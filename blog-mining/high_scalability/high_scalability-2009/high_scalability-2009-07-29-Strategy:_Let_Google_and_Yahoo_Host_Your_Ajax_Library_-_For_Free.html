<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his
picture), in I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything,
reveals the stack used for building Google+:Our stack is pretty standard fare
for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and
JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-
source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and
template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to
maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on
hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates
server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the
JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make
it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on
stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily
most people don't run int</p><p>3 0.17545424 <a title="665-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-07-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Web_asset_server_concept_-_3rd_party_software_available%3F.html">1402 high scalability-2013-02-07-Ask HighScalability: Web asset server concept - 3rd party software available?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>4 0.16234069 <a title="665-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-16-Google%2B_Infrastructure_Update_-_the_JavaScript_Story.html">1143 high scalability-2011-11-16-Google+ Infrastructure Update - the JavaScript Story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In Google+ Is Built Using Tools You Can Use Too: Closure, Java Servlets,
JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround we glimpsed inside Google's
technology stack for building Google+. Mark Knichel, an engineer on the
Google+ infrastructure team, has helped us look alittle deeper on how
Javascript is handled in Google+.  Here's a quick look:They loveClosure for
its library, templates, compiler, and strict type checking. Compilation is now
required for good performance. I've wondered if GWT will be killed off as have
other Google properties, but I've been told GWT is being used heavily inside
Google, so thankfully that probably won't happen.Closure templatesare used
both Java and JavaScript to render pages server-side and in the browser. Just-
in-time JavaScript. Code is split into modules so the minimum amount of
JavaScript is loaded asynchronously in the background as necessary. Navigation
happens without loading the page.Page navigation happens without page reloads.

<p>Introduction: Performance is critical to the success of any web site, and yet today's web
applications push browsers to their limits with increasing amounts of rich
content and heavy use of Ajax. In his new bookEven Faster Web Sites:
Performance Best Practices for Web Developers, Steve Souders, web performance
evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable
techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.Souders' previous
book, the bestsellingHigh Performance Web Sites, shocked the web development
world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on
the client side. In Even Faster Web Sites, Souders and eight expert
contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your

<p>Introduction: John McCutchan,after a long career spent working on the Linux kernel and being
hired out as a code optimization guru, joined Google's Dart team. A curious
hire until you watch Bringing SIMD to the Web via Dart, where John makes a
programmer accessible explanation of why he likes Dart: performance,
performance, performance.Dartis an open-source Web programming
languagedeveloped by Google. The motivation for Dart is twofold: provide a
language capable of scaling up to the complex web applications that are
becoming the norm. Think Gmail. And provide a single language capable of
working on both the client and server. Towards those ends Dart is a complete
language, full tool environment, and provides an advanced Web UI framework for
building web applications at a high level of abstraction.Why isn't JavaScript
good enough? The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts
crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause web
apps to lose out to mobile apps.</p><p>5 0.70438099 <a title="665-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-01-Moving_Beyond_End-to-End_Path_Information_to_Optimize_CDN_Performance.html">712 high scalability-2009-10-01-Moving Beyond End-to-End Path Information to Optimize CDN Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,

<p>Introduction: Update:Offloading ALL JS Files To Google. Now you can let Google serve all
your javascript files. This article tells you how to do it (upload to Google
Code Project) and why it's a big win (cheap, fast, caching, parallel
downloads, save bandwidth).Don't have a CDN? Why not let Google and Yahoo be
your CDN? At least for Ajax libraries. No charge. Google runs acontent
distribution network and loading architecture for the most popular open source
JavaScript libraries, which include: jQuery, prototype, script.aculo.us,
MooTools, and dojo. The idea is web pages directly include your library of
choice from Google's global, fast, and highly available network. Some have
found much better performance and others experienced slower performance. My
guess is the performance may be slower if your data center is close to you,
but far away users will be much happier. Some negatives: not all libraries are
included, you'll load more than you need because all functionality is
included.

<p>Introduction: Update:MapReduce and PageRank Notes from Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau's Fall 2008
class. Collects interesting facts about MapReduce and PageRank. For example,
the history of the solution to searching for the term "flu" is traced through
multiple generations of technology.With Google entering the cloud space
withGoogle AppEngineand a maturingHadoopproduct, the MapReduce scaling
approach might finally become a standard programmer practice. This is the best
paper on the subject and is an excellent primer on a content-addressable
memory future.Some interesting stats from the paper: Google executes 100k
MapReduce jobs each day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day;
more than 10k MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual
processor with gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.One common criticism ex-
Googlers have is that it takes months to get up and be productive in the
Google environment. Hopefully a way will be found to lower the learning curve
and make programmers</p><p>4 0.89057386 <a title="665-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-30-Pomegranate_-_Storing_Billions_and_Billions_of_Tiny_Little_Files.html">889 high scalability-2010-08-30-Pomegranate - Storing Billions and Billions of Tiny Little Files</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pomegranateis a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular
storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at
increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support
applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high
concurrency, high throughput, and low latency. Their tests seem to indicate it
works:We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well
for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observedlinearly
increased more than100,000aggregate read and write requests served per second
(RPS). Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V
store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system
API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use.
Every application could use it out of the box.The features of Pomegranate
are:It handles billions of small files efficiently, even in one directory;It
provide separate and</p><p>5 0.88056648 <a title="665-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-22-Architecting_Massively-Scalable_Near-Real-Time_Risk_Analysis_Solutions.html">1161 high scalability-2011-12-22-Architecting Massively-Scalable Near-Real-Time Risk Analysis Solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Constructing a scalablerisk analysis solution is a fascinating architectural
challenge. If you come from Financial Services you are sure to appreciate
that. But even architects from other domains are bound to find the challenges
fascinating, and the architectural patterns of my suggested solution highly
useful in other domains.Recently I held an interesting webinar around
architecting solutions for scalable and near-real-time risk analysis solutions
based on experience gathered with Financial Services customers. Seeing the
vast interest in the webinar, I would like to share the highlights with you
here.From an architectural point of view, risk analysis is a data-intensive
and a compute-intensive process, which also has an elaborate orchestration
logic. volumes in this domain are massive and ever-increasing, together with
an ever-increasing demand to reduce response time. These trends are aggravated
by global financial regulatory reforms set following the late-2000s financial
crisis, wh</p><p>6 0.87982875 <a title="665-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-16-Scaling_Secret_%232%3A_Denormalizing_Your_Way_to_Speed_and_Profit.html">65 high scalability-2007-08-16-Scaling Secret #2: Denormalizing Your Way to Speed and Profit</a></p>

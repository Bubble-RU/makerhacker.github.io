<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model,
which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model,
networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as
services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the
datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed
application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing
sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the
datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to
scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt
easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sun's VeriScale architecture
provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun
Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures
for more than a decade. The features of these architectures, such as
elasticity, ar</p><p>3 0.30750018 <a title="486-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-24-Scalability_Perspectives_%236%3A_Lew_Tucker_%E2%80%93_Virtual_Data_Centers_in_the_Open_Cloud.html">547 high scalability-2009-03-24-Scalability Perspectives #6: Lew Tucker – Virtual Data Centers in the Open Cloud</a></p>

thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are

<p>Introduction: WhileKnginejust announcesome improvement and new features, I would like you
take you in small trip in Snippet Search research project at Kngine. What is
Kngine?Kngine is startup company working in Searching technologies, We in
Kngine aims to organize the human beingsSystematic KnowledgeandExperiencesand
make it accessible to everyone. We aim to collect and organize all objective
data, and make it possible and easy to access. Our goal is to buildWeb 3.0 Web

Representation technologies a new form of Web Search Engine that will unleash
a revolution of new possibilities. Introduction to Snippet SearchToday, The
Web Search Engine's is the Web getaway, especially to get specific
information. But unfortunately the search engines didn't changed mush as the
Web changed from 90's.Since the 90's the Web search engine still provide the
same kind of results: Links to documents. We in Kngine think that it's the

stats, wich technology thay use, how they implement karaoke flash-based
player, which media server they use, how many bandwidth does it need, etc. Any
information will be helpful.

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

<p>Introduction: Im sure most are familiar with Facebooks 'news feed'. If not, the 'news feed'
basically lists recent activity of all of your friends.I dont see how you can
get this information efficiently from a DB:* Im assuming all user activity is
inserted in a "actions" table.* first get a list of all your friends* then
query the actions table to return recent activity where the activity belongs
to someone on your friends listThis can't be efficient especially considering
some people have 200+ friends.So what am I missing? How do you think Facebook
is implementing their "news feed".Im not asking for any specific details, just
a general point in the right direction, as I cant see how they are
implementing the 'news feed efficiently.Thanks.</p><p>6 0.82044804 <a title="486-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL_Took_Away_the_Relational_Model_and_Gave_Nothing_Back.html">930 high scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL Took Away the Relational Model and Gave Nothing Back</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Benjamin Erb  ( @b_erb ) from Ulm University recently published his diploma thesis on  "Concurrent Programming for Scalable Web Architectures" . The thesis provides a comprehensive survey on different concepts and techniques of concurrency inside web  architectures, including web servers, application logic and storage backends. It incorporates research publications, hands-on reports  and also regards popular programming languages, frameworks and  databases.

Web architectures are an important asset for various large-scale web applications, such as social networks or e-commerce sites. Being able to handle huge numbers of users concurrently is essential, thus scalability is one of the most important features of these architectures. Multi-core processors, highly distributed backend architectures and new web technologies force us to reconsider approaches for concurrent programming in order to implement web applications and fulfil scalability demands.

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble wrote a fascinating case study,  MySpace’s death spiral: insiders say it’s due to bets on Los Angeles and Microsoft , where he reports MySpace insiders blame the Microsoft stack on why they  lost the great social network race  to Facebook.  
 
Does anyone know if this is true? What's the real story?
 
I was wondering because it doesn't seem to track with the  MySpace Architecture  post that I did in 2009, where they seem happy with their choices and had stats to back up their improvements. Why this matters is it's a fascinating model for startups to learn from. What does it really take to succeed? Is it the people or the stack? Is it the organization or the technology? Is it the process or the competition? Is the quality of the site or the love of the users? So much to consider and learn from.
 
Some conjectures from the article:
  
 Myspace didn't have programming talent capable of scaling the site to compete with Facebook. 
 Choosing the Microsoft stack made it difficul</p><p>4 0.12576446 <a title="539-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive</p><p>5 0.11415886 <a title="539-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-16-Interview_With_Google%27s_Ilya_Grigorik_On_His_New_Book%3A_High_Performance_Browser_Networking.html">1533 high scalability-2013-10-16-Interview With Google's Ilya Grigorik On His New Book: High Performance Browser Networking</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one  Ilya Grigorik , Developer Advocate,  Make the Web Fast  at Google, and author of a great new book:  High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer should know about networking and web performance . 
 
That's a big topic you might be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It’s like a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.
 
In case you are not familiar with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For years Ilya has been producing excellent content on  his blog  and if you  search YouTube  you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the book. Authority established.
 
Reading the book I was struck by what a complicated beast or little World Wide Web has become.

<p>Introduction: How do you layer a programmable Internet of smart things on top of the web? That's the question addressed byÂ  Dominique Guinard Â in his ambitious dissertation:Â  A Web of Things Application Architecture - Integrating the Real-World Â ( slides ). With the continuedÂ siloing of content, perhaps we can keep our things open and talking to each other?
 
In the architecture things are modeled using REST, they will be findable via search, they will be social via a social access controller, and they will be mashupable. Here's great graphical overview of the entire system:

Demand is rising, and companies are looking for ways to tackle the performance and scalability needs placed on Web infrastructure without raising IT operational expenses.

<p>Introduction: I am excited about the upcoming release of two books on Web 2.0 and Cloud Application Architectures by O'Reilly.      Web 2.0 Architectures     (estimated release in May 2009)   What entrepreneurs and information architects need to know      Using several high-profile Web 2.0 companies as examples, authors Duane Nickull, Dion Hinchcliffe, and James Governor have distilled the core patterns of Web 2.0 coupled with an abstract model and reference architecture. The result is a base of knowledge that developers, business people, futurists, and entrepreneurs can understand and use as a source of ideas and inspiration. Featured architectures include Google, Flickr, BitTorrent, MySpace, Facebook, and Wikipedia.       Cloud Application Architectures     (estimated release in April 2009)   Building Applications and Infrastructure in the Cloud      This book by George Reese offers tested techniques for creating web applications on cloud computing infrastructures and for migrating existing system</p><p>3 0.84586972 <a title="539-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-02-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_2%2C_2011.html">1150 high scalability-2011-12-02-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 2, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ganglia  is a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical design targeted at federations of clusters. It leverages widely used technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-node overheads and high concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been ported to an extensive set of operating systems and processor architectures, and is currently in use on thousands of clusters around the world. It has been used to link clusters across university campuses and around the world and can scale to handle clusters with 2000 nodes.</p><p>6 0.80021256 <a title="539-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-14-Google_Says_Cloud_Prices_Will_Follow_Moore%E2%80%99s_Law%3A_Are_We_All_Renters_Now%3F.html">1647 high scalability-2014-05-14-Google Says Cloud Prices Will Follow Moore’s Law: Are We All Renters Now?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t
be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems
Laboratories* The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds
is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the
high-tech industry.* The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome
of the evolution of these games.* Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore
the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.* The game server is used both to
discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating
(by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the
client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might
seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role
means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the
server component.* Using multiple servers is a basic mechanism for scaling th</p><p>4 0.064144507 <a title="493-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-An_Open_Source_Web_Solution_-_Lighttpd_Web_Server_and_Chip_Multithreading_Technology__.html">452 high scalability-2008-12-01-An Open Source Web Solution - Lighttpd Web Server and Chip Multithreading Technology  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: With more users interacting, working, purchasing, and communicating over the
network than ever before, Web 2.0 infrastructure is taking center stage in
many organizations. Demand is rising, and companies are looking for ways to
tackle the performance and scalability needs placed on Web infrastructure
without raising IT operational expenses. Today companies are turning to
efďŹ cient, high-performance, open source solutions as a way to decrease
acquisition, licensing, and other ongoing costs and stay within budget
constraints.</p><p>5 0.060426585 <a title="493-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble wrote a fascinating case study,MySpace's death spiral: insiders
say it's due to bets on Los Angeles and Microsoft, where he reports MySpace
insiders blame the Microsoft stack on why theylost the great social network
raceto Facebook.  Does anyone know if this is true? What's the real story?I
was wondering because it doesn't seem to track with theMySpace Architecture
post that I did in 2009, where they seem happy with their choices and had
stats to back up their improvements. Why this matters is it's a fascinating
model for startups to learn from. What does it really take to succeed? Is it
the people or the stack? Is it the organization or the technology? Is it the
process or the competition? Is the quality of the site or the love of the
users? So much to consider and learn from.Some conjectures from the
article:Myspace didn't have programming talent capable of scaling the site to
compete with Facebook.Choosing the Microsoft stack made it difficult to hire

<p>Introduction: Pud off*ckedcomany.com (FC) fame, a favorite site of the dot bomb era, and a
site I absolutely loved until my company became featured, has given us a look
at his backend: Why Must You Laugh At My Back End. For those whose don't
remember FC's history, TechCrunch published afitting eulogy:[FC] first went
live in 2000, chronicling failing and troubled companies in its unique and
abrasive style after the dot com bust. Within a year it had a massive audience
and was getting serious mainstream press attention. As the startup economy
became better in 2004, much of the attention the site received went away. But
a large and loyal audience remains at the site, coming back day after day for
its unique slant on the news. At its peak, FC had 4 million unique monthly
visitors.Delightfully, FC was not a real-names kind of site. Hard witty
cynicism ruled and not a single cat picture was in sight. It was a blast of
fun when all around was the enclosing dark.So when I saw Pud's post I was

<p>Introduction: Update:Here's thefirst result. Good response time until 400 users. At 1,340
users the response time was 6 seconds. And at 2000 users the site was

reputation started at 1000 users. Cheers to the company that had the guts to
give this a try.That which doesn't kill your site makes it stronger. Or at
least that's the capacity planning strategy John Allspaw recommends (not
really, but I'm trying to make a point here) inThe Art of Capacity
Planning:Using production traffic to define your resources ceilings in a
controlled setting allows you to see firsthand what would happen when you run
out of capacity in a particular resource. Of course I'm not suggesting that
you run your site into the ground, but better to know what your real (not
simulated) loads are while you're watching, than find out the hard way. In
addition, a lot of unexpected systemic things can happen when load increases

<p>Introduction: Tim Brayhas a wonderfulinterview with Casey Forbes, creator of Ravelry, a Ruby
on Rails site supporting a 400,000+ strong community of dedicated knitters and
crocheters.Casey and his small team have done great things with Ravelry. It is
a very focused site that provides a lot of value for users. And users
absolutely adore the site. That's obvious from their enthusiastic comments and
rocket fast adoption of Ravelry.Ten years ago a site like Ravelry would have
been a multi-million dollar operation. Today Casey is the sole engineer for
Ravelry and to run it takes only a few people. He was able to code it in 4
months working nights and weekends. Take a look down below of all the
technologies used to make Ravelry and you'll see how it is constructed almost
completely from free of the shelf software that Casey has stitched together
into a complete system. There's an amazing amount of leverage in today's
ecosystem when you combine all the quality tools, languages, storage,

<p>Introduction: All,I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for
sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and
other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers.
I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.Could anyone share
their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube
etc..?Thank you,Regards,Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>2 0.99360311 <a title="493-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-06-Announce%3A_First_Meeting_of_Boston_Scalability_User_Group.html">268 high scalability-2008-03-06-Announce: First Meeting of Boston Scalability User Group</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to
start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their
application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I
am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I
plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need
to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure
and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the
application that will become critical over time.</p><p>4 0.98414272 <a title="493-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-UK_Based_CDN.html">324 high scalability-2008-05-19-UK Based CDN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw
up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK. If they're outside the
UK but have decent support then also include. The service must be cheap and
not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it
shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered
whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK
compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a
small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space. Would S3 be a good
starting point? What is the service like? I hear mixed reviews about it.Many
thanks,Jim</p><p>5 0.9761492 <a title="493-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>6 0.96949613 <a title="493-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

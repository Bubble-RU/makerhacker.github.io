<p>Introduction: One of the core assumption behind many of today's databases is that disks are
reliable. In other words, your data is "safe" if it is stored on a disk, and
indeed most database solutions rely heavily on that assumption. Is it a valid
assumption?Read the full storyhere</p><p>3 0.21300209 <a title="749-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-16-WTF_is_Elastic_Data_Grid%3F_%28By_Example%29.html">843 high scalability-2010-06-16-WTF is Elastic Data Grid? (By Example)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Forrester released their new wave report:  The Forrester Waveâ&bdquo;˘: Elastic
Caching Platforms, Q2 2010where they listed GigaSpaces, IBM, Oracle, and
Terracotta as leading vendors in the field. In this post I'd like to take some
time to explain what some of these terms mean, and why they're important to
you. I'll start with a definition of Elastic Data Grid (Elastic Caching), how
it is different then other caching and NoSQL alternatives, and more
importantly -- I'll illustrate how it works through some real code
examples.You can read the full storyhere.</p><p>4 0.19655769 <a title="749-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-01-The_Pattern_Bible_for_Distributed_Computing.html">400 high scalability-2008-10-01-The Pattern Bible for Distributed Computing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>5 0.1690861 <a title="749-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-09-NoSQL_on_the_Microsoft_Platform.html">875 high scalability-2010-08-09-NoSQL on the Microsoft Platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source.
There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity:
from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-
value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there's Riak, Tokyo Cabinet,
Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL
products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft
Windows. I'm going to outline what's available now and briefly touch on some
opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.You

<p>Introduction: I've largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the "NoSQL vs.
Relational" conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about
currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to
build in, I'd like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint.
In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I've inadvertently given myself
plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches,
and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say
with a fair amount of certainty, that I've found a good compromise. You can

<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of many of the
scalability issues that we face today with traditional database approach.I
think that the main reason so many people have come to see SQL as the source
of all evil is the fact that, traditionally, the query language was burned
into the database implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to
the traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.This view has brought on a
flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a different aspect
that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach, such as a document
model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as Key/Value query.Most of
the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject, and tend to use
query semantics and architecture interchangeably. InPart Iof this post i tried
to provide quick overview of what each query term stands for in the context of
the NoSQL world .Part II illustrates those ideas using  code examples from</p><p>6 0.64902997 <a title="749-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-07-ArchCamp%3A_Scalable_Databases_%28NoSQL%29.html">874 high scalability-2010-08-07-ArchCamp: Scalable Databases (NoSQL)</a></p>

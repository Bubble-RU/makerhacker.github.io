<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a

<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all
programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.Then you may observe after
coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form
of interacting patterns of flows.Then you may think hey, a program isn't only
useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and
that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over
data and flow over other flows.That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making
available in the Graph extension to their plumbing package (code examples),
which is described in an excellent post:Graph: Abstractions for Structured
Computation.You may remember Prismatic from previous profile we did on

<p>Introduction: GraphChiuses aParallel Sliding Windowsmethod which can: process a graph with
mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-
sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of
computation.The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on
just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar
toPregel, which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style
of MapReduce. Streaming graph updates are supported.About GraphChi, Carlos

<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most
of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to
the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez
introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide
web of data.Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on
the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10
billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for
applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, withthe
Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible
to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge
structure. This talk will discuss graph databases, their underlying data
model, their querying mechanisms, and the benefits of the graph data structure
for modeling and analysis.</p><p>6 0.78795165 <a title="631-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j_-_a_Graph_Database_that_Kicks_Buttox.html">628 high scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j - a Graph Database that Kicks Buttox</a></p>

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released
information onPregel. Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip.
Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure......to mine a wide range of
graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each
iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages
sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify
its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's
topology.Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this
limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but
so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing
problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much
faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to
use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

<p>Introduction: Update: How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences. Shows how to
analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what
I mean. Steve Souders, author ofHigh Performance WebsitesandYslow, hasten more
best practices to speed up your website:Split the initial payloadLoad scripts
without blockingDon't scatter scriptsSplit dominant content domainsMake static

26.7 rules left, so get them while they're still in our dimension.Here

<p>Introduction: When you have a large population of servers you have both the opportunity and
the incentive to perform interesting studies. Authors from Google and the
University of California in Optimizing Google's Warehouse Scale Computers: The
NUMA Experience conducted such a study, taking a look at how jobs run on
clusters of machines using a NUMA architecture. Since NUMA is common on server
class machines it's a topic of general interest for those looking to maximize
machine utilization across clusters.Some of the results are surprising:The
methodology of how to attribute such fine performance variations to NUMA
effects within such a complex system is perhaps more interesting than the
results themselves. Well worth reading just for that story.The performance
swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on
Intel Westmere for Web-search frontend. Memory locality is not always King.
Because of the interaction between NUMA and cache sharing/contention it turns
out differe</p><p>5 0.77420932 <a title="631-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-09-Why_My_Slime_Mold_is_Better_than_Your_Hadoop_Cluster.html">1225 high scalability-2012-04-09-Why My Slime Mold is Better than Your Hadoop Cluster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Organism without a brain creates external memories for navigationshows
slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where
it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's
calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the
organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that
won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors
make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants.  InAfter Life: The
Strange Science Of Decaythere's a truly incredible sequence of gorgeously shot
video showing howcreeping slime moldsolves mazes and performs other other
amazing feats of computation. Take a look at what simple one celled organisms
can do:The whole video is really well done and shockingly revelatory. It's the
story of decay, how atoms created during the Big Bang and through countless
supernova explosions are continually rearranged and reused by the complex

<p>Introduction: Update:Social networks in the database: using a graph database. A nice post on
representing, traversing, and performing other common social network
operations using a graph database.If you areDiggorLinkedInyou can build your
own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network
relationships. For those of more modest meansNeo4j, a graph database, is a
good alternative.A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges
(relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs)
on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to
represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships
are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and
relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look
at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for
relationships."A graph looks something like:For more lovely examples take a

<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all

coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form

useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and
that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over
data and flow over other flows.That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making
available in the Graph extension to their plumbing package (code examples),
which is described in an excellent post:Graph: Abstractions for Structured
Computation.You may remember Prismatic from previous profile we did on

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>6 0.24590658 <a title="626-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-27-Making_Hadoop_1000x_Faster_for_Graph_Problems.html">1088 high scalability-2011-07-27-Making Hadoop 1000x Faster for Graph Problems</a></p>

<p>Introduction: GraphChiuses aParallel Sliding Windowsmethod which can: process a graph with
mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-
sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of
computation.The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on
just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar
toPregel, which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style
of MapReduce. Streaming graph updates are supported.About GraphChi, Carlos
Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,says:A Mac Mini running
GraphChi can analyze Twitter's social graph from 2010--which contains 40
million users and 1.2 billion connections--in 59 minutes. "The previous

<p>Introduction: One of the problems in building distributed systems is figuring out what the
heck is going on. Usually endless streams of log files are consulted like
ancients usingentrailsto divine the will of the Gods.To rise above these
ancient practices we must rise another level of abstraction and that's the
approach described in a Microsoft research paper: G2: A Graph Processing
System for Diagnosing Distributed Systems, which uses execution graphs that
model runtime events and their correlations in distributed systems.The problem
with these schemes is viewing applications, written by programmers in low
level code, as execution graphs. But we're heading in this direction in any
case. To program a warehouse or an internet sized computer we'll have to write
at higher levels of abstraction so code can be executed transparently at
runtime on these giant distributed computers. There are many advantages to
this approach, fault diagnosis and performance monitoring are just one of the
wins.Abstract from</p><p>6 0.84426475 <a title="626-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-26-Product%3A_HyperGraphDB_-_A_Graph_Database.html">766 high scalability-2010-01-26-Product: HyperGraphDB - A Graph Database</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How does Facebook handle the massive New Year's Eve traffic spike? Thanks to
Mike Swift, in Facebook gets ready for New Year's Eve, we get a little insight
as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still
interesting.Problem SetupFacebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be
shared on New Year's eve.Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the
world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average
of 130 friends.Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a
homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those
requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then
rendered.Different events put different stresses on different parts of
Facebook. Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of
capacity News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve
Jobs drive user status updatesCoping StrategiesTry to predictthe surge in

<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most
of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to
the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez
introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide
web of data.Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on
the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10
billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for
applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, withthe
Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible
to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge
structure. This talk will discuss graph databases, their underlying data
model, their querying mechanisms, and the benefits of the graph data structure
for modeling and analysis.</p><p>3 0.87493241 <a title="626-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-30-Behind_the_scenes_of_an_online_marketplace.html">818 high scalability-2010-04-30-Behind the scenes of an online marketplace</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,I want to implement a search engine with lucene.To be scalable, I would
like to execute search jobs asynchronously (with a job queuing system).But i
don't know if it is a good design... Why ?Search results can be large ! (eg:
100+ pages with 25 documents per page)With asynchronous sytem, I need to store
results for each search job.I can set a short expiration time (~5 min) for
each search result, but it's still large.What do you think about it ?Which
design would you use for that ?ThanksMat</p><p>5 0.82494473 <a title="626-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-25-StubHub_Architecture%3A_The_Surprising_Complexity_Behind_the_World%E2%80%99s_Largest_Ticket_Marketplace.html">1271 high scalability-2012-06-25-StubHub Architecture: The Surprising Complexity Behind the World’s Largest Ticket Marketplace</a></p>
<p>Introduction: StubHub is an interesting architecture to take a look at because, as market
makers for tickets, they are in a different business than we normally get to
consider.StubHub is surprisingly large, growing at 20% a year, serving 800K
complex pages per hour, selling 5 million tickets per year, and handling 2
million API calls per hour. And the ticket space is surprisingly rich in
complexity. StubHub's traffic is tricky. It's bursty, centering around
unpredictable game outcomes, events, schedules, and seasons. There's a lot of
money involved. There are a lot of different actors involved. There are a lot
of complex business processes involved. And StubHub has several complementary
but very different parts of their business: they have an ad server component
serving ads to sites like ESPN, a rich interactive UI, and a real-time ticket
market component.Most interesting to me is how StubHub is bringing into the
digital realm the once quintessentially high-touch physical world of tickets,

<p>Introduction: Surgeis a conference put on by OmniTI targeting practical Scalability matters.
OmniTI specializes in helping people solve their scalability problems, as is
only natural, as it was founded by Theo Schlossnagle, author of the
canonicalScalable Internet Architectures. Now that Surge 2011 is on the
horizon, they've generously made available nearly all thevideos from the Surge
2010conference.  A pattern hopefully every conference will follow (only don't
wait a year please). We lose a lot of collective wisdom from events not being
available online in a timely manner.In truth, nearlyall the talksare on topic
and are worth watching, but here are a few that seem especially relevant:Going

<p>Introduction: Sorry, the content for this post apparently did not make the transition from
the old HighScalability website, it's all messed up, but there's still a some
useful content...EVE Onlineis "The World's Largest Game Universe", a massively
multiplayer online game (MMO) made by CCP. EVE Online's Architecture is
unusual for a MMOG because it doesn't divide the player load among different
servers or shards. Instead, the same cluster handles the entire EVE universe.
It is an interesting to compare this with theArchitecture of the Second Life
Grid. How do they manage to scale?Information SourcesEVE Insider Dev BlogEVE

<p>Introduction: O'Reilly Radar's James Turner conducted avery informative interviewwith Joe
Stump, current CTO ofSimpleGeoand former lead architect atDigg, in which Joe
makes some of his usually insightful comments on his experience using
Cassandra vs MySQL. As Digg started out with aMySQL oriented architectureand
has recently beenmoving full speedto Cassandra, his observations on some of
their lessons learned and the motivation for the move are especially valuable.
Here are some of the key takeaways you find useful:Precompute on writes, make
reads fast. This is an oldie as a scaling strategy, but it's valuable to see
how SimpleGeo is applying it to their problem of finding entities within a
certain geographical region. Using Cassandra they've built two clusters: one
for indexes and one for records. The records cluster, as you might imagine, is
a simple data lookup. The index cluster has a carefully constructed key for
every lookup scenario. The indexes are computed on the write, so reads are
very fas</p><p>4 0.97591978 <a title="560-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-26-Golden_rule_of_web_caching.html">194 high scalability-2007-12-26-Golden rule of web caching</a></p>

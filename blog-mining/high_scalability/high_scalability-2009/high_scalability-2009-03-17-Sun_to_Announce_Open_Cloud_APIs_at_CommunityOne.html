<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment.

These configurations focus on single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the switches.     These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to the customer needs.

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives  is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.     Lew Tucker    Lew Tucker is the Vice President and CTO of Sun Microsystems’ Cloud Computing initiative.     Lew’s career has been focused on scalable computing and web development. Lew worked at Sun Microsystems through the 1990’s. In 2002, Lew joined Salesforce.com and led the design and implementation of App Exchange. After Salesforce.com, Lew was CTO at Radar Networks, where he focused on the scalable design and build out of its semantic web service.

<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable solution that</p><p>5 0.23560344 <a title="543-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-07-Sun_Acquires_Q-layer_in_Cloud_Computing_Play.html">486 high scalability-2009-01-07-Sun Acquires Q-layer in Cloud Computing Play</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the key items Sun will be talking about in today's   cloud computing announcement   (at 9AM EST/6AM PST) will be Sun's opening of the APIs that we'll use for the Sun Cloud.  We're making these available so that those who are interested will be able to review and comment on these APIs.  Continuing our commitment to openness, we're making these APIs available via the Creative Commons Version 3.0 license.     ...</p><p>2 0.72665966 <a title="543-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-24-NoSQL_Parody%3A_say_No%21_No%21_and_No%21.html">1393 high scalability-2013-01-24-NoSQL Parody: say No!

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released information on  Pregel . Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip. Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure...
   ...to mine a wide range of graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's topology.  Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

<p>Introduction: Update:   How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences .  Shows how to analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and how to resolve them.  80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what I mean. Steve Souders, author of  High Performance Websites  and  Yslow , has  ten more best practices to speed up your website :
  Split the initial payload   Load scripts without blocking   Don’t scatter scripts   Split dominant content domains   Make static content cookie-free   Reduce cookie weight   Minify CSS   Optimize images   Use iframes sparingly   To www or not to www  Sadly, according to String Theory, there are only 26.7 rules left, so get them while they're still in our dimension.  Here are  slides  on the first few rules. Love the speeding dog slide. That's exactly what my dog looks like trav</p><p>5 0.58569968 <a title="543-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-30-Google_Finds_NUMA_Up_to_20%25_Slower_for_Gmail_and_Websearch.html">1467 high scalability-2013-05-30-Google Finds NUMA Up to 20% Slower for Gmail and Websearch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When you have a large population of servers you have both the opportunity and the incentive to perform interesting studies. Authors from Google and the University of California in  Optimizing Google’s Warehouse Scale Computers: The NUMA Experience  conducted such a study, taking a look at how jobs run on clusters of machines using a  NUMA  architecture. Since NUMA is common on server class machines it's a topic of general interest for those looking to maximize machine utilization across clusters.
 
Some of the results are surprising:
  
 The methodology of how to attribute such fine performance variations to NUMA effects within such a complex system is perhaps more interesting than the results themselves. Well worth reading just for that story. 
 The performance swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on Intel Westmere for Web-search frontend.  
 Memory locality is not always King. Because of the interaction between NUMA and cache sharing/contention it</p><p>6 0.57517004 <a title="543-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-09-Why_My_Slime_Mold_is_Better_than_Your_Hadoop_Cluster.html">1225 high scalability-2012-04-09-Why My Slime Mold is Better than Your Hadoop Cluster</a></p>

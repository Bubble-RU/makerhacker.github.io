<p>Introduction: I recently came across a TPC-C benchmark results held on MySQL based RDS
databases. You can see ithere. I think the results may bring light to many
questions concerning MySQL scalability in general and RDS scalability in
particular. (For disclosure, I'm working forScaleBasewhere we run an internal
scale out TPC-C benchmark these days, and will publish results soon).TPC-
CTPC-C is a standard database benchmark, used to measure databases. The
database vendors invest big bucks in running this test, and showing off which
database is faster, and can scale better.It is a write intensive test, so it
doesn't necessarily reflect the behavior of the database in your application.
But it does give some very important insights on what you can expect from your
database under heavy load.The Benchmark ProcessFirst of all, I have some
comments for the benchmark method itself.Generally - the benchmarks were held
in an orderly fashion and in a rather methodological way - which increases the

<p>Introduction: The recent Data-Intensive Computing Symposium brought together experts in
system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific
applications, and information-based applications to better understand existing
capabilities in the development and application of large-scale computing
systems, and to explore future opportunities.Google Fellow Jeff Dean had a
very interesting presentation on Handling Large Datasets at Google: Current
Systems and Future Directions. He discussed:• Hardware infrastructure•
Distributed systems infrastructure:–Scheduling system–GFS–BigTable–MapReduce•

<p>Introduction: Cloud computing promises a number of advantages for the deployment of data-
intensive applications. Most prominently, these include reducing cost with a
pay-as-you-go pricing model and (virtually) unlimited throughput by adding
servers if the workload increases. At theSystems Group, ETH Zurich, we did an
extensiveend-to-end performance studyto compare the major cloud offerings
regarding their ability to fulfill these promises and their implied cost.The
focus of the work is on transaction processing (i.e., read and update work-
loads), rather than analytics workloads. We used theTPC-W, a standardized
benchmark simulating a Web-shop, as the baseline for our comparison. The TPC-W
defines that users are simulated through emulated browsers (EB) and issue page
requests, called web-interactions (WI), against the system. As a major
modification to the benchmark, we constantly increase the load from 1 to 9000
simultaneous users to measure the scalability and cost variance of the system.

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally
successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips
with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these
successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to
multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are
reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we
are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be
squashed.To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a
corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer
2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use
symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to
work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore
designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core
efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtaining</p><p>3 0.70934027 <a title="535-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-20-Paper%3A_Flux%3A_An_Adaptive_Partitioning_Operator_for_Continuous_Query_Systems.html">604 high scalability-2009-05-20-Paper: Flux: An Adaptive Partitioning Operator for Continuous Query Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are
continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand
and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable,
which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.Abstract:The long-running
nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow
processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across
multiplequeries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their
constituent, stateful operators - e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators.
To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a
shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static
techniquesfor partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as
workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue
to function robustly inthe face of these imbalances. To address this
challenge, we introduce a dataflo</p><p>4 0.67719591 <a title="535-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce_for_Machine_Learning_on_Multicore.html">581 high scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly
many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for
these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning
to take advantage of the potential speed up.In this paper, we develop a
broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to
many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the
tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up
a single algorithm at a time.Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit
the Statistical Query model can be written in a certain “summation form,”
which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt
Google’s map-reduce paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique
on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear
regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM,

<p>Introduction: Scale-up solutions in the form of large SMPs have represented the mainstream
of commercial computing for the past several years. The major server vendors
continue to provide increasingly larger and more powerful machines. More
recently, scale-out solutions, in the form of clusters of smaller machines,
have gained increased acceptance for commercial computing.Scale-out solutions
are particularly effective in high-throughput web-centric applications.In this
paper, we investigate the behavior of two competing approaches to parallelism,
scale-up and scale-out, in an emerging search application. Our conclusions
show that a scale-out strategy can be the key to good performance even on a
scale-up machine.Furthermore, scale-out solutions offer better
price/performance, although at an increase in management complexity.Read more

<p>Introduction: Authors:Kevin LimParthasarathy RanganathanJichuan ChangChandrakant PatelTrevor
MudgeSteven ReinhardtThis International Symposium on Computer Architecture
paper seeks to understand and design next-generation servers for emerging
"warehouse-computing" environments. We make two key contributions. First, we
put together a detailed evaluation infrastructure including a new benchmark
suite for warehouse-computing workloads, and detailed performance, cost, and
power models, to quantitatively characterize bottlenecks. Second, we study a
new solution that incorporates volume non-server-class components in novel
packaging solutions, with memory sharing andflash-based disk caching. Our
results show that this approach has promise, with a 2X improvement on average
in performance-per-dollar for our benchmark suite.</p><p>2 0.9071306 <a title="535-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Deploying_MySQL_Database_in_Solaris_Cluster_Environments.html">454 high scalability-2008-12-01-Deploying MySQL Database in Solaris Cluster Environments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: MySQL™ database, an open source database, delivers high performance and
reliability while keeping costs low by eliminating licensing fees. The
Solaris™ Cluster product is an integrated hardware and software environment
that can be used to create highly-available data services. This article
explains how to deploy the MySQL database in a Solaris Cluster environment.
The article addresses the following topics:* "Advantages of Deploying MySQL
Database with Solaris Cluster" on page 1 discusses the benefits provided by a
Solaris Cluster deployment of the MySQL database.* "Overview of Solaris
Cluster" on page 2 provides a high-level description of the hardware and
software components of the Solaris Cluster.* "Installation and Configuration"
on page 8 explains the procedure for deploying the MySQL database on a Solaris
Cluster.This article assumes that readers have a basic understanding of
Solaris Cluster and MySQL database installation and administration.</p><p>3 0.89481944 <a title="535-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-27-.Net2_and_AJAX_scalability%3F.html">135 high scalability-2007-10-27-.Net2 and AJAX scalability?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Am I mad to consider using .Net2 and AJAX for a high-scalability application?
In case you wonder why, it's the legacy of a website built on IIS and .Net
1.1, and we're looking for ways to make the content more attractive and
interactive. In this case, it's a medical image library being shared by a few
Wikis and online coursework for medicalstudents ( < 15K users) and doctors ( <
150K users)But I'm worried about the performance overhead. We already have a
performance problem because of personalising the content for users according
to their type (student or doctor), and for doctors, their grade and
speciality.</p><p>4 0.87089235 <a title="535-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-06-Graph_server.html">621 high scalability-2009-06-06-Graph server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've seen mentioned in few times sites like Digg or LinkedIn using graph
servers to hold their social graphs. But the only sort of open source graph
server I've found is http://neo4j.org/ .Can anyone recommend an open source
graph server?ThanksAaron</p><p>5 0.86636668 <a title="535-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-10-The_Art_of_Capacity_Planning%3A_Scaling_Web_Resources.html">407 high scalability-2008-10-10-The Art of Capacity Planning: Scaling Web Resources</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3:The book was released! Find it on Amazon atThe Art of Capacity
Planning.Update 2:Maybe the iPhone can use a little capacity planning?What's
Behind the iPhone 3G Glitches:One source says Apple programmed the Infineon
chip to demand a more powerful 3G signal than the iPhone really requires. So
if too many people try to make a call or go on the Internet in a given area,
some of the devices will decide there's insufficient power and switch to the
slower networkâ&euro;&rdquo;even if there is enough 3G bandwidth available.Update:To get a
taste of what will be served,mySQL DBAhas a nice post titledCapacity Planning,
Architecture, Scaling, Response time, Throughput. You learn how to figure out
when your application will break by building a 3rd order polynomial. Cool
stuff!John Allspaw who is the Operations Engineering Manager at Flickr is
about to publish a book with O'Reilly.There are not much details so far but it
seems interesting and relevant to High Scalability.Allspaw combines personal

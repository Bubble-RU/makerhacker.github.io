<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: " High Performance at Massive Scale –  Lessons learned at Facebook ". The abstract for the talk is:
  

Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web architectures.

  
There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into  later, but I thought you might want a head start on learning how Facebook handles 30K+ machines,</p><p>4 0.13439752 <a title="693-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-05-Drop_ACID_and_Think_About_Data.html">589 high scalability-2009-05-05-Drop ACID and Think About Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi Media, Inc:
   Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide for yourself.   
Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)  An interesting observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal</p><p>5 0.12165317 <a title="693-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-10-How_do_we_make_a_large_real-time_search_engine%3F.html">64 high scalability-2007-08-10-How do we make a large real-time search engine?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We're implementing a website which should be oriented to content and with massive access by public and we would need a search engine to index and execute queries on the indexes of contents (stored in a database, most likely MySQL InnoDB or Oracle).      The solution we found is to implement a separate service to make index constantly the contents of the database at regular intervals. Anyway, this is a complex and not optimal solution, since we would like it to index in real time and make it searchable.     Could you point me to some examples or articles I could review to design a   solution for such this context?</p><p>6 0.1194957 <a title="693-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Product%3A_Facebook%27s_Cassandra_-_A_Massive_Distributed_Store.html">649 high scalability-2009-07-02-Product: Facebook's Cassandra - A Massive Distributed Store</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 2:  Presentation from the  NoSQL conference :  slides ,  video .  Update:   Why you won't be building your killer app on a distributed hash table  by Jonathan Ellis.  Why I think Cassandra is the most promising of the open-source distributed databases --you get a relatively rich data model and a distribution model that supports efficient range queries. These are not things that can be grafted on top of a simpler DHT foundation, so Cassandra will be useful for a wider variety of applications.    James Hamilton has published a thorough summary of Facebook's Cassandra, another scalable key-value store for your perusal. It's open source and is described as a "BigTable data model running on a Dynamo-like infrastructure." Cassandra is used in Facebook as an email search system containing 25TB and over 100m mailboxes.

<p>Introduction: The recent Data-Intensive Computing Symposium brought together experts in system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific applications, and information-based applications to better understand existing capabilities in the development and application of large-scale computing systems, and to explore future opportunities.     Google Fellow Jeff Dean had a very interesting presentation on Handling Large Datasets at Google: Current Systems and Future Directions. He discussed:     • Hardware infrastructure    • Distributed systems infrastructure:    –Scheduling system    –GFS    –BigTable    –MapReduce    • Challenges and Future Directions    –Infrastructure that spans all datacenters    –More automation     It is really like a "How does Google work" presentation in ~60 slides?

<p>Introduction: The High Scalable Systems (i.e. Websites) such as: Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. need high scalable storage system that can deal with huge amount of data with high availability and reliability. Building large systems on top of a traditional RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This presentation explores the landscape of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability.

<p>Introduction: The Exceptional Performance group at Yahoo! has identified 14 best practices for making web pages faster. These best practices have proven to reduce response times of Yahoo! properties by 25-50%. They focus on the front-end, for example, why it's bad to use "@import" for including stylesheets and why ETags disable browser caching.      This google tech talk features these best practices and demonstrate YSlow.

<p>Introduction: Gartner published recently an interesting paper:  Productivity vs. Control: Cloud Application Platforms Must Split to Win  . (The paper requires registration.)
 
The paper does a pretty good job covering the evolution that is taking place in the PaaS market toward a more open platform and compares between the two main categories: aPaaS (essentially a PaaS running as a service) and CEAP (Cloud Enabled Application Platform) which is the  *P* out of PaaS that gives you the platform to build your own PaaS in private or public cloud.
 
While I was reading through the paper I felt that something continued to bother me with this definition, even though I tend to agree with the overall observation. If I follow the logic of this paper than I have to give away productivity to gain control, hmm…  that’s a hard choice.
 
The issue seem to be with the way we define productivity.

<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill  wrote an interesting article on O’Reilly Radar covering the current solutions for running  Big Data in the Cloud   
  Big data and cloud technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing, which clouds can readily provide.
   Big PaaS 
  Edd touched briefly on the role of PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloud
  Beyond IaaS, several cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes referred to as managed solutions, or  platform as a service   (PaaS), these services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce, reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass those savings on to the customer.
 
To put it simply, managing data clusters is one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we need to think about when we’re dealing with application platforms, as I no</p><p>5 0.89866245 <a title="693-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-12-P2P_server_technology%3F.html">598 high scalability-2009-05-12-P2P server technology?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Is there any type of server technology that allows visitors to a website to become part of the server?

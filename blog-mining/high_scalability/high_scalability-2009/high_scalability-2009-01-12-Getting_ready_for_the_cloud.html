<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for
"CloudAPIportability," which implies a series of misconceptions.If we break
away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud
portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly
simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without
settling on a common CloudAPI.In this post i'll be covering five common
misconceptions people haveWRTto cloud portability.Cloud portability = Cloud
API portability. API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.The
main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in.Cloud
portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-
in.Cloud portability isn't for startups. Every startup that is expecting rapid
growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability
rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared

challenges that developers face today when deploying their existing JEE
application to the cloud such as complexity, database integration, security,
standard JEE support etc. In this post i also provided summary of how we

<p>Introduction: Many web applications, including eBanking, Trading, eCommerce and Online

<p>Introduction: Hi,I am very glad that this site exists, as I have learned more about
clustering on this site than for quite some time reading stuff elsewhere.
Oftentimes, one can find lots of material about clustering, but the practical
real-life information is missing. Not so wih this site.I am currently planning
the development of an application which has a lot of enterprise features and
requirements. On the other side (if the tiny chance of success might strike
us), this application would not be an in-house application of a financial
institution, or something like that, but some kind of communit/web 2.0 web
site. Thus it is an enterprise application with (hopefully, but surely
unlikely) the user numbers of a social networking site. Each user initiated
transaction involves huge resssources business logic wise (including insane
amounts of encryption oprations).Of course, I do not intend to induldge into
premature scaling, but to invest every minute I have into the implementation
of business logic fe</p><p>6 0.15438506 <a title="490-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Private-Public_Cloud.html">444 high scalability-2008-11-14-Private-Public Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs
in a private cloud or data center and bursts into a public cloud when the
demand for computing capacity spikes. The advantage of such a hybrid cloud
deployment is that an organization only pays for extra compute resources when
they are needed. (Source: SearchCloudComputing)Neal Sample the former CTO -
X.commerce at eBay gave an interesting talk last year on the economic benefit
of Cloud Bursting. Neal pointed out eBay traffic statistics and showed some
real numbers of the business impact of bursting peak load activities using on-
demand cloud resources as presented in the diagram from his talk.In order to
use cloud bursting effectively we need to address the following set of
challenges:Workload migration- specifically the ability to clone our
application environment in a consistent way across sites in an on demand
fashion.Data Synchronization- The ability to maintain real time copy of the
data between the tw</p><p>4 0.8363108 <a title="490-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-14-Challanges_for_Developing_Enterprise_Application_on_the_Cloud.html">567 high scalability-2009-04-14-Challanges for Developing Enterprise Application on the Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This presentation illustrates how one can scale EXISTING JEE application and
deploy it on Amazon cloud usingGigaSpaces as the scale-out application
serverwhile:* Not having to re-write your application* Preventing lock-in to
specific cloud provider* Enabling seamless portability between your local
environment to cloud environmento No code or configuration change is required
between the two environmentso Develop local - test on the cloudo Built for
iterative development</p><p>2 0.89246041 <a title="490-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-19-Serving_JavaScript_Fast.html">285 high scalability-2008-03-19-Serving JavaScript Fast</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cal Hendersonwrites at thinkvitamin.com: "With our so-called "Web 2.0'
applications and their rich content and interaction, we expect our
applications to increasingly make use of CSS and JavaScript. To make sure
these applications are nice and snappy to use, we need to optimize the size
and nature of content required to render the page, making sure we're
delivering the optimum experience. In practice, this means a combination of
making our content as small and fast to download as possible, while avoiding
unnecessarily refetching unmodified resources." A lot of good comments too.</p><p>3 0.88637769 <a title="490-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-16-Product%3A_GlusterFS.html">278 high scalability-2008-03-16-Product: GlusterFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:GlusterFSis a clustered file-system capable of
scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over
Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64
server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).Cluster file systems are still
not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain
though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of
commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.GlusterFS
achieved35 GBps read throughput. The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was
performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband
interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with
multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB
block size. GlusterFS was configured with unify translator and round-robin
scheduler.The advantage</p><p>4 0.87179416 <a title="490-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Why_doesn%27t_anyone_use_j2ee%3F.html">82 high scalability-2007-09-06-Why doesn't anyone use j2ee?</a></p>

the architectures are non j2ee-Does that mean that>there aren't enough

Java, but in a very pragmatic way. They use servlets, an application server,
the JDK, and they do the rest themselves. They skip JSP, entity beans, and
JMS.When you need to scale putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky
strategy. Why use JSP when you can do better? When use entity beans when you
can do better? Use servlets because they are a very effective way of handling
http requests. Use Java because it is fast, runs everywhere, and has a boat
load of libraries you can use to build your build your custom system.Probably
the major reason J2EE is absentee is simply LAMP. LAMP is just so incredibly
functional for most 2-tier shared nothing sites they don't need a better

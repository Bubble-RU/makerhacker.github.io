<p>Introduction: Update 8:Introducing MongoDB byEliot Horowit. Update 7: The Future of Scalable
Databases by Robin Mathew.Update 6:NoSQL : If Only it Was that Easy. BJ Clark
lays down the law on which databases are scalable: Tokyo - NO, Redis - NO,
Voldemort - YES, MongoDB - Not Yet, Cassandra - Probably, Amazon S3 - YES * 2,
MySQL - NO.The real thing to point out is that if you are being held back from
making something super awesome because you can't choose a database, you are
doing it wrong.Update 5:Exciting stuff happening in Japan at this Key-Value
Storage meeting in Tokyo. Presentations on Groonga, Senna, Lux IO, Tokyo-
Cabinet, Tx, repcached, Kai, Cagra, kumofs, ROMA, and Flare.Update 4:NoSQL and

<p>Introduction: Lots of cool stuff happening this week...Voldemort gets rebalancing.It's one
thing to shard data to scale, it's a completely different level of
functionality to manage those shards intelligently. Voldemort has stepped up
by adding advanced rebalancing functionality: Dynamic addition of new nodes to
the cluster; Deletion of nodes from cluster; Load balancing of data inside a
cluster.Microsoft Finally Opens Azure for Business.Out of the blue Microsoft
opens up their platform as a service service. Good to have more competition
and we'll keep an eye out for experience reports.New details on LinkedIn
architectureby Greg Linden.LinkedIn appears to only use caching minimally,
preferring to spend their efforts and machine resources on making sure they
can recompute computations quickly than on hiding poor performance behind
caching layers.The end of SQL and relational databases?  byDavid

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.07707347 <a title="667-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-13-SQL_Server_2008_Database_Performance_and_Scalability.html">410 high scalability-2008-10-13-SQL Server 2008 Database Performance and Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>3 0.7502858 <a title="667-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL%3A_An_Overview_of_the_Various_Query_Semantics_in_the_Post_Only-SQL_World.html">867 high scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL: An Overview of the Various Query Semantics in the Post Only-SQL World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of many of the
scalability issues that we face today with traditional database approach.I
think that the main reason so many people have come to see SQL as the source
of all evil is the fact that, traditionally, the query language was burned
into the database implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to
the traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.This view has brought on a
flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a different aspect
that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach, such as a document
model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as Key/Value query.Most of
the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject, and tend to use
query semantics and architecture interchangeably. InPart Iof this post i tried
to provide quick overview of what each query term stands for in the context of
the NoSQL world .Part II illustrates those ideas using  code examples from</p><p>4 0.74676031 <a title="667-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at
giving a wide range o</p><p>5 0.73875248 <a title="667-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-07-Paper%3A_A_Co-Relational_Model_of_Data_for_Large_Shared_Data_Banks.html">1018 high scalability-2011-04-07-Paper: A Co-Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let's play a quick game of truth or sacrilage: are SQL and NoSQL are really
just two sides of the same coin? That's what Erik Meijerand Gavin Bierman
would have us believe in their "we can all get along and make a lot of money"
article in the Communications of the ACM,A Co-Relational Model of Data for
Large Shared Data Banks. You don't believe it? It's math, so it must be true
:-) Some key points:In this article we present a mathematical data model for
the most common noSQL databases--namely, key/value relationships--and
demonstrate that this data model is the mathematical dual of SQL's relational
data model of foreign-/primary-key relationships...we believe that our
categorical data-model formalization and monadic query language will allow the
same economic growth to occur for coSQL key-value stores....In contrast to
common belief, the question of big versus small data is orthogonal to the
question of SQL versus coSQL. While the coSQL model naturally supports extreme
sharding, the fac</p><p>6 0.72821051 <a title="667-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL_Took_Away_the_Relational_Model_and_Gave_Nothing_Back.html">930 high scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL Took Away the Relational Model and Gave Nothing Back</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Another fun one...Should I be Worried About Scaling?What happens when the
comfortable SQL world of yesterday changes out from under you? You feel like
this (it uses some language picante so be advised):breakHere's a link to the
source:http://browsertoolkit.com/fault-tolerance.pngA great way to communicate
the dislocation one feels when technology changes. It also gets you to wonder
if those changes at the user level are completely necessary for carrying out
the task?Lest you think this just an old guard reactionary sentiment, Boxed
Ice choseMongoDB over CouchDBpartly because "CouchDB requires map/reduce style
queries which is much more complicated to work with."Related ArticlesIt Must

<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and
Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper: Pursue robust
indefinite scalability, wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural
networks, starting from scratch.What is this strange thing calledindefinite
scalability? They sound like words that don't really go together:Indefinite
scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended
computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense
as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network
designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable
because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-
core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of
numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-
engineered.Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to
programmers using rei</p><p>3 0.71507907 <a title="667-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-08-scaling_drupal_-_an_open-source_infrastructure_for_high-traffic_drupal_sites.html">146 high scalability-2007-11-08-scaling drupal - an open-source infrastructure for high-traffic drupal sites</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a sad fact of life, but processes die. I know, it's horrible. You start
them, send them out into process space, and hope for the best. Yet sometimes,
despite your best coding, they core dump, seg fault, or some other calamity
befalls them. Unlike our messy biological world so cruelly ruled by entropy,
in the digital world processes can be given another chance. They can be
restarted. A greater destiny awaits. And hopefully this time the random
lottery of unforeseen killing factors will be avoided and a long productive
life will be had by all.This is fun code to write because it's a lot more
complicated than you might think. And restarting processes is a highly
effective high availability strategy. Most faults are transient, caused by an
unexpected series of events. Rather than taking drastic action, like taking a
node out of production or failing over, transients can be effectively masked
by simply restarting failed processes. Though complexity makes it a fun
problem, it's also why</p><p>5 0.65536875 <a title="667-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN_is_Not_a_Silver_Bullet_for_Network_Scalability.html">1256 high scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN is Not a Silver Bullet for Network Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak(CCIE#1354 Emeritus) is Chief Technology Advisor atNIL Data
Communications,author of numerous webinarsandadvanced networking books, and
aprolific blogger. He's focusing on data center and cloud networking, network
virtualization, and scalable application design.OpenFlow is an interesting
emerging networking technology appearingseemingly out of nowhere with much
hype and fanfarein March 2011. More than a year later, there are two
commercial products based on OpenFlow (NEC's Programmable FlowandNicira's
Network Virtualization Platform) and probably less than a dozen production-
grade implementations (includingGoogle's G-Scale networkandIndiana
University's campus network). Is this an expected result for an emerging
technology or another case of overhyped technology hitting limits imposed by
reality?OpenFlow-based solutions have to overcome numerous problems every
emerging technology is facing, in OpenFlow's case ranging from compatibility

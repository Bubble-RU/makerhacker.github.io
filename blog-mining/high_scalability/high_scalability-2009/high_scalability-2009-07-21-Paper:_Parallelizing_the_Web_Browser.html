<p>Introduction: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges    Research and education in Parallel computing technologies is more important than ever. Here I present a perspective on the past contributions, current status, and future direction of the parallelism technologies.     While machine power will grow impressively, increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be driving force in computing in the foreseeable future. This ongoing shift toward parallel architectural paradigms is one of the greatest challenges for the microprocessor and software industries.

<p>Introduction: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning to take advantage of the potential speed up.      In this paper, we develop a broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a time.      Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model can be written in a certain “summation form,” which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt Google’s map-reduce  paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM</p><p>3 0.76144308 <a title="660-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-01-Paper%3A_Can_Programming_Be_Liberated_From_The_Von_Neumann_Style%3F_.html">1641 high scalability-2014-05-01-Paper: Can Programming Be Liberated From The Von Neumann Style? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist  John Backus , he's the B in BNF(Backus-Naur form) and the creator of Fortran, gave a Turing Award Lecture titled  Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?: a functional style and its algebra of programs , that has layed out a division in programming that lives long after it was published in 1977. 
 
It's the now familiar argument for why functional programming is superior:
  

The assignment statement is the von Neumann bottleneck of programming languages and keeps us thinking in word-at-a-time terms in much the same way the computer's bottleneck does.


...


The second world of conventional programming languages is the world of statements. The primary statement in that world is the assignment statement itself. All the other statements of the language exist in order to make it possible to perform a computation that must be based on this primitive construct: the assignment statement.

<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist  Leslie Lamport  is definitely not a  worse is better  kind of guy. In  Computation and State Machines  he wants to make the case that to get better programs we need to teach programmers to think better. And programmers will think better when they learn to think in terms of concepts firmly grounded in the language of mathematics.
 
I was disappointed that there was so much English in the paper. Surely it would have been more convincing if it was written as a mathematical proof. Or would it?
 
This whole topic has been argued extensively throughout thousands of years of philosophy. Mathematics has always been a strange attractor for those trying to escape a flawed human rationality. In the end as alluring as the utopia of mathematics is, it lacks a coherent theory of meaning and programming is not about rearranging ungrounded symbols, it's about manipulating and shaping meaning.
 
For programmers I think  Ludwig Wittgenstein  has the right sense of things.

<p>Introduction: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic  is written by UC Berkeley's  Joseph Hellerstein  for a keynote speech he gave at  PODS . The video version of the talk is  here . You may have heard about Mr. Hellerstein through the  Berkeley Orders Of Magnitude  project ( BOOM ), whose purpose is to help  people build systems that are OOM (orders of magnitude) bigger than are building today, with OOM less effort than traditional programming methodologies . A noble goal which may be why BOOM was rated as a top 10 emerging technology for 2010 by  MIT Technology Review . Quite an honor.
 
The motivation for the talk is a familiar one: it's a dark period for computer programming and if we don't learn how to write parallel programs the children of Moore's law will destroy us all. We have more and more processors, yet we are stuck on figuring out how the average programmer can exploit them. The BOOM solution is the Bloom language which is based on  Dedalus:</p><p>6 0.72877443 <a title="660-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-20-Dart_-_Is_it_the_Future_of_the_Web%3F.html">1427 high scalability-2013-03-20-Dart - Is it the Future of the Web?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There have been reports that  software engineering is dead . Maybe, like the future, software engineering is simply not evenly distributed? When you read this paper I think you'll agree there is some real engineering going on, it's just that most of the things we need to build do not require real engineering. Much like my old childhood tree fort could be patched together and was "good enough." This brings to mind the old joke: If a software tree falls in the woods would anyone hear it fall? Only if it tweeted on the way down...  What this paper really showed me is we need not only to change programming practices and constructs, but we also need to design solutions that allow for deep parallelism to begin with. Grafting parallelism on later is difficult. Parallel execution requires knowing precisely how components are dependent on each other and that level of precision tends to go far beyond the human attention span.  In particular this paper deals with how to parallelize the browser on</p><p>2 0.87772858 <a title="660-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-29-Product%3A_SciDB_-_A_Science-Oriented_DBMS_at_100_Petabytes.html">817 high scalability-2010-04-29-Product: SciDB - A Science-Oriented DBMS at 100 Petabytes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scientists are doing it for themselves. Doing what? Databases. The idea is that most databases are designed to meet the needs of businesses, not science, so scientists are banding together at  scidb.org  to create their own Domain Specific Database, for science. The goal is to be able to handle datasets in the 100PB range and larger.
  

SciDB, Inc. is building an open source database  technology product designed specifically to satisfy the demands of  data-intensive scientific problems.  With the advice of the world's  leading  scientists across a variety of disciplines including astronomy, biology,   physics, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and climatology, our  computer  scientists are currently designing and prototyping this technology


The scientists that are participating in our open source project  believe that the SciDB database — when completed — will dramatically  impact their ability to conduct their experiments faster and more  efficiently  and further improve the qual</p><p>3 0.84913421 <a title="660-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Many_updates_against_MySQL.html">366 high scalability-2008-08-17-Many updates against MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello! My first post here, so be patient please. I am developing site where I have lots of static content. But on many pages I have query to update count of views. I would say this is may cause lots of problems and was interested in another solution like storing these counts somewhere else. As my knowledge is bit limited in this way, I am asking you. I can say I understand PHP(OOP ofc) and MySQL. Nowadays I am getting into servers.     Other question I have is:   I read about making lots of things static.(in Flickr Architecture) and am interested how they do static sites? Lets say they make photo page static? And rebuild when tagg or comment is added? I am bit interested in it as I want to learn Smarty better(newbie) and serving content.     Moreover, how about PHP? I have read many books about PHP theoretically but would love to see some RL example of using objects and exceptions(mainly this as I don't completely understand it) to learn some good programming habits. So if you can help</p><p>4 0.84622079 <a title="660-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-23-Product%3A_dbShards_-_Share_Nothing._Shard_Everything..html">847 high scalability-2010-06-23-Product: dbShards - Share Nothing. Shard Everything.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I met the CodeFutures folks, makers of  dbShards , at  Gluecon . They occupy an interesting niche in the database space, somewhere between  NoSQL , which jettisons everything SQL, and  high end analytics platforms  that completely rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.
 
High concept: I think of dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from  HSCALE  (partitioning) +  MySQL Proxy  (transparent intermediate layer) +  Memcached  (client side sharding) +  Gigaspaces  (parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).
 
You may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult questions (not really).
  Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was dbShards created to solve?

<p>Introduction: From their website:   DRBD  is a block device which is designed to build high availability clusters. This is done by mirroring a whole block device via (a dedicated) network. You could see it as a network raid-1.  DRBD takes over the data, writes it to the local disk and sends it to the other host. On the other host, it takes it to the disk there.  
   
  The other components needed are a cluster membership service, which is supposed to be heartbeat, and some kind of application that works on top of a block device.  Examples: A filesystem & fsck. A journaling FS. A database with recovery capabilities.  Each device (DRBD provides more than one of these devices) has a state, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'. On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to the local 'lower level block device' and to the node with the device in 'secondary' state. The secondary device simply writes the data to its lowe</p><p>6 0.8247906 <a title="660-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-19-Is_it_time_to_get_rid_of_the_Linux_OS_model_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1177 high scalability-2012-01-19-Is it time to get rid of the Linux OS model in the cloud?</a></p>

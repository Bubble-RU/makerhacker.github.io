<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems

<p>Introduction: One stumbling block of the the great march towards virtualization is the
relatively poor performance of resource hungry applications like databases. We
are told to develop and test using VMs, but deploy without them. Which kind of
sucks IMHO. Maybe better virtualization technology can remove this split. This
paper talks about a different approach to virtualization called "container-
based" virtualization that can reportedly double the performance of
traditional hypervisor systems like Xen. It does this by trading isolation for
efficiency. Rather than maintaining complete isolation between VMs the
container approach shares resources between VMs and thus gives higher
performance while still guaranteeing strong fault, resource, and security
isolation. It's yet another battle in computing's endless war of creating and
destroying abstraction layers. I learned a lot from from this paper because of

<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: For the last few months I've been programming a system in Go, so I'm always on
the lookout for information to feed my confirmation bias. An opportunity
popped up when Iron.io wrote about theirexperience using Go to rewrite
IronWorker, their ever busy job execution system, originally coded in Ruby.The
result:Dropped from 30 to 2 servers and the second server was used only for
redundancy.CPU utilization dropped to less than 5%.Memory usage dropped. Only
a "few hundred KB's of memory (on startup) vs our Rails apps which were ~50MB
(on startup)". Cascading failures are now a thing of the past.New services
running on hundreds of servers are all written in Go.They believe using Go
allows them to "build great products, to grow and scale, and attract grade A
talent. And I believe it will continue to help us grow for the foreseeable
future." Picking a language based on the size of the talent pool is a common
recommendation, they've found selecting Go helps them attract top

<p>Introduction: Production Monitoringis about ensuring the stability and health of our system,
that also includes the application. A lot of times we encounter production
systems that concentrate on System Monitoring, under the assumption that a
stable system leads to stable and healthy applications. So let's see what
System Monitoring can tell us about ourApplication.Let's take a very simple
two tier Web Application: This is a simple multi-tier eCommerce solution.
Users are concerned about bad performance when they do a search. Let's see
what we can find out about it if performance is not satisfactory. We start by
looking at a couple of simple metrics.CPU UtilizationThe best known operating
system metric is CPU utilization, but it is also the most misunderstood. This
metric tells us how much time the CPU spent executing code in the last

<p>Introduction: Travis Reeder inSpikability - An Application's Ability to Handle Unknown
and/or Inconsistent Load gives four good ways of handling spikey loads:Have
more resources than you'll ever need. Estimate the maximum traffic you'll need
and keep that many servers running. Downside is you are paying for capacity
you aren't using.Disable features during high loads. Reduce load by disabling
features or substituting in lighter weight features. Downside is users to have
access to features.Auto scaling. Launch new servers in response to load.
Downsides are it's complicated to setup and slow to respond. Random spikes
will cause cycling of instances going up and down.Use message queues. Queues
soak up work requests during traffic spikes. More servers can be started to
process work from the queue. Resources aren't wasted and features are
disabled. Downside is increased latency.</p><p>2 0.91367233 <a title="664-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-11-Have_We_Reached_the_End_of_Scaling%3F.html">758 high scalability-2010-01-11-Have We Reached the End of Scaling?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.Have we reached the end
of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The
End of" headlines. We've reachedThe End of Historybecause the Western liberal
democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the
final form of human government." We've reachedThe End of Sciencebecause of the
"fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions."
We've even reachedThe End of Theorybecause all answers can be found in the
continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're
atThe End of the World?Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began
to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?For a while I thought
this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is
because of the slow down of potential articles at

<p>Introduction: Simone Brunozzi, technology evangelist for Amazon Web Services in Europe,
describes how Soocial.com was fully ported to Amazon web services.
----------------This period of the year I decided to dedicate some time to
better understand how our customers use AWS, therefore I spent some online
time with Stefan Fountain and the nice guys at Soocial.com, a "one address
book solution to contact management", and I would like to share with you some
details of their IT infrastructure, which now runs 100% on Amazon Web
Services!In the last few months, they've been working hard to cope with tens
of thousands of users and to get ready to easily scale to millions. To make
this possible, they decided to move ALL their architecture to Amazon Web
Services. Despite the fact that they were quite happy with their previous
hosting provider, Amazon proved to be the way to go.-----------------Read the

<p>Introduction: Update: Parascale's CTO on what's different about Parascale.Let's say you have
gigglebytes of data to store and you aren't sure you want to use aCDN.
Amazon'sS3doesn't excite you. And you aren't quite ready to join
thegridnation. You want to keep it all in house. Wouldn't it be nice to have
something like theGoogle File Systemyou could use to create a unified file
system out of all your disks sitting on all your nodes?According to Robin
Harris, a.k.aStorageMojo(a great blog BTW), you can now have your own
GFS:Parascale launches Google-like storage software.Parascalecalls their
softwate a Virtual Storage Network (VSN). It "aggregates disks across
commodity Linux x86 servers to deliver petabyte-scale file storage. With
features such as automated, transparent file replication and file migration,
Parascale eliminates storage hotspots and delivers massive read/write
bandwidth." Why should you care?I don't know about you, but the "storage
problem" is one the most frustrating parts of buildin</p><p>5 0.89725161 <a title="664-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-The_7_Stages_of_Scaling_Web_Apps.html">391 high scalability-2008-09-23-The 7 Stages of Scaling Web Apps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical
successful website goes through:Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture,
low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers,
database server, and internal storage.Stage 2 - More of the same, just
bigger.Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache
static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding.Stage 4 - The Pain
Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too
long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content,
significant re-architecting for DB.Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink
entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters,
using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster.Stage 6
- Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database
architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again,
optimizing some code,</p><p>6 0.89443862 <a title="664-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-29-Second_Hand_Seizure_%3A_A_New_Cause_of_Site_Death.html">1070 high scalability-2011-06-29-Second Hand Seizure : A New Cause of Site Death</a></p>

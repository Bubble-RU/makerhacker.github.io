<p>Introduction: All the cool kids advocate scaling out as the secret sauce of scaling. And it
is, but don't forget to serve some tasty "scaling up" as a side dish. Scaling
up doesn't have to mean buying a jet propelled, liquid cooled, 128 core

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a

<p>Introduction: By Bhavin Turakhia CEO, Directi. Covers:* Why scalability is important. Viral
marketing can result in instant success. With RSS/Ajax/SOA number of requests
grow exponentially with user base. Goal is to build a web 2.0 app that can
server millions of users with zero downtime.* Introduction to the variables.
Scalability, performance, responsiveness, availability, downtime impact, cost,
maintenance effort.* Introduction to the factors. Platform selection,
hardware, application design, database architecture, deployment architecture,
storage architecture, abuse prevention, monitoring mechanisms, etc.* Building
our own scalable architecture in incremental steps: vertical scaling, vertical
partitioning, horizontal scaling, horizontal partitioning, etc. First buy
bigger. Then deploy each service on a separate node. Then increase the number
of nudes and load balance. Deal with session management. Remove single points
of failure. Use a shared nothing cluster.

Blog.Optimize everything else first, and then if performance still isn't good
enough, it's time to take a very bitter medicine.Update 3:Building Scalable
Databases: Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemesby Dare Obasanjo.
Excellent discussion of why and when you would choose a sharding architecture,
how to shard, and problems with sharding.Update 2:Mr. Moore gets to punt on
shardingby Alan Rimm-Kaufman of 37signals. Insightful article on design
tradeoffs and the evils of premature optimization. With more memory, more CPU,
and new tech like SSD, problems can be avoided before more exotic
architectures like sharding are needed. Add features not infrastructure.Jeremy
Zawodnysays he's wrong wrong wrong. we're running multi-core CPUs at slower
clock speeds. Moore won't save you.Update:Dan Pritchett shares some

<p>Introduction: This is a guest posting by Marty Abbott and Michael Fisher, authors ofThe Art
of Scalability. I'm still reading their book and will have an interview with
them a little later.  If 2010 is the year that you've decided to kickoff your
startup or if you've already got something off the ground and are expecting
double or triple digit growth, this list is for you.  We all
wanttheattentionof usersto achieve viral growth but as manycan attest, too
much attention can bring a startup to its knees. If you've used Twitter for
any amount of time you're sure to have seen the "Fail Whale", which is so
often seen that it has its ownfan club. Take a look at the graph below from
Compete.com showing Twitter's unique visitors. One can argue that limitations
in the product offering have as much to do with the flattening of growthover
the past six monthsas does the availability,butit's hard to believe the
inability of users to actually use the service has not hindered growth. What

<p>Introduction: The last six months have been exciting for Digg's engineering team. We're
working on a soup-to-nuts rewrite. Not only are we rewriting all our
application code, but we're also rolling out a new client and server
architecture. And if that doesn't sound like a big enough challenge, we're
replacing most of our infrastructure components and moving away from
LAMP.Perhaps our most significant infrastructure change is abandoning MySQL in
favor of a NoSQL alternative. To someone like me who's been building systems
almost exclusively on relational databases for almost 20 years, this feels
like a bold move.What's Wrong with MySQL?Our primary motivation for moving
away from MySQL is the increasing difficulty of building a high performance,
write intensive, application on a data set that is growing quickly, with no
end in sight. This growth has forced us into horizontal and vertical
partitioning strategies that have eliminated most of the value of a relational
database, while still incurring all t</p><p>5 0.70429254 <a title="717-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-30-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_30%2C_2010.html">869 high scalability-2010-07-30-Hot Scalability Links for July 30, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremy Zawodny, while performing data alchemy in the dungeons of Craigslist,
stored1,250,000,000 Key/Value Pairs in Redis on a 32GB Machine.Data sorting
world record: 1 terabyte, 1 minute. The system has 52 computer nodes, each
node is a commodity server with two quad-core processors, 24 gigabytes (GB)
memory and sixteen 500 GB disks. It's not just hardware though, they also
built a software that utilized all their CPU and RAM.Tweets of Gold:wm: I am
really getting the sense that none of you yokels waxing profound about
scalability actually has anything factual to sayjoestump: I think you can do
things to *mitigate* pain points up front. You don't need to over-engineer,
but it's not hard to look forward.danielcrenna: I love it when I check in

<p>Introduction: Erasure codesare one of those seemingly magical mathematical creations that
with the developments described in the paper XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure
Codes for Big Data, are set to replace triple replication as the data storage
protection mechanism of choice.The result says Robin Harris (StorageMojo) in
an excellent article, Facebook's advanced erasure codes: "WebCos will be able
to store massive amounts of data more efficiently than ever before. Bad news:
so will anyone else."Robin says with cheap disks triple replication made sense
and was economical. With ever bigger BigData the overhead has become costly.
But erasure codes have always suffered from unacceptably long time to repair
times. This paper describes new Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) that are
efficiently repairable in disk I/O and bandwidth requirements:These systems
are now designed to survive the loss of up to four storage elements - disks,
servers, nodes or even entire data centers - without losing any data. What is</p><p>2 0.96547049 <a title="717-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Product%3A_NetApp_MetroCluster_Software.html">28 high scalability-2007-07-25-Product: NetApp MetroCluster Software</a></p>
<p>Introduction: NetApp MetroCluster SoftwareCost-effective is an integrated high-availability
storage cluster and site failover capability.NetApp MetroCluster is an
integrated high-availability and disaster recovery solution that can reduce
system complexity and simplify management while ensuring greater return on
investment. MetroCluster uses clustered server technology to replicate data
synchronously between sites located miles apart, eliminating data loss in case
of a disruption. Simple and powerful recovery process minimizes downtime, with
little or no user action required.At one company I worked at they used the
NetApp snap mirror feature to replicate data across long distances to multiple
datacenters. They had a very fast backbone and it worked well. The issue with
NetApp is always one of cost, but if you can afford it, it's a good option.</p><p>3 0.96152788 <a title="717-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-12-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_12%2C_2011.html">1097 high scalability-2011-08-12-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 12, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scale-Out is incrementally adding servers as needed to scale rather than
buying larger servers. Here's the MySQL idea of what ascale-out architecture
lookslike:ThisMySQL articlelists 5 problems to avoid when scaling out:Don't
Think Synchronously. Introduce asynchronous communication, parallelization,
and strategies to deal with approximate or slightly outdated data.Don't Think
Vertically.  Scaling by bigger machines won't work. Plan on horizontal scaling
and asynchronous architectures form the start which make it easy to add
capacity on demand.Don't Mix Transactions with Business
Intelligence.Transactions and analytics are inherently different. Separate out
different types of data onto different databases.Avoid Mixing Hot and Cold
Data.Static and fast changing data are inherently different. Separate out
different types of data onto different databases.Don't Forget the Power of
Memory.  Make data accessible in RAM by smartly partitioning data across
servers.More information atScale-Out</p><p>5 0.92884272 <a title="717-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-31-How_WhatsApp_Grew_to_Nearly_500_Million_Users%2C_11%2C000_cores%2C_and_70_Million_Messages_a_Second.html">1622 high scalability-2014-03-31-How WhatsApp Grew to Nearly 500 Million Users, 11,000 cores, and 70 Million Messages a Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When we lastvisited WhatsAppthey'd just been acquired by Facebook for $19
billion. We learned about their early architecture, which centered around a
maniacal focus on optimizing Erlang into handling 2 million connections a
server, working on All The Phones, and making users happy through
simplicity.Two years later traffic has grown 10x. How did WhatsApp make that
jump to the next level of scalability?Rick Reedtells us in a talk he gave at
the Erlang Factory:That's 'Billion' with a 'B': Scaling to the next level at
WhatsApp(slides), which revealed some eye popping WhatsApp stats:What has
hundreds of nodes, thousands of cores, hundreds of terabytes of RAM, and hopes
to serve the billions of smartphones that will soon be a reality around the
globe? The Erlang/FreeBSD-based server infrastructure at WhatsApp. We've faced

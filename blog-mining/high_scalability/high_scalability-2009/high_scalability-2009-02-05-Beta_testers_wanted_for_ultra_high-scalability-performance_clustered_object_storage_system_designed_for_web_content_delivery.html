<p>Introduction: The Clustered Storage Revolution 
 
If the clustered file system, clustered storage system, storage virtualization movement is new to you then this is a good intro paper. It's a both vendor puff piece and informative, so it might be worth your time.
  A Quick Hit of What's Inside  
Clustered storage architectures have the ability to pull together two or more storage devices to behave as a single entity. Clustered storage can be broken down into three types:

<p>Introduction: Pomegranate  is a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high concurrency, high throughput, and low latency.   Their tests seem to indicate it works:
  

We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observed  linearly  increased more than  100,000  aggregate read and write requests served per second (  RPS  ).   

  
Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use. Every application could use it out of the box.
 
The features of Pomegranate are:
  
 It handles billions of small files efficiently, even in on</p><p>4 0.11688041 <a title="508-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-10-Sify.com_Architecture_-_A_Portal_at_3900_Requests_Per_Second.html">825 high scalability-2010-05-10-Sify.com Architecture - A Portal at 3900 Requests Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sify.com is one of the leading portals in India. Samachar.com is owned by the same company and is one of the top content aggregation sites in India, primarily targeting Non-resident Indians from around the world. Ramki Subramanian, an Architect at Sify, has been generous enough to describe the common back-end for both these sites. One of the most notable aspects of their architecture is that Sify does not use a traditional database. They query Solr and then retrieve records from a distributed file system. Over the years many people have argued for file systems over databases. Filesystems can work for key-value lookups, but they don't work for queries, using Solr is a good way around that problem. Another interesting aspect of their system is the use of Drools for intelligent cache invalidation. As we have more and more data duplicated in multiple specialized services, the problem of how to keep them  synchronized  is a difficult one. A rules engine is a clever approach.

<p>Introduction: Update :   Parascale’s CTO on what’s different about Parascale .   Let's say you have gigglebytes of data to store and you aren't sure you want to use a  CDN . Amazon's  S3  doesn't excite you. And you aren't quite ready to join the  grid  nation. You want to keep it all in house. Wouldn't it be nice to have something like the  Google File System  you could use to create a unified file system out of all your disks sitting on all your nodes?
 
According to Robin Harris, a.k.a  StorageMojo  (a great blog BTW), you can now have your own GFS:  Parascale launches Google-like storage software .  Parascale  calls their softwate a Virtual Storage Network (VSN). It "aggregates disks across commodity Linux x86 servers to deliver petabyte-scale file storage. With features such as automated, transparent file replication and file migration, Parascale eliminates storage hotspots and delivers massive read/write bandwidth." Why should you care?

<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:    GlusterFS  is a clustered file-system capable of scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64 server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).  Cluster file systems are still not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.   GlusterFS achieved  35 GBps read throughput . The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB block size. GlusterFS was configured with unify translator and round-robin scheduler</p><p>5 0.78174418 <a title="508-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-21-Paper%3A_Standardizing_Storage_Clusters_%28with_pNFS%29.html">128 high scalability-2007-10-21-Paper: Standardizing Storage Clusters (with pNFS)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: pNFS (parallel NFS) is the next generation of NFS and its main claim to fame is that it's clustered, which "enables clients to directly access file data spread over multiple storage servers in parallel. As a result, each client can leverage the full aggregate bandwidth of a clustered storage service at the granularity of an individual file." About pNFS  StorageMojo  says:  pNFS is going to commoditize parallel data access. In 5 years we wonâ&euro;&trade;t know how we got along without it .

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose limits (  GAE Quotas  ,   Fotolog  ,   Facebook  ) as a means of protecting a website against service destroying   traffic spikes  . Twitter will reportedly   limit the number followers   to 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow Twitter to make some bank by   going freemium   and charging for adding more followers.     Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established ecosystem?      One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is, however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service. Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.      Now in Twitter's case the people with the most followers tend to be o</p><p>3 0.9070496 <a title="508-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-18-How_to_deal_with_an_I-O_bottleneck_to_disk%3F.html">251 high scalability-2008-02-18-How to deal with an I-O bottleneck to disk?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.     They're using a static server to deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.     I'm curious how other people have dealt with this situation.     Seperating into two different servers would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.90175986 <a title="508-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-05-Beta_testers_wanted_for_ultra_high-scalability-performance_clustered_object_storage_system_designed_for_web_content_delivery.html">508 high scalability-2009-02-05-Beta testers wanted for ultra high-scalability-performance clustered object storage system designed for web content delivery</a></p>
<p>Introduction: DataDirect Networks (www.ddn.com) is searching for beta testers for our exciting new object-based clustered storage system.  Does this sound like you?     * Need to store millions to hundreds of billions of files   * Want to use one big file system but can't because no single file system scales big enough   * Running out of inodes   * Have to constantly tweak file systems to perform better   * Need to replicate content to more than one data center across geographies   * Have thumbnail images or other small files that wreak havoc on your file and storage systems   * Constantly tweaking and engineering around performance and scalability limits   * No storage system delivers enough IOPS to serve your content   * Spend time load balancing the storage environment   * Want a single, simple way to manage all this data     If this sounds like you, please contact me at jgoldstein@ddn.com.

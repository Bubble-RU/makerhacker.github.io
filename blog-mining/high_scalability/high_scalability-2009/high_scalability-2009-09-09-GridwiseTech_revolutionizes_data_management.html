<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things we are seeing is more tools and tool chains for
performing very high level operations quite simply.Vagrantis such a tool
forbuilding and distributing virtualized development environments.Web
developers use virtual environments every day with their web applications.
From EC2 and Rackspace Cloud to specialized solutions such as EngineYard and
Heroku, virtualization is the tool of choice for easy deployment and
infrastructure management. Vagrant aims to take those very same principles and
put them to work in the heart of the application lifecycle. By providing easy
to configure, lightweight, reproducible, and portable virtual machines
targeted at development environments, Vagrant helps maximize your productivity
and flexibility.If you've created a build and deployment system before Vagrant
does a lot of the work for you:Automated virtual machine creation

<p>Introduction: Snoozeis an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual
machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly to other VM
management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it
allows to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources.
Particularly, once installed and configured users can submit and control the
life-cycle of a large number of VMs. However, contrary to existing frameworks
for scalability and fault tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and
healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it
performs distributed VM management and is designed to be energy efficient.
Therefore, it implements features to monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU,
memory, network Rx, network Tx) demands, detect and resolve overload/underload
situations, perform dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and
finally power management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a
generic scheduler</p><p>4 0.71004492 <a title="697-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons_Learned_at_208K%3A_Towards_Debugging_Millions_of_Cores.html">484 high scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons Learned at 208K: Towards Debugging Millions of Cores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we debug and profile a cloud full of processors and threads? It's a
problem more will be seeing as we code big scary programs that run on even
bigger scarier clouds. Logging gets you far, but sometimes finding the root
cause of problem requires delving deep into a program's execution. I don't
know about you, but setting up 200,000+ gdb instances doesn't sound all that
appealing. Tools like STAT (Stack Trace Analysis Tool) are being developed to
help with this huge task. STAT "gathers and merges stack traces from a
parallel application's processes." So STAT isn't a low level debugger, but it
will help you find the needle in a million haystacks.Abstract:Petascale
systems will present several new challenges to performance and correctness
tools. Such machines may contain millions of cores, requiring that tools use

<p>Introduction: Update 2: 3tera has addedDynamic Appliances, which are "packaged data center
operations like backup, migration or SLAs that users can add to their
applications to provide functionality."Update: in an effort to help cross the
chasm of how start building a website using their grid OS, 3tera is offering
theirAssured Success Plan. The idea is to provide training, consulting, and
support so you can get started with some confidence you'll end up
succeeding.If you are starting or extending a website you have a problem: what
technologies should you use?Now there are more answers to that question than
ever. One new and refreshingly innovative answer is3tera's grid OS. In this
podcast interview with Bert Armijo from 3tera, we'll learn how 3tera wants to
change how you build websites.How? By transforming the physical into the
virtual and then allowing the virtual to be manipulated as if it were real.
Could I possibly be more abstract? Not really. But when I think of what they
are doing that's the</p><p>6 0.67045599 <a title="697-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-09-Paper%3A_Container-based_Operating_System_Virtualization%3A_A_Scalable%2C_High-performance_Alternative_to_Hypervisors.html">147 high scalability-2007-11-09-Paper: Container-based Operating System Virtualization: A Scalable, High-performance Alternative to Hypervisors</a></p>

<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech hasdeveloped AdHoc, an advanced framework for sharing
geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the
resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective.The premise of
AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access
to his or her resources without an IT administrator's help, and with high
security level of any exposed data or applications assured.It takes 3 easy
steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization,
add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any
organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join
forces for more efficient results.AdHoc was initially created for a consortium
of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical
partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to
provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the
administration of the</p><p>4 0.8214342 <a title="697-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-23-Postgresql_on_high_availability_websites%3F.html">73 high scalability-2007-08-23-Postgresql on high availability websites?</a></p>

that no sites are using Postgresql, and then I searched through

<p>Introduction: Wired has awonderful interview with Clayton Christensen, author of the tech
ninja's bible, Innovator's Dilemma. Innovation is the name of the game in
Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this
article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained
with compelling examples by the man himself.Just as every empire has fallen,
every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become
comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of
mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the
disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.He also talks
about his new book,The Capitalist's Dilemma, which addresses this puzzle: if
corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?If someone can
help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a
fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here's a
gloss of his wo</p><p>6 0.73984414 <a title="697-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-06-10_Ways_to_Take_your_Site_from_One_to_One_Million_Users_by_Kevin_Rose__.html">715 high scalability-2009-10-06-10 Ways to Take your Site from One to One Million Users by Kevin Rose  </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so
I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if
a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have
attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If
you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in
the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please
comment on that too.Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of
them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade
away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these
days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work.
Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people
do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not. Taking all
that wisdom and stuffing it into a presentations is surprisingly hard wor</p><p>6 0.044974409 <a title="520-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-17-Sponsored_Post%3A_Animoto%2C_deviantART%2C_Hadapt%2C_Clustrix%2C_Percona%2C_Mathworks%2C_AppDynamics%2C__ScaleOut%2C_Cloudkick%2C_Membase%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1043 high scalability-2011-05-17-Sponsored Post: Animoto, deviantART, Hadapt, Clustrix, Percona, Mathworks, AppDynamics,  ScaleOut, Cloudkick, Membase, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the
Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that
provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It
also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke
about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week - here is the summary
of that presentation.ďťżhttp://gojko.net/2010/01/25/designing-applications-for-

<p>Introduction: BigDataMatters is focused on the issues faced when processing and managing
large amounts of data. In light of this, it would be a crime not to blog about
the security of this data. Over the next few weeks, I will write a series of
posts focused on identity management in the enterprise. Before you read any

<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are
continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand
and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable,
which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.Abstract:The long-running
nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow
processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across
multiplequeries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their
constituent, stateful operators - e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators.
To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a
shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static
techniquesfor partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as
workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue
to function robustly inthe face of these imbalances. To address this
challenge, we introduce a dataflo</p><p>3 0.45710111 <a title="520-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-25-Relating_business%2C_systems_%26_technology_during_turbulent_time_-By_John_Zachman_.html">523 high scalability-2009-02-25-Relating business, systems & technology during turbulent time -By John Zachman </a></p>

<p>Introduction: What data structure is more sacred than the link list? If we get rid of it
what silly interview questions would we use instead? But not using linked-
lists is exactly what Aater Suleman recommends inShould you ever use Linked-
Lists?InThe Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connectionsone of the important
strategies is not scribbling data all over memory via pointers because
following pointers increases cache misses whichreduces performance. And
there's nothing more iconic of pointers than the link list.Here are Aeter's
reasons to be anti-linked-list:They reduce the benefit of out-of-order
execution.They throw off hardware prefetching.They reduce DRAM and TLB
locality.They cannot leverage SIMD.They are harder to send to GPUs.He also
demolishes the pros of linked-lists, finding arrays a better option in almost
every case. Good discussion in the comment section as not everyone
agrees.Patrick Wyatt detailshow a linked-list threading bugrepeatedly crashed

</p><p>3 We initially looked at MemCacheD but our internal benchmarking indicated SharedCache had better performance – at least w/in a Microsoft environment. [sent-19, score-0.218]
</p><p>4 NET's wildcard search was a little buggy in our initial beta testing. [sent-22, score-0.23]
</p><p>5 Getting a new machine (2 quad cores with 16 GB of RAM) helped reduce the latency to less than a second. [sent-32, score-0.179]
</p><p>6 Allowing CSS control isn't enough; we needed a templating system that allows total control over the site. [sent-38, score-0.394]
</p><p>7 We built a proprietary templating system that unfortunately became too limiting and would one day lead to a drag on performance. [sent-43, score-0.453]
</p><p>8 This made XSLT a natural choice from the templating angle. [sent-46, score-0.307]
</p><p>9 XSLT as Custom Templating System  Building a templating system in XSLT that actually allows the template author to make a web service call to our internal web service layer (or external web services) straight from the templating system. [sent-50, score-0.988]
</p><p>10 What we've found in our internal testing is that these extension objects scale way better than our previous templating system (a homegrown proprietary system). [sent-53, score-0.841]
</p><p>11 For now, we make the internal web services calls via HTTP, but we will soon be moving this to a TCP call to take advantage of the better connection pooling offered by TCP. [sent-56, score-0.219]
</p><p>12 For instance, if we needed a collection of comments, previously we'd hit the database for the 5, 10, 100, etc comments we wanted, do the sorting / filtering in the DB, return a single dataset, cache that, and then display. [sent-60, score-0.17]
</p><p>13 What we've started doing recently is caching the recent comment objects, and using our cache providers MultiGet ability to simultaneously retrieve all comments at the same time. [sent-62, score-0.235]
</p><p>14 Given the growth of our templating system mentioned above, we realized it was best to truly separate the tiers into discrete areas. [sent-69, score-0.478]
</p><p>15 Since our application is easily accessed via a set of REST APIs and our own internal skinning system (and who knows what in the future), dividing the application like this gives us a lot of leeway in being able to swap out components. [sent-70, score-0.246]
</p><p>16 We think this system will work for the near to mid term but long term, we'll take advantage of a queuing system to keep the index in sync. [sent-78, score-0.373]

Also a Right Scale article on  Network performance within Amazon EC2 and to Amazon S3 . 75MB/s between EC2 instances, 10.2MB/s between EC2 and S3 for download, 6.9MB/s upload.       Now that Amazon's S3 (storage service) is   out of beta   and EC2 (elastic compute cloud) has added new   instance types   (the class of machine you can rent) with more CPU and more RAM, I thought it would be interesting to take a look out how their pricing stacks up.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Andy Gelfond , VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site. There's an update for this article at  An Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment .  
 
For  TripAdvisor , scalability is woven into our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture, development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable co</p><p>4 0.15737 <a title="682-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Johann Schleier-Smith , CTO & co-founder, Tagged. 
  Five snapshots on how Tagged scaled to more than 1,000 servers  
Since 2004,  Tagged  has grown from a tiny  social experiment to one of the largest social networks, delivering  five billion pages per month to many  millions of members who visit to meet and socialize with new people.   One step at a time, this evolution forced us to evolve our architecture,  eventually arriving at an enormously capable platform  .
  V1:  PHP webapp, 100k users, 15 servers, 2004  
     
 
Tagged was born in the rapid-prototyping  culture of an incubator that usually launched two new concepts each  year in search of the big winner.  LAMP was the natural choice  for this style of work, which emphasized flexibility and quick turnaround  at a time when Java development was mostly oriented towards development  at large enterprises, Python attracted too few programmers, and Perl  brought the wrong sort.  Also, we knew that Yahoo was</p><p>3 0.80030978 <a title="682-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-03-MocoSpace_Architecture_-_3_Billion_Mobile_Page_Views_a_Month.html">821 high scalability-2010-05-03-MocoSpace Architecture - 3 Billion Mobile Page Views a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO of  MocoSpace , describing the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile Web; their multi-tiered,  read/write, local/distributed caching system; selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.
 
MocoSpace is a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser, ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web. Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging, music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs. The monetization strategy is focused on</p><p>4 0.79815698 <a title="682-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis_-_Scaling_an_Email-based_App_from_Scratch.html">1269 high scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis - Scaling an Email-based App from Scratch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO of  iDoneThis , which makes status reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch. 
 
 iDoneThis  is a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day to ask, "What'd you get done today?"  Just reply with a few lines of what you got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and kickstart another awesome day.
 
Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a weekend in the most rudimentary way possible.  I kid you not, we sent the first few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox.  The upshot is that we’ve had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.
 
We’ve gone from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming emails per month.  In total, customers have recorded over 1.</p><p>5 0.7977553 <a title="682-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-06-How_HipChat_Stores_and_Indexes_Billions_of_Messages_Using_ElasticSearch_and_Redis.html">1573 high scalability-2014-01-06-How HipChat Stores and Indexes Billions of Messages Using ElasticSearch and Redis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article is from an interview with    Zuhaib Siddique   , a production engineer at    HipChat   , makers of     group chat and IM for teams.  
   HipChat started in an unusual space, one you might not think would have much promise, enterprise group messaging, but as we are learning there is gold in them there    enterprise hills   . Which is why Atlassian, makers of well thought of tools like JIRA and Confluence,    acquired HipChat in 2012   . 
   And in a tale not often heard, the resources and connections of a larger parent have actually helped HipChat enter an    exponential growth cycle   . Having reached the 1.2 billion message storage mark they are now doubling the number of messages sent, stored, and indexed every few months. 
   That kind of growth puts a lot of pressure on a once adequate infrastructure. HipChat exhibited a common scaling pattern. Start simple, experience traffic spikes, and then think what do we do now? Using bigger computers is usually the first and bes</p><p>6 0.79670393 <a title="682-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-16-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_16th%2C_2014.html">1649 high scalability-2014-05-16-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 16th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: ThePort Network's Director of Engineering, TJ Muehleman was kind of enough to share some of the architectural details for their white label social media system. It currently runs about 50 social networks varying in size from less than 1000 members to more than 300,000 members, all on a Microsoft stack. In addition to their social networking platform, they offer Javascript APIs and web service APIs (both REST and SOAP) which account for a significant percentage of overall system usage.  ThePort is an excellent example of a real world in-the-trenches product offering real value to customers.  One of the most interesting problems they have to solve is multi-tenancy. How do you provide good performance, complete customization, support, develop new features, and provide individual search indexes for each customer? It's not an easy problem to solve.  How did they solve their problems and build a successful system?

<p>Introduction: Write a little "Hello World" program these days and it runs inside a bewildering Russian Doll of nested environments, each layer adding its own special performance and complexity tax. First, a language executes in its own environment of data structure libraries, memory management, and so on. That, more often than not, will run inside a language VM like the JVM, CLR, or V8. The language VM will in-turn run inside a process that runs inside an OS. An application will run in one or more threads inside a process. And the whole thing will run inside a machine sharing VM layer like Xen. And across all of that are frameworks for monitoring, elasticity, storage, and so on. That's a lot of overhead for a such a little program.
 
What if we could remove all these taxes and run directly on the new bare metal, which some consider to be a combination of M achine VM + Cloud API ? That's exactly what a system called  Mirage , described in the paper  Turning down the LAMP: Software Specialisation for</p><p>5 0.91260421 <a title="682-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_3%2C_2012.html">1297 high scalability-2012-08-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 3, 2012</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:                       
 
  Ross Tur : the tricks you learned to make things big are not the same tricks you can apply to make things infinite.  
  @gclaramunt : Son, I'm getting old, but let me tell you a secret: programming is hard, and high scalability and concurrent programming... frigging hard! 
 
 
  @Carnage4Life : At Apple the iOS team didn't see iPhone hardware or hardware team see OS until it shipped 
  @adrianco :  #ebspio caps iops but latency variance is much lower than EBS 
  @bernardgolden : RT @peakscale: A culture of automation is 10x more important than deployment/test/monkey thing you'd like to discuss < devops calling 
  @JayCollier : 50 years ago, school standardization was needed for scale. Now, scalability and flexibility (variability) can coexist. #FOL2012

<p>Introduction: Some intrepid company blogs are posting their technical challenges and how they solve them. I wish more would open up and talk about what they are doing as it helps everyone move forward. Here are a few blogs documenting their encounters with the bleeding edge:     Flickr    Digg    LinkedIn    Facebook    Amazon Web Services blog     Twitter blog     Reddit blog    Photobucket blog     Second Life blog     PlentyofFish blog     Joyent's Blog   Any others that should be added?</p><p>3 0.22992823 <a title="692-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-24-4_New_Podcasts_for_Scalable_Summertime_Reading.html">864 high scalability-2010-07-24-4 New Podcasts for Scalable Summertime Reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just  let the  random chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting  content." #fail. While someone says this I imagine them flicking their  hair back in a "I can't be bothered with true understanding" disdain. And  where does random chance get its content? From people like these. So:  support your local blog! 
 
If you would like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts that you may not know about and that I've found interesting:

With this  new video series where John and Damon visit high  performing companies and record an insider's tour of the tools and  processes those companies are using to solve their DevOps problems , DevOps is a profession that finally seems to be realizing their own value.

<p>Introduction: Update:   HostedFTP.com - Amazon S3 Performance Report . How fast is S3? Based on their own study HostedFTP.com has found: 10 to 12 MB/second when storing and receiving files and 140 ms per file stored as a fixed overhead cost.
   
  Update:   A Quantitative Comparison of Rackspace and Amazon Cloud Storage Solutions . S3 isn't the only cloud storage service out there. Mosso is saying they can save you so money while offering support. There are number of scenarios in their paper, but For 5TB of cloud storage Mosso will save you 17% over S3 without support and 42% with support. For their CDN on a Global test Mosso says the average response time is 333ms for CloudFront vs. 107ms for Cloud Files which means globally, Cloud Files is 3.1 times or 211% faster than CloudFront.   Amazon S3  is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.  This service allows you to link directly to files at a cost of 15 cents per GB of storage, and 20 cents per GB</p><p>5 0.50896269 <a title="692-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-10-Useful_Corporate_Blogs_that_Talk_About_Scalability.html">408 high scalability-2008-10-10-Useful Corporate Blogs that Talk About Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:

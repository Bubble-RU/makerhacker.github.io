<p>Introduction: Can you have your ACID cake and eat your distributed database too? Yes
explains Daniel Abadi, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Yale
University, in an epic post,The problems with ACID, and how to fix them
without going NoSQL, coauthored with Alexander Thomson, on their paperThe Case
for Determinism in Database Systems. We've already seenVoltDBoffer the best of
both worlds, this sounds like a completely different approach.The solution,
they propose, is: ...an architecture and execution model that avoids deadlock,
copes with failures without aborting transactions, and achieves high
concurrency. The paper contains full details, but the basic idea is to use
ordered locking coupled with optimistic lock location prediction, while
exploiting deterministic systems' nice replication properties in the case of
failures.The problem they are trying to solve is:In our opinion, the NoSQL
decision to give up on ACID is the lazy solution to these scalability and
replication issues. Responsibil</p><p>4 0.17307708 <a title="658-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>5 0.15782312 <a title="658-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: So far every massively scalable database is a bundle of compromises. For some
the weak guarantees of Amazon'seventual consistencymodel are too cold. For
many the strong guarantees of standard RDBMSdistributed transactionsare too
hot. Google App Engine tries to get it just right withentity groups. Yahoo! is
also trying to get is just right by offering per-record timeline consistency,
which hopes to serve up a heaping bowl ofrich database functionality and low
latency at massive scale:We describe PNUTS [Platform for Nimble Universal
Table Storage], a massively parallel and geographically distributed database
system for Yahoo!'s web applications. PNUTS provides data storage organized as
hashed or ordered tables, low latency for large numbers of con-current
requests including updates and queries, and novel per-record consistency
guarantees. It is a hosted, centrally managed, and geographically distributed
service, and utilizes automated load-balancing and failover to reduce

<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey, founder ofNuoDB, in thisthread on the Cloud Computing group,
delivers a masterful post on why he thinks the relational model is the best
overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself
from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave
new lock free world....I'll[Jim Starkey]go into more detail later in the post
for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency
is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human
facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips
between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads
inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage
this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together
related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make
sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the server and
using i</p><p>5 0.79620409 <a title="658-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-23-Digg%3A_4000%25_Performance_Increase_by_Sorting_in_PHP_Rather_than_MySQL.html">799 high scalability-2010-03-23-Digg: 4000% Performance Increase by Sorting in PHP Rather than MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: O'Reilly Radar's James Turner conducted avery informative interviewwith Joe
Stump, current CTO ofSimpleGeoand former lead architect atDigg, in which Joe
makes some of his usually insightful comments on his experience using
Cassandra vs MySQL. As Digg started out with aMySQL oriented architectureand
has recently beenmoving full speedto Cassandra, his observations on some of
their lessons learned and the motivation for the move are especially valuable.
Here are some of the key takeaways you find useful:Precompute on writes, make
reads fast. This is an oldie as a scaling strategy, but it's valuable to see
how SimpleGeo is applying it to their problem of finding entities within a
certain geographical region. Using Cassandra they've built two clusters: one
for indexes and one for records. The records cluster, as you might imagine, is
a simple data lookup. The index cluster has a carefully constructed key for
every lookup scenario. The indexes are computed on the write, so reads are

<p>Introduction: This article not about Mariah Carey, or its song. It's about Storing System,
Database.First let's describe what means by odds: In my social network, I
found 93% of the mainstream developers sanctify the database, or at least
consider it in any data persistence challenge as the ultimate, superhero, and
undefeatable solution.I think this problem come from the education,
personally, and some companies also I think it's involved in this.To start to
fix this bad thinking, we all should agree in the following points:Every
challenge have its own solutions, so whatever you want to save/persistent,
there are always many solutions. For example the Web search engines, such as:
Google, Kngine, Yahoo, Bing don't use database at all instead we use Indexes
(Index file) for better performance.The Database in general whatever the
vendor it's slow compared with other solutions such as: Key-Value storing
system, Index file, DHT.The Database currently employ Relation Data model, or
Object relational data</p><p>5 0.94764197 <a title="658-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-10-Viddler_Architecture_-_7_Million_Embeds_a_Day_and_1500_Req-Sec_Peak__.html">1037 high scalability-2011-05-10-Viddler Architecture - 7 Million Embeds a Day and 1500 Req-Sec Peak  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Viddler is in the high quality Video as a Service business for a customer who
wants to pay a fixed cost, be done with it, and just have it work. Similar to
Blip and Ooyala, more focussed on business than YouTube. They serve thousands
of business customers, including high traffic websites like FailBlog,
Engadget, and Gawker.Viddler is a good case to learn from because they are a
small company trying to provide a challenging service in a crowded field. We
are catching them just as they transitioning from a startup that began in one
direction, as a YouTube competitor, and pivoted into a slightly larger company
focussed on paying business customers.Transition is the key word for Viddler:
transitioning from a free YouTube clone to a high quality paid service.
Transitioning from a few colo sites that didn't work well to a new higher
quality datacenter. Transitioning from an architecture that was typical of a
startup to one that features redundancy, high availability, and automation.

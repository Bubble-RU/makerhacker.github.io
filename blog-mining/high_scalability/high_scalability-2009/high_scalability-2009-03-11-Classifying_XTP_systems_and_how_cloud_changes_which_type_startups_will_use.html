<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create
a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll
have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own
forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each
group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to
start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups
(this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that
having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that
some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day,
let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active
though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate
which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if
having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>3 0.09378498 <a title="531-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-03-Six_guiding_principles_to_Consolidate_your_IT_.html">894 high scalability-2010-09-03-Six guiding principles to Consolidate your IT </a></p>
<p>Introduction: The need for IT consolidation is most evident in two types of organizations.
In the first group, IT grew organically with business over the decades, and
survived changes of strategy, management, staff and vendor orientation. The
second group of businesses capital groups are characterized by rapid growth
through acquisitions (followed by attempts to integrate radically different IT
environments). In both groups, their IT infrastructures have typically been
pieced together over the past 20 (or more) years.ďťżRead more

<p>Introduction: In a People of ACM interview withSanjay Ghemawat, a Google Fellow in the
Systems Infrastructure Group (MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, GFS, etc), talks
about a few interesting aspects of Google's culture.What Made Google
GoogleProgress is a modern idea. The conviction that future can be changed for
the better through individual advancement and action has over hundreds of
years driven an exponential growth in the technome.What drives progress?
Challenges. Individuals finding and defeating a challenge. There's usually
something someone wants to do so badly that they put in the effort, the
thought, and the money into solving all the problems. The results are often
something new and amazing.And so it was for Google:The main motivation behind
the development of much of Google's infrastructure was the challenge of
keeping up with ever-growing data sets. For example, at the same time Google's
web search was gaining usage very quickly, we were also scaling up the size of
our index dramatically a</p><p>5 0.084885299 <a title="531-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-11-Google_Megastore_-_3_Billion_Writes_and_20_Billion_Read_Transactions_Daily.html">972 high scalability-2011-01-11-Google Megastore - 3 Billion Writes and 20 Billion Read Transactions Daily</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A giant step into the fully distributed future has been taken by the Google
App Engine team with the release of theirHigh Replication Datastore. The HRD
is targeted at mission critical applications that require data replicated to
at least three datacenters, full ACID semantics forentity groups, and lower
consistency guarantees across entity groups.This is a major accomplishment.
Few organizations can implement a true multi-datacenter datastore. Other than
SimpleDB, how many other publicly accessible database services can operate out
of multiple datacenters? Now that capability can be had by anyone. But there
is a price, literally and otherwise. Because the HRD uses three times the
resources as Google App Engine's Master/Slave datastatore, it will cost three
times as much. And because it is a distributed database, with all that implies
in the CAP sense, developers will have to be very careful in how they
architect their applications because as costs increased, reliability
increased, com</p><p>6 0.066365592 <a title="531-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-04-Its_time_for_auto_scaling_%E2%80%93_avoid_peak_load_provisioning_for_web_applications.html">524 high scalability-2009-03-04-Its time for auto scaling – avoid peak load provisioning for web applications</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is
indeed the case:Research conducted by HPfound that the majority of businesses
in the EMEA region are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the
cloud. Of the 940 respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-
critical apps at some point over the next two to five years.A more
recentsurvey, by research firm MeriTalkand sponsored by VMware and EMC
(NYSE:EMC), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to move some
mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within two years,
the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their mission-critical apps
to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of their mission-
critical apps to run in the cloud.The Challenge - How to Bring Hundreds of
Enterprise Apps to the CloudThe reality is that cloud economics only start

infrastructure.If the large majority of</p><p>3 0.75261909 <a title="531-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-12-The_CIO%E2%80%99s_Problem%3A_Cloud_%E2%80%9CMess%E2%80%9D_or_Cloud_%E2%80%9CMash%E2%80%9D.html">918 high scalability-2010-10-12-The CIO’s Problem: Cloud “Mess” or Cloud “Mash”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days - you only needed one, but then came along the
AS400's and soon you had ten - but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh
sh%# - now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and
datacenter operations!Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path?As a
technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other
CIO's on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context
to how they can leverage SpringCM' s easy, fast and affordable cloud
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done
in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a
combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those
services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be
outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud
services.What options do I have?In a recent conversation with a CIO
representing many million</p><p>4 0.74145716 <a title="531-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-15-Cloud_Bursting_between_AWS_and_Rackspace.html">1264 high scalability-2012-06-15-Cloud Bursting between AWS and Rackspace</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs
in a private cloud or data center and bursts into a public cloud when the
demand for computing capacity spikes. The advantage of such a hybrid cloud
deployment is that an organization only pays for extra compute resources when
they are needed. (Source: SearchCloudComputing)Neal Sample the former CTO -
X.commerce at eBay gave an interesting talk last year on the economic benefit
of Cloud Bursting. Neal pointed out eBay traffic statistics and showed some
real numbers of the business impact of bursting peak load activities using on-
demand cloud resources as presented in the diagram from his talk.In order to
use cloud bursting effectively we need to address the following set of
challenges:Workload migration- specifically the ability to clone our
application environment in a consistent way across sites in an on demand
fashion.Data Synchronization- The ability to maintain real time copy of the
data between the tw</p><p>5 0.71575326 <a title="531-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-08-Under_Snowden%27s_Light_Software_Architecture_Choices_Become_Murky.html">1575 high scalability-2014-01-08-Under Snowden's Light Software Architecture Choices Become Murky</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adrian Cockcroft on the future ofCloud, Open Source, SaaS and the End of
Enterprise Computing:Most big enterprise companies are actively working on
their AWS rollout now. Most of them are also trying to get an in-house cloud
to work, with varying amounts of success, but even the best private clouds are
still years behind the feature set of public clouds, which is has a big impact
on the agility and speed of product developmentWhile theSnowden
revelationshave tattered the thin veil of trust secreting Big Brother from We
the People, they may also be driving a fascinating new tension in architecture
choices between Cloud Native (scale-out, IaaS), Amazon Native (rich service
dependencies), and Enterprise Native (raw hardware, scale-up).This tension
became evident in a recentHipChat interviewwhere HipChat, makers of an AWS
based SaaS chat product, were busy creating an on-premises version of their
product that could operate behind the firewall in enterprise datacenters. This
is consistent w</p><p>6 0.71331644 <a title="531-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-Google_App_Engine_-_what_about_existing_applications%3F.html">305 high scalability-2008-04-21-Google App Engine - what about existing applications?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I try to group XTP in to two main groups, type 1 and 2 and then subdivide type
2 in to 2a and 2b. I describe how I do this grouping and then amplify it a
little in the context of cloud services.</p><p>3 0.58032268 <a title="531-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-20-Ask_HighScalability%3A_How_do_I_organize_millions_of_images%3F.html">1268 high scalability-2012-06-20-Ask HighScalability: How do I organize millions of images?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to store millions of images?
Currently images are stored in a MS SQL database which performance wise isn't
ideal. We'd like to migrate the images over to a file system structure but I'd
assume we don't just want to dump millions of images into a single directory.
Besides having to contend with naming collisions, the windows filesystem might
not perform optimally with that many files.I'm assuming one approach may be to
assign each user a unique CSLID, create a folder based on the CSLID and then
place one users files in that particular folder. Even so, this could result in
hundreds of thousands of folders. Whats the best organizational
scheme/heirachy for doing this?</p><p>4 0.47136927 <a title="531-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-16-Do_you_have_any_questions_for_the_Elastra_CEO%3F.html">277 high scalability-2008-03-16-Do you have any questions for the Elastra CEO?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It looks like in the near future I'll have a chance to interview the Elastra
CEO. Elastra provides standarddatabases--MySQL, EnterpriseDB and PostgreSQL--
on top of EC2 and S3. They are selling aggressive pricing, expandable and
contactable database resource usage in response to demand, and a simple
management and operations interface to well known databases deployed in a
cloud. Elastra could be an important option for developers looking for a more
traditional cloudy database.I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions
for questions you would like answered? What would you like to know about their
service? What are you looking for in a cloudy database? What would stop you
from adopting it or what would make you decide to adopt it? Any ideas you have
would help a lot and will probably be better than anything I have.</p><p>5 0.43558368 <a title="531-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-29-One_Story_of_Life_as_Told_Through_Queues.html">1556 high scalability-2013-11-29-One Story of Life as Told Through Queues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Love this little example of the human condition fromJohn Kellden viaIlya
Grigorik. This happens so often to me shopping at Costco or making lane
changes on the highway or picking stocks. Sometimes it's just never the right
line and trying to make it better only makes it worse. Stick and stay. Buy and
hold. Live to queue another day.</p><p>6 0.42380488 <a title="531-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-04-IPS-IDS_for_heavy_content_site.html">238 high scalability-2008-02-04-IPS-IDS for heavy content site</a></p>

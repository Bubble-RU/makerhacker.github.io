<p>Introduction: InfoQueue has thisexcellent talk by Brian Goetzon the new features being added
to Java SE 7 that will allow programmers to fully exploit our massively multi-
processor future. While the talk is about Java it's really more general than
that and there's a lot to learn here for everyone.Brian starts with a short,
coherent, and compelling explanation of why programmers can't expect to be
saved by ever faster CPUs and why we must learn to exploit the strengths of
multiple core computers to make our software go faster.Some techniques for
exploiting multiple cores are given in an equally short, coherent, and
compelling explanation of why divide and conquer as the secret to multi-core
bliss, fork-join, how the Java approach differs from map-reduce, and lots of
other juicy topics.The multi-core "problem" is only going to get worse. Tilera
founder Anant Agarwalestimates by 2017embedded processors could have 4,096
cores, server CPUs might have 512 cores and desktop chips could use 128 cores.

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: Abstract--This paper presents the architecture andcharacteristics of a memory
database intended to be used as acache engine for web applications. Primary
goals of this databaseare speed and efficiency while running on SMP systems
withseveral CPU cores (four and more). A secondary goal is thesupport for
simple metadata structures associated with cacheddata that can aid in
efficient use of the cache. Due to these goals,some data structures and
algorithms normally associated withthis field of computing needed to be
adapted to the newenvironment.</p><p>5 0.10236526 <a title="502-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-06-Ask_For_Forgiveness_Programming_-_Or_How_We%27ll_Program_1000_Cores.html">1204 high scalability-2012-03-06-Ask For Forgiveness Programming - Or How We'll Program 1000 Cores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The argument for a massively multicore future is now familiar: while clock
speeds have leveled off, device density is increasing, so the future is cheap
chips with hundreds and thousands of cores. That's the inexorable logic behind
our multicore future.The unsolved question that lurks deep in the dark part of
a programmer's mind is: how on earth are we to program these things? For
problems that aren'tembarrassingly parallel, we really have no idea. IBM
Research'sDavid Ungarhas an idea. And it's radical in the extreme...Grace
Hopperonce advised "It's easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to get
permission." I wonder if she had any idea that her strategy for dealing with
human bureaucracy would the same strategy David Ungar thinks will help us tame
the technological bureaucracy of 1000+ core systems?You may recognize David as
the co-creator of theSelf programminglanguage, inspiration for the HotSpot
technology in the JVM and the prototype model used by Javascript. He's also

<p>Introduction: The multi-cores are coming and software designed for fewer cores usually
doesn't work on more cores without substantial redesign. For a taste of the
issues take a look atNo new global mutexes! (and how to make the
thread/connection pool work), which shows some of the difficulties of making
MySQL perform on SMP servers.In this paper, Richard Smith, a -Staff Engineer
at Sun, goes into some nice detail on multi-core issues. His take home lessons
are:Use fine-grained locking or lock-free strategyDocument the strategy,
including correctnesscriteria (invariants)Keep critical sections shortProfile

<p>Introduction: Hi,I am an owner of an large community website and currently we are having
problems with our database architecture. We are using 2 database servers and
spread tables across them to divide read/writes. We have about 90% reads and
10% writes. We use Memcached on all our webservers to cache as much as we can,
traffic is load balanced between webservers. We have 2 extra servers ready to
put to use!We have looked into a couple of solution so far:Continuent
Uni/Cluster aka Sequoia -> Commercial version way too expensive and Java isn't
as fast as it suppose to be.MySQL Proxy -> We couldn't find any good example
on how to create a master - master with failover scenario.MySQL Clustering ->
Seems to be not mature enough, had a lot of performance issues when we tried
to go online with it.MySQL DRDB HA -> Only good for failover, cannot be
scaled!MySQL Replication -> Well don't get me started ;)So now I turn to you
guys to help me out, I am with my hands in my hair and see the site still

<p>Introduction: Teams fromPrincetonand CMU areworking togetherto solve one of the most
difficult problems in the repertoire: scalable geo-distributed data stores.
Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple
datacenter database functionality for some time, but there's still a general
lack of available systems that work for complex data scenarios.The ideas in
this paper--Don't Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-
Area Storage with COPS--are different. It's not another eventually consistent
system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based
system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally
consistent system that achievesALPSsystem properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL,
etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete
successfully), Low-latency (operations complete quickly (single digit
milliseconds)), Partition-tolerant (operates with a partition), and Scalable

<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDBis a great follow up
to the idea inHow SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMSthat more programming is the
price paid for performance in SimpleDB. It shows how much work and
infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of
SimpleDB.Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you
want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests.
Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to
parallelize. Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a
little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.Parallelization is the
approach taken by Haakon@AWS in his Java code example of how to get the most
out of SimpleDB. You can find the code atIndexing and Querying Amazon S3
Metadata with Amazon SimpleDB. We'll also consider how a back-end service
architecture built on Erlang may be a better fit with cloud computing.breakTwo

<p>Introduction: Mather Corgan, president of HotPads,gave a great talkon how HotPads uses AWS
to run their real estate search engine. I loved the presentation for a few
reasons:It gives real costs on on their servers, how many servers they have,
what they are used for, and exactly how they use S2, EBS, CloudFront and other
AWS services. This is great information for anybody trying to architect a
system and wondering where to run it.HotPads is a "real" application. It's a
small company and at 4.5 million page-views/month it's large but not super
large. It has custom server side components like indexing engines, image
processing, and background database update engines for syncing new real estate
data. And it also stores a lot of images and has low latency requirements.This
a really good example mix of where many companies are or would like to be with
their applications.Their total costs are about $11K/month, which is about what
they were paying at their previous provider. I found this is a little

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steve Newman, co-founder of Writely (Google Docs),
tech lead on the Paxos-based synchronous replication in Megastore, and founder
of cloud service providerScalyr.com.Microsoft's Azure service suffered a
widely publicized outage on February 28th / 29th. Microsoft recently published
an excellentpostmortem. For anyone trying to run a high-availability service,
this incident can teach several important lessons.The central lesson is that,
no matter how much work you put into redundancy, problems will arise. Murphy
is strong and, I might say, creative; things go wrong. So preventative
measures are important, but how you react to problems is just as important.
It's interesting to review the Azure incident in this light.The postmortem is
worth reading in its entirety, but here's a quick summary: each time Azure
launches a new VM, it creates a "transfer certificate" to secure
communications with that VM. There was a bug in the code that determines the
certificate expirat</p><p>5 0.095986523 <a title="615-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-14-How_scalable_could_be_a_cPanel_Hosting_service%3F.html">841 high scalability-2010-06-14-How scalable could be a cPanel Hosting service?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Every system has a limit. Although most providers of web hosting services
claim to provide "Unlimited", we all know that any web server has physical
limits which is usually hard to scale up, especially without taking the
machine offline.Most IT hosting companies use stand-alone servers to provide
website hosting. A very few use any form of HA clusters. Those web hosts that
use stand-alone servers do not feature scalability. Every time they need to
upgrade the machines they use, major changes to the systems have to be made.
Others which that do clustering are more scalable. They would add additional
servers to their systems or to remove machines from the set-ups. There are
many scenarios and different models of doing clustering. However I'm not the
one who would write about them. Plus this is not the purpose of this
article.The reason to start this article at High Scalability is to present

<p>Introduction: Update::Eucalyptus Goes Commercial with $5.5M Funding Round. This removes my
objection that it's an academic project only. Go team go!Rich Wolski,
professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
gave a spirited talk onEucalyptusto a large group of very interested
cloudsters at theEucalyptus Cloud Meetup. If Rich could teach computer science
at every school the state of the computer science industry would be
stratospheric. Rich is dynamic, smart, passionate, and visionary. It's that
vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his
group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and
glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he
decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as
a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement
Eucalyptus and have been improving it and tracking Amazon's changes ever
since.The question I had going into t</p><p>4 0.62839288 <a title="615-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-27-A_Metric_A%24%24-Ton_of_Joe_Stump%3A_The_Cloud_is_Cheaper_than_Bare_Metal.html">865 high scalability-2010-07-27-A Metric A$$-Ton of Joe Stump: The Cloud is Cheaper than Bare Metal</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Should you pay more in the cloud or pay less for bare metal in the datacenter?
This is a crucial decision point facing startups today. Which way should you
go? In thisWebpulp.tv interview, Joe Stump, always a go-to guy when you need a
metric ass-ton (a favorite expression of Joe's) of good advice on cutting edge
practices for the modern startup, laughs at conventional wisdom by sayingthe
cloud is really not more expensive than bare metal.The argument for a cheaper
cloud has a three main points:Raw Hardware Costs are Close. Buying hardware is
cheaper than renting hardware from Amazon, but it's close when you
considerreserved instances. A reserved instance costs about $250 a year and a
new server costs about $1500. Let's say Amazon is 30% slower. That means for a
cluster of 20 machines you would need a another 7 servers. This takes 10
minutes and 4 button clicks to provision on the cloud (the advantage of a
scale-out architecture + automation + cloud aware tools). So 7 extra servers

<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a meetup Wednesday onOpenStack,
whose tag line isthe open source, open standards cloud. I was shocked at the
large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of
them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free
t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are
really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud
doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from
Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems
to be. The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:OpenStack allows any organization
to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software
running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically
creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack
Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage using

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like?
Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing.
Specifically the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group(IPNSIG
).Ansible-likefaster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical
warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning
telegraph system.It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more
interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that
was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances
and with muchlonger delays:The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also
called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a
set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2]
Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances,
so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to
large delays and errors.[2] While the In</p><p>5 0.52077401 <a title="615-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala_-_P2P_Online_Storage_Cloud.html">368 high scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala - P2P Online Storage Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected
availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P
systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show
you how! They havelaunched Wuala, the social online storage service which
scales as new nodes join the P2P network.The goal ofWua.lais to provide
distributed online storage that is:largescalablereliablesecureby harnessing
the idle resources of participating computers.This challenge is an old dream
of computer science. In fact asAndrew Tanenbaumwrote in 1995:"The design of a
world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by
millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise
for the reader"After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich,
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system,
Caleido is ready to unveil the result: Wuala. Wuala is a new way of storing,
sharing, and p</p><p>6 0.46448478 <a title="615-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-02-Distributed_Hashing_Algorithms_by_Example%3A_Consistent_Hashing.html">892 high scalability-2010-09-02-Distributed Hashing Algorithms by Example: Consistent Hashing</a></p>

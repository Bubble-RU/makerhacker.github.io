<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDBis a great follow up
to the idea inHow SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMSthat more programming is the
price paid for performance in SimpleDB. It shows how much work and
infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of
SimpleDB.Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you
want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests.
Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to
parallelize. Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a
little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.Parallelization is the
approach taken by Haakon@AWS in his Java code example of how to get the most
out of SimpleDB. You can find the code atIndexing and Querying Amazon S3
Metadata with Amazon SimpleDB. We'll also consider how a back-end service
architecture built on Erlang may be a better fit with cloud computing.breakTwo

Parallel computing technologies is more important than ever. Here I present a
perspective on the past contributions, current status, and future direction of
the parallelism technologies.While machine power will grow impressively,
increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be driving force in
computing in the foreseeable future. This ongoing shift toward parallel
architectural paradigms is one of the greatest challenges for the
microprocessor and software industries. In 2005, Justin Ratter, chief
technology officer of Intel Corporation, said ‘We are at the cusp of a

<p>Introduction: Hidden in every computer is a hardware backplane for moving signals around.
Hidden in every application are ways of moving messages around and giving code
CPU time to process them. Unhiding those capabilities and making them first
class facilities for the programmer to control is the idea behind
AppBackplane.This goes directly against the trend of hiding everything from
the programmer and doing it all automagically. Which is great, until it
doesn't work. Then it sucks. And the approach of giving the programmer all the
power also sucks, until it's tuned to work together and performance is
incredible even under increasing loads. Then it's great.These are two
different curves going in opposite directions. You need to decide for your
application which curve you need to be on.AppBackplane is an example framework
supporting the multiple application architectures we talked about inBeyond
Threads And Callbacks. It provides a scheduling system that supports
continuous and high loads, meets crit</p><p>5 0.15960084 <a title="575-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-18-Beyond_Threads_and_Callbacks_-_Application_Architecture_Pros_and_Cons.html">1425 high scalability-2013-03-18-Beyond Threads and Callbacks - Application Architecture Pros and Cons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process
level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback
models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple
models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to
make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like
work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.But that's not
all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be
composed across threads of control.Your favorite language may not give you
access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there
has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially
for controlling latency variance, so I think it's time to talk about these
kind of issues. When it was do everything in the thread of a web server thread
pool none of these issues really mattered. But now that developers are

<p>Introduction: In many posts, such as: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges I
mentioned that synchronization the access to the shared resource is the major
challenge to write parallel code.The synchronization and coordination take
long time from the overall execution time, which reduce the benefits of the
parallelism; the synchronization and coordination also reduce the
scalability.There are many forms of synchronization and coordination, such
as:Create Task object in frameworks such as: Microsoft TPL, Intel TDD, and
Parallel Runtime Library. Create and enqueue task objects require
synchronization that it's takes long time especially if we create it into
recursive work such as: Quick Sort algorithm.Synchronization the access to
shared data.But there are a few techniques to avoid these issues, such as:
Shared-Nothing, Actor Model, and Hyper Object (A.K.A. Combinable Object).
Simply if we reduce the shared data by re-architect our code this will gives
us a huge benefits in performance and s</p><p>5 0.67839301 <a title="575-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-23-Learn_How_to_Exploit_Multiple_Cores_for_Better_Performance_and_Scalability.html">636 high scalability-2009-06-23-Learn How to Exploit Multiple Cores for Better Performance and Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InfoQueue has thisexcellent talk by Brian Goetzon the new features being added
to Java SE 7 that will allow programmers to fully exploit our massively multi-
processor future. While the talk is about Java it's really more general than
that and there's a lot to learn here for everyone.Brian starts with a short,
coherent, and compelling explanation of why programmers can't expect to be
saved by ever faster CPUs and why we must learn to exploit the strengths of
multiple core computers to make our software go faster.Some techniques for
exploiting multiple cores are given in an equally short, coherent, and
compelling explanation of why divide and conquer as the secret to multi-core
bliss, fork-join, how the Java approach differs from map-reduce, and lots of
other juicy topics.The multi-core "problem" is only going to get worse. Tilera

<p>Introduction: From their website:DRBDis a block device which is designed to build high
availability clusters. This is done by mirroring a whole block device via (a
dedicated) network. You could see it as a network raid-1.DRBD takes over the
data, writes it to the local disk and sends it to the other host. On the other
host, it takes it to the disk there.breakThe other components needed are a
cluster membership service, which is supposed to be heartbeat, and some kind
of application that works on top of a block device.Examples:A filesystem &
fsck.A journaling FS.A database with recovery capabilities.Each device (DRBD
provides more than one of these devices) has a state, which can be 'primary'
or 'secondary'. On the node with the primary device the application is
supposed to run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to
the local 'lower level block device' and to the node with the device in
'secondary' state. The secondary device simply writes the data to its lower
level block devi</p><p>3 0.8892498 <a title="575-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-14-How_do_you_even_do_anything_without_using_EBS%3F.html">1631 high scalability-2014-04-14-How do you even do anything without using EBS?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing recent AWS price changes,seldo
mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good
question was asked:How do you even do anything without using EBS?Amazon
certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability
record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This
avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as
AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS
services like RDS or ELB.If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where
to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls gives a great answer:Well,
you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that,
you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual
node failure. I prefer to believe that if you can't roll your entire
infrastructure over to new nodes monthly then you're unprepared for the
eventual outage of</p><p>4 0.88860971 <a title="575-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-20-Strategy%3A_Front_S3_with_a_Caching_Proxy.html">353 high scalability-2008-07-20-Strategy: Front S3 with a Caching Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Given S3'srecent failure(Cloud Statustells the tale)Kevin Burtonmakes
theexcellent suggestion of fronting S3with acaching proxy server.A caching
proxy servercan reply to service requests without contacting the specified
server, by retrieving content saved from a previous request, made by the same
client or even other clients. This is called caching. Caching proxies keep
local copies of frequently requested resources.In normal operation when an
asset (a user's avatar, for example) is requested the cache is tried first. If
the asset is found in the cache then it's returned. If the asset is not in the
cache it's retrieved from S3 (or wherever) and cached. So when S3 goes down
it's likely you can ride out the down time by serving assets out of the
cache.This strategy only works when using S3 as aCDN. If you are using S3 for
its "real" purpose, as a storage service, then a caching proxy can't help
you...breakAmazon doesn't used S3 as a CDN eitherAmazon Not Building Out AWS

<p>Introduction: Solve only 80% of a problem. That's usually good enough and you'll not only
get done faster, you'll actually have a chance of getting done at all.This
strategy is given by Amix inHOW TWITTER (AND FACEBOOK) SOLVE PROBLEMS
PARTIALLY. The idea is solving 100% of a complex problem can be so hard and so
expensive that you'll end up wasting all your bullets on a problem that could
have been satisfactoraly solved in a much simpler way.The example given is for
Twitter's real-time search. Real-time search almost by definition is focussed
on recent events. So in the design should you be able to search historically
back from the beginning of time or should you just be able to search for
recent time periods? A complete historical search is the 100% solution. The
recent data only search is the 80% solution. Which should you choose?breakThe
100% solution is dramatically more difficult to solve. It requires searching
disk in real-time which is a killer. So it makes more sense to work on the 80%

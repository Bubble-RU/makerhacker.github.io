<p>Introduction: Database Optimize patternsMost of websites and enterprise application rely on
the database backing them to store the application and customer data. So at
some point the database could be the main performance and scalability
bottleneck for your system performance, so I ‘m here today to cure this!key

<p>Introduction: My first post, please be gentle. I know it is long. You are all like doctors -
the more info, the better the diagnosis.-----------What is the best way to
store a list of all of your friends in the memcached cache (a simple boolean
saying “yes this user is your friend”, or “no”)? Think Robert Scoble (26,000+
“friends”) on Twitter.com. He views a list of ALL existing users, and in this
list, his friends are highlighted.I came up with 4 possible methods:--store in
memcache as an array, a list of all the "yes" friend ID's--store your friend
ID's as individual elements.--store as a hash of arrays based on last 3 digits
of friend's ID -- so have up to 1000 arrays for you.--comma-delimited string
of ID's as one elementI'm using the second one because I think it is faster to
update. The single array or hash of arrays feels like too much overhead
calculating and updating – and even just loading – to check for existence of a
friend.The key is FRIEND[small ID#]_[big ID#]. The value is 1.This way</p><p>4 0.073467858 <a title="582-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

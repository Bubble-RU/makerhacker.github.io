<p>Introduction: Hi,     I'm   i  nterested in peop  l  es thoughts on the best choice for a database clustering so  l  ution.     I have a database that is most  l  y varchars and numbers that doesn't store any b  i  nary data at a  l  l. It's used at about 70% read and 30% wr  i  tes - though we're using memcached at the moment so it's not rea  l  ly hit that hard.     We're current  l  y using mysql w  i  th m/cluster, but are interested in a new so  l  ution. Possib  l  e candidate so far are unic  l  uster (which doesn't seem mature yet.) or DRBD.     Had anyone had a simi  l  ar experience and can make any suggest  i  ons?

<p>Introduction: There were many talks recently about twitter scalability and their specific choice of language such as Scala  to address their existing Ruby based scalability. In this post i tried to provide a more methodical approach for handling twitter scalability challenges that is centered around the right choice of architecture patterns rather then the language itself.   The architecture pattern are given in a generic fashion that is not specific to twitter itself and can serve anyone who is looking to build a scalable real time web application in the near future.</p><p>4 0.10909443 <a title="557-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-21-Tracking_usage_of_public_resources_-_throttling_accesses_per_hour.html">256 high scalability-2008-02-21-Tracking usage of public resources - throttling accesses per hour</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     We have an application that allows the user to define a publicly available resource with an ID. The ID can then be accessed via an HTTP call, passing the ID. While we're not a picture site, thinking of a resource like a picture may help understand what is going on.     We need to be able to stop access to the resource if it is accessed 'x' times in an hour, regardless of who is requesting it.     We see two options   - go to the database for each request to see if the # of returned in the last hour is within the limit.   - keep a counter in each of the application servers and sync the counters every few minutes or # of requests to determine if we've passed the limit. The sync point would be the database.     Going to the database (and updating it!) each time we get a request isn't very attractive.      We also have a load balanced farm of servers, so we know 'x' is going to have to be a soft limit if we count in the app serevrs. (We know there will be a period of time between s</p><p>5 0.099726304 <a title="557-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-05-10_Things_You_Should_Know_About_Running_MongoDB_at_Scale.html">1606 high scalability-2014-03-05-10 Things You Should Know About Running MongoDB at Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Guest post by  Asya Kamsky , Principal Solutions Architect at MongoDB. 
 
This post outlines ten things you need to know for operating MongoDB at scale based on my experience working with MongoDB customers and open source users:
  
  MongoDB requires DevOps, too.  MongoDB is a database. Like any other data store, it requires capacity planning, tuning, monitoring, and maintenance. Just because it's easy to install and get started and it fits the developer paradigm more naturally than a relational database, don't assume that MongoDB doesn't need proper care and feeding.  And just because it performs super-fast on a small sample dataset in development doesn't mean you can get away without having a good schema and indexing strategy, as well as the right hardware resources in production! But if you prepare well and understand the best practices, operating large MongoDB clusters can be boring instead of nerve-wracking. 
  Successful MongoDB users monitor everything and prepare for growth.</p><p>6 0.090517193 <a title="557-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-23-When_to_migrate_your_database%3F.html">782 high scalability-2010-02-23-When to migrate your database?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on an amazing  Beach's motorcycle tour  of the  Alps  ( and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ). My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.   The trip was more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system, listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of fellow riders. Magical.

<p>Introduction: Can anyone convincingly explain why properties sporting traffic statistics that may seem in-line with with the capabilities of a single big-iron machine need so many machines in their architecture?
 
This is a common reaction to architecture profiles on High Scalability: I could do all that on a few machines so they must be doing something really stupid. 
 
Lo and behold this same reaction also occurred to the article  The Architecture Twitter Uses to Deal with 150M Active Users . On Hacker News  papsosouid  voiced what a lot of people may have been thinking:
  

I really question the current trend of creating big, complex, fragile architectures to "be able to scale". These numbers are a great example of why, the entire thing could run on a single server, in a very straight forward setup. When you are creating a cluster for scalability, and it has less CPU, RAM and IO than a single server, what are you gaining? They are only doing 6k writes a second for crying out loud.

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose limits (  GAE Quotas  ,   Fotolog  ,   Facebook  ) as a means of protecting a website against service destroying   traffic spikes  . Twitter will reportedly   limit the number followers   to 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow Twitter to make some bank by   going freemium   and charging for adding more followers.     Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established ecosystem?      One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is, however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service. Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.      Now in Twitter's case the people with the most followers tend to be o</p><p>5 0.47084367 <a title="557-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-22-How_can_we_spark_the_movement_of_research_out_of_the_Ivory_Tower_and_into_production%3F.html">863 high scalability-2010-07-22-How can we spark the movement of research out of the Ivory Tower and into production?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean: can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something useful? 
 
Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often do very little to help front-line developers succeed.

This is interesting for three reasons: 1) Joel has always seemed like a keep it small and grow organically type of guy, so this is a big step in a different direction. 2) It means they think there's a very big market in the Q&A; space and they mean to capture as much as the market as possible. 3) Most importantly for this blog, Joel gives some good advice on when to stay fresh and local and when it's time to jump for the brass ring, scale up your ambition, and go for VC money. Please see  Joel's blog  post for the details, but here's when to go VC:
  
 There’s a land grab going on. 
 There is a provable concept that’s repeatable. 
 The business itself could benefit from the publicity. 
 The investor will add substantial value to the business. 
 The business can potentially have a big exit or become a large, publically traded company. 
 The founders are not in it for their own personal aggrandizement.

<p>Introduction: The idea came up in this Hacker News  thread , commenting on a 37signals interview, that having three system administrators is the minimum optimal number of admins. Everyone wants to lower their costs by having each admin administer a lot of machines. The problem is when you have fewer than three admins you can never get a break from the constant corrosive pressure of always being on call. When every moment of your life you are dreading the next emergency, it eats at you. Having three admins solves that problem. With three admins you can:
  
 Go on a real vacation. The two remaining admins can switch off being on call. 
 Not be on call all the time. 
  
A larger shop will naturally have more admins so it's not as big an issue, but at smaller shops trying to minimize head count, carrying three admins (or people in those roles) might be something to consider.</p><p>4 0.25453854 <a title="557-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-21-What_does_the_next_generation_data_center_look_like%3F.html">69 high scalability-2007-08-21-What does the next generation data center look like?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey , founder of  NuoDB , in this  thread  on the Cloud Computing group, delivers a  masterful post  on why he thinks the relational model is the best overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave new lock free world.... 
 
I'll  [Jim Starkey]  go into more detail later in the post for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the s</p><p>6 0.18922949 <a title="557-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-22-Paper%3A_On_Delivering_Embarrassingly_Distributed_Cloud_Services.html">387 high scalability-2008-09-22-Paper: On Delivering Embarrassingly Distributed Cloud Services</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Snoozeis an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual
machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly to other VM
management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it
allows to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources.
Particularly, once installed and configured users can submit and control the
life-cycle of a large number of VMs. However, contrary to existing frameworks
for scalability and fault tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and
healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it
performs distributed VM management and is designed to be energy efficient.
Therefore, it implements features to monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU,
memory, network Rx, network Tx) demands, detect and resolve overload/underload
situations, perform dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and
finally power management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a

<p>Introduction: TGLdelivers Virtual Private Datacenters and virtual private servers from grids
of commodity servers. Each TGL grid consists of a pool of HP servers connected
with a Gigabit backbone network and running 3Tera's AppLogic grid operating
system.With a Virtual Private Datacenter, you get complete control of your own
private grid. Using our visual interface, you set up and assemble disposable
virtual infrastructure, including firewalls, load balancers, web servers,
database servers, NAS boxes, etc. visually, by pointing and clicking. You can
build advanced clusters, deploy large and small applications, and save them as
templates that can be provisioned in minutes. You can even build your own
virtual servers and appliances.</p><p>4 0.082619764 <a title="725-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-16-The_VeriScale_Architecture_-_Elasticity_and_efficiency_for_private_clouds.html">706 high scalability-2009-09-16-The VeriScale Architecture - Elasticity and efficiency for private clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model,
which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model,
networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as
services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the
datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed
application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing
sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the
datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to
scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt
easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sun's VeriScale architecture
provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun
Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures
for more than a decade. The features of these architectures, such as
elasticity, ar</p><p>5 0.06876637 <a title="725-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise.html">287 high scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Gartner published recently an interesting paper: Productivity vs. Control:
Cloud Application Platforms Must Split to Win. (The paper requires
registration.)The paper does a pretty good job covering the evolution that is
taking place in the PaaS market toward a more open platform and compares
between the two main categories: aPaaS (essentially a PaaS running as a
service) and CEAP (Cloud Enabled Application Platform) which is the  *P* out
of PaaS that gives you the platform to build your own PaaS in private or
public cloud.While I was reading through the paper I felt that something
continued to bother me with this definition, even though I tend to agree with
the overall observation. If I follow the logic of this paper than I have to
give away productivity to gain control, hmmâ&euro;Ś  that's a hard choice.The issue
seem to be with the way we define productivity.

<p>Introduction: Data centers are reshaping themselves by taking ideas from public cloud
providers, such as Amazon and Google. The idea is to make the data center more
cost-effective by enabling on-demand utility-based computing rather than
dedicated machines. At the same time, it is clear that to make IT operations
more effective, it doesn't make sense to run all the applications that are
currently hosted in a company's data center in the private cloud. This calls
for an integration between private and public cloud. In this post i discuss
some of the challenges involved in making that happen:1. How do we design
applications to be cloud-agnostic?2. How do we enable seamless fail-over to a
public cloud?3. Future-proofing: There are many cases in which we can't make a
clear decision as to where our application should be running at the time of
writing or developing the application. We would like to be in a position to
change the decision as to where our application will be running even after our
applicati</p><p>5 0.58413154 <a title="725-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-07-Rumors_of_Signs_and_Portents_Concerning_Freeish_Google_Cloud.html">299 high scalability-2008-04-07-Rumors of Signs and Portents Concerning Freeish Google Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Rumor no more.Google Jumps Head First Into Web Services With Google
App Engine. The quick and dirty of it: developers simply upload their Python
code to Google, launch the application, and can monitor usage and other
metrics via a multi-platform desktop application. There were 10,000 developer
slots open and of course I was too late. More as the cobra strikes.Update:
TechCrunch reportsGoogle To Launch BigTable As Web Servicenext week. It
competes with Amazon's SimpleDB. Though it won't be truly comparable until
they also release an EC2 and S3 equivalent. An internet hit for each data

<p>Introduction: The essence of my work is coming into daily contact with innovative
technologies. A recent example was at the request of a partner company who
wanted to answer- which one of these tools will best solve my virtualized
datacenter headache? After initial analysis all the products could be
classified as tools that troubleshoot VM sprawl, but there was no universally
accepted term for them. The most descriptive term  that I found was Virtual
Resource Manager (VRM) from DynamicOps. As I delved deeper into their
workings, the distinction between VRMs and Private Clouds became blurred. What
are the differences?Read more

What should Robert ask in his scalability interview?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know
everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this
case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help?
Here's Robert's plight:I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest
interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.It’s on
Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.Look at
who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind
WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of
FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the
“don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million
users on Facebook in about 10 days.What would you ask?</p><p>4 0.82635862 <a title="725-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-13-CloudCamp_London_2%3A_private_clouds_and_standardisation.html">441 high scalability-2008-11-13-CloudCamp London 2: private clouds and standardisation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: CloudCamp returned to London yesterday, organised with the help of Skills
Matter at the Crypt on the Clarkenwell green. The main topics of this
cloud/grid computing community meeting were service-level agreements,
connecting private and public clouds and standardisation issues.</p><p>5 0.665604 <a title="725-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-21-Paper%3A_Standardizing_Storage_Clusters_%28with_pNFS%29.html">128 high scalability-2007-10-21-Paper: Standardizing Storage Clusters (with pNFS)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: pNFS (parallel NFS) is the next generation of NFS and its main claim to fame
is that it's clustered, which "enables clients to directly access file data
spread over multiple storage servers in parallel. As a result, each client can
leverage the full aggregate bandwidth of a clustered storage service at the
granularity of an individual file." About pNFSStorageMojosays:pNFS is going to
commoditize parallel data access. In 5 years we won't know how we got along
without it. Something to watch.</p><p>6 0.65254283 <a title="725-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-01-Google_Strategy%3A_Tree_Distribution_of_Requests_and_Responses.html">981 high scalability-2011-02-01-Google Strategy: Tree Distribution of Requests and Responses</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson:  Game Industry Legends: Rob Pardo , where the future of gaming is discussed, there was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:
  Q. If the game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of those technical issues?

 


 Rob Pardo : I certainly think there's a lot of potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with the infrastructure that can have all those games up there.

<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact socially with friends using  Playfish  games on social platforms like The Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the fastest growing segment of the game industry:  social gaming , which is the love child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by why EA bought them for  $300 million  and they think a  $1 billion game  is possible): building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve systems, agile development and deployment, and  selling virtual good  as a business model.
 
How can a small company make all this happen?

<p>Introduction: Release early and often. A/B testing. Creating a landing page and buying ads on AdSense. All are ways of providing quick feedback in order to validate an idea. If you are like Zynga, with 250 million active users a month, how do you cost effectively prove out a game that could flop or get 90 million users (like CityVille) in an instant?
 
Zynga handles this problem inlle an innovative way, by inverting the typical cloud burst scenario that has excess traffic flowing from a datacenter to a cloud, to having a game start in the cloud and then moving to the datacenter once the game has proved popular enough to keep.
 
This process is nicely described by Charles Babcock in  Lessons From FarmVille: How Zynga Uses The Cloud , in an interview with Allan Leinwand, CTO of infrastructure engineering at Zynga.
 
When paired down to its essence, Zynga's strategy goes something like this:
  
  Games are risky .  Even with all their experience, Zynga can't know how many people will play a game or how</p><p>6 0.20659478 <a title="755-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-26-Sponsored_Post%3A_Membase%2C_Playfish%2C_Electronic_Arts%2C_Tagged%2C_Undertone%2C_Joyent%2C_Appirio%2C_Tuenti%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">929 high scalability-2010-10-26-Sponsored Post: Membase, Playfish, Electronic Arts, Tagged, Undertone, Joyent, Appirio, Tuenti, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: "Everything in war is simple, but the﻿ simplest thing is difficult." -- Carl von Clausewitz 
  

  

  
Games are proving grounds for software architecture. They combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost sensitivity, and the need for profit. And when games have in-game currency, like EVE Online has, there's money at play, so you can't just get away with a c'est la vie attitude. Engineering must be applied. 
 
In  Planning for war: how the EVE Online servers deal with a 3,000 person battle , we learn some techniques EVE Online uses to handle large games:
  7 Sensible...   
  Do nothing.  Most games are manageable or have spikes that quickly dissipate.  
  Run it Hot . There's nothing to throttle as servers run at 100%. Why waste money? Use all your CPU.

<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact socially with friends using  Playfish  games on social platforms like The Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the fastest growing segment of the game industry:  social gaming , which is the love child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by why EA bought them for  $300 million  and they think a  $1 billion game  is possible): building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve systems, agile development and deployment, and  selling virtual good  as a business model.
 
How can a small company make all this happen? To explain the magic I interviewed Playfish's Jodi Moran, Senior Director of Engineering, an</p><p>5 0.67955786 <a title="755-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-17-Scaling_Spam_Eradication_Using_Purposeful_Games%3A_Die_Spammer_Die%21.html">422 high scalability-2008-10-17-Scaling Spam Eradication Using Purposeful Games: Die Spammer Die!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change. What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better yesterday and a better tomorrow.   CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make CAPTCHA work ( Spammers Choose GMail ). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't really work because CAPTCHA solving markets ( Inside India’s CAPTCHA solving economy ) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game over :-)  Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is with humans.

<p>Introduction: The GigaOM Network today announces its second Structure conference after the runaway success of the 2008 event. The Structure 09 conference returns to San Francisco, Calif., on June 25th, 2009.     Structure 09 (http://structureconf.com) is a conference designed to explore the next generations of Internet infrastructure. Over a year ago, The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik saw that the platforms on which we have done business for over a decade were starting to provide diminishing returns, and smart money was seeking new options.  Structure 09 looks at the changing needs and rapid growth in the Internet infrastructure sector, and this year's event will consider the impact of the global economy. "I cannot remember a time when a new technology had so much relevance to our industry as cloud computing does in the current economic climate," said The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Gordon Worley , a Software Engineer at  Korrelate , where they correlate (see what they did there) online purchases to offline purchases. 
 
Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were originally told to expect. I wouldn’t say we panicked, but the office was certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.
 
At Korrelate, we deploy  tracking pixels , also known beacons or web bugs, that our partners use to send us information about their users. These tiny web objects contain no visible content, but may include transparent 1 by 1 gif</p><p>5 0.83852208 <a title="755-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-18-New_Relic_Architecture_-_Collecting_20%2B_Billion_Metrics_a_Day.html">1082 high scalability-2011-07-18-New Relic Architecture - Collecting 20+ Billion Metrics a Day</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The transport-level server load balancing architectures described inthe first
half of this articleare more than adequate for many Web sites, but more
complex and dynamic sites can't depend on them. Applications that rely on
cache or session data must be able to handle a sequence of requests from the
same client accurately and efficiently, without failing. In this follow up to
his introduction to server load balancing, Gregor Roth discusses various
application-level load balancing architectures, helping you decide which one
will best meet the business requirements of your Web site.The first half of
this articledescribes transport-level server load balancing solutions, such as
TCP/IP-based load balancers, and analyzes their benefits and disadvantages.
Load balancing on the TCP/IP level spreads incoming TCP connections over the
real servers in a server farm. It is sufficient in most cases, especially for
static Web sites. However, support for dynamic Web sites often requires

<p>Introduction: InClient Side Load Balancing for Web 2.0 Applicationsauthor Lei Zhu suggests a
very interesting approach to load balancing: forget DNS round robbin, toss
your expensive load balancer, and make your client do the load balancing for
you. Your client maintains a list of possible servers and cycles through them.
All the details are explained in the article, but it's an intriguing idea,

<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture
principles then take a look at Will Larson's Introduction to Architecting
Systems for Scale. Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers
key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:Load
Balancing: Scalability & Redundancy.Horizontal scalability and redundancy are
usually achieved via load balancing, the spreading of requests across multiple
resources.Smart Clients.The client has a list of hosts and load balances
across that list of hosts. Upside is simple for programmers. Downside is it's
hard to update and change.Hardware Load Balancers.Targeted at larger
companies, this is dedicated load balancing hardware. Upside is performance.
Downside is cost and complexity.Software Load Balancers.The recommended
approach, it's  software that handles load balancing, health checks,
etc.Caching.Make better use of resources you already have. Precalculate
results for later use.

<p>Introduction: Server farms achieve high scalability and high availability through server
load balancing, a technique that makes the server farm appear to clients as a
single server. In this two-part article, Gregor Roth explores server load
balancing architectures, with a focus on open source solutions. Part 1 covers
server load balancing basics and discusses the pros and cons of transport-
level server load balancing.The barrier to entry for many Internet companies
is low. Anyone with a good idea can develop a small application, purchase a
domain name, and set up a few PC-based servers to handle incoming traffic. The
initial investment is small, so the start-up risk is minimal. But a successful
low-cost infrastructure can become a serious problem quickly. A single server
that handles all the incoming requests may not have the capacity to handle
high traffic volumes once the business becomes popular. In such a situations
companies often start to scale up: they upgrade the existing infrastructure by</p><p>6 0.80322409 <a title="509-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-06-The_Design_of_99designs_-_A_Clean_Tens_of_Millions_Pageviews_Architecture.html">1188 high scalability-2012-02-06-The Design of 99designs - A Clean Tens of Millions Pageviews Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:Load Balancing in Amazon EC2 with HAProxy.Grig Gheorghiu writes a nice
poston HAProxy functionality and configuration: Emulating virtual servers,
Logging, SSL, Load balancing algorithms, Session persistence with cookies,
Server health checks, etc.Adapted From the website:HAProxyis a free, very fast
and reliable solution offering high availability, load balancing, and proxying
for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It is particularly suited for web sites
crawling under very high loads while needing persistence or Layer7 processing.
Supporting tens of thousands of connections is clearly realistic with todays
hardware. Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing
architectures very easy and riskless, while still offering the possibility not
to expose fragile web servers to the Net.Currently, two major versions are
supported :* version 1.1 - maintains critical sites online since 200 The most
stable and reliable, has reached years of uptime. Receives no new feature,

<p>Introduction: Plenty of Fish CEO Markus Frind, famous nerd hero for making over $10 million
a year from Google ads on a free dating site he made and ran all by himself,
nowsees a problem with the free model:The problem with free is that every time
you double the size of your database the cost of maintaining the site grows 6
fold. I really underestimated how much resources it would take, I have one
database table now that exceeds 3 billion records. The bigger you get as a
free site the less money you make per visit and the more it costs to service a
visit...There is really no money in being free and we have to start
experimenting with other models now or we won't be able to compete in 3 or 4
years.As one commenter succinctly put it: the"golden time" of AdSense is over.
Time to look at costs. The POF architecture is to run scarily huge tables on
single machines. They also buy and maintain their own SAN. So it seems scaling
up is what is increasing costs and decreasing profits. I wonder if the

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere

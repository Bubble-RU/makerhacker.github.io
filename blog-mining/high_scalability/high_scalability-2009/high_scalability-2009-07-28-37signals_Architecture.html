<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>3 0.15192144 <a title="663-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon_Architecture.html">96 high scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived
processes) and why they moved toScalato program against it (high level

<p>Introduction: Update 4: Heroku versus GAE & GAE/JUpdate 3:Heroku has gone live!.
Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the
relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment
and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.Update 2:Heroku
Architecture. A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests
flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a
Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based
routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your
application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors. Dynos
themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware,
Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as
an application caching layer.Update: Aaron WorshamInterview with James

<p>Introduction: This article is a lightly edited version of 20 Obstacles to Scalability bySean
Hull (with permission) from the always excellent and thought provoking ACM
Queue.1. TWO-PHASE COMMITNormally when data is changed in a database, it is
written both to memory and to disk. When a commit happens, a relational
database makes a commitment to freeze the data somewhere on real storage
media. Remember, memory doesn't survive a crash or reboot. Even if the data is
cached in memory, the database still has to write it to disk. MySQL binary
logs or Oracle redo logs fit the bill.With a MySQL cluster or distributed file
system such as DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) or Amazon Multi-AZ
(Multi-Availability Zone), a commit occurs not only locally, but also at the
remote end. A two-phase commit means waiting for an acknowledgment from the
far end. Because of network and other latency, those commits can be slowed
down by milliseconds, as though all the cars on a highway were slowed down by
heavy loa</p><p>5 0.7910077 <a title="663-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-16-ThePort__Network__Architecture.html">682 high scalability-2009-08-16-ThePort  Network  Architecture</a></p>

share some of the architectural details for their white label social media
system. It currently runs about 50 social networks varying in size from less

addition to their social networking platform, they offer Javascript APIs and
web service APIs (both REST and SOAP) which account for a significant
percentage of overall system usage.ThePort is an excellent example of a real
world in-the-trenches product offering real value to customers. One of the
most interesting problems they have to solve is multi-tenancy. How do you
provide good performance, complete customization, support, develop new
features, and provide individual search indexes for each customer? It's not an
easy problem to solve.How did they solve their problems and build a successful

<p>Introduction: A conjunction of a few new technologies may trigger disruptive changes in the
future. This observation was prompted by a talkSteve Perlmangave at the
Columbia Engineering School: Benjamin Button, Cloud Everything and Why
Shannon's Law Isn't. In it he covers a set of technologies that at first may
seem unrelated, but turn out to be deeply related after all, culminating in a
realization of the long talked about vision of an application utility, where
all applications are hosted and run out of the cloud. First Perlman talks
about the realistic human rendering technology developed at Rearden, his
research incubator company. This technology was developed over many years and
is the secret behind the wonderful effects found in movies likeBenjamin
Button. It is now being used in many other films, and promises to
revolutionize film making, possibly even replacing actors with computers, in
real-time.The next invention at Rearden isOnLive, a cloud based gaming

<p>Introduction: If you are stuck drowning in too much data and too many options and are
dazzled by all the possibilities of code, here's a helpful bit of advice from
Airbnb's rags to richesorigin story:it's okay to do things that don't scale. A
corollary is the idea of paying attention to and learning from what your users
are actually doing and let that lead you without out that annoying voice in
your head second guessing you, yelling but that will never scale! Worry about
building something good, then worry about making it scale.In Airbnb's case
they noticed people weren't booking rooms because the pictures sucked. So they
flew to New York and shot some beautiful images. This is a very non-scalable
and non-technical solution. Yet it was the turning point for Airbnb and
sparked their climb out of the "trough of sorrow." Previously they had been
limited by the Silicon Valley idea that every feature had to be scalable. Not
every solution can be found behind a computer screen.For the full story please

<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>4 0.93972164 <a title="663-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-16-7_Design_Patterns_for_Almost-infinite_Scalability.html">958 high scalability-2010-12-16-7 Design Patterns for Almost-infinite Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Good article frommanageability.com summarizing design patterns from Pat
Helland's amazing paperLife beyond Distributed Transactions: an Apostate's
Opinion.Entities are uniquely identified- each entity which represents
disjoint data (i.e. no overlap of data between entities) should have a unique
key.Multiple disjoint scopes of transactional serializability- in other words
there are these 'entities' and that you cannot perform atomic transactions
across these entities.At-Least-Once messaging- that is an application must
tolerate message retries and out-of-order arrival of messages.Messages are
adressed to entities- that is one can't abstract away from the business logic
the existence of the unique keys for addresing entities. Addressing however is
independent of location.Entities manage conversational state per party- that
is, to ensure idemptency an entity needs to remember that a message has been
previously processed. Furthermore, in a world without atomic transactions,
outcomes need t</p><p>5 0.93820077 <a title="663-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-01-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_1%2C_2011.html">1015 high scalability-2011-04-01-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 1, 2011</a></p>

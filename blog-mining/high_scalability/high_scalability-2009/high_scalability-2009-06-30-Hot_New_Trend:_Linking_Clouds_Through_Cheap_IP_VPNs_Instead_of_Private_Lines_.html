<p>Introduction: How do you keep in sync a crescendo of data between data centers over a slow
WAN? That's the questionAlbertoposted a few weeks ago. Normally I'm not into
all boy bands, but I was frustrated there wasn't a really good answer for his
problem. It occurred to me later a WAN accelerator might help turn his slow
WAN link into more of a LAN, so the overhead of copying files across the WAN
wouldn't be so limiting. Many might not consider a WAN accelerator in this
situation, but since my friend Damon Ennis works at the WAN accelerator
vendorSilver Peak, I thought I would ask him if their product would help. Not
surprisingly his answer is yes! Potentially a lot, depending on the nature of
your data. Here's a no BS overview of their product:breakWhat is it?- Scalable

<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says one of the
big lessons they've learned is to create lesschatty protocols:In the Netflix
data centers, we have a high capacity, super fast, highly reliable network.
This has afforded us the luxury of designing around chatty APIs to remote
systems. AWS networking has more variable latency. We've had to be much more
structured about "over the wire" interactions, even as we've transitioned to a
more highly distributed architecture.There's not a lot of advice out there on
how to create protocols. Combine that with a rush to the cloud and you have a
perfect storm for chatty applications crushing application performance.
Netflix is far from the first to be surprised by the less than stellar
networks inside AWS. A chatty protocol is one where a client makes a series of
requests to a server and the client must wait on each reply before sending the
next request. On a LAN this can work great. LAN's are typically fast, wide,

<p>Introduction: The title of this post is a quote from Ilya Grigorik's post Weak Consistency
and CAP Implications. Besides the article being excellent, I thought this idea
had something to add to the great NoSQL versus RDBMS debate, whereMike
Stonebraker makes the argument that network partitions are rare so designing
eventually consistent systems for such rare occurrence is not worth losing
ACID semantics over. Even if network partitions are rare, latency between
datacenters is not rare, so the game is still on.The rare-partition argument
seems to flow from a centralized-distributed view of systems. Such systems are
scale-out in that they grow by adding distributed nodes, but the nodes
generally do not cross datacenter boundaries. The assumption is the network is
fast enough that distributed operations are roughly homogenous between
nodes.In a fully-distributed system the nodes can be dispersed across
datacenters, which gives operations a widely variable performance profile.

<p>Introduction: Who hasn't cursed their network for being slow while waiting for that annoying
little hour glass of pain to release all its grains of sand? But what's really
going on? Is your network really slow? PacketPushers Show 45 - Arista - EOS
Network Software Architecture has a good explanation of what may be really at
fault (paraphrased):Network operators get calls from application guys saying
the network is slow, but the problem is usually dropped packets due to
congestion. It's not usually latency, it's usually packet loss. Packet loss
causes TCP to back off and retransmit, which causes applications to appear
slow.Packet loss can be caused by a flakey transceiver, but the problem is
usually network congestion. Somewhere on the network there's fan-in, a
bottleneck develops, queues build up to a certain point, and when a queue
overflows it drops packets. Often the first sign of this happening is
application slowness.Queues get deeper and deeper because the network is
getting more and more use</p><p>3 0.74620569 <a title="645-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-10-Kill_the_Telcos_Save_the_Internet_-_The_Unsocial_Network.html">1140 high scalability-2011-11-10-Kill the Telcos Save the Internet - The Unsocial Network</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday
you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is
technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient
and made the diagnosis. What did they find?Diagnostic team: the Packet Pushers
gang (Greg Ferro,Jan Zorz,Ivan Pepelnjak) in the podcast How We Are Killing
the Internet.Diagnosis: invasive tunnelation. (tubes anyone?)Prognosis: even
Dr. House might not be able to help.Cure: go back to what the Internet was;
kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything;
disrupt the telcos.This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--
but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's
where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder,
tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's

<p>Introduction: Cloud-based services for all things digital will either drive - or die by -
bandwidthConsumers, by definition, consume. In the realm of the Internet, they
consume far more than they produce. Or so it's been in the past. Broadband
connectivity across all providers have long offered asymmetric network feeds
because it mirrored reality: an HTTP request is significantly smaller than its
corresponding response, and in general web-based activity is heavily biased
toward fat download and thin upload speeds. The term "broadband" is really a
misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very
narrowband of a typical consumer's upload speed.cloud computing, or to be more
accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the
status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing
all things digital "in the cloud", network providers must consider the impact
on them - and the satisfaction of their customer base with performance over

<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak, in his short and information packed REDUNDANT DATA CENTER
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY video, shows why networking as played at the highest
levels is something you want to leave to professionals, like alarge animal
country vetenariandelivering a stuck foal at 2AM on a dark and stormy night.
There are always a lot questions about the black art of building redundant
datacenter networks and there's a shortage of accessible explanations. What I
liked about Ivan's video is how effortlessly he explains the issues and
tradeoffs you can expect in designing your own solution, as well as giving
creative solutions to those problems. A lot of years of experience are boiled
down to a 17 minute video.Ivan begins by showing what a canonical fully
redundant datacenter would look like:It's like an ark where everything goes
two by two. You have two datacenters, each datacenter has redundant core
switches, redundant servers, redundant disk arrays, redundant links between
datacenters (for synchro</p><p>6 0.71084011 <a title="645-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-22-Paper%3A_Revisiting_Network_I-O_APIs%3A_The_netmap_Framework.html">1213 high scalability-2012-03-22-Paper: Revisiting Network I-O APIs: The netmap Framework</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's Tommy Reilly.  We
atNuoDBwere recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google
Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google
Developer Live Session by clickinghere.  In order to access the capabilities
of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General
Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we
demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our
private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million
transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that
NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don't call it a
cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the
faster the database</p><p>same-blog 2 0.92460668 <a title="645-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-30-Hot_New_Trend%3A_Linking_Clouds_Through_Cheap_IP_VPNs_Instead_of_Private_Lines_.html">645 high scalability-2009-06-30-Hot New Trend: Linking Clouds Through Cheap IP VPNs Instead of Private Lines </a></p>
<p>Introduction: You might think major Internet companies have a latency, availability, and
bandwidth advantage because they can afford expensive dedicated point-to-point
private line networks between their data centers. And you would be right. It's
a great advantage. Or it at least it was a great advantage. Cost is the great
equalizer and companies are now scrambling for ways to cut costs. Many of the
most recognizable Internet companies are moving to IP VPNs (Virtual Private
Networks) as a much cheaper alternative to private lines. This is a strategy
you can effectively use too.This trend has historical precedent in the data
center. In the same way leading edge companies moved early to virtualize their
data centers, leading edge companies are now virtualizing their networks using
IP VPNs to build inexpensive private networks over a shared public network. In
kindergarten we learned sharing was polite, it turns out sharing can also save
a lot of money in both the data center and on the network.The line</p><p>3 0.90260541 <a title="645-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-08-Lessons_from_Pownce_-_The_Early_Years.html">116 high scalability-2007-10-08-Lessons from Pownce - The Early Years</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pownce is a new social messaging application competing micromessage to
micromessage with the likes of Twitter and Jaiku. Still in closed beta, Pownce
has generously shared some of what they've learned so far. Like going to a
barrel tasting of a young wine and then tasting the same wine after some
aging, I think what will be really interesting is to follow Pownce and compare
the Pownce of today with the Pownce of tomorrow, after a few years spent in
the barrel. What lessons lie in wait for Pownce as they grow?Site:

<p>Introduction: Update:VcubeV- an OpenVPN-based solution designed to build and operate a
multisourced infrastructure.True high availability requires a presence in
multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation
like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys
can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers. Cloud
computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling
the playing field. Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk
by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost, Mosso and other
providers.The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk
amongst the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy
Samovskiy in his Linux Journal article titledBuilding aMultisourced
Infrastructure Using OpenVPN.breakDmitriy's idea is to create a secure UDP
tunnel between different data centers over public internet links so your

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed

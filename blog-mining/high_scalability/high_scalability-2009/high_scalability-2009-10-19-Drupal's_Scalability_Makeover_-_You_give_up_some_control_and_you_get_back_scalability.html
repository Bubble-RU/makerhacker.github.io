</p><p>3 Drupal is based on an older LAMP stack approach where PHP modules are scooped up and merged together each time a request is made to Drupal. [sent-9, score-0.426]
</p><p>4 Drupal's most intriguing idea is how it is built, expands, and changes byweaving together a single systemout of individual components calledmodules. [sent-10, score-0.118]
</p><p>5 Built-in modules include comments, RSS, contact forms, forums, and Clean URLs. [sent-11, score-0.347]
</p><p>6 Add in modules include things like CSE to add Google's Custom Search Engine, modules to add in AdSense, CAPTCHA, and Sitemaps. [sent-12, score-0.774]
</p><p>7 Drupal establishesAOPextension points that allow modules to work remarkably well together, creating a site that feels like one single site even though it has been constructed from dozens of modules hunted and gathered from all over the digital world. [sent-13, score-0.825]
</p><p>8 Part of Drupal's amazing configurability and extensibility has been how easy it is for everything to work together by changing the database. [sent-15, score-0.221]
</p><p>9 If you have 20 different modules they each can make 20 separate calls to the database when what we really want is one call. [sent-17, score-0.347]
</p><p>10 So we see as Drupal sites grow in the number of modules and the number of users both performance and scalability tank. [sent-19, score-0.408]
</p><p>11 For example, the aggregator in cron when handling several hundred feeds fails, it never finishes. [sent-40, score-0.086]
</p><p>12 Extensive unit tests are being developed to catch bugs. [sent-44, score-0.111]
</p><p>13 Developers of new modules are encouraged to write tests. [sent-46, score-0.389]
</p><p>14 Given that Drupal sites are built from community contributions the new emphasis on unit tests should really help product quality going forward. [sent-51, score-0.172]
</p><p>15 And since the coding practices for modules has changed so much it will be quite a challenge to get all those modules moved to the new way of doing things. [sent-54, score-0.737]
</p><p>16 Without these modules Drupal isn't as attractive an option. [sent-55, score-0.347]

</p><p>19 Compare this approach against all the widgets now available on the Internets. [sent-64, score-0.113]

<p>Introduction: Find out with Builtwith.com. It scans a site and guesses how the site is
built. I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows, PHP, Adsense, RSS,
CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have
guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which
AJAX library is used. Though it's kind of cool to see which sites use PHP and
other technologies.</p><p>5 0.23000635 <a title="724-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-08-scaling_drupal_-_an_open-source_infrastructure_for_high-traffic_drupal_sites.html">146 high scalability-2007-11-08-scaling drupal - an open-source infrastructure for high-traffic drupal sites</a></p>

<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting
HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting
services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary.
Thanks for the thought though.It's been a long long long process. Importing a
largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like
dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the
site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm
betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things.I'll
explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia
that needs to be handled to make the move complete:If you have a user account
and have posted on HighScalability before then you have a user account, but
since I don't know your passwords I had to make new passwords up for you. So

experience of building scalable websites into one place so you can learn how
to build your website with confidence.When it becomes clear you must grow your

<p>Introduction: Hey guys,There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy
vmware...everywhere.I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when
it comes to resources.What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of
using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.Today we get lots
of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well. 40x HP blades,
apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's. (20
servers in 2 datacentres).The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including
the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our
internal networks. This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have
ever lived by while working on the inet. No airgaps from the unknown to the
known!I am interested in feedback on this scenario.From a resource
perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time
due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.Do
you think this is change for ch</p><p>2 0.92753541 <a title="724-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_24%2C_2011.html">1067 high scalability-2011-06-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 24, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Drupal 7 is having a scalability makeover. Karoly Negyesi, Drupal Core
Developer and Public Development Team Lead, explains the process in this
video:Drupal 7 APIs, scalability mindset. Karoly states the general theme of
the changes as:You give up some control and you get back scalability. An
interesting comment on the politics of scalability?Makeover may not be quite
the right word though. A makeover implies a cosmetic change, looking better by
changing the surface. Drupal's changes will go deeper than that, right to
Drupal's core. It's a genuine and authentic change that will hopefully allow
one of the Internet's most venerable Content Management Systems (CMSs) to
compete with a constant stream of younger and sexier models.Drupal is based on
an older LAMP stack approach where PHP modules are scooped up and merged
together each time a request is made to Drupal. Drupal's most intriguing idea
is how it is built, expands, and changes byweaving together a single systemout

<p>Introduction: Jumping around the social mediasphere, it's not uncommon to feel the heat
generated in praise of a favorite this or that over all the clearly inferior
alternatives. Whilst human nature may never cool, I think Old Will had some
insight worth considering the next time a flame threatens to flicker forth:My
mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130)My mistress' eyes are
nothing like the sun;Coral is far more red than her lips' red ;If snow be
white, why then her breasts are dun;If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her
head.I have seen roses damask, red and white,But no such roses see I in her
cheeks;And in some perfumes is there more delightThan in the breath that from
my mistress reeks.I love to hear her speak, yet well I knowThat music hath a
far more pleasing sound;I grant I never saw a goddess go;My mistress, when she
walks, treads on the ground:And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rareAs any
she belied with false compare.-William Shakespeare</p><p>5 0.91148514 <a title="724-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-12-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_12%2C_2013.html">1490 high scalability-2013-07-12-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 12, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding

<p>Introduction: Memcached is one of the most common In-Memory cache implementation.  It was
originally developed by Danga Interactive for LiveJournal, but is now used by
many other sites as a side cache to speed up read mostly operations. It gained
popularity in the non-Java world, too, especially since it's a language-
neutral side cache for which few alternatives existed.  As a side-cache,
Memcache clients relies on the database as the system of record, The database
is still used for write,update and complex query operations.  Since the
memcached specification includes no query operations, memcached is not a
database alternative, unlike most of the NoSQL offerings. It also exclude
memcache from being a real solution for write scalability. As a result of that
many of the heavy sites started to move away from Memcache and replace it with
other NoSQL alternatives as noted in a recent highscalability post MySQL And
Memcached: End Of An Era?The transition away from memcached to NoSQL could

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems
to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly
increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly
using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and
gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous
information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and
ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only
SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it's true that the marketing wave of NoSQL
has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that's been around for quite a
while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all,
everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend
of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very profitable
either.So, what'</p><p>5 0.1656552 <a title="729-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL_and_Memcached%3A_End_of_an_Era%3F.html">785 high scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL and Memcached: End of an Era?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you look at the early days of this blog, when web scalability was still in
its heady bloom of youth, many of the articles had to do with
leveragingMySQLandmemcached. Exciting times. Shard MySQL to handle high write
loads, cache objects in memcached to handle high read loads, and then write a
lot of glue code to make it all work together. That was state of the art, that
was how it was done. The architecture of many major sites still follow this
pattern today, largely because with enough elbow grease, it works.This was a
pre-cloud, relational database dominated world, built from parts scrounged
from the remnants of enterprises and datacenters past.TwitterandDiggstarted in
this era, but are evolving into something different, as scaling pressures
increase and new purpose built technologies pop into being.With a little
perspective, it's clear the MySQL+memcached era is passing. It will stick
around for a while. Old technologies seldom fade away completely. Some still
ride horses. Some st</p><p>6 0.16532423 <a title="729-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Strategy%3A_Drop_Memcached%2C_Add_More_MySQL_Servers.html">367 high scalability-2008-08-17-Strategy: Drop Memcached, Add More MySQL Servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Michael Galpin inCache MoneyandCache Discussionslikes memcached for
it's expiry policy, complex graph data, process data, but says MySQL has many
advantages: SQL, Uniform Data Access, Write-through, Read-through,
Replication, Management, Cold starts, LRU eviction.Update:Dormando asksShould
you use memcached? Should you just shard mysql more?. The idea of caching is
the most important part of caching as it transports you beyond a simple CRUD
worldview. Plan for caching and sharding by properly abstracting data access
methods.Brace for change. Be ready to shard, be ready to cache. React and
change to what you push out which is actually popular, vs over planning and
wasting valuable time.Feedster's Franรงois Schiettecatte wondersifFotolog's 21

clustering solution.I have a database that is mostly varchars and numbers that
doesn't store any binary data at all. It's used at about 70% read and 30%
writes - though we're using memcached at the moment so it's not really hit
that hard.We're currently using mysql with m/cluster, but are interested in a
new solution. Possible candidate so far are unicluster (which doesn't seem
mature yet.) or DRBD.Had anyone had a similar experience and can make any

<p>Introduction: Sean Hallwith some really good MySQL advice: Tune those queries. Biggest bang
for your buck. Enable the slow query log and watch it. Once you've found a
heavy resource intensive query, optimize it! Tune what receives real-world
traffic. Employ Master-Master Replication. Immediately have a read-only slave
for your application to hit as well.Use Your Memory. Set
innodb_buffer_pool_size, key_buffer_size and other key options.RAID Your Disk
I/O. Use RAID 10 mirroring and striping. On EC2 striping across a number of
EBS volumes using the Linux md software raid.Tune Key Parameters. speeds up
inserts & updates with innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2; create a tablespace
and underlying datafile for each table with innodb_file_per_table.Full details

cloud platform are a constant drain of money.Update 4:Caching becomes even
more important inCPU based billing environments. Avoiding the CPU means saving
money.Update 3:An interesting simple example of this idea showed up on the
Google AppEngine list. With one paging algorithm and one use of AJAX the
yearly cost of the site was $1000. By changing those algorithms the site went
under quota and became free again. This will make life a lot more interesting

<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and
there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of
the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet
tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are
Oprah...Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart
Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast"
where traffic peaked at 242Gbps. A variable bitrate scheme was used so
depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as
750Kbps.Dan Rayburn thinksThe big take away from this webcast is that it shows
proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those
who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions
and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.breakTo handle
more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P
streaming, or us</p><p>5 0.9375084 <a title="729-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Product%3A__Hibernate_Shards.html">24 high scalability-2007-07-24-Product:  Hibernate Shards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from
scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.Hibernate Shards
is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by
adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.Hibernate
Shardskey features:Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards
allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love:
SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use
Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards.Flexible sharding
strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of
the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific
logic.Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going
to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one
of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your

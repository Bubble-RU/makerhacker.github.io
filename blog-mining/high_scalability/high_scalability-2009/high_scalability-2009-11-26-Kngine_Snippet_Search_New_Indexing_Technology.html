<p>Introduction: Hi,I want to implement a search engine with lucene.To be scalable, I would
like to execute search jobs asynchronously (with a job queuing system).But i
don't know if it is a good design... Why ?Search results can be large ! (eg:
100+ pages with 25 documents per page)With asynchronous sytem, I need to store
results for each search job.I can set a short expiration time (~5 min) for
each search result, but it's still large.What do you think about it ?Which
design would you use for that ?ThanksMat</p><p>4 0.16554686 <a title="746-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-08-Audiogalaxy.com_Architecture.html">269 high scalability-2008-03-08-Audiogalaxy.com Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3:Always Refer to Your V1 As a Prototype. You really do have to plan to
throw one away.Update 2:Lessons Learned Scaling the Audiogalaxy Search Engine.
Things he should have done and fun things he couldn’t justify
doing.Update:Design details of Audiogalaxy.com’s high performance MySQL search
engine. At peak times, the search engine needed to handle 1500-2000 searches
every second against a MySQL database with about 200 million rows.Search was
one of most interesting problems at Audiogalaxy. It was one of the core
functions of the site, and somewhere between 50 to 70 million searches were
performed every day. At peak times, the search engine needed to handle
1500-2000 searches every second against a MySQL database with about 200
million rows.</p><p>5 0.15768191 <a title="746-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-28-DuckDuckGo_Architecture_-_1_Million_Deep_Searches_a_Day_and_Growing.html">1395 high scalability-2013-01-28-DuckDuckGo Architecture - 1 Million Deep Searches a Day and Growing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an interview with Gabriel Weinberg, founder of Duck Duck Go and
general all around startup guru, on what DDG's architecture looks like in
2012.Innovative search engine upstart DuckDuckGo had30 million searchesin
February 2012 and averages over 1 million searches a day. It's being
positioned bysuper investor Fred Wilsonas a clean, private, impartial and fast
search engine. After talking with Gabriel I like what Fred Wilson said
earlier, it seems closer to the heart of the matter:We invested in DuckDuckGo
for the Reddit, Hacker News anarchists.                  Choosing DuckDuckGo
can be thought of as not just a technical choice, but a vote for revolution.
In an age when knowing your essence is not about about love or friendship, but
about more effectively selling you to advertisers, DDG is positioning
themselves as thedo not track alternative, keepers of theprivacy flame. You
will still be monetized of course, but in a more civilized and anonymous way.

<p>Introduction: I have a table .This table has many columns but search performed based on 1
columns ,this table can have more than million rows.The data in these columns
is something like funny,new york,hollywoodUser can search with parameters as
funny hollywood .I need to take this 2 words and then search on column whether
that column contain this words and how many times .It is not possible to index
here .If the results return say 1200 results then without comparing each and
every column i can't determine no of results.I need to compare for each and
every column.This query is very frequent .How can i approach for this
problem.What type of architecture,tools is helpful.I just know that this can
be accomplished with distributed system but how can i make this system. I also
see in this website that LinkedIn uses Lucene for search .Is Lucene is helpful
in my case.My table has also lots of insertion ,however updation in not very
frequent.</p><p>5 0.76920187 <a title="746-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-12-Search_the_tags_across_all_post.html">246 high scalability-2008-02-12-Search the tags across all post</a></p>

have to search through all the records in table and find post which contain
tags entered by user .user can enter more than 1 keywords.What strategy

<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw
up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK. If they're outside the
UK but have decent support then also include. The service must be cheap and
not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it
shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered
whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK
compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a
small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space. Would S3 be a good
starting point? What is the service like? I hear mixed reviews about it.Many
thanks,Jim</p><p>same-blog 2 0.99191093 <a title="746-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

take you in small trip in Snippet Search research project at Kngine. What is

Web Search Engine's is the Web getaway, especially to get specific
information. But unfortunately the search engines didn't changed mush as the

<p>Introduction: All,I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for
sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and
other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers.
I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.Could anyone share
their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube
etc..?Thank you,Regards,Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>4 0.98195863 <a title="746-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to
start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their
application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I
am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I
plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need
to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure
and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the
application that will become critical over time.</p><p>5 0.97809052 <a title="746-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>6 0.97628403 <a title="746-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy%3A_Put_Mobile_Video_Into_Cold_Storage_After_30_Days.html">1201 high scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy: Put Mobile Video Into Cold Storage After 30 Days</a></p>

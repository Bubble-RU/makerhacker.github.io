<p>Introduction: It seems that HTTP calls have become a default way to think about distributed
systems. HTTP and Web services definitely have a lot to offer, but they are
not the only way to do things and there are definitely cases where web is not
the right choice. Unfortunately, lots of people just stick with web services
and hack on, trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. In cases such as
these, a different distribution paradigm can save us quite a lot of time and
effort both in development and later in maintenance. One of those different
paradigms is messaging.</p><p>6 0.14627559 <a title="641-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff_to_Watch_from_Google_IO_2011.html">1055 high scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff to Watch from Google IO 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With theGoogle IO Developer Conferencecompleted there aredozens and dozensof
information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty
free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos
available so quickly after the conference. Let's say you don't want to watch
all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen
scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:App
Engine Backends by Justin Haugh, Greg Darke. One of this biggest complaints
about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new
Backend node.Scaling App Engine Applicationsby Justin Haugh, Guido van Rossum.
Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make
it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000
queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good
discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides when to spawn
instances;</p><p>3 0.69368756 <a title="641-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-21-Google_AppEngine_-_A_Second_Look.html">517 high scalability-2009-02-21-Google AppEngine - A Second Look</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look
around their documentation and seeing what stands out for me. It's not the
much speculatedsuper cluster VM. AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and
structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran awebsite out of S3with a
splash ofHerokuthrown in as a chaser.The idea is clearly to take advantage of
ourmassive multi-core futureby creating a shared nothing infrastructure based
firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU
services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage:
email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps. A shared nothing
request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures
must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google
is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy
creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build on. Now they
have their script</p><p>5 0.66113353 <a title="641-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-07-What_Google_App_Engine_Price_Changes_Say_About_the_Future_of_Web_Architecture.html">1112 high scalability-2011-09-07-What Google App Engine Price Changes Say About the Future of Web Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Google App Engine (GAE) is focused on making development easy, but limits your
options. Amazon Web Services is focused on making development flexible, but
complicates the development process. Real enterprise applications require both
of these paradigms to achieve successâ&euro;Ś What we really want is the flexibility
of AWS and the simplicity of GAE.For the rest of the post see

What do you think about the future of similar solutions? Is Amazon EC2 and S3
ready for video streaming?I have found threads on their forums related to the
performance, scalability and high availability of the hosted streaming
solution. How would you make it scalable? Is it really cheaper than
traditional hosting?Looking forward to your thoughts!</p><p>3 0.87970769 <a title="641-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-26-Scale-up_vs._Scale-out%3A_A_Case_Study_by_IBM_using_Nutch-Lucene.html">583 high scalability-2009-04-26-Scale-up vs. Scale-out: A Case Study by IBM using Nutch-Lucene</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scale-up solutions in the form of large SMPs have represented the mainstream
of commercial computing for the past several years. The major server vendors
continue to provide increasingly larger and more powerful machines. More
recently, scale-out solutions, in the form of clusters of smaller machines,
have gained increased acceptance for commercial computing.Scale-out solutions
are particularly effective in high-throughput web-centric applications.In this
paper, we investigate the behavior of two competing approaches to parallelism,
scale-up and scale-out, in an emerging search application. Our conclusions
show that a scale-out strategy can be the key to good performance even on a
scale-up machine.Furthermore, scale-out solutions offer better
price/performance, although at an increase in management complexity.Read more
about scaling out/up and about the conclusions here (PDF - you can also
download it)</p><p>4 0.84600282 <a title="641-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-02-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_2%2C_2011.html">1150 high scalability-2011-12-02-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 2, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle
traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch
or other very popular websites frontpage).Regular hosting companies
(especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get
crushed under the load in short time.But there is hope. A new breed of hosting
companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability
you need at a fraction of the cost.Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!”
(or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same
thing).Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting
companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of
them).Read the entire article aboutCloud computing, grid computing, utility

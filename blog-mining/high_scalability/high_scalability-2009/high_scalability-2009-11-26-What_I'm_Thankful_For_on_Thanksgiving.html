<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO of  Parallel Universe , a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time applications. 
 
A little over a month ago, we open-sourced a new in-memory data grid called  Galaxy . An in-memory data grid, or IMDG, is a clustered data storage and processing middleware that uses RAM as the authoritative and primary storage, and distributes data over a cluster for purposes of data and processing scalability and high-availability. A common feature of IMDGs is co-location of code and data, meaning that application code runs on all cluster nodes, each instance processing those data items residing in the local node's RAM.
 
While quite a few commercial and open-source IMDGs are available (like Terracotta, Gigaspaces, Oracle Coherence, GemFire, Websphere eXtreme Scale, Infinispan and Hazelcast), Galaxy has adopted a completely different architecture from all other IMDGs, to service some usage scenarios ill-fitted to the othe</p><p>6 0.066555291 <a title="747-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-15-Web_Analytics%3A_An_Hour_a_Day.html">14 high scalability-2007-07-15-Web Analytics: An Hour a Day</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joel Spolsky and Jeff   Atwood are  raising VC money  for    StackOverflow.  This is interesting for three reasons: 1) Joel has always seemed like a keep it small and grow organically type of guy, so this is a big step in a different direction. 2) It means they think there's a very big market in the Q&A; space and they mean to capture as much as the market as possible. 3) Most importantly for this blog, Joel gives some good advice on when to stay fresh and local and when it's time to jump for the brass ring, scale up your ambition, and go for VC money. Please see  Joel's blog  post for the details, but here's when to go VC:
  
 There’s a land grab going on. 
 There is a provable concept that’s repeatable. 
 The business itself could benefit from the publicity. 
 The investor will add substantial value to the business. 
 The business can potentially have a big exit or become a large, publically traded company. 
 The founders are not in it for their own personal aggrandizement.

<p>Introduction: There was a bit of drama earlier when I posted a free job opening for Zynga. It caused unfortunate and just plain wrong accusations. It also caused a number of requests for more free job posts, which I should have anticipated, but obviously I can't let this blog become cluttered with that kind of stuff. Earlier I tried a job board type service, but that never really worked out. So what to do? Someone suggested a sponsored post approach and I think that's a good compromise. It minimizes the noise, let's people know about work, and brings in a little revenue. It works like an advertisement. If you are interested please let me know. When we have any job openings there will be a sponsored post like this one, that you can easily ignore or pay attention to, depending on your situation.

My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.   The trip was more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system, listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of fellow riders. Magical.

<p>Introduction: This is an all time favorite post. Even though I've seen this video a hundred times I still can't help but laugh... 
 
This is so funny I laughed until I cried! Definitely NSFW. OMG it's hilarious, but it's also not a bad overview of the issues. Especially loved:  You read the latest post on HighScalability.com and think you are a f*cking Google and architect and parrot slogans like Web Scale and Sharding but you have no idea what the f*ck you are talking about . There are so many more gems like that.

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be thankful for the  song  of the tinniest  sparrow  at  sunrise , I'll save you from all that. It's hard to tie scalability and the  giving of thanks  together, especially as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of time. But I think I found a sentiment in  A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and MIRACLES  by  James Bridle  that manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving thanks meaningfully together:
  

I distrust commercial definitions of innovation, and particularly of awesomeness. It’s an overused term. When I think of awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.


  So I started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.  


     


We’re not actually very good about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use metaphors and examples.

<p>Introduction: Deferred Deletes  is a technique where deleted items  are marked as deleted but not garbage collected until some days or  preferably weeks later .    James Hamilton talks describes this strategy in his classic  On Designing and Deploying  Internet-Scale Services: 
  

Never delete anything. Just mark it deleted. When new data comes in, record the requests on the way. Keep a rolling two week (or more) history of all changes to help recover from software or administrative errors. If someone makes a mistake and forgets the where clause on a delete statement (it has happened before and it will again), all logical copies of the data are deleted. Neither RAID nor mirroring can protect against this form of error. The ability to recover the data can make the difference between a highly embarrassing issue or a minor, barely noticeable glitch. For those systems already doing off-line backups, this additional record of data coming into the service only needs to be since the last backup. But, bein</p><p>6 0.70706433 <a title="747-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-16-Scaling_Traffic%3A_People_Pod_Pool_of_On_Demand_Self_Driving_Robotic_Cars_who_Automatically_Refuel_from_Cheap_Solar.html">657 high scalability-2009-07-16-Scaling Traffic: People Pod Pool of On Demand Self Driving Robotic Cars who Automatically Refuel from Cheap Solar</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things).
That's why scaling Facebook is hardsays Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of
Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and
Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why
would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional
web sites? Let's find out.Traditional websites are easier to scale than social
networking sites for two reasons:They usually access only their own data and
common cached data.Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one
time.Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your
profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the
website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around
single records usingdistributed hashing schemes. And since only a few percent
of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little RAM cache
to handle a</p><p>5 0.098469608 <a title="723-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-12-Report_from_OpenSocial_Meetup_at_Google.html">183 high scalability-2007-12-12-Report from OpenSocial Meetup at Google</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I had a false beliefI thought I came here to stayWe're all just visitingAll
just breaking like wavesThe oceans made me, but who came up with me?Push me,
pull me, push me, or pull me out .So true Perl Jam(Push me Pull me lyrics), so
true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes.
Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from
servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.breakTo pull
events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server.
This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a
list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has
changed and makes those changes available to you. Knowing what has changed can
be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very
complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state
on what I client still needs to see.Polling is heavy man. Imagine all your

<p>Introduction: We saw in Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale? scaling social
networks is a lot harder than you might think. This paper,Scaling Online
Social Networks without Pains, from a team at Telefonica Research in Spain
hopes to meet the challenge of status distribution, user generated content
distribution, and managing the social graph through a technique they callOne-
Hop Replication (OHR). OHRabstracts and delegates the complexity of scaling up
from the social network application. The abstract:Online Social Networks (OSN)
face serious scalability challenges due to their rapid growth and popularity.
To address this issue we present a novel approach to scale up OSN called One
Hop Replication (OHR). Our system combines partitioning and replication in a
middleware to transparently scale up a centralized OSN design, and therefore,
avoid the OSN application to undergo the costly transition to a fully
distributed system to meet its scalability needs. OHR exploits some of the

<p>Introduction: It is widely recognized that MySQL is the most popular database software in
the world. Since its inception in 1995, there have been 11 million product
installations around the world in a wide variety of markets. There are more
installations of MySQL in use today than any other database architecture. From
startup companies hoping to be the next Web2.0 poster child to large global
enterprises, the MySQL database architecture has proven to be flexible,
extendable, scalable, and more than capable of filling high-capacity database
roles in very different venues.</p><p>4 0.99522573 <a title="723-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-08-Eight_Best_Practices_for_Building_Scalable_Systems.html">594 high scalability-2009-05-08-Eight Best Practices for Building Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wille Faler hascreated an excellent list of best practicesfor building
scalable and high performance systems. Here's a short summary of his
points:Offload the database- Avoid hitting the database, and avoid opening
transactions or connections unless you absolutely need to use them.What a
difference a cache makes- For read heavy applications caching is the easiest
way offload the database.Cache as coarse-grained objects as possible- Coarse-
grained objects save CPU and time by requiring fewer reads to assemble
objects.Don't store transient state permanently- Is it really necessary to
store your transient data in the database?Location, Location- put things close
to where they are supposed to be delivered.Constrain concurrent access to
limited resource- it's quicker to let a single thread do work and finish
rather than flooding finite resources with 200 client threads.Staged,
asynchronous processing- separate a process using asynchronicity into separate
steps mediated by queues and execut</p><p>5 0.99281031 <a title="723-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers
podcastShow 15 - Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls. The
conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can
be processed by a WAF (Web Application Firewall), which inspects HTTP for
security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much
was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be
necessary, but I digress.Toterminate SSLmost shops run SSL connections into
Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for
developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of
the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.Load
balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very
efficiently in hardware. Efficiently enough that if you are willing to get rid
of the general purpose Linux boxes and use your big iron load balancers, your
server count can be decreased</p><p>6 0.99256867 <a title="723-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-30-More_Troubles_with_Caching.html">911 high scalability-2010-09-30-More Troubles with Caching</a></p>

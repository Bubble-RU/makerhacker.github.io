  Introduction  
Hypertable and HBase are both open source, scalable databases modeled after Google's proprietary Bigtable database.  The primary difference between the two systems is that Hypertable is written in C++, while HBase is written in Java.  We modeled this test after the one described in section 7 of the  Bigtable paper  and tuned both systems fo</p><p>3 0.17295788 <a title="647-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Product%3A_Hbase.html">650 high scalability-2009-07-02-Product: Hbase</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3:  Presentation from the  NoSQL Conference :  slides ,  video .  Update 2:  Jim Wilson helps with the  Understanding HBase and BigTable  by explaining them from a "conceptual standpoint."  Update:  InfoQ interview:  HBase Leads Discuss Hadoop, BigTable and Distributed Databases . "MapReduce (both Google's and Hadoop's) is ideal for processing huge amounts of data with sizes that would not fit in a traditional database. Neither is appropriate for transaction/single request processing."   Hbase  is the open source answer to BigTable, Google's highly scalable distributed database.  It is built on top of Hadoop ( product ), which implements functionality similar to Google's GFS and Map/Reduce systems.Â 
 
Both Google's GFS and Hadoop's HDFS provide a mechanism to reliably store large amounts of data.

 Notable Tweets:     
 
  Aaron Cordova  -  scalability means "can change size" and also "works at large sizes" - this conflates two orthogonal features of cloud computing.   
  Jaime Garcia Reinoso  - I t's the scalability, stupid!   
  Alex Averbuch   - when I read/hear "unlimited/inifinite scalability" I stop reading/listening and start thinking about cake.  
  Dennis Clark   - I used to smirk at developers whose main DB experience was in MUMPS or Pick, until I realized those are old-school  #NoSQL  engines.

<p>Introduction: So much good stuff this week...
  
 Adrian Cockcroft  Compares NoSQL Availability Models .  Let's risk feeding the CAP trolls, and try to get some insight into the differences between the many NoSQL contenders . Adrian asks how each NoSQL product will add a movie to its favorites list, read it back, and how this works across availability zones. Much trickier than it sounds with multiple writers. Cassandra and MongoDB answer back.

  @jerng : Reading up on scalability. WHY THE HELL FOR? Because I want to know the future. 
  @freerangedata : The #nosql options are the micro brews/craft beers of data stores. So many good ones, so little time to try them all. 
  @edward_ribeiro : Soon, Darwinism will start to play its role on #NoSQL systems. You know, only the fittest will survive.

<p>Introduction: Cosmin Lehene ﻿wrote two excellent articles on Adobe's experiences with HBase:  Why we’re using HBase: Part 1   and  Why we’re using HBase: Part 2 . Adobe needed a  generic,   real-time, structured data storage and processing system that could handle any data volume, with access times under 50ms, with no downtime and   no data loss . The article goes into great detail about their experiences with HBase and their evaluation process, providing a "well reasoned impartial use case from a commercial user". It talks about failure handling, availability, write performance, read performance, random reads, sequential scans, and consistency. 
 
One of the knocks against HBase has been it's complexity, as it has many parts that need installation and configuration. All is not lost according to the Adobe team:
  

HBase is more complex than other systems (you need Hadoop, Zookeeper, cluster machines have multiple roles). We believe that for HBase, this is not accidental complexity and that the argu</p><p>4 0.67741716 <a title="647-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Product%3A_Hbase.html">650 high scalability-2009-07-02-Product: Hbase</a></p>

<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a new  Social Inbox  integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer in  The Underlying Technology of Messages :  HBase . HBase beat out MySQL, Cassandra, and a few others.
 
Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time Messages product. Facebook also has an extensive  MySQL infrastructure , but they found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could have built their own, but they chose HBase.
 
HBase is a   scaleout table store supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data  . Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system. HBase is also a colu</p><p>6 0.5682534 <a title="647-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-19-Hadoop_Getting_Closer_to_1.0_Release.html">254 high scalability-2008-02-19-Hadoop Getting Closer to 1.0 Release</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 3 : Presentation from the  NoSQL conference :  slides ,  video 1 ,  video 2 .
 
 Update 2 : The folks at Hypertable would like you to know that  Hypertable is now officially  sponsored by Baidu , China’s Leading Search Engine.  As a sponsor of Hypertable, Baidu has committed an industrious team of engineers, numerous servers, and support resources to improve the quality and development of the open source technology. 
 
 Update : InfoQ interview on  Hypertable Lead Discusses Hadoop and Distributed Databases . Hypertable differs from HBase in that it is a higher performance implementation of Bigtable.
 
 Skrentablog  gives the heads up on  Hypertable ,  Zvents'  open-source BigTable clone. It's written in C++ and can run on top of either HDFS or KFS. Performance looks encouraging at  28M rows of data inserted at a per-node write rate of 7mb/sec .</p><p>2 0.82878315 <a title="647-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-26-Finding_an_excellent_LAMP_developer.html">193 high scalability-2007-12-26-Finding an excellent LAMP developer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi...      I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am building it!  So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking, architecture planning, everything.  I haven't even gotten into the legal aspects yet.......     It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to handle that end of the operation.  I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best.  I'd like to FIND that very best person available, to handle the technical aspects.  For worse or better, I don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.     I've posted a bazillion ads on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses.  I've put out feelers among my own network, same result.  Not sure what else I can do.  Shoestring budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning.  That can actually be a plus, as it forces people to focus.     Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the right person?     Thanks   Jason</p><p>3 0.7326026 <a title="647-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-17-Database_People_Hating_on_MapReduce.html">216 high scalability-2008-01-17-Database People Hating on MapReduce</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a  guest repost  by  Sriram Devadas , Engineer at Vistaprint, Web platform group. A fun and well written analogy of how to scale web applications using a familiar coffee shop as an example. No coffee was harmed during the making of this post. 
 
I own a small coffee shop.   My expense is proportional to resources  100 square feet of built up area with utilities, 1 barista, 1 cup coffee maker.   My shop's capacity  Serves 1 customer at a time, takes 3 minutes to brew a cup of coffee, a total of 5 minutes to serve a customer.   Since my barista works without breaks and the German made coffee maker never breaks down,  my shop's maximum throughput = 12 customers per hour.
       
 
  Web server  
Customers walk away during peak hours. We only serve one customer at a time. There is no space to wait.   I upgrade shop. My new setup is better!   Expenses  Same area and utilities, 3 baristas, 2 cup coffee maker, 2 chairs   Capacity  3 minutes to brew 2 cups of coffee, ~7 minutes to serv</p><p>5 0.64689016 <a title="647-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff_the_Internet_Says_on_Scalability_For_November_12th%2C_2010.html">940 high scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff the Internet Says on Scalability For November 12th, 2010</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:     
 
  @jkalucki : Getting just 100 servers to work together for the first time is so ridiculously complicated. Horizontal scaling doesn't scale.

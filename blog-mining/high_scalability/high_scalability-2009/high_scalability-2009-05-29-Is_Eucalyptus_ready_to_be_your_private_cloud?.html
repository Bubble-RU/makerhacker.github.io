</p><p>6 The question I had going into the meetup was:  should Eucalyptus be used to make an organization's private cloud? [sent-12, score-0.125]
</p><p>7 The project is of high quality, the people are of the highest quality, but in the end Eucalyptus is a research project from a university. [sent-15, score-0.202]
</p><p>8 As an academic project Eucalyptus is subject to changes in funding and the research interests of the team. [sent-16, score-0.263]
</p><p>9 If the team finds another research area more interesting, or if they get tired of chasing a continuous stream of new Amazon features, or no new grad students sign on, which will happen in a few years, then the project goes dark. [sent-18, score-0.177]
</p><p>10 Fears over continuity have at least two solutions: community support and commercial support. [sent-19, score-0.137]
</p><p>11 This is unlikely to happen though as it conflicts with the research intent of Eucalyptus. [sent-21, score-0.118]
</p><p>12 The Eucalyptus team plans to control the core for research purposes and encourage external development of add-on service like SQS. [sent-22, score-0.158]
</p><p>13 Eucalyptus won't go commercial as University projects must stay clear from commercial pretensions. [sent-23, score-0.196]
</p><p>14 Amazon is "no comment" on Eucalyptus so it's not clear what they would think of commercial development should it occur. [sent-24, score-0.133]
</p><p>15 Taken together these concerns imply Eucalyptus is not a good base for an enterprise quality private cloud. [sent-25, score-0.225]
</p><p>16 And some will certainly base their private cloud on Eucalyptus, but when making a decision of this type you have to be sure your cloud infrastructure will be around for the long haul. [sent-30, score-0.403]
</p><p>17 Eucalyptus is still a good choice for it's original research purpose, or as cheap staging platform for Amazon, or as base for temporary clouds, but as your rock solid private cloud infrastructure of the future Eucalyptus isn't the answer. [sent-32, score-0.354]
</p><p>18 It was never meant to be our little untethered private Amazon cloud. [sent-35, score-0.162]
</p><p>19 Eucalyptus plans to make more invasive and more scalable options available in the future. [sent-67, score-0.074]
</p><p>20 Rich actually makes a convincing argument that grids and clouds are different and do require a completely different infrastructure. [sent-75, score-0.083]

Two reasons why Eucalyptus is potentially important: private clouds and cloud portability:
   
  Private clouds . Let's say you want a cloud like infrastructure for architectural purposes but you want it to run on your own hardware in your own secure environment. How would you do this today? Hm....   Cloud portability . With the number of cloud offerings increasing how can you maintain some level of vendor neutrality among this "swarm" of different options?

<p>Introduction: Adrian Cockcroft on the future of    Cloud, Open Source, SaaS and the End of Enterprise Computing   :  
  
   Most big enterprise companies are actively working on their AWS rollout now. Most of them are also trying to get an in-house cloud to work, with varying amounts of success, but even the best private clouds are still years behind the feature set of public clouds, which is has a big impact on the agility and speed of product development  

    While the    Snowden revelations    have tattered the thin veil of trust secreting Big Brother from We the People, they may also be driving a fascinating new tension in architecture choices between Cloud Native (scale-out, IaaS), Amazon Native (rich service dependencies), and Enterprise Native (raw hardware, scale-up). 
   This tension became evident in a recent    HipChat interview    where HipChat, makers of an AWS based SaaS chat product, were busy creating an on-premises version of their product that could operate behind the firewall in</p><p>5 0.73127627 <a title="610-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-30-Scalability_Perspectives_%235%3A_Werner_Vogels_%E2%80%93_The_Amazon_Technology_Platform.html">480 high scalability-2008-12-30-Scalability Perspectives #5: Werner Vogels – The Amazon Technology Platform</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: :  Eucalyptus Goes Commercial with $5.5M Funding Round .  This removes my objection that it's an academic project only. Go team go!   Rich Wolski , professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, gave a spirited talk on  Eucalyptus  to a large group of very interested cloudsters at the  Eucalyptus Cloud Meetup . If Rich could teach computer science at every school the state of the computer science industry would be stratospheric. Rich is dynamic, smart, passionate, and visionary. It's that vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement Eucalyptus and have been improving it and tracking Amazon's changes ever since.

<p>Introduction: Twitter Sees Its 20 Billionth Tweet  writes  Marshall Kirkpatrick of ReadWriteWeb. 
  Startups die for not having customers, so STOP thinking about how to scale . Alessandro Orsi says  focusing on the architecture and scaling possibilities of your app for millions of users is just plain dumb...concentrate on marketing...concentrate on user experience . Alessandro is perfectly correct, but this isn't the year the 2000 when the default architecture that is easy is also not scalable and when sites were built from scratch one painful user at a time.  Today neither is tue. In the era of social networks, where Facebook has 500 million users, successful applications can and often do spike to millions of users seemingly overnight. And you have to have some architecture. With today's tool-chains you don't have to choose easy and non-scalable. There are other options. Of course, it's all pointless without customers and that is what you need to worry about, but it's a false choice in this era to</p><p>3 0.87669331 <a title="610-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-31-Need_help_on_Site_loading_%26_database_optimization_-_URGENT.html">611 high scalability-2009-05-31-Need help on Site loading & database optimization - URGENT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,  I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was taking too much load.  There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain PHP/HTML coding is used.

<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems Laboratories     * The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the high-tech industry.   * The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome of the evolution of these games.    * Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.    * The game server is used both to discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating (by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the server component.   * Using multiple servers is a basic mecha</p><p>5 0.87268913 <a title="610-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-13-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_Aug_13%2C_2010.html">880 high scalability-2010-08-13-Hot Scalability Links for Aug 13, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ezra Zygmuntowicz in a heart warming account of his      4 Years at Engine Yard   , has concluded in his experience that:  the true future of cloud computing for developers is to not think about servers at all. It is now time to focus on the Application and new levels of abstraction that allow folks to use the computing resources in easier and easier ways.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Nice explanation in  The importance of bandwidth versus latency  of how long latencies cause cascading delays in resource loading.  Doloto  tries to optimize how resources are loaded.   Twenty new rules  have been added to the  original 14 rules  for sizzling web performance. Part of scalability is worrying about performance too. The front-end is where 80-90% of end-user response time is spent and following these best practices improved the performance of Yahoo! properties by 25-50%. The rules are divided into server, content, cookie, JavaScript, CSS, images, and mobile categories. The new rules are:
  Flush the buffer early  	[server]    Use GET for AJAX requests 	[server]    Post-load components 	[content]    Preload components 	[content]    Reduce the number of DOM elements 	[content]    Split components across domains 	[content]    Minimize the number of iframes 	[content]    No 404s 	[content]    Reduce cookie size 	[cookie]    Use cookie-free domains for components 	[coo</p><p>6 0.12317432 <a title="585-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-Art_of_Distributed.html">590 high scalability-2009-05-06-Art of Distributed</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across data centers,  then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What is  ChironFS  and how does it work?
 
Adapted from the ChironFS website:   The Chiron Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not FILESYSTEMS.  Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become a real nightmare!</p><p>5 0.60291255 <a title="585-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-12-P2P_server_technology%3F.html">598 high scalability-2009-05-12-P2P server technology?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,     Some time ago , martin fowler bloged about how HTTP cache headers can be very effectively used in web site design.   http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/SegmentationByFreshness.html     How actively HTTP cache headers are considered in web site design? I think it is a great tool to reduce lot of load on server and should be considered before designing any complex caching strategy. Thoughts?

<p>Introduction: Why is there something rather than nothing? That's the kind of question the  Large Hadron Collider  in CERN is hopefully poised to answer. And what is the output of this beautiful 17-mile long,  6 billion  dollar  wabi-sabish  proton smashing machine? Data. Great heaping torrents of Grand Canyon sized data. 15 million gigabytes every year. That's 1000 times the information printed in books every year. It's so much data 10,000 scientists will use a  grid  of  80,000+ computers , in 300 computer centers , in 50 different countries just to help make sense of it all.
 
How will all this data be collected, transported, stored, and analyzed? It turns out, using what amounts to sort of Internet of Particles instead of an Internet of Things.

<p>Introduction: You're Doing it Wrong  by Poul-Henning Kamp. Don't look so guilty, he's not talking about you know what, he's talking about writing high-performance server programs:  Not just wrong as in not perfect, but wrong as in wasting half, or more, of your performance. What good is an  O(log2(n))  algorithm if those operations cause page faults and slow disk operations? For most relevant datasets an  O(n)  or even an  O(n^2)  algorithm, which avoids page faults, will run circles around it.   
  A Microsoft Windows Azure primer: the basics  by Peter Bright. Nice article explaining the basics of Azure and how it compares to Google and Amazon. 
 A call to change the name from  NoSQL to Postmodern Databases . Interesting idea, but the problem is the same one I have for Postmodern Art, when is it? I always feel like I'm in the post-post modern period, yet for art it's really in the early 1900s. Let's save future developers from this existential time crisis.

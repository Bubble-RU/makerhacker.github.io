<p>Introduction: Memcached is one of the most common In-Memory cache implementation.  It was
originally developed by Danga Interactive for LiveJournal, but is now used by
many other sites as a side cache to speed up read mostly operations. It gained
popularity in the non-Java world, too, especially since it's a language-
neutral side cache for which few alternatives existed.  As a side-cache,
Memcache clients relies on the database as the system of record, The database
is still used for write,update and complex query operations.  Since the
memcached specification includes no query operations, memcached is not a
database alternative, unlike most of the NoSQL offerings. It also exclude
memcache from being a real solution for write scalability. As a result of that
many of the heavy sites started to move away from Memcache and replace it with
other NoSQL alternatives as noted in a recent highscalability post MySQL And
Memcached: End Of An Era?The transition away from memcached to NoSQL could

<p>Introduction: Hi,I am building a video-sharing site and I'm looking for an efficient way to
update video views count.The easiest way would be to perform an SQL update to
increase the "views" counter every time a video is viewed, but naturally I
want to avoid DB write access as much as possible.I am looking for an
efficient temporary storage to which I could connect and say "increment views
of video X". Every so often I would save the changes to my main database, and
remove the counter from this temporary storage.I am having a hard time finding
such temporary storage, however. My first thought was memcache, but it's not
ideal as I wouldn't like to lose the data if memcache goes down. Also,
memcache's increment command requires that the key is already present - that
means that every time a video is viewed, I would have to check if the key
already exists in memcache, before I can actually send the increment
command.What do people use to solve this kind of issues?Kind regards,Tomasz</p><p>4 0.14652771 <a title="482-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-27-Use_Instance_Caches_to_Save_Money%3A_Latency_%3D%3D_%24%24%24.html">1126 high scalability-2011-09-27-Use Instance Caches to Save Money: Latency == $$$</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the post Using memcache might be free, but it's costing you money with
instance pricing! Use instance caches if possible made on the Google App
Engine group, Santiago Lema brings up an oldie but a goody of an idea that was
once used to improve performance, but now it's used to save money:Santiago's
GAE application went from about $9 to about $177 per month. Memcache is slow
enough that under higher loads extra instances are created by the scheduler to
handle the load.For static or semi-static data, a way around the cost of the
extra instances, is to keep a cache in the instance so requests can be served
out of local memory rather than going to memcache or the database. A simple
hashtable makes a good in-memory cache.This solution made his app affordable
again by reducing the number of instances back to 1 (sometimes 2).Where have
we seen this before?This is a variant of the old Sticky Session idea where web
sessions are stored in RAM in an application server and all further
interacti</p><p>5 0.14364046 <a title="482-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-10-31-15_Ways_to_Make_Your_Application_Feel_More_Responsive_under_Google_App_Engine.html">1135 high scalability-2011-10-31-15 Ways to Make Your Application Feel More Responsive under Google App Engine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Small Imrovements, makers of a hosted, lightweight feedback platform, have
written an excellent article on Performance issues on GAE, and how we resolved
them. They show how they trimmed most of their requests to between 300ms and
800ms, some still take 2 seconds when memcache is stale, and others clock in
at 150ms. Notzippy overall, but acceptable, especially if you really like
GAE's PaaS promise.What's tricky with PaaS is if your performance is poor,
there's often not a lot you can do about it. But the folks at Small
Improvements have been clever and diligent, giving many specific details and
timings. Though their advice is specifically for GAE, it will apply to a lot
of different situations as well.Here are the 15 ways they made small
performance improvements: Understand App Engine has bad days. App Engine can
have bad days where performance can degrade. Your design needs to take this
potential for high latency variability into account. Don't always assume the
best case.Always prefe</p><p>6 0.14216456 <a title="482-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling_Pinterest_-_From_0_to_10s_of_Billions_of_Page_Views_a_Month_in_Two_Years.html">1440 high scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling Pinterest - From 0 to 10s of Billions of Page Views a Month in Two Years</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My first post, please be gentle. I know it is long. You are all like doctors -
the more info, the better the diagnosis.-----------What is the best way to
store a list of all of your friends in the memcached cache (a simple boolean
saying “yes this user is your friend”, or “no”)? Think Robert Scoble (26,000+
“friends”) on Twitter.com. He views a list of ALL existing users, and in this
list, his friends are highlighted.I came up with 4 possible methods:--store in
memcache as an array, a list of all the "yes" friend ID's--store your friend
ID's as individual elements.--store as a hash of arrays based on last 3 digits
of friend's ID -- so have up to 1000 arrays for you.--comma-delimited string
of ID's as one elementI'm using the second one because I think it is faster to
update. The single array or hash of arrays feels like too much overhead
calculating and updating – and even just loading – to check for existence of a
friend.The key is FRIEND[small ID#]_[big ID#]. The value is 1.This way</p><p>3 0.63511497 <a title="482-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-17-Scaling_Django_Web_Apps_by_Mike_Malone.html">602 high scalability-2009-05-17-Scaling Django Web Apps by Mike Malone</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a

<p>Introduction: Recently I attended a lecture presented by Manik Surtani , JBoss Cache &
Infinispan project lead. The goal of the talk was to provide a technical
overview of both products and outline Infinispan's road-map. Infinispan is the
successor to the open-source JBoss Cache. JBoss Cache was originally targeted
at simple web page caching and Infinispan builds on this to take it into the
Cloud paradigm.Why did I attend? Well, over the past few years I have worked
on projects that have used commercial distributed caching (aka data grid)
technologies such as GemFire, GigaSpaces XAP or Oracle Coherence . These
projects required more functionality than is currently provided by open-source
solutions such as memcached or EHCache. Looking at the road-map for
Infinispan, I was struck by its ambition - will it provide the functionality
that I need?Read more at:http://bigdatamatters.com/bigdatamatters/2009/09

<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog
PileEffectinDog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails. Glenn
Franxman also has a Django solution inMintCache.Data is usually cached because
it's too expensive to calculate for every hit. Maybe it's a gnarly SQL query

<p>Introduction: I have introduced pattern languages in my earlier post onThe Pattern Bible for
Distributed Computing.Achieving highest possible scalability is a complex
combination of many factors. This PLoP 2007paperpresents a pattern language
that can be used to make a system highly scalable.The Scalability Pattern
Language introduced by Kanwardeep Singh Ahluwalia includes patterns
to:Introduce ScalabilityOptimize AlgorithmAdd HardwareAdd ParallelismAdd

<p>Introduction: 3PAR Remote Copyis a uniquely simple and efficient replication technology that
allows customers to protect and share any application data affordably. Built
upon 3PAR Thin Copy technology, Remote Copy lowers the total cost of storage
by addressing the cost and complexity of remote replication.Common Uses of
3PAR Remote Copy:Affordable Disaster Recovery: Mirror data cost-effectively
across town or across the world.Centralized Archive: Replicate data from
multiple 3PAR InServs located in multiple data centers to a centralized data
archive location.Resilient Pod Architecture: Mutually replicate tier 1 or 2
data to tier 3 capacity between two InServs (application pods).Remote Data
Access: Replicate data to a remote location for sharing of data with remote
users.</p><p>4 0.87324417 <a title="482-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-07-It%27s_a_VM_Wasteland_-_A_Near_Optimal_Packing_of_VMs_to_Machines_Reduces_TCO_by_22%25.html">1419 high scalability-2013-03-07-It's a VM Wasteland - A Near Optimal Packing of VMs to Machines Reduces TCO by 22%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>5 0.86402446 <a title="482-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-17-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_17%2C_2010.html">860 high scalability-2010-07-17-Hot Scalability Links for July 17, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: And by hot I also mean temperature. Summer has arrived. It's sizzling here in
Silicon Valley. Thank you air conditioning!Scale the web by appointing a
Crawler Czar? Tom Foremski has the idea thatGoogle should open up their
indexso sites wouldn't have to endure the constant pounding by ravenous
crawler bots. Don MacAskill of SmugMug estimates50% of our web server CPU
resourcesare spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work
with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but
does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data
over and over again?Tweets of Gold:jamesurquhart:Key to applications is
architecture. Key for infrastructure supporting archs is configurability.

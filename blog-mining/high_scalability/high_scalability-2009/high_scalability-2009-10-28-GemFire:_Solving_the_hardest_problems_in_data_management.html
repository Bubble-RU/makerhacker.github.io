<p>Introduction: GemFire Enterprise is in-memory distributed data management platform that
pools memory (and CPU, network and optionally local disk) across multiple
processes to manage application objects and behavior. With the 6.0 release,
GemFire has reached a stage of maturity in its evolution. GemStone touts this
version as the true 'best of breed' distributed caching technology, solving
scalability issues in all industries.</p><p>3 0.26340964 <a title="730-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-19-GemFire_6.0%3A_New_innovations_in_data_management.html">633 high scalability-2009-06-19-GemFire 6.0: New innovations in data management</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GemStone has unveiled GemFire 6.0 which is the culmination of several years of
development and the continuous solving of the hardest data management problems
in the world. With this release GemFire touts some of the latest innovative
features in data management.In this release:- GemFire introduces a resource
manager to continuously monitor and protect cache instances from running out
of memory, triggering rebalancing to migrate data to less loaded nodes or
allow dynamic increase/decrease in the number of nodes hosting data for linear
scalability without impeding ongoing operations (no contention points).-
GemFire provides explicit control over when rebalancing can be triggered, on
what class of data and even allows the administrator to simulate a "rebalance"
operation to quantify the benefits before actually doing it.- With built in
instrumentation that captures throughput and latency metrics, GemFire now
enables applications to sense changing performance patterns and proactively

<p>Introduction: Scale-up solutions in the form of large SMPs have represented the mainstream
of commercial computing for the past several years. The major server vendors
continue to provide increasingly larger and more powerful machines. More
recently, scale-out solutions, in the form of clusters of smaller machines,
have gained increased acceptance for commercial computing.Scale-out solutions
are particularly effective in high-throughput web-centric applications.In this
paper, we investigate the behavior of two competing approaches to parallelism,
scale-up and scale-out, in an emerging search application. Our conclusions
show that a scale-out strategy can be the key to good performance even on a
scale-up machine.Furthermore, scale-out solutions offer better
price/performance, although at an increase in management complexity.Read more
about scaling out/up and about the conclusions here (PDF - you can also

<p>Introduction: Sometimes I get article proposals and then there's no follow up. Though these
TripAdvisor data points are from 2010, I thought them worth sharing:Our site
serves in excess of 100M dynamically generated page view a day (all media and
static content goes through CDN), and we do this with about 100 machines, no
single point of failure, supported by distributed service architecture that
that responds to over 2B requests a day, and a data warehouse of over 20TB
that is used to drive email campaigns, SEM, and general reporting. We are a
Linux/Java/Apache/Tomcat/Postgres/Lucene shop, and have built our own
distributed computing architecture. We also maintain duplicate data centers
(one active, one standby) for redundancy and maintenance purposes.Too bad, it
sounds like it would have been a good article.Related Articles A new twist on

<p>Introduction: GemStone's website recently recieved a major facelift over atwww.gemstone.com.
I felt that the users of this site might find our detailed description of how
we solve the hardest problems in data management interesting. This can be
viewed at:http://www.gemstone.com/hardest-problems(PDF available for
download).Also check out our industry page to see how GemFire applies to
multiple industries, then head over to the solutions page to see how GemFire
enables mainframe migration, real-time BI in data warehousing, RDB
scalup/speedup and the cloud. Finally, check out our community site if you
want a more technical view of GemFire. We hope you enjoy the new facelift and
content!</p><p>2 0.83370066 <a title="730-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ.html">592 high scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Atif Ghaffarhas a nice strategy to deal with virus checking uploads:Upload
item into a safe area. If necessary, the uploader blocks waiting for a
result.Queue a work order into a job system so all the work can be distributed
throughout your cluster.A service in your cluster performs the virus scan and
informs the uploader of the result.Move the vetted item into your system.This
removes the CPU bottleneck from your web servers and distributes it through
your cluster. Keep your web servers providing prompt service to users. Let
your cluster do the heavy lifting. This minimizes response time and maximizes
throughput. A similar system can be used for creating thumbnails, transcoding,
copyright checks, updating indexes, event notification or any other kind of
intensive work.</p><p>4 0.73726368 <a title="730-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-09-The_Story_of_How_Turning_Disk_Into_a_Service_Lead_to_a_Deluge_of_Density.html">1384 high scalability-2013-01-09-The Story of How Turning Disk Into a Service Lead to a Deluge of Density</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We usually think of the wonderful advantages of service oriented
architectures as a software thing, but it also applies to hardware. InSecurity
Now 385, that Doyen of Disk,Steve Gibson, tells the fascinating story (@ about
41:30) of how moving to a service oriented architecture in hard drives,
modeling a drive as a linear stream of sectors, helped create the amazing high
density disk drives we enjoy today.When drives switched to use
theIDE(integrated drive electronics) interface, the controller function moved
into the drive instead of the computer. No longer were low level drive signals
moved across cables and into the motherboard. Now we just ask the drive for
the desired sector and the drive takes care of it.This allowed manufacturers
to do anything they wanted to behind the IDE interface. The drive stopped
being dumb, it became smart, providing a sort of sector service. Density sky
rocketed because there was no dependency on the computer. All the internals
could completely change as</p><p>5 0.70633572 <a title="730-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-14-Big_List_of_Scalabilty_Conferences.html">1115 high scalability-2011-09-14-Big List of Scalabilty Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so
I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if
a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have
attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If
you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in
the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please
comment on that too.Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of
them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade
away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these
days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work.
Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people
do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not. Taking all
that wisdom and stuffing it into a presentations is surprisingly hard wor</p><p>6 0.6521672 <a title="730-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-Google_App_Engine_-_what_about_existing_applications%3F.html">305 high scalability-2008-04-21-Google App Engine - what about existing applications?</a></p>

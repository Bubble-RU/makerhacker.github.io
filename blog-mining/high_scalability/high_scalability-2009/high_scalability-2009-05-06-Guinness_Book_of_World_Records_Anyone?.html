give this a try.That which doesn't kill your site makes it stronger. Or at
least that's the capacity planning strategy John Allspaw recommends (not
really, but I'm trying to make a point here) inThe Art of Capacity
Planning:Using production traffic to define your resources ceilings in a
controlled setting allows you to see firsthand what would happen when you run
out of capacity in a particular resource. Of course I'm not suggesting that
you run your site into the ground, but better to know what your real (not
simulated) loads are while you're watching, than find out the hard way. In
addition, a lot of unexpected systemic things can happen when load increases

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops
Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access
to production machin</p><p>4 0.13210085 <a title="593-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-04-Number_of_load_balanced_servers.html">111 high scalability-2007-10-04-Number of load balanced servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Dan Bartow, VP ofSOASTA, talking about how they pelted
MySpace with 1 million concurrent users using 800 EC2 instances. I thought
this was an interesting story because: that's a lot of users, it takes big
cajones to test your live site like that, and not everything worked out quite
as expected. I'd like to thank Dan for taking the time to write and share this
article.In December of 2009 MySpace launched a new wave of streaming music
video offerings in New Zealand, building on the previous success of MySpace
music.  These new features included the ability to watch music videos, search
for artist's videos, create lists of favorites, and more. The anticipated load
increase from a feature like this on a popular site like MySpace is huge, and
they wanted to test these features before making them live. If you manage the
infrastructure that sits behind a high traffic application you don't want any
surprises.

<p>Introduction: Tim Brayhas a wonderfulinterview with Casey Forbes, creator of Ravelry, a Ruby
on Rails site supporting a 400,000+ strong community of dedicated knitters and
crocheters.Casey and his small team have done great things with Ravelry. It is
a very focused site that provides a lot of value for users. And users
absolutely adore the site. That's obvious from their enthusiastic comments and
rocket fast adoption of Ravelry.Ten years ago a site like Ravelry would have
been a multi-million dollar operation. Today Casey is the sole engineer for
Ravelry and to run it takes only a few people. He was able to code it in 4
months working nights and weekends. Take a look down below of all the
technologies used to make Ravelry and you'll see how it is constructed almost
completely from free of the shelf software that Casey has stitched together
into a complete system. There's an amazing amount of leverage in today's
ecosystem when you combine all the quality tools, languages, storage,
bandwidth and hosti</p><p>4 0.66388613 <a title="593-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-16-Just-In-Time_Scalability%3A_Agile_Methods_to_Support_Massive_Growth_%28IMVU_case_study%29.html">493 high scalability-2009-01-16-Just-In-Time Scalability: Agile Methods to Support Massive Growth (IMVU case study)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: BeforeWe started with a small site, a mess of open source, and a small team
that didn't know much about scaling.AfterWe ended with a large site, a medium
sized team, and an architecture that has scaled.We never stopped. We used a
roadmap and a compass, made weekly changes in direction, regularly shipped
code on Wednesday to handle the next weekend's capacity constraints, and
shipped new features the whole time.These are excerpts from the IMVU PDF
presentation of their architecture which can be viewed or

popular the site will be I don't want to spend a ton of money on the

<p>Introduction: Searching around the HS website I noticed that there are no articles regarding
db2, which has an express edition, free of charge and from what I know there
aren't any restrictions.Being a powerful database system I thought it could
make be an alternative to MySQL, PostgreSQL databases.Here is the IBM
statement:"DB2 Express Edition for Community (DB2 Express-C) is a no charge
data server for use in development and deployment. DB2 Express-C supports a
full range of APIs, drivers, and interfaces for application development
including PHP, C/C++, and .NET. In addition, DB2 Express-C V9 contains
advanced XML features. DB2 Express-C provides ISVs an ideal starting database
server for Web, enterprise, and eBusiness applications.This IBM Redbook
provides fundamentals of DB2 application development with DB2 Express-C. It
covers the DB2 Express-C installation and configuration for application
development and skills and techniques for building DB2 applications with XML,
PHP, C/C++, Java, and .NET.</p><p>3 0.91562498 <a title="593-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-08-Virus_Scanning_for_Uploaded_content.html">204 high scalability-2008-01-08-Virus Scanning for Uploaded content</a></p>

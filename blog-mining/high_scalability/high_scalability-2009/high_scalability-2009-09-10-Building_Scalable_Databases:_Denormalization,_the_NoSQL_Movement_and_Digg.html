<p>Introduction: Jeff Atwood started a barn burner of a conversation inMaybe Normalizing Isn't
Normalon how to create a fast scalable tagging system. Jeff eventually asks
that terrible question:which is better -- a normalized database, or a
denormalized database?And all hell breaks loose. I know, it's hard to imagine
database debates becoming contentious, but it does happen :-) It's lucky
developers don't have temporal power or rivers of blood would flow.Here are a
few of the pithier points (summarized):breakNormalization is not magical fairy
dust you sprinkle over your database to cure all ills; it often creates as
many problems as it solves. (Jeff)Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until
it works. (Jeff)Use materialized views which are tables created and maintained
by your RDBMS. So a materialized view will act exactly like a de-normalized
table would - except you keep you original normalized structure and any change
to original data will propagate to the view automatically. (Goran)According to

<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak, in his short and information packed REDUNDANT DATA CENTER
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY video, shows why networking as played at the highest
levels is something you want to leave to professionals, like alarge animal
country vetenariandelivering a stuck foal at 2AM on a dark and stormy night.
There are always a lot questions about the black art of building redundant
datacenter networks and there's a shortage of accessible explanations. What I
liked about Ivan's video is how effortlessly he explains the issues and
tradeoffs you can expect in designing your own solution, as well as giving
creative solutions to those problems. A lot of years of experience are boiled
down to a 17 minute video.Ivan begins by showing what a canonical fully
redundant datacenter would look like:It's like an ark where everything goes
two by two. You have two datacenters, each datacenter has redundant core
switches, redundant servers, redundant disk arrays, redundant links between
datacenters (for synchro</p><p>5 0.09850622 <a title="698-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-04-Top_Features_of_a_Scalable_Database.html">1276 high scalability-2012-07-04-Top Features of a Scalable Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Douglas Wilson, EMEA Field Application Engineer at
Raima, based on insights from biulding theirRaima Database Manager.Scalability
and HardwareScalability is the ability to maintain performance as demands on
the system increase, by adding further resources. Normally those resources
will be in the form of hardware. Since processor speeds are no longer
increasing much, scaling up the hardware normally means adding extra
processors or cores, and more memory.Scalability and SoftwareHowever,
scalability requires software that can utilize the extra hardware effectively.
The software must be designed to allow parallel processing. In the context of
a database engine this means that the server component must be multi-threaded,
to allow the operating system to schedule parallel tasks on all the cores that
are available. Not only that, but the database engine must provide an
efficient way to break its workload into as many parallel tasks as there are
cores. So, for example,</p><p>6 0.091771111 <a title="698-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-23-Facebook_Timeline%3A_Brought_to_You_by_the_Power_of_Denormalization.html">1179 high scalability-2012-01-23-Facebook Timeline: Brought to You by the Power of Denormalization</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This excellent survey of the field waswritten by Ian Thomas Varleyas part of
his Master of Science in Engineering program.The aim of this paper is to
explore the conceptual design space of non-relational databases as compared to
traditional relational databases. It is clear that the design needs of the two
paradigms are different, but how fundamental are the differences, and what
strategies can we use to transition our conceptual designs from one to the
other?There are a few things to like about this paper. A running a example is
used to show the different ways to model data depending on which type of
solution you are targeting, especially covering how many-to-many relationships
are modeled, data integrity, and how to support optional attributes. There's
also a brief survey of some of the major systems.The most interesting section
of the report is where it tackles the problem of design for non-relational
systems. The approach has two different phases: design questions and design

<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming
your business - reports are out of date, your batch processing window is
nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database
consolidation - remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database
environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware,
OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are

<p>Introduction: O'Reilly Radar's James Turner conducted avery informative interviewwith Joe
Stump, current CTO ofSimpleGeoand former lead architect atDigg, in which Joe
makes some of his usually insightful comments on his experience using
Cassandra vs MySQL. As Digg started out with aMySQL oriented architectureand
has recently beenmoving full speedto Cassandra, his observations on some of
their lessons learned and the motivation for the move are especially valuable.
Here are some of the key takeaways you find useful:Precompute on writes, make
reads fast. This is an oldie as a scaling strategy, but it's valuable to see
how SimpleGeo is applying it to their problem of finding entities within a
certain geographical region. Using Cassandra they've built two clusters: one
for indexes and one for records. The records cluster, as you might imagine, is
a simple data lookup. The index cluster has a carefully constructed key for
every lookup scenario. The indexes are computed on the write, so reads are

<p>Introduction: Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database
schemas that ensures that the data is optimal for ad-hoc querying and that
modifications such as deletion or insertion of data does not lead to data
inconsistency. Database denormalization is the process of optimizing your
database for reads by creating redundant data. A consequence of
denormalization is that insertions or deletions could cause data inconsistency
if not uniformly applied to all redundant copies of the data within the
database.Read more on Carnage4life blog...</p><p>3 0.78331411 <a title="698-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-Google_Wave_Architecture.html">618 high scalability-2009-06-05-Google Wave Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Good Vibrationsby Radovan SemanÄ?ik. Lot's of interesting questions
about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.Google
Waveis a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML
documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency
updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new,
convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users ofGoogle
Waveand we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open
platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and
become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to
"federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google
Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and
collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation
Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.Hereare

<p>Introduction: In his blog post,Scaling WSO2 Stratos, Srinath Perera explains the scaling
architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure.
It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new
concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.Overall,
WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading
to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the
paper WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing.
ProblemStratos is multi-tenanted. In other words, there are many tenants. Each
tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants,
where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos
supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products
(e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants
may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, and Gadgets
etc. WSO2 Str</p><p>5 0.65192616 <a title="698-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-16-S3_Failed_Because_of_Authentication_Overload.html">249 high scalability-2008-02-16-S3 Failed Because of Authentication Overload</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Being an authentic human being is difficult and apparently authenticating all
those S3 requests can be a bit overwhelming as well. Amazon fingered a lot of
processor heavy authentication requests as the reason for their
downtime:breakEarly this morning, at 3:30am PST, we started seeing elevated
levels of authenticated requests from multiple users in one of our locations.
While we carefully monitor our overall request volumes and these remained
within normal ranges, we had not been monitoring the proportion of
authenticated requests. Importantly, these cryptographic requests consume more
resources per call than other request types.Shortly before 4:00am PST, we
began to see several other users significantly increase their volume of
authenticated calls. The last of these pushed the authentication service over
its maximum capacity before we could complete putting new capacity in place.
In addition to processing authenticated requests, the authentication service
also performs account valida</p><p>6 0.63202029 <a title="698-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-12-SPHiveDB%3A_A_mixture_of_the_Key-Value_Store_and_the_Relational_Database..html">655 high scalability-2009-07-12-SPHiveDB: A mixture of the Key-Value Store and the Relational Database.</a></p>

</p><p>2 Horizontal partitioning means store a subset of rows on a different machines. [sent-40, score-0.206]
</p><p>3 Vertical partitioning means putting some columns in one table and some columns in another table. [sent-42, score-0.342]
</p><p>4 Build a data access layer so partitioning is hidden behind an API. [sent-45, score-0.131]
</p><p>5 With partitioning comes theCAP Theorem: you can only pick two of the following three: Strong Consistency, High Availability, Partition Tolerance. [sent-46, score-0.131]
</p><p>6 Denormalization means data is copied in multiple objects and must be kept synchronized. [sent-48, score-0.15]
</p><p>7 - It's faster and more responsive than cron and only slightly less responsive than real-time. [sent-52, score-0.128]
</p><p>8 All three are then combined to return a combined single answer to the client. [sent-58, score-0.201]
</p><p>9 So you have to:- denormalize- avoid joins- avoid large scans across databases by partitioning- cache- add read slaves- don't use NFSRun numbers before you try and fix a problem to make sure things actually will work. [sent-65, score-0.172]
</p><p>10 Eventually consistent means that writes to one partition will eventually make it to all the other partitions. [sent-78, score-0.236]
</p><p>11 After a write reads made one after another don't have to return the same value as they could be handled by different partitions. [sent-79, score-0.252]
</p><p>12 Trust that people have it handled and they'll take care of it. [sent-93, score-0.163]
</p><p>13 At those write rates it's easy to see why Joe was so excited about MemcacheDB's ability to handle their digg deluge. [sent-127, score-0.505]
</p><p>14 It conforms to memcache protocol(not completed, see below), so any memcached client can have connectivity with it. [sent-131, score-0.204]
</p><p>15 Digg uses MemcacheDB to scale out the huge number of writes that happen when data is denormalized. [sent-137, score-0.187]
</p><p>16 Denormalizing introduces redundancies because you are keeping copies of data in multiple records instead of just one copy in a nicely normalized table. [sent-140, score-0.145]
</p><p>17 So denormalization means a lot more writes as data must be copied to all the records that contain a copy. [sent-141, score-0.43]
</p><p>18 MemcacheDB has the performance, especially when you layer memcached's normal partitioning scheme on top. [sent-143, score-0.131]
</p><p>19 Digg already uses memcache so it's a no-brainer to start using MemcacheDB. [sent-148, score-0.159]
</p><p>20 So it's an evolutionary step for code and a revolutionary step for performance. [sent-156, score-0.334]

<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things).
That's why scaling Facebook is hardsays Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of
Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and
Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why
would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional
web sites? Let's find out.Traditional websites are easier to scale than social
networking sites for two reasons:They usually access only their own data and
common cached data.Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one
time.Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your
profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the
website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around
single records usingdistributed hashing schemes. And since only a few percent
of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little RAM cache

<p>Introduction: Get Your High Scalability Fix at Digg Interested in working on cutting-edge
high-scale infrastructure at Digg? We're making a big investment in scaling
and have committed to the NoSQL (Not only SQL) path with Cassandra. We're
using other open-source infrastructure to help us scale including Hadoop,
RabbitMQ, Zookeeper, Thrift, HDFS and Lucene. We're rewriting Digg from the
ground up and we need amazing developers to join our world-class team. If you
think you are up for the challenge, or you know someone who might be, take a

<p>Introduction: O'Reilly Radar's James Turner conducted avery informative interviewwith Joe
Stump, current CTO ofSimpleGeoand former lead architect atDigg, in which Joe
makes some of his usually insightful comments on his experience using
Cassandra vs MySQL. As Digg started out with aMySQL oriented architectureand
has recently beenmoving full speedto Cassandra, his observations on some of
their lessons learned and the motivation for the move are especially valuable.
Here are some of the key takeaways you find useful:Precompute on writes, make
reads fast. This is an oldie as a scaling strategy, but it's valuable to see
how SimpleGeo is applying it to their problem of finding entities within a
certain geographical region. Using Cassandra they've built two clusters: one
for indexes and one for records. The records cluster, as you might imagine, is
a simple data lookup. The index cluster has a carefully constructed key for
every lookup scenario. The indexes are computed on the write, so reads are

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg, the first paid employee at reddit, teaches us a lot about how
to create a successful social site in a really good talk he gave at the RAMP
conference. Watch it here at Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion-
Pitfalls and Lessons.Jeremy uses a virtue and sin approach. Examples of the
mistakes made in scaling reddit are shared and it turns out they did a lot of
good stuff too. Somewhat of a shocker is that Jeremy is now a Reliability
Architect at Netflix, so we get a little Netflix perspective thrown in for
free.Some of the lessons that stood out most for me: Think of SSDs as cheap
RAM, not expensive disk. When reddit moved from spinning disks to SSDs for the
database the number of servers was reduced from 12 to 1 with a ton of
headroom. SSDs are 4x more expensive but you get 16x the performance. Worth
the cost. Give users a little bit of power, see what they do with it, and turn
the good stuff into features. One of the biggest revelations for me was how

<p>Introduction: Mixi is a fast growing social networking site in Japan. They provide services
like: diary, community, message, review, and photo album. Having a lot in
common with LiveJournal they also developed many of the same approaches. Their
write up on how they scaled their system is easily one of the best out
there.Site: http://mixi.jpInformation Sourcesmixi.jp- scaling out with open
sourcePlatformLinuxApacheMySQLPerlMemcachedSquidShardWhat's Inside?They grew
to approximately 4 million users in two years and add over 15,000 new
users/day.Ranks 35th on Alexa and 3rd in Japan.More than 100 MySQL serversAdd
more than 10 servers/monthUse non-persistent connections.Diary traffic is 85%
read and 15% write.Message traffic is is 75% read and 25% write.Ran into
replication performance problems so they had to split the database.Considered

<p>Introduction: This is an email interview withViktor Klang, Director of Engineering
atTypesafe, on theScala Futuresmodel &Akka;,both topics on which is he is
immensely passionate and knowledgeable.How do you structure your application?
That's the question I explored in the articleBeyond Threads And Callbacks. An
option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful
stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.To remedy my
oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe's Viktor Klang, long time Scala
hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in
answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He's
a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about.I've implemented several
Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO,
service orchestration, failover, etc, so I'm innately skeptical about
frameworks that remove control from the programmer at the cost of latency.So

<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his
picture), in I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything,
reveals the stack used for building Google+:Our stack is pretty standard fare
for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and
JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-
source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and
template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to
maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on
hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates
server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the
JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make
it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on
stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily

<p>Introduction: Joe Stump, Lead Architect at Digg, gavethis presentationat the Web 2.0 Expo. I
couldn't find the actual presentation, but fortunatelyKris Jordantook some
great notes. That's how key moments in history are accidentally captured
forever. Joe was also kind enough to respond to my email questions with a
phone call.In this first part of the post Joe shares some timeless wisdom that
you may or may not have read before. I of course take some pains to extract
all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules. What
really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDBWill be the biggest new
kid on the block in scaling. MemcacheDB has been around for a little while and
I've never thought of it in that way. Well learn why Joe is so excited by
MemcacheDB at the end of the post.Impressive Stats80th-100th largest site in

<p>Introduction: Ilya Grigorik has written another wonderful article lavishly detailing the
extraordinary tactics Chrome employs to hide network latency from users:
Chrome Networking: DNS Prefetch & TCP Preconnect. Ilya springs some surpising
factoids on us, revealing how the web has slowed and super sized:The size of
an average page has grown to 1059kB and is now composed of over80 subresource
requests.An average DNS lookup takes between 60 and 120ms. This creates a
100-200ms of latency before a request can be sent because of th full round-
trip (RTT) to perform the TCP handshake.Slow mobile experiences are largely
due to the much higher RTT's (200-1000ms) on wireless networks. Reducing the
number of outbound connections and the total byte size of your pages is the
single best optimization you can make for mobile today. Chrome reduces
apparent latency using a host of clever anticipatory mechanisms:Learns the
network topology as you use it via a Predictor object that anticipates user
behavior and futur</p><p>6 0.96145475 <a title="512-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-22-Spanner_-_It%27s_About_Programmers_Building_Apps_Using_SQL_Semantics_at_NoSQL_Scale.html">1345 high scalability-2012-10-22-Spanner - It's About Programmers Building Apps Using SQL Semantics at NoSQL Scale</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers Show 41 episode was to reveal and
ruminate over the horrors of a successfulattack on RSA, which puts the whole
world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there
was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost
datacenter.Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile
back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by
summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal: Look at
Arista and Juniper. JuniperHas a range of stackable switches, which includes
some 10 gig.If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on
their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric
solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric.
Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.
Thinks Juniper would make a good deal in order to get a few reference sites
for QFX.Arista Networks</p><p>4 0.102367 <a title="540-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-09-Writing_about_cisco_loadbalancer%3F.html">678 high scalability-2009-08-09-Writing about cisco loadbalancer?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Guys,At one of my jobs I have to administer a CISCO ACE (application control
engine) hardware load-balancer.I don't particularly love this beast, but it's
very very powerful.There appears to be little real-world info out there, so it
could be interesting writing an article on that.But I don't have other HW LB's
to compare it to and I don't want to rehash the product page.What would
interest you in a 'product review' of a loadbalancer?No replies means it's not
an interesting topic, so no article then ;-)</p><p>5 0.10153262 <a title="540-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-09-The_Tera-Scale_Effect_.html">939 high scalability-2010-11-09-The Tera-Scale Effect </a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the past year, Intel issued a series of powerful chips under the new
Nehalem microarchitecture, with large numbers of cores and extensive memory
capacity. This new class of chips is is part of a bigger Intel initiative
referred to as Tera-Scale Computing. Cisco has released their Unified
Computing System (UCS) equipped with a unique extended memory and high speed
network within the box, which is specifically geared to take advantage of this
type of CPU architecture .This new class of hardware has the potential to
revolutionize the IT landscape as we know it.In  this post, I want to focus
primarily on the potential implications on application architecture, more
specifically on the application platform landscape.  more...</p><p>6 0.10107826 <a title="540-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-15-Sun_Customer_Ready_HPC_Cluster%3A_Reference_Configurations_with_Sun_Fire_X2200_M2_and_X2100_M2_Servers.html">418 high scalability-2008-10-15-Sun Customer Ready HPC Cluster: Reference Configurations with Sun Fire X2200 M2 and X2100 M2 Servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though â€“ the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Lew TuckerLew Tucker is the Vice President and CTO of Sun
Microsystemsâ€™ Cloud Computing initiative.Lewâ€™s career has been focused on

the 1990â€™s. In 2002, Lew joined Salesforce.com and led the design and
implementation of App Exchange. After Salesforce.com, Lew was CTO at Radar

<p>Introduction: Reducing the costs of IT infrastructure and improving the manageability and
efficiency of web services pose significant challenges for many organizations
in today's economic climate. Recent studies describe the challenges IT
managers face administering the proliferation of x86-based servers used to run
web services applications. Those reports reveal that using large number of
x86-based systems can increase space and power consumption, as well as cost
and asset management overhead. In addition, many of these x86-based systems
run a mixture of operating system and application software leading to
increased management complexity and potential security concerns.Faced with
these challenges, many organizations are attracted by the idea of
consolidating web and application services from multiple x86-based servers to
a smaller number of high-performance servers. This approach strives to help
simplify management, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of
delivering web services.

<p>Introduction: A recentInfoWorld articleclaims that "With Cisco expected to enter the blade
market and Sun expected to offer networking equipment, things could get
interesting awfully fast." How does this effect your infrastructure strategy
and decisions?Would you consider to build scalable web applications on the
Cisco Unified Computing System? Or would you consider to build a router out of
a server with the use of OpenSolaris and Project Crossbow as the article
suggests? Will any of these initiatives change the way we build scalable web
infrastructure or are these just attempts to sale these systems?What do you
think?</p><p>2 0.66223937 <a title="540-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Paper%3A_Replication_Under_Scalable_Hashing.html">19 high scalability-2007-07-16-Paper: Replication Under Scalable Hashing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Replication Under Scalable Hashing: A Family of Algorithms for
ScalableDecentralized Data DistributionFrom the abstract:Typical algorithms
for decentralized data distributionwork best in a system that is fully built
before it first used;adding or removing components results in either
extensivereorganization of data or load imbalance in the system.We have
developed a family of decentralized algorithms,RUSH (Replication Under
Scalable Hashing), thatmaps replicated objects to a scalable collection of
storageservers or disks. RUSH algorithms distribute objects toservers
according to user-specified server weighting. Whileall RUSH variants support
addition of servers to the system,different variants have different
characteristics withrespect to lookup time in petabyte-scale systems,
performancewith mirroring (as opposed to redundancy codes),and storage server
removal. All RUSH variants redistributeas few objects as possible when new
servers areadded or existing servers are removed, and all v</p><p>3 0.66049039 <a title="540-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Paper%3A_The_Clustered_Storage_Revolution.html">20 high scalability-2007-07-16-Paper: The Clustered Storage Revolution</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Abstract--This paper presents the architecture andcharacteristics of a memory
database intended to be used as acache engine for web applications. Primary
goals of this databaseare speed and efficiency while running on SMP systems
withseveral CPU cores (four and more). A secondary goal is thesupport for
simple metadata structures associated with cacheddata that can aid in
efficient use of the cache. Due to these goals,some data structures and
algorithms normally associated withthis field of computing needed to be
adapted to the newenvironment.</p><p>5 0.64481533 <a title="540-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-27-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_January_28_2010.html">767 high scalability-2010-01-27-Hot Scalability Links for January 28 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Google's Research Areas of Interest: Building scalable, robust cluster
applications.At Google we see distributed systems as a technology in its
infancy, with huge gaps in the supporting research  that represent some of the
most important problems in the space. Here are some examples:Resource
sharing,Balancing cost, performance, and reliability,Self-maintaining systems.

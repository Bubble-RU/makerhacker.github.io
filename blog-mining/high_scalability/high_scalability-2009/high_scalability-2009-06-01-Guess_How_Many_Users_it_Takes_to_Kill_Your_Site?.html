<p>Introduction: You don't even have to make a bid, Randy Shoup, anÂ eBay Distinguished Architect, gives this  presentation  on how eBay scales, for free. Randy has done a fabulous job in this presentation and in other talks listed at the end of this post getting at the heart of the principles behind scalability. It's more about ideas of how things work and fit together than a focusing on a particular technology stack.
  Impressive Stats  
In case you weren't sure, eBay is big, with lots of: users, data, features, and change...
  
 Over 89 million active users worldwide 
 190 million items for sale in 50,000 categories 
 Over 8 billion URL requests per day 
 Hundreds of new features per quarter 
 Roughly 10% of items are listed or ended every day 
 In 39 countries and 10 languages 
 24x7x365 
 70 billion read / write operations / day 
 Processes 50TB of new, incremental data per day 
 Analyzes 50PB of data per day 
   10 Lessons  
The presentation does a good job explaining each lesson, but the list is.</p><p>3 0.19877975 <a title="614-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-29-How_to_Succeed_at_Capacity_Planning_Without_Really_Trying_%3A__An_Interview_with_Flickr%27s_John_Allspaw_on_His_New_Book.html">643 high scalability-2009-06-29-How to Succeed at Capacity Planning Without Really Trying :  An Interview with Flickr's John Allspaw on His New Book</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:   Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr . Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change.  Operations and developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature flags -  don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics. Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access to production</p><p>4 0.17120217 <a title="614-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-04-How_MySpace_Tested_Their_Live_Site_with_1_Million_Concurrent_Users.html">788 high scalability-2010-03-04-How MySpace Tested Their Live Site with 1 Million Concurrent Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Dan Bartow, VP of  SOASTA , talking about how they pelted MySpace with 1 million concurrent users using 800 EC2 instances. I thought this was an interesting story because: that's a lot of users, it takes big cajones to test your live site like that, and not everything worked out quite as expected. I'd like to thank Dan for taking the time to write and share this article. 
 
 
 
 In December of 2009  MySpace launched a new wave of streaming music video offerings in New  Zealand, building on the previous success of MySpace music.  These  new features included the ability to watch music videos, search for  artist’s videos, create lists of favorites, and more. The anticipated  load increase from a feature like this on a popular site like MySpace  is huge, and they wanted to test these features before making them live.  
 
 If you manage the  infrastructure that sits behind a high traffic application you don’t  want any surprises.  You want to understand your breakin</p><p>5 0.16342506 <a title="614-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-Guinness_Book_of_World_Records_Anyone%3F.html">593 high scalability-2009-05-06-Guinness Book of World Records Anyone?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We need to measure the number of queries-per-second our site gets for capacity planning purposes.  Obviously, we need to provision the site based on the peak QPS, not average QPS. There will always be some spikes in traffic, though, where for one particular second we get a really huge number of queries. It's ok if site performance slightly degrades during that time. So what I'd really like to do is estimate the *near* peak QPS based on average or median QPS. Near peak might be defined as the QPS that I get at the 95th percentile of the busiest seconds during the day.  My guess is that this is similar to what ISPs do when they measure your bandwidth usage and then charge for usage over the 95th percentile.  What we've done is analyzed our logs, counted the queries executed during each second during the day, sorted from the busiest seconds to the least busy ones, and graphed it. What you get is a histogram that  steeply declines and flattens out near zero.

<p>Introduction: In Scalability   issues for dummies  Alex Barrera talks movingly about the challenges he faces trying to scale his startup  inkzee  as the lone developer.  Inkzee is an  online news reader that automatically groups similar topics . This is a cool problem and is one you know right away is going to have some killer scalability problems as the number of feeds and the number of users increase. And these problems lead to the point of the post, to  explain here what are scalability problems and how deep the repercussions are for a small company , which Alex does admirably.   Some takeaways:
   Sites are composed of a frontend and backend. The backend isn't visible to users, but it does all the work and this is where the scalability problems show up.    As more and more users use a site it becomes slow because more users reveal bottlenecks in the system that weren't visible before.    There can be many many reasons for these bottlenecks. They are often very hard to find because the backend sy</p><p>4 0.77796125 <a title="614-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability_has_Moved_to_Squarespace.com%21_.html">714 high scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability has Moved to Squarespace.com! </a></p>
<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary. Thanks for the thought though.  It's been a long long long process. Importing a largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things. I'll explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia that needs to be handled to make the move complete:

<p>Introduction: Update:  Here's the  first result . Good response time until 400 users. At 1,340 users the response time was 6 seconds. And at 2000 users the site was effectively did. An interesting point was that errors that could harm a site's reputation started at 1000 users. Cheers to the company that had the guts to give this a try.  That which doesn't kill your site makes it stronger. Or at least that's the capacity planning strategy John Allspaw recommends (not really, but I'm trying to make a point here) in  The Art of Capacity Planning :
   Using production traffic to define your resources ceilings in a controlled setting allows you to see firsthand what would happen when you run out of capacity in a particular resource. Of course I'm not suggesting that you run your site into the ground, but better to know what your real (not simulated) loads are while you're watching, than find out the hard way. In addition, a lot of unexpected systemic things can happen when load increases in a particular</p><p>3 0.86809289 <a title="614-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-19-Paper%3A_MegaPipe%3A_A_New_Programming_Interface_for_Scalable_Network_I-O.html">1478 high scalability-2013-06-19-Paper: MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I-O</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The paper  MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O  ( video ,  slides ) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."
 
The result: MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between  29% (for long connections)  and  582% (for short connections) . MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed version of  memcached between 15% and 320% . For a workload based on real-world HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of  nginx by 75% .

<p>Introduction: The Twelve Networking Truths  is one of a long series of timeless truths documented in sacred   April Fools'  RFC   s. Though issued in 1996, it's no less true today.
 
It's hard to pick a favorite because they are all good. But if I had to pick, it would be:
  

Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor understood unless experienced firsthand.

  
As we grow comfortable behind garden walls, clutching gadgets like lifelines and ideologies like shields, empathy is the true social network.

<p>Introduction: Jurgen Appelo of Noop.nl asked for nominations for top blogs and then performed a sophisticated weighting of their popularity based on page range, trust authority, Alexa rank, Google hits, and number of comments. When all the results poured out of the blender HighScalability was ranked 16th. Not bad! Joel on Software was number one, of course. The next few were: 2) Coding Horror by Jeff Atwood 3) Seth's Blog by Seth Godin and 4) Paul Graham: Essays Paul Graham. All excellent blogs. Very cool.</p><p>6 0.84755713 <a title="614-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-06-Paper%3A_Real-world_Concurrency.html">462 high scalability-2008-12-06-Paper: Real-world Concurrency</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales are finally fulfilling their destiny:  slaughtering PCs  in the sales arena. And it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend systems.
    
While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company facing those same exact problems right now is  Medialets , a mobile rich media ad platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads, though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of defeating the mobile device data deluge.

<p>Introduction: This post about using Hive and Hadoop for analytics comes straight from Facebook engineers.  Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis and business intelligence applications used by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook products are also based on analytics.   These products range from simple reporting applications like Insights for the Facebook Ad Network, to more advanced kind such as Facebook's Lexicon product.   As a result a flexible infrastructure that caters to the needs of these diverse applications and users and that also scales up in a cost effective manner with the ever increasing amounts of data being generated on Facebook, is critical. Hive and Hadoop are the technologies that we have used to address these requirements at Facebook.

I thought untethered readers might like to give it a try. Thanks to Jean-Paul for making it available!     WidSets is:   a simple service that brings you information normally accessed via the Internet by sending it directly to your mobile phone . Using mini-applications called widgets, it sends you the latest updates to your favorite websites. The system uses RSS feeds to push information from these websites directly to your mobile phone the minute theyâ&euro;&trade;re updated  .</p><p>5 0.48028287 <a title="548-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-08-Sponsored_Post%3A_Infragistics%2C_Velocity%2C_Reality_Check_Network%2C_Gigaspaces%2C_AiCache%2C_ElasticHosts%2C_Logic_Monitor%2C_Attribution_Modeling%2C_New_Relic%2C_AppDynamics%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEnine%2C_Site24x7.html">1241 high scalability-2012-05-08-Sponsored Post: Infragistics, Velocity, Reality Check Network, Gigaspaces, AiCache, ElasticHosts, Logic Monitor, Attribution Modeling, New Relic, AppDynamics, CloudSigma, ManageEnine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Varnish  is a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered by these operating systems.  Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.  Varnish is reported to be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>4 0.6624549 <a title="548-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-26-Golden_rule_of_web_caching.html">194 high scalability-2007-12-26-Golden rule of web caching</a></p>

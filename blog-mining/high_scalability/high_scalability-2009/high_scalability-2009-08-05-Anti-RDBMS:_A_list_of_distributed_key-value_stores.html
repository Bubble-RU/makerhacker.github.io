<p>Introduction: With so many database options available these days, like for the rest of life,
it's natural to wonder how it allfits together. Amazon complicated, or rather
expanded the available options by introducing RDS, theirrelational database
service. RDS is MySQL safely cocooned as a manageable cloud element, resting
boldly within an energy providing elasticCPU pool, supported by a
virtuallyinfinite supplyof verycapable virtualized storage.MySQL in AWS isnow
easyto start, stop, monitor, backup, snapshot, expand, and effortlessly move
up and down the instance hierarchy. What it's not, contrary to what you might
expect, is a scale-out solution, it's a scale-up solution. You get more by
buying a bigger instance, not by horizontally adding more instances. There's
alimit. Admittedly a larger limit now with Amazon's newhigh memory
instances.That's OK, well maybe not for people who helped grow Amazon's
ecosystem by offering a similar product, but so many projects use MySQL that

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems
to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly
increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly
using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and
gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous
information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and
ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only
SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it's true that the marketing wave of NoSQL
has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that's been around for quite a
while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all,
everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend
of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very profitable
either.So, what'</p><p>5 0.16629152 <a title="670-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.16474921 <a title="670-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-20-Building_a_data_cycle_at_LinkedIn_with_Hadoop_and_Project_Voldemort.html">634 high scalability-2009-06-20-Building a data cycle at LinkedIn with Hadoop and Project Voldemort</a></p>

<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source.
There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity:
from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-
value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there's Riak, Tokyo Cabinet,
Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL
products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft
Windows. I'm going to outline what's available now and briefly touch on some
opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.You

<p>Introduction: Morgan Tocker has an awesome article and comment thread in theMySQL
Performance BlogaboutWhen should you store serialized objects in the
database?Before the NoSQL age is was very common to simulate schemalessness by
storing blobs in MySQL. Sharding was implemented by running multiple MySQL
instances and spreading writes across them. While not ideal for the purpose,
developers felt comfortable with MySQL. They knew how to install it, back it
up, replicate it, in short:  they knew how to make it work. Yet they also
needed to store objects without the penalty of joins. Searches and aggregate
queries were handled by indexes kept in separate tables, this offloaded the
fast path to objects.This all made perfect sense. Usually we just want stuff
to work and going with what you know is often the best path to that goal. And
what we have known is MySQL. All the different pros and cons of this approach
are covered wonderfully in the post.But the world has changed. With the same
goals in mind I do</p><p>6 0.7516554 <a title="670-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-29-Digg_-_Looking_to_the_Future_with_Cassandra.html">732 high scalability-2009-10-29-Digg - Looking to the Future with Cassandra</a></p>

Databases by Robin Mathew.Update 6:NoSQL : If Only it Was that Easy. BJ Clark
lays down the law on which databases are scalable: Tokyo - NO, Redis - NO,
Voldemort - YES, MongoDB - Not Yet, Cassandra - Probably, Amazon S3 - YES * 2,
MySQL - NO.The real thing to point out is that if you are being held back from
making something super awesome because you can't choose a database, you are
doing it wrong.Update 5:Exciting stuff happening in Japan at this Key-Value

<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing
network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:
Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework by Luigi Rizzo. As commodity
networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all
those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen? Abstract:Today
10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On
these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern
operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between
the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful
hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the
design of device drivers and network stacks.The netmap framework is a
promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the
engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary
overhead and moves traffic up to 40</p><p>5 0.80475104 <a title="670-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-15-Isilon_Clustred_Storage_System.html">12 high scalability-2007-07-15-Isilon Clustred Storage System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheIsilon IQfamily of clustered storage systems was designed from the ground
up to meet the needs of data-intensive enterprises and high-performance
computing environments. By combining Isilon's OneFS® operating system software
with the latest advances in industry-standard hardware, Isilon delivers
modular, pay-as-you-grow, enterprise-class clustered storage systems. OneFS,
with TrueScale™ technology, powers the industry's first and only storage
system that enables linear or independent scaling of performance and capacity.
This new flexible and tunable system, featuring a robust suite of clustered
storage software applications, provides customers with an "out of the box"
solution that is fully optimized for the widest range of applications and
workflow needs.* Scales from 4 TB ti 1 PB* Throughput of up to 10 GB per

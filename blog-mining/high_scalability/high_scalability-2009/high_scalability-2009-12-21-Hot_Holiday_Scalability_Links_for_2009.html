<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.We tend to think compute
of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of
innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will
reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the
datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of
datacenters in the future.Given the diversity of compute resources it's
reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API.
They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those
specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough
to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever
they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the

resources it doesn't have</p><p>6 0.12931156 <a title="753-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-01-What_Will_Kill_the_Cloud%3F.html">768 high scalability-2010-02-01-What Will Kill the Cloud?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.There's a pattern,
already begun, that has accelerated by the need for applications to scale and
increase complexity, the end result of which will be that applications give up
their independence and enter a kind offeudal relationshipwith their platform
provider.To understand how this process works, like a glacier slowly and
inevitably carving out a deep river valley, here's the type of question I get
quite a lot:I've learned PHP and MySQL and I've built a web app that I HOPE
will receive traffic comparable to eBay's with a similar database structure. I
see all these different opinions and different techniques and languages being
recommended and it's so confusing. All I want is perhaps one book or one
website that focuses on PHP and MySQL and building a large database web app
like eBay's. Does something like this exist?I'm always at a loss for words

<p>Introduction: Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the
Ambient Cloud. The only independent platform most of us will have access to
capable of hosting planet-scale applications is the Ambient Cloud. It forms a
sort of digital potluck where everyone contributes memory, network, and other
compute resources from whatever they happen to have available. Top 10 Internet
Startup Scalability Killers. Strategies taken fromThe Art of Scalability. 1\.
Thinking Scalability Is Just About Technology; 2. Overuse of Synchronous
Calls; 3. Failure to Weed or Seed Soon Enough; 4. Inappropriate Use of
Databases; 5. Cesspools Instead of Swim Lanes; 6. Reliance on Vertical Scale;

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>4 0.87130892 <a title="753-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex_Architecture.html">258 high scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex Architecture</a></p>

at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I
thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with
Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:3.5 billion pages in the search

<p>Introduction: In It's Time for Low Latency  Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's
time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency
datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for
programarchitectures will be revolutionary.  Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished
Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer
resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are
interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter
into single computer. Abstract from the paper:The operating systems community
has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays
in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs
round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will
be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation
delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it
will be up to us to ﬁnish the job and see</p><p>6 0.86303979 <a title="753-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_17%2C_2012.html">1195 high scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 17, 2012</a></p>

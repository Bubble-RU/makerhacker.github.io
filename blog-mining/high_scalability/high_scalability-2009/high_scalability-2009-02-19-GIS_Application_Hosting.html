<p>Introduction: Every system has a limit. Although most providers of web hosting services
claim to provide "Unlimited", we all know that any web server has physical
limits which is usually hard to scale up, especially without taking the
machine offline.Most IT hosting companies use stand-alone servers to provide
website hosting. A very few use any form of HA clusters. Those web hosts that
use stand-alone servers do not feature scalability. Every time they need to
upgrade the machines they use, major changes to the systems have to be made.
Others which that do clustering are more scalable. They would add additional
servers to their systems or to remove machines from the set-ups. There are
many scenarios and different models of doing clustering. However I'm not the
one who would write about them. Plus this is not the purpose of this
article.The reason to start this article at High Scalability is to present

<p>Introduction: InCool spatial algos with Neo4j: Part 1 - Routing with A* in RubyPeter
Neubauer not only does a fantastic job explaining a complicated routing
algorithm using the graph databaseNeo4j, but he surfaces an interesting
architectural conundrum:make it really fast so work can be done on the reads
or do all the work on the writes so the reads are really fast.The money quote
pointing out the competing options is:[Being] able to do these calculations in
sub-second speeds on graphs of millions of roads and waypoints makes it
possible in many cases to abandon the normal approach ofprecomputing indexes
with K/V stores and be able to put routing into the critical path with the
possibility to adapt to the live conditions and build highly personalized and
dynamic spatial services.ďťżThe poster boys for the precompute strategy

<p>Introduction: Caching/data-grids are going through a similar evolution to databases. As with
databases, we started by using caching as an embedded service to the
application. Now we are in the phase where we need to be able to share the
data between multiple applications, or in cases where we don't want to share
the data, we need to be able to share the resources for managing the data,
while keeping a high degree of isolation.The demand for these sort of
requirements becomes much more common with SOA or SaaS-based applications. As
we approach the next generation of middleware and data-centers, it becomes
clear that we cannot move to the next wave of virtualization and cloud
computing without a strong security and isolation solution that is built-in to
all layers of our application and middleware.</p><p>5 0.075201079 <a title="515-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-02-WEB_hosting_Select.html">200 high scalability-2008-01-02-WEB hosting Select</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello, I am new to the back end side of things. Love this web site.Read all
comments about Amazon hosting, actually I really like Amazon S3 but concerned
that it may not be sufficient for my computing needs. And E3 just not too
sure.What about hosting sites like host monster? Their prices seem amazing.
Are they too good to be true? What are the cons and what are the things I
should be considering? I am concerned about costs, but I want user experience
to be world class.I am creating a media sharing site.Any help will be
great.ThanksFahad</p><p>6 0.073425114 <a title="515-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-17-Database_People_Hating_on_MapReduce.html">216 high scalability-2008-01-17-Database People Hating on MapReduce</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>3 0.64291435 <a title="515-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-26-Web_2.0_Killed_the_Middleware_Star.html">1087 high scalability-2011-07-26-Web 2.0 Killed the Middleware Star</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It started out innocently enough with a simple question, "What exactly *is*
the model for PaaS services scalability? If based on HTTP/REST API
integration, fairly easy. If native middleware… input?" You'll forgive the odd
phrasing - Twitter's limitations sometimes make conversations of this nature …
interesting.The discussion culminated in what appeared to be the sentiment
that middleware was mostly obsolete with respect to PaaS.THE OLD WAYVery
briefly for those of you who are more infrastructure / network minded than
application architecture fluent, let's review the traditional middleware-based
application architecture.Generally speaking, middleware - a.k.a. JMS, MQ
Series and most recently, ESB - is leveraged as means to enable a publish-
subscribe model of sharing data. Basically, it's an integration pattern, but
no one really likes to admit that because of the connotations associated with
the evil word "integration" in the enterprise. But that's what it's used for -
to integrate ap</p><p>4 0.64245576 <a title="515-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-01-Hot_Trend%3A__Move_Behavior_to_Data_for_a_New_Interactive_Application_Architecture.html">933 high scalability-2010-11-01-Hot Trend:  Move Behavior to Data for a New Interactive Application Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Two forces account for the trend of moving behavior to data: larger values
used in key-value stores and spotty cloud networks. For some time we've seen
functions pushed close to data with MapReduce, which is a batch process, but
we are now seeing this model extend to interactive applications, which match
the current emphasis on highly scalable, real-time, event driven
applications.To see the trend look at the increasing support for collocated
behavior at the datastore level:HBase is implementing a coprocessor
feature.Cassandra is also implementing coprocessors or plugins.Membase is
creatingNodeCode, which is a process for executing functions on data in the
database.MongoDB supportsJavaScript stored procedures. VoltDB hasJava based
stored procedures.In-memory DataGridproducts like GigaSpaces have been doing
something like this forever. The key difference historically being GigaSpaces'
tight integration with languages C++ and Java, instead of using a language
agnostic protocol based appr</p><p>5 0.63117868 <a title="515-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-22-Applying_Scalability_Patterns_to_Infrastructure_Architecture.html">906 high scalability-2010-09-22-Applying Scalability Patterns to Infrastructure Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application
delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to
addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application
delivery tier of the data center. By Lori Mac Vittie, F5 Networks The "High
Scalability" blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not
disappoint with a posthighlighting a set of scalability design patternsthat
was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on "6 Ways to
Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way." Credit:Michael
Chow/azcentral.com  This particular post caught my attention primarily because
although I've touched on many of these patterns in the past, I've never
thought to call them what they are: scalability patterns. That's probably a
side-effect of forgetting thatbuilding an architecture of any kind is at its
core computer scienceand thus algorithms and design patterns are applicable to

<p>Introduction: All,I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for
sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and
other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers.
I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.Could anyone share
their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube
etc..?Thank you,Regards,Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>5 0.56065875 <a title="515-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-UK_Based_CDN.html">324 high scalability-2008-05-19-UK Based CDN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw
up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK. If they're outside the
UK but have decent support then also include. The service must be cheap and
not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it
shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered
whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK
compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a
small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space. Would S3 be a good
starting point? What is the service like? I hear mixed reviews about it.Many
thanks,Jim</p><p>6 0.5567416 <a title="515-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you look at the early days of this blog, when web scalability was still in
its heady bloom of youth, many of the articles had to do with
leveragingMySQLandmemcached. Exciting times. Shard MySQL to handle high write
loads, cache objects in memcached to handle high read loads, and then write a
lot of glue code to make it all work together. That was state of the art, that
was how it was done. The architecture of many major sites still follow this
pattern today, largely because with enough elbow grease, it works.This was a
pre-cloud, relational database dominated world, built from parts scrounged
from the remnants of enterprises and datacenters past.TwitterandDiggstarted in
this era, but are evolving into something different, as scaling pressures
increase and new purpose built technologies pop into being.With a little
perspective, it's clear the MySQL+memcached era is passing. It will stick
around for a while. Old technologies seldom fade away completely. Some still
ride horses. Some st</p><p>3 0.11043788 <a title="648-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-20-35%2B_Use_Cases_for_Choosing_Your_Next_NoSQL_Database.html">1064 high scalability-2011-06-20-35+ Use Cases for Choosing Your Next NoSQL Database</a></p>

Questions To Ask When Considering A NoSQL Database. We've even had a webinar
What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for Scalable Web
Applications.Now we get to the point of considering use cases and which
systems might be appropriate for those use cases.What are your options?First,
let's cover what are the various data models. These have been adapted fromEmil

Notes.Data model: Collections of documents, which contain key-value
collections.Example: CouchDB, MongoDB Good at: Natural data modeling.
Programmer friendly. Rapid development. Web friendly, CRUD.Graph

and 10 different NoSQL products and how their 1) support for multiple
datacenters,  2) the ability to add new machines to a live cluster

Persistence Design. The 10 systems reviewed are: Cassandra, CouchDB, HBase,
MongoDB, Neo4J, Redis, Riak, Scalaris, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort.A very
thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the
article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of
approaches to not being a relational database.Related ArticlesNOSQL = Not Only

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at

<p>Introduction: Update: Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was
wrong about what he meant. His real point:The meaning of the statement was
that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a
standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a
high priority task for them.At the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto, an audience
member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really
interesting:NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.The
idea being that NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance,
etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its
name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships.
With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to
implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed
usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it's not
about data.My</p><p>4 0.71104223 <a title="648-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-05-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_November_5th%2C_2010.html">935 high scalability-2010-11-05-Hot Scalability Links For November 5th, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: So much good stuff this week...Adrian Cockcroft Compares NoSQL Availability
Models. Let's risk feeding the CAP trolls, and try to get some insight into
the differences between the many NoSQL contenders. Adrian asks how each NoSQL
product will add a movie to its favorites list, read it back, and how this
works across availability zones. Much trickier than it sounds with multiple
writers. Cassandra and MongoDB answer back.Stuff the Internet Says:@jerng:

<p>Introduction: The world of NoSQL and alternative database implementations (i.e. non-
relational) is deeply fascinating to me. I can't help but be swept up in the
whirl of planet-scale web development scalability techniques and the evolution
of how developers think about building their applications knowing that with
success comes the inevitable need to scale to levels almost unimaginable just
five or ten years ago.I'm going to make a prediction: Developers will be
expected to understand the fundamentals of how different database systems can
be applied within a singular application; their strengths and weaknesses, and
when it is appropriate to leverage them.There's a lot out there about scaling
relational databases. Partitioning your data over application-managed shards
is a topic that has seen its fair share of attention. But I think there's a
whole slew over NoSQL databases that have been built and designed by some very
smart people that are new enough that their internals aren't well understood

<p>Introduction: Pinterest co-founder Paul Sciarrashared a bit about their stackon Quora:Python
+ heavily-modified Django at the application layerTornado and (very
selectively) node.js as web-servers.  Memcached and membase / redis for
object- and logical-caching, respectively.  RabbitMQ as a message queue.
Nginx, HAproxy and Varnish for static-delivery and load-balancing.Persistent
data storage using MySQL.  MrJob on EMR for map-reduce.Git.Alex Popescu

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose
limits (GAE Quotas,Fotolog,Facebook) as a means of protecting a website
against service destroyingtraffic spikes. Twitter will reportedlylimit the
number followersto 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow
Twitter to make some bank bygoing freemiumand charging for adding more
followers.Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting
aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established
ecosystem?One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let
everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is,
however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are
will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service.
Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.Now in Twitter's
case the people with the most followers tend to be opinion leaderswho shape
much of the blognet echo</p><p>same-blog 3 0.85199559 <a title="648-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-It_Must_be_Crap_on_Relational_Dabases_Week_.html">648 high scalability-2009-07-02-It Must be Crap on Relational Dabases Week </a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's hard to be a relational database lately. After years of faithful service
everywhere you look the world is turning against you:Recently at theNoSQL
conference150 revolutionaries met with their new anti-RDBMS arms suppliers.
And you know what happens when revolutionaries are motivated, educated,
funded, and well armed.The revolution has gone mainstream when Computerworld
writesNo to SQL? Anti-database movement gains steam. It's not just whispers
anymore, it's everywhere.And perennial revolutionary Michael Stonebraker runs
from blog to blog shouting theThe End of a DBMS Era (Might be Upon Us).
Relational vendors are selling legacy software, are 50x slower than other
alternatives, and that can not stand.The Greek Chorus onHacker Newssings of
anger and lies.Certainly some say stick with the past. It's your fault, you
aren't doing it right, give us another chance and all will be as it ever was.

was King.But i</p><p>4 0.80353975 <a title="648-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-18-How_to_deal_with_an_I-O_bottleneck_to_disk%3F.html">251 high scalability-2008-02-18-How to deal with an I-O bottleneck to disk?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.They're using a static server to
deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that
the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on
serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.I'm curious how other
people have dealt with this situation.Seperating into two different servers
would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the
premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created
in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>5 0.80334944 <a title="648-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-25-Relating_business%2C_systems_%26_technology_during_turbulent_time_-By_John_Zachman_.html">523 high scalability-2009-02-25-Relating business, systems & technology during turbulent time -By John Zachman </a></p>

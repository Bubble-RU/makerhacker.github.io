you may or may not have read before. I of course take some pains to extract
all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules. What
really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDBWill be the biggest new

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block, CTO atRockThePost.com, a crowdfunding company, haswritten a
nice set of tipsfor smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a
small two person development team. Their service has a typical small scale
structure:PHP's Zend Framework 2Two m1.medium for web serversELB to split the
loadmaster/slave MySQL databaseSiege for load testingThe very sensible tips
that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: Use PHP's APC feature.
APC is opcode cache that is "really a requirement in order for a website to
have a chance at performing well."Put everything that's not a .php request on
a CDN. Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on
S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused
them to serve directly from S3.Don't make connections to other servers in your
PHP code. Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down
processing. Use the APC key/value store for data storage and Varnish for

clicks after being mentioned on Slashdot. Sure, we now have the "Digg effect"
and other hot new stars, but Slashdot was the original. And like many stars
from generations past, Slashdot plays the elder statesman's role with with
class, dignity, and restraint. Yet with millions and millions of users
Slashdot is still box office gold and more than keeps up with the young'ins.
And with age comes the wisdom of learning how to handle all those users. Just

<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture
forPoppen.de, a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be
careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they
manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new,
using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached,
RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.What is Poppen.de?Poppen.de (NSFW) is
the top dating website in Germany, and while it may be a small site compared
to giants like Flickr or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to
learn from if you are starting to get some scaling problems.The Stats2.000.000

<p>Introduction: Cloud-based services for all things digital will either drive - or die by -
bandwidthConsumers, by definition, consume. In the realm of the Internet, they
consume far more than they produce. Or so it's been in the past. Broadband
connectivity across all providers have long offered asymmetric network feeds
because it mirrored reality: an HTTP request is significantly smaller than its
corresponding response, and in general web-based activity is heavily biased
toward fat download and thin upload speeds. The term "broadband" is really a
misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very
narrowband of a typical consumer's upload speed.cloud computing, or to be more
accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the
status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing
all things digital "in the cloud", network providers must consider the impact
on them - and the satisfaction of their customer base with performance over

<p>Introduction: Inthis posti wrote my view on the anti SQL database movement and where the
alternative approach fits in:- SQL databases are not going away anytime soon.-
The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.- There
is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions
alongside traditional SQL databases.In addition to the options that was
mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative
approach and how that fits into the puzzle. I used a real life scenario:

approach was the only option they could scale and meet their application

<p>Introduction: Comet is anactive distributed key-value storebuilt at the University of
Washington. The paper describing Comet is Comet: An active distributed key-
value store, there are also slides, and a MP3 of a presentation given atOSDI
'10. Here's a succinct overview of Comet:Today's cloud storage services, such
as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety
of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes,
fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility
first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption
keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage
service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their
data's behavior inside the storage service.I found this paper quite
interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-
value store, which turns it into what might called a key-code store. This is

<p>Introduction: Update 4::Introducing Digg's IDDB Infrastructureby Joe Stump.IDDB is a way to
partition both indexes (e.g. integer sequences and unique character indexes)
and actual tables across multiple storage servers (MySQL and MemcacheDB are
currently supported with more to follow).Update 3::Scaling Digg and Other Web
Applications.Update 2::How Digg WorksandHow Digg Really Works(wear ear plugs).
Brought to you straight from Digg's blog. A very succinct explanation of the
major elements of the Digg architecture while tracing a request through the
system. I've updated this profile with the new information.Update:Digg now
receives 230 million plus page views per month and 26 million unique visitors
- traffic that necessitated major internal upgrades.Traffic generated by
Digg's over 22 million famously info-hungry users and 230 million page views
can crash an unsuspecting website head-on into its CPU, memory, and bandwidth
limits. How does Digg handle billions of requests a month?Site:

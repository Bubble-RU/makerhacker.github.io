<p>Introduction: Hi,I am very glad that this site exists, as I have learned more about
clustering on this site than for quite some time reading stuff elsewhere.
Oftentimes, one can find lots of material about clustering, but the practical
real-life information is missing. Not so wih this site.I am currently planning
the development of an application which has a lot of enterprise features and
requirements. On the other side (if the tiny chance of success might strike
us), this application would not be an in-house application of a financial
institution, or something like that, but some kind of communit/web 2.0 web
site. Thus it is an enterprise application with (hopefully, but surely
unlikely) the user numbers of a social networking site. Each user initiated
transaction involves huge resssources business logic wise (including insane
amounts of encryption oprations).Of course, I do not intend to induldge into
premature scaling, but to invest every minute I have into the implementation
of business logic fe</p><p>5 0.14684719 <a title="524-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-What_is_Network-based_Application_Virtualization_and_Why_Do_You_Need_It%3F.html">924 high scalability-2010-10-21-What is Network-based Application Virtualization and Why Do You Need It?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>6 0.11065726 <a title="524-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-19-Planetary-Scale_Computing_Architectures_for_Electronic_Trading_and_How_Algorithms_Shape_Our_World.html">1599 high scalability-2014-02-19-Planetary-Scale Computing Architectures for Electronic Trading and How Algorithms Shape Our World</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A bit over a month ago Amazon experienced its infamous AWS outage in the US
East Region. As a cloud evangelist, I was intrigued by the history of the
outage as it occurred. There were great posts during and after the outage from
those who went down. But more interestingly for me as architect were the
detailed posts of those who managed to survive the outage relatively unharmed,
such as SimpleGeo, Netflix,SmugMug, SmugMug's CTO, Twilio, Bizo and
others.Reading through the experience of others, I tried to summarize
thepatterns, principles and best practicesthat emerged from these posts, as I
believe we can learn a lot from them on how to design our business
applications to truly leverage on the benefits that the cloud offers in high
availability and scalability.The main principles, patterns and best practices
are:Design for failureStateless and autonomous servicesRedundant hot copies

<p>Introduction: Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs
in a private cloud or data center and bursts into a public cloud when the
demand for computing capacity spikes. The advantage of such a hybrid cloud
deployment is that an organization only pays for extra compute resources when
they are needed. (Source: SearchCloudComputing)Neal Sample the former CTO -
X.commerce at eBay gave an interesting talk last year on the economic benefit
of Cloud Bursting. Neal pointed out eBay traffic statistics and showed some
real numbers of the business impact of bursting peak load activities using on-
demand cloud resources as presented in the diagram from his talk.In order to
use cloud bursting effectively we need to address the following set of
challenges:Workload migration- specifically the ability to clone our
application environment in a consistent way across sites in an on demand
fashion.Data Synchronization- The ability to maintain real time copy of the

<p>Introduction: Social Developer Summit- June 29, 2010 - San Franciso, CAA meeting of the
technically social - Building, scaling, and profiting in a social ageWhether
it'ssocial games, social news, social discovery, social search, or other forms
of social solutions, developers today are facing new hurdles in building
instantly scalable products. As new technologies emerge to address the
challenges faced by social application developers, it's increasingly important
to come together for knowledge sharing purposes.The first Social Developer
Summit will bring together social application developers todiscuss the
challenges, solutions, and best practices for building applications in the
rapidly expanding social web economy. At the Social Developer Summit, industry
experts will share tips and case studies for building high performance social
web products.For more information please take a look atSocial Developer

<p>Introduction: Many web applications, including eBanking, Trading, eCommerce and Online
Gaming, face large, fluctuating loads. In this post will describe how to
achieve Right Sizing using virtualization and cloud computing. Will use a
standard JEE web application to demonstrate how auto-scaling works on AWS
Cloud without changing your application code.</p><p>4 0.87776446 <a title="524-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-10-Let%27s_Play_a_Game_of_Take_It_or_Leave_It__-_Game_1.html">1608 high scalability-2014-03-10-Let's Play a Game of Take It or Leave It  - Game 1</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The way this game is played is you read a few statements on some hot topics
below. If you agree with a statement then you "take it"; if you disagree then
you "leave it." And if you are so moved please write a convincing comment as
to why. Got it?Snowden vs. the State.Snowden represents true the spirit of
freedom and is not a threat to all we hold dear.Walled Garden vs. Federated
Freedom.The Walled Garden has won the last decade. The cycle of life will
return the balance and federated services will once again win the day.Mobile +
messaging vs. Le Web.Mobile + messaging is eating search and the web, changing
the way things are found, discovered, and bought.Fiat vs.
Cryptocurrency.BitCoin has had its 400 million dollars of fame, it's on the
way out, a tulip gone out of bloom.True Detective vs. The Field.True Detective
is the best show on TV, ever. Wired and Breaking Bad need not apply.</p><p>5 0.81015736 <a title="524-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-Dyrad.html">591 high scalability-2009-05-06-Dyrad</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:MapReduce and PageRank Notes from Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau's Fall 2008
class. Collects interesting facts about MapReduce and PageRank. For example,
the history of the solution to searching for the term "flu" is traced through
multiple generations of technology.With Google entering the cloud space
withGoogle AppEngineand a maturingHadoopproduct, the MapReduce scaling
approach might finally become a standard programmer practice. This is the best
paper on the subject and is an excellent primer on a content-addressable
memory future.Some interesting stats from the paper: Google executes 100k
MapReduce jobs each day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day;
more than 10k MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual
processor with gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.One common criticism ex-
Googlers have is that it takes months to get up and be productive in the
Google environment. Hopefully a way will be found to lower the learning curve
and make programmers</p><p>4 0.10700126 <a title="644-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-03-Storage_Systems_for_High_Scalable_Systems_presentation.html">693 high scalability-2009-09-03-Storage Systems for High Scalable Systems presentation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The High Scalable Systems (i.e. Websites) such as: Google, Facebook, Amazon,
etc. need high scalable storage system that can deal with huge amount of data
with high availability and reliability. Building large systems on top of a
traditional RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This
presentation explores the landscape of new technologies available today to
augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability.Remember: All

<p>Introduction: Update 5:PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews And 32 Billion Images A
MonthUpdate 4:Jeff Atwoodcosts out Markus' scale up approach against a scale
out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as
interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his
software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive
scale up works better for his needs.Update 3:POF now has 200 million imagesand
serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS
RamSan to handle the load. Also upgraded to a core database machine with 512
GB of RAM, 32 CPU's, SQLServer 2008 and Windows 2008.Update 2: This seems to
be aPOF Peer1 love fest infomercial. It's pretty content free, but the
production values are high. Lots of quirky sounds and fish swimming on the
screen.Update: by Facebook standards Read/WriteWeb says POF is worth a coolone
billion dollars. It helps to talk like Dr. Evil when saying it out
loud.PlentyOfFish i</p><p>6 0.10166007 <a title="644-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-22-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_PlentyOfFish_Architecture.html">1361 high scalability-2012-11-22-Gone Fishin': PlentyOfFish Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The recent Data-Intensive Computing Symposium brought together experts in
system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific
applications, and information-based applications to better understand existing
capabilities in the development and application of large-scale computing
systems, and to explore future opportunities.Google Fellow Jeff Dean had a
very interesting presentation on Handling Large Datasets at Google: Current
Systems and Future Directions. He discussed:• Hardware infrastructure•
Distributed systems infrastructure:–Scheduling system–GFS–BigTable–MapReduce•
Challenges and Future Directions–Infrastructure that spans all
datacenters–More automationIt is really like a "How does Google work"

<p>Introduction: Hello, I am new to the back end side of things. Love this web site.Read all
comments about Amazon hosting, actually I really like Amazon S3 but concerned
that it may not be sufficient for my computing needs. And E3 just not too
sure.What about hosting sites like host monster? Their prices seem amazing.
Are they too good to be true? What are the cons and what are the things I
should be considering? I am concerned about costs, but I want user experience
to be world class.I am creating a media sharing site.Any help will be
great.ThanksFahad</p><p>5 0.54022676 <a title="644-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-25-Should_JSPs_be_avoided_for_high_scalability%3F.html">131 high scalability-2007-10-25-Should JSPs be avoided for high scalability?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The Future of the Parallelism and its ChallengesResearch and education in
Parallel computing technologies is more important than ever. Here I present a
perspective on the past contributions, current status, and future direction of
the parallelism technologies.While machine power will grow impressively,
increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be driving force in
computing in the foreseeable future. This ongoing shift toward parallel
architectural paradigms is one of the greatest challenges for the
microprocessor and software industries. In 2005, Justin Ratter, chief
technology officer of Intel Corporation, said ‘We are at the cusp of a
transition to multicore, multithreaded architectures, and we still have not
demonstrated the ease of programming the move will require…’Key points:A

<p>Introduction: Oh, you don't have a Quantum Computer Lab staffed with researchers? Well,
Google does. Here they areon G+. To learn what they are up to the Verge hasA
first look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab. The lab is partnership
between NASA, Google, and a 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum computer.  One result
from the lab is:The first practical application has been on Google Glass, as
engineers put the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it
to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks. For
engineering reasons, the quantum processor can never be installed in Glass,
but together with Google's conventional server centers, it can point the way
to a better blink-detecting algorithm. That would allow the Glass processor to
detect blinks with better accuracy and using significantly less power. If
successful, it could be an important breakthrough for wink-triggered apps,
which have struggled with the task so far.Google thinksquantum computing has a

<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle, infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made areally interesting
statementabout the economics of scale in the datacenter:We've shown that when
you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared
to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a
factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.My
first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm
crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using
technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency
requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly
automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a
simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper
to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>6 0.36879581 <a title="644-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_4%2C_2011.html">984 high scalability-2011-02-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 4, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This was the first architecture profile on HighScalability. IMHO LiveJournal
was really the start of the openness on how to build stuff at scale, setting
the whole industry off with an excellent role model. They wrote about their
architecture, they open sourced their tools, they showed that success wasn't
based on keeping secrets, and they set forth principles still followed by our
rather amazing industry. No other industry is so open and cooperative, with
their eyes cast so far forward, intent on building cool stuff. When all around
seems dark it would be good to keep this little bit of light in mind...A

<p>Introduction: It's a little known fact that Santa Clause was an early queue innovator. Faced
with the problem of delivering a planet full of presents in one night, Santa,
in his hacker's workshop, created a Present Distribution System using
thousands of region based priority present queues for continuous delivery by
the Rudolphs. Rudolphs? You didn't think there was only one Rudolph did you?
Presents are delivered in parallel by a cluster of sleighs, each with
redundant reindeer in a master-master configuration. Each Rudolph is a cluster
leader and they coordinate work using an early and more magical version of the
ZooKeeper protocol.Programmers have followed Santa's lead and you can find
amessage queue in nearly every major architecture profile onHighScalability.
Historically they may have been introduced after a first generation
architecture needed to scale up from their two tier system into something a
little more capable (asynchronicity, work dispatch, load buffering, database
offloading, etc).</p><p>5 0.7092306 <a title="491-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-01-8_Commonly_Used_Scalable_System_Design_Patterns.html">951 high scalability-2010-12-01-8 Commonly Used Scalable System Design Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ricky HoinScalable System Design Patternshas created a great list of
scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary
of the patterns are:Load Balancer- a dispatcher determines which worker
instance will handle a request based on different policies.Scatter and Gather-
a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will
compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will
consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the
client.Result Cache- a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been
made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save
the actual execution.Shared Space- all workers monitors information from the
shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The
information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached.Pipe and
Filter- all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.MapReduce-
targets batch jobs where disk I/O is th</p><p>6 0.69293904 <a title="491-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Letting_Clients_Know_What%27s_Changed%3A_Push_Me_or_Pull_Me%3F.html">205 high scalability-2008-01-10-Letting Clients Know What's Changed: Push Me or Pull Me?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

<p>Introduction: Update:New Gearman Server & Library in C, MySQL UDFs.Gearmanis an open
sourcemessage queuingsystem that makes it easy to do distributed job
processing using multiple languages. With Gearman you:farm out work to other
machines, dispatching function calls to machines that are better suited to do
work, to do work in parallel, to load balance lots of function calls, to call
functions between languages, spread CPU usage around your network.Gearman is
used by companies like LiveJournal, Yahoo!, and Digg. Digg, for example, runs
300,000 jobs a day through Gearman without any issues. Most large sites use
something similar. Why would anyone ever even need a message queuing
system?breakMessage queuing is a handy way to move work off your web servers
(like image manipulation), to generate thousands of documents in the
background, to run the multiple requests in parallel needed to build a web
page, or to perform tasks that can comfortably be run in the background and

<p>Introduction: Authored by Chris Fregly:  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS
Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.Ahead of the
upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi's
recentpresentationat an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few
of my recentFluxcapacitor.com consulting engagements, I've compiled a list of
10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS.1) Query AWS resource
metadata Can't remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge
cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?
awsnow.infois the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.
Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You're in luck.
There's now aREST API, as well!Note:  These are default soft limits and will
vary by account.2) Tame your S3 buckets Delete an entire S3 bucket with a
single CLI command:  aws s3 rb s3://\--forceRecursively copy a
local directory to S3:aws</p><p>6 0.734635 <a title="491-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-21-9_Principles_of_High_Performance_Programs.html">1652 high scalability-2014-05-21-9 Principles of High Performance Programs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There’s some amount of debate whether Facebook  really  crossed over the one trillion page view per month threshold. While one report says it did,  another respected firm says it did not ; that its monthly page views are a mere 467 billion per month.


In the big scheme of things, the discrepancy is somewhat irrelevant, as neither show the  true  load on Facebook’s infrastructure – which is far more impressive a set of numbers than its externally measured “page view” metric.  Mashable reported in “ Facebook Surpasses 1 Trillion Pageviews per Month ” that the social networking giant saw “approximately 870 million unique visitors in June and 860 million in July” and followed up with some per visitor statistics, indicating “each visitor averaged approximately 1,160 page views in July and 40 per visit — enormous by any standard. Time spent on the site was around 25 minutes per user.”


From an architectural standpoint it’s not  just  about the page views. It’s about requests and responses,</p><p>4 0.25095019 <a title="720-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-13-Why_are_Facebook%2C_Digg%2C_and_Twitter_so_hard_to_scale%3F.html">721 high scalability-2009-10-13-Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things). That's why scaling Facebook is hard  says Jeff Rothschild , Vice President of Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional web sites? Let's find out.
 
Traditional websites are easier to scale than social networking sites for two reasons:
  
 They usually access only their own data and common cached data. 
 Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one time. 
  
Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around single records using  distributed hashing schemes . And since only a few percent of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little</p><p>5 0.24512517 <a title="720-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Hive_-_A_Petabyte_Scale_Data_Warehouse_using_Hadoop.html">624 high scalability-2009-06-10-Hive - A Petabyte Scale Data Warehouse using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post about using Hive and Hadoop for analytics comes straight from Facebook engineers.  Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis and business intelligence applications used by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook products are also based on analytics.   These products range from simple reporting applications like Insights for the Facebook Ad Network, to more advanced kind such as Facebook's Lexicon product.   As a result a flexible infrastructure that caters to the needs of these diverse applications and users and that also scales up in a cost effective manner with the ever increasing amounts of data being generated on Facebook, is critical. Hive and Hadoop are the technologies that we have used to address these requirements at Facebook.

<p>Introduction: Web Log Storming  is an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows. The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and how it fits into your desired scenario.  Web Log Storming does far more than just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.  In other words, analyze your web logs like never before!   It's easy to track sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed.

<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: " High Performance at Massive Scale –  Lessons learned at Facebook ". The abstract for the talk is:
  

Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web architectures.

  
There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into  later, but I thought you might want a head start on learning how Facebook handles 30K+ machines,</p><p>3 0.90143281 <a title="720-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-22-Paper%3A_The_Case_for_RAMClouds%3A_Scalable_High-Performance_Storage_Entirely_in_DRAM_.html">726 high scalability-2009-10-22-Paper: The Case for RAMClouds: Scalable High-Performance Storage Entirely in DRAM </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stanford Info Lab is taking pains to document a direction we've been moving for a while now, using RAM not just as a cache, but as the primary storage medium. Many  quality products  have built on this model. Even if the vision isn't radical, the paper does produce a lot of data backing up the transition, which is in itself helpful. From the The Abstract:   
 Disk-oriented approaches to online storage are becoming increasingly problematic: they do not scale grace-fully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications, and improvements in disk capacity have far out-stripped improvements in access latency and bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity servers. We believe that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access lat</p><p>4 0.89984697 <a title="720-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-03-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Sep_3%2C_2010.html">893 high scalability-2010-09-03-Hot Scalability Links For Sep 3, 2010</a></p>

  jmtan24 : Funny that whenever a high scalability article comes out, it always mention the shared nothing approach

<p>Introduction: This post is by  Hasan Ceylan , an Open Source software enthusiast from Istanbul. 
 
I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.
  Those were the days our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to use the curse called “XDoclet”.  On the other side, our company grew steadily, our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of money.

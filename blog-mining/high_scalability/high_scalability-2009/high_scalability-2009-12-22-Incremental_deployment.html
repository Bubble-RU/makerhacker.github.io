<p>Introduction: When you’re looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium  ecosystem, one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular  breed of fish is amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are  not, which means if you put them together in a confined space, they’re  going to fight. Viciously. To the death. Responsible aquarists try to  avoid such situations, so careful attention to the  conspecificity  of animals is a must.
 
Now,  while in many respects the data center ecosystem correlates well to an  aquarium ecosystem, in this case it does not. It’s what you usually get,  today, but its not actually the best model. That’s because what you  want in the data center ecosystem – particularly when it extends to  include public  cloud computing   resources – is conspecificity in infrastructure.
 
This  desire and practice is being seen both in enterprise data center  decision making as well as in startups suddenly dealing with massive  growth and increasingly encountering pe</p><p>3 0.10448923 <a title="754-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-29-Sponsored_Post%3A_Apple%2C_Wargaming.net%2C_PagerDuty%2C_HelloSign%2C_CrowdStrike%2C_Gengo%2C_ScaleOut_Software%2C_Couchbase%2C_Tokutek%2C_MongoDB%2C_BlueStripe%2C_AiScaler%2C_Aerospike%2C_LogicMonitor%2C_AppDynamics%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7__.html">1639 high scalability-2014-04-29-Sponsored Post: Apple, Wargaming.net, PagerDuty, HelloSign, CrowdStrike, Gengo, ScaleOut Software, Couchbase, Tokutek, MongoDB, BlueStripe, AiScaler, Aerospike, LogicMonitor, AppDynamics, ManageEngine, Site24x7  </a></p>

<p>Introduction: By Bhavin Turakhia CEO, Directi. Covers:   * Why scalability is important. Viral marketing can result in instant success. With RSS/Ajax/SOA number of requests grow exponentially with user base. Goal is to build a web 2.0 app that can server millions of users with zero downtime.   * Introduction to the variables. Scalability, performance, responsiveness, availability, downtime impact, cost, maintenance effort.   * Introduction to the factors. Platform selection, hardware, application design, database architecture, deployment architecture, storage architecture, abuse prevention, monitoring mechanisms, etc.   * Building our own scalable architecture in incremental steps: vertical scaling, vertical partitioning, horizontal scaling, horizontal partitioning, etc. First buy bigger. Then deploy each service on a separate node. Then increase the number of nudes and load balance. Deal with session management. Remove single points of failure. Use a shared nothing cluster.

<p>Introduction: In  Don’t panic! Here’s how to quickly scale your mobile apps   Mike Maelzer  paints a wonderful picture of how  Avocado , a mobile app for connecting couples, evolved to handle 30x traffic within a few weeks. If you are just getting started then this is a great example to learn from.
 
What I liked: it's well written, packing a lot of useful information in a little space; it's failure driven, showing the process of incremental change driven by purposeful testing and production experience; it shows awareness of what's important, in their case, user signup; a replica setup was used for testing, a nice cloud benefit. 
 
Their Biggest lesson learned is a good one:
  It would have been great to start the scaling process much earlier. Due to time pressure we had to make compromises –like dropping four of our media resizer boxes. While throwing more hardware at some scaling problems does work, it’s less than ideal.

<p>Introduction: Distributed systems are not typically a place domain driven design is applied. Distributed processing projects often start with an overall architecture vision and the idea about a processing model which basically drives the whole thing, including object design if it exists at all. Elaborate object designs are thought of as something that just gets in the way of distribution and performance, so the idea of spending time to apply DDD principles gets rejected in favour of raw throughput and processing power. However, from my experience, some more advanced DDD concepts can significantly improve the performance, scalability and throughput of distributed systems when applied correctly.

<p>Introduction: I follow a certain philosophy when developing system architectures. I assume that very few systems will ever exist in a consistent form for more than a short period of time. What constitutes a “short period of time” differs depending on the specifics of each system, but in an effort to quantify it, I generally find that it falls somewhere between a week and a month.     The driving forces behind the need for an ever changing architecture are largely business requirement based. This is a side effect of the reality that software development, in most cases, is used as a supporting role within the business unit it serves. As business requirements (i.e. additional features, new products, etc.) pour forth, it is the developer’s job to evolve their software system to accommodate these requirements and provide a software based solution to whatever problems lay ahead.     Given that many businesses can be identified as having the above characteristics, I can now begin to explain why I believe t</p><p>4 0.5817461 <a title="754-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-30-NoCAP_%E2%80%93_Part_III_%E2%80%93_GigaSpaces_clustering_explained...html">950 high scalability-2010-11-30-NoCAP – Part III – GigaSpaces clustering explained..</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In many of the recent discussions on the design of large scale systems (a.k.a. Web Scale) it was argued that the right set of tradeoffs for building large scale systems would be to give away  C onsistency for  A vailability and  P artition tolerance. Those arguments relied on the foundation of the CAP theorem developed in early 2000-2002. One of the core principals behind the CAP theorem is that you must choose two out of the three CAP properties. In many of the transactional systems giving away consistency is either impossible or yields a huge complexity in the design of those systems. In this series of posts, I've tried to suggest a different set of tradeoffs in which we could achieve scalability without compromising on consistency. I also argued that rather than choosing only two out of the three CAP properties we could choose various degrees of all three. The degrees would be determined by the most likely availability and partition tolerance scenarios in our specific application.</p><p>5 0.57802403 <a title="754-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-01-The_Pattern_Bible_for_Distributed_Computing.html">400 high scalability-2008-10-01-The Pattern Bible for Distributed Computing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see how!     Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed in a format called   Alexandrian form which draws on constructs used by Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:     The pattern name   The problem the pattern is trying to solve     Context   Solution   Examples   Design rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why experts use it       Patterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context, and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next ‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured col</p><p>6 0.57730854 <a title="754-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-26-Akaros_-_an_open_source_operating_system_for_manycore_architectures.html">1234 high scalability-2012-04-26-Akaros - an open source operating system for manycore architectures</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ladar Levison of Lavabit has written an  incredible article on how  they took a centralized off-the-shelf email server that could handle only few thousand users and built their own custom distributed infrastructure for handling hundreds of thousands of email users.  Lavabit processes 70 gigabytes of data per day, is made up of 26 servers, hosts 260,000 email addresses, and processes 600,000 emails a day. That's a lot of email.   Lavabit's mission has a little edge to it too:
   Lavabit was founded as a direct reaction to the larger free e-mail services available. We felt it was possible to create an e-mail service that was fast, reliable, feature rich and didn't achieve profitability by prostituting its user base to marketers.   
What I really like about this article is that Lavabit has some challenging elements in dealing with different email protocols while being able to scale to a lot of users. There's more going on than just trying to scale out a database.

<p>Introduction: We saw in  Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?  scaling social networks is a lot harder than you might think. This paper,  Scaling Online Social Networks without Pains , from a team at Telefonica Research in Spain hopes to meet the challenge of status distribution, user generated content distribution, and managing the social graph through a technique they call  One-Hop Replication  (OHR). OHR  abstracts and delegates the complexity of scaling up from the social network application . The abstract:   
 Online Social Networks (OSN) face serious scalability challenges due to their rapid growth and popularity. To address this issue we present a novel approach to scale up OSN called One Hop Replication (OHR). Our system combines partitioning and replication in a middleware to transparently scale up a centralized OSN design, and therefore, avoid the OSN application to undergo the costly transition to a fully distributed system to meet its scalability needs. OHR exploits some</p><p>5 0.98296988 <a title="754-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling_Twitter%3A_Making_Twitter_10000_Percent_Faster.html">639 high scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling Twitter: Making Twitter 10000 Percent Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 6:  Some interesting changes from Twitter's  Evan Weaver : everything in RAM now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability; switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them locally.  Update 5:   Twitter on Scala . A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners.

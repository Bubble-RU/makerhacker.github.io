from Oracle yesterday announced the start of the Coherence Incubator project.
Coherence Incubator is a new online repository of projects that provides

<p>Introduction: Space-based architectures are an alternative to the traditional n-tier model
for enterprise applications. Instead of a vertical tier partitioning, space
based applications are partitioned horizontally into self-sufficient units.
This leads to almost linear scalability of stateful, high-performance
applications.This is arecording of a talk I did last monthwhere I introduce
space based programming and demonstrate how that works in practice on the .NET
platform using Oracle Coherence and GigaSpaces.</p><p>5 0.066496611 <a title="499-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-25-Designing_applications_for_cloud_deployment.html">764 high scalability-2010-01-25-Designing applications for cloud deployment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the
Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that
provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It
also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke
about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week - here is the summary
of that presentation.ďťżhttp://gojko.net/2010/01/25/designing-applications-for-

<p>Introduction: The first meeting of this Online Gaming High Scalability SIG will be on the
9th of July 2009 in central London, starting at 10 AM and finishing around
5PM.The main topic of this meeting will be potentials for using cloud and grid
technologies in online gaming systems. In addition to experience reports from
the community, we have invited some of the leading cloud experts in the UK to
discuss the benefits such as resource elasticity and challenges such as
storage and security that companies from other industries have experienced. We
will have a track for IT managers focused on business opportunities and issues
and a track for architects and developers more focused on implementation
issues.The event is free but up-front registration is required for capacity
planning, so please let us know in advance, if you are planning to attend by
completing the registration form on this pageTo propose a talk or for
programme enquiries, contact meetings [at] gamingscalability [dot] org.Note:

performed a sophisticated weighting of their popularity based on page range,
trust authority, Alexa rank, Google hits, and number of comments. When all the
results poured out of the blender HighScalability was ranked 16th. Not bad!
Joel on Software was number one, of course. The next few were: 2) Coding

<p>Introduction: An excellent article by Bryan Cantrill and Jeff Bonwick on how to write multi-
threaded code. With more processors and no magic bullet solution for how to
use them, knowing how to write multiprocessor code that doesn't screw up your
system is still a valuable skill. Some topics:Know your cold paths from your
hot paths.Intuition is frequently wrong--be data intensive.Know when--and when
not--to break up a lock.Be wary of readers/writer locks.Consider per-CPU
locking.Know when to broadcast--and when to signal.Learn to debug
postmortem.Design your systems to be composable.Don't use a semaphore where a
mutex would suffice.Consider memory retiring to implement per-chain hash-table
locks.Be aware of false sharing.Consider using nonblocking synchronization
routines to monitor contention.When reacquiring locks, consider using
generation counts to detect state change.Use wait- and lock-free structures
only if you absolutely must.Prepare for the thrill of victory--and the agony
of defeat.While I</p><p>5 0.37419486 <a title="499-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-19-Paper%3A_MegaPipe%3A_A_New_Programming_Interface_for_Scalable_Network_I-O.html">1478 high scalability-2013-06-19-Paper: MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I-O</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The paper MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O
(video,slides) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a
better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started
with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support
for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling
to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they
created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented
workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."The result:
MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29% (for long connections) and
582% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed
version of memcached between 15% and 320%. For a workload based on real-world
HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of nginx by 75%.What's this most
excellent and interesting paper about?Message-oriented network workloads,

for making web pages faster. These best practices have proven to reduce

<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do
something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one
Ilya Grigorik, Developer Advocate,Make the Web Fastat Google, and author of a
great new book:High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer
should know about networking and web performance. That's a big topic you might
be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed
pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It's like
a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.In case you are not familiar
with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For
years Ilya has been producing excellent content onhis blog and if yousearch
YouTube you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the
book. Authority established.Reading the book I was struck by what a
complicated beast or little World Wide Web has become. That's clear from just

<p>Introduction: Performance guruSteve Souders gave his keynote presentation, Cache is King!
(slides), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of
how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get
the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results
on what gave the best web site performance improvements.In his base line test,
page loads took 7.65 seconds (median of three runs). What change--Fast
Network, No Javascript, or Primed Cache--would make the biggest performance
improvement? It was Primed Cache.Fast Network - Using a fast FIOS network the
load time was 4.13 seconds. Steve was surprised how big a difference this
made, given how much work must happen in the browser. No JavaScript - 4.74
seconds after disabling JavaScript. Both reduces transfers and skips parsing
by the browser. Steve thought the effect would have been larger.Primed Cache-
3.46 seconds using a warm cache, less than half than the empty cache page view

<p>Introduction: Making the world's knowledge computableToday's Wolfram|Alpha is the first step
in an ambitious, long-term project to make all systematic knowledge
immediately computable by anyone. You enter your question or calculation, and
Wolfram|Alpha uses its built-in algorithms and growing collection of data to
compute the answer.Answer Engine vs Search EngineWhenWolfram|Alphalaunches
later today, it will beone of the most computationally intensive websites on
the internet. TheWolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engineis an "answer
engine" that is able to produce answers to various questions such asWhat is

<p>Introduction: Performance is critical to the success of any web site, and yet today's web
applications push browsers to their limits with increasing amounts of rich
content and heavy use of Ajax. In his new bookEven Faster Web Sites:
Performance Best Practices for Web Developers, Steve Souders, web performance
evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable
techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.Souders' previous
book, the bestsellingHigh Performance Web Sites, shocked the web development
world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on
the client side. In Even Faster Web Sites, Souders and eight expert
contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your
site's performance in three critical categories:JavaScript- Get advice for
understanding Ajax performance, writing efficient JavaScript, creating
responsive applications, loading scripts without blocking other components,
and more.Network- Learn to shar</p><p>3 0.8758077 <a title="617-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-16-The_5_Biggest_Ways_to_Boost_MySQL_Scalability.html">1099 high scalability-2011-08-16-The 5 Biggest Ways to Boost MySQL Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sean Hallwith some really good MySQL advice: Tune those queries. Biggest bang
for your buck. Enable the slow query log and watch it. Once you've found a
heavy resource intensive query, optimize it! Tune what receives real-world
traffic. Employ Master-Master Replication. Immediately have a read-only slave
for your application to hit as well.Use Your Memory. Set
innodb_buffer_pool_size, key_buffer_size and other key options.RAID Your Disk
I/O. Use RAID 10 mirroring and striping. On EC2 striping across a number of
EBS volumes using the Linux md software raid.Tune Key Parameters. speeds up
inserts & updates with innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2; create a tablespace
and underlying datafile for each table with innodb_file_per_table.Full details

<p>Introduction: This is a guest repost byPete Soderling, Founder at Hakka Labs, creating a
community where software engineers come to grow.In response to a recent post
from MongoHQ entitled "You don't have big data," I would generally agree with
many of the author's points.However, regardless of whether you call it big
data, small data, hot data or cold data - we are all in a position to admit
that *more* data is here to stay - and that's due to many different
factors.Perhaps primarily, as the article mentions, this is due to the
decreasing cost of storage over time. Other factors include access to open
APIs, the sheer volume of ever-increasing consumer activity online, as well as
a plethora of other incentives that are developing (mostly) behind the scenes
as companies "share" data with each other. (You know they do this, right?)But
one of the most important things I've learned over the past couple of years is
that it's crucial for forward thinking companies to start to design more

<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is
indeed the case:Research conducted by HPfound that the majority of businesses
in the EMEA region are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the
cloud. Of the 940 respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-
critical apps at some point over the next two to five years.A more
recentsurvey, by research firm MeriTalkand sponsored by VMware and EMC
(NYSE:EMC), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to move some
mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within two years,
the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their mission-critical apps
to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of their mission-
critical apps to run in the cloud.The Challenge - How to Bring Hundreds of
Enterprise Apps to the CloudThe reality is that cloud economics only start
making sense when there are true workloads that utilize the cloud
infrastructure.If the large majority of</p><p>6 0.85238874 <a title="617-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-04-How_MySpace_Tested_Their_Live_Site_with_1_Million_Concurrent_Users.html">788 high scalability-2010-03-04-How MySpace Tested Their Live Site with 1 Million Concurrent Users</a></p>

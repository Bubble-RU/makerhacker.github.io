Cormack, both of the University of Waterloo. The full table of contents is on-
line and looks to be really interesting:Information retrieval is the
foundation for modern search engines. This text offers an introduction to the
core topics underlying modern search technologies, including algorithms, data
structures, indexing, retrieval, and evaluation. The emphasis is on
implementation and experimentation; each chapter includes exercises and
suggestions for student projects.Currently available is the full text of
chapters: Introduction, Basic Techniques, Static Inverted Indices, Index
Compression, and Parallel Information Retrieval. Parallel Information

<p>Introduction: Art of DistributedPart 1: Rethinking about distributed computing modelsI 'm
getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially
distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can
MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other
technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our
situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two
parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the
difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability,
and distributed storage systems.Download the article in PDF format.Download
the article in MS Word format.I wait for your comments, and questions, and I
will answer it in part two.</p><p>6 0.095227174 <a title="580-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-26-Lucasfilm%3A_The_Real_Magic_is_in_the_Data_Center.html">396 high scalability-2008-09-26-Lucasfilm: The Real Magic is in the Data Center</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so
I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if
a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have
attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If
you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in
the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please
comment on that too.Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of
them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade
away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these
days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work.
Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people
do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not. Taking all
that wisdom and stuffing it into a presentations is surprisingly hard wor</p><p>5 0.66850507 <a title="580-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-10-Scalability_Perspectives_%231%3A_Nicholas_Carr_%E2%80%93_The_Big_Switch.html">439 high scalability-2008-11-10-Scalability Perspectives #1: Nicholas Carr – The Big Switch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Nicholas CarrA former executive editor of the Harvard Business
Review, Nicholas Carr writes and speaks on technology, business, and culture.
His provocative 2004 book Does IT Matter? set off a worldwide debate about the
role of computers in business.The Big Switch – Rewiring the World, From Edison
to GoogleCarr's core insight is that the development of the computer and the
Internet remarkably parallels that of the last radically disruptive
technology, electricity. He traces the rapid morphing of electrification from
an in-house competitive advantage to a ubiquitous utility, and how the
business advantage rapidly shifted from the innovators and early adopters to

<p>Introduction: All,I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for
sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and
other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers.
I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.Could anyone share
their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube
etc..?Thank you,Regards,Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>2 0.99557179 <a title="580-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-06-Announce%3A_First_Meeting_of_Boston_Scalability_User_Group.html">268 high scalability-2008-03-06-Announce: First Meeting of Boston Scalability User Group</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to
start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their
application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I
am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I
plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need
to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure
and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the
application that will become critical over time.</p><p>4 0.98283523 <a title="580-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-UK_Based_CDN.html">324 high scalability-2008-05-19-UK Based CDN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw
up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK. If they're outside the
UK but have decent support then also include. The service must be cheap and
not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it
shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered
whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK
compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a
small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space. Would S3 be a good
starting point? What is the service like? I hear mixed reviews about it.Many
thanks,Jim</p><p>5 0.97208017 <a title="580-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>6 0.96664423 <a title="580-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

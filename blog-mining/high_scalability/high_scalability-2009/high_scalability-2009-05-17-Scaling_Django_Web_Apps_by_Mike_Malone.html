<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding

mean several things. Most developers are primarily concerned with are response
time and scalability. Response TimeIs the time taken by web application to
process request and return response. Applications should respond to requests

<p>Introduction: Pownce is a new social messaging application competing micromessage to
micromessage with the likes of Twitter and Jaiku. Still in closed beta, Pownce
has generously shared some of what they've learned so far. Like going to a
barrel tasting of a young wine and then tasting the same wine after some
aging, I think what will be really interesting is to follow Pownce and compare
the Pownce of today with the Pownce of tomorrow, after a few years spent in
the barrel. What lessons lie in wait for Pownce as they grow?Site:

<p>Introduction: How do you plan to scale your system as you reach predictable milestones? This
topic came up in another venue and it reminded me about a great comment an
Anonymous wrote a while ago and I wanted to make sure that comment didn't get
lost.The Anonymous scaling plan was relatively simple and direct:My two cents
on what I'm using to start a website from scratch using a single server for
now. Later, I'll scale out horizontally when the need arises.Phase

Fedora 8. You could go with pretty much any Linux though. I like Fedora 8 best
for servers.Proxy Cache: Varnish - it is way faster than Squid per my own
benchmarks. Squid chokes bigtime.Web Server: Lighttpd - faster than Apache 2
and easier to configure for me.Object Cache: Memcached. Very scalable.PHP
Cache: APC. Easy to configure and seems to work fine.Language: PHP 5 - no
bloated frameworks, waste of time for me. You spend too much time trying to

<p>Introduction: Michael Nygard talks aboutTwo Ways To Boost Your Flagging Web Site. The idea
behind cache farms is to move memory devoted to the various caching layers
into one large farm of caches, as with memcached. The idea behind read pools
is to allocate your database read requests to a pool of dedicated read
servers, thus offloading the write server. Using a combination of the
strategies you aren't forced to scale up the database tier to scale your
website.</p><p>5 0.79950112 <a title="602-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-27-Strategy%3A_Cache_Stored_Procedure_Results.html">1620 high scalability-2014-03-27-Strategy: Cache Stored Procedure Results</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Caching is not new of course, but I don't think I've heard of caching store
procedure results before. It's like memoization in the database. Brent Ozar
covers this idea in How to Cache Stored Procedure Results.The benefits are the
usual for doing work in the database, it doesn't take per developer per app
work, just code it once in the stored proc and it works for everyone,
everywhere, for all of time. The disadvantage is the usual as well, it adds
extra load to a probably already busy database, so it should only be applied
to heavy computations.Brent positions this strategy as an emergency bandaid to
apply when you need to take pressure off a database now. Developers can then
work on moving the cache off the database and into its own tier. Interesting
idea. And as the comments show the implementation is never as simple as it
seems.</p><p>6 0.79732525 <a title="602-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-18-Real_World_Web%3A_Performance_%26_Scalability.html">684 high scalability-2009-08-18-Real World Web: Performance & Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a
lot of useful Dj</p><p>2 0.9212774 <a title="602-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-07-3_Secrets_to_Lightning_Fast_Mobile_Design_at_Instagram.html">1259 high scalability-2012-06-07-3 Secrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design at Instagram</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InSecrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger
shares three strategies Instagram uses to outsmart high latency mobile
networks and make mobile apps feel faster than they really are, which helped
Instagram reach 12 million users in 12 months:The motivation:"mobile
experiences fill gaps while we wait. no one wants to wait while they
wait"Perform actions optimistically. Make the user feel productive. Likes,
comments, and follows are registered on screen while the like operation is
being sent in the background. Adaptively preload content. Load content before
it's needed. Don't images according to time, it will take too long, instead
re-prioritize based on interest. Show what the social network things is the
most popular. Listen to what your user's flicks and taps are telling you.Move
bits when no-one is watching.Picture uploading startsbeforeyou share them,
most apps wait until after the share screen. The rule is send data as soon as
it's ready, then match it</p><p>3 0.91500872 <a title="602-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_18th%2C_2013.html">1534 high scalability-2013-10-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 18th, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tachyon  (github) is interesting new filesystem brought to by the folks at
theUC Berkeley AMP Lab:Tachyon is a fault tolerant distributed ďŹ le system
enabling reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such
as Spark and MapReduce.It offers up to 300 times higher throughput than HDFS,
by leveraging lineage information and using memory aggressively. Tachyon
caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and
frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Thus, Tachyon avoids going
to disk to load datasets that is frequently read.It has a Java-like File API,
native support for raw tables, a pluggable file system, and it works with
Hadoop with no modifications. It might work well for streaming media too as
you wouldn't have to wait for the complete file to hit the disk before
rendering.Discuss on Hacker News</p><p>5 0.90218842 <a title="602-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-12-How_Google_Taught_Me_to_Cache_and_Cash-In.html">703 high scalability-2009-09-12-How Google Taught Me to Cache and Cash-In</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A user named Apathyon how Reddit scales some of their features, shares some
advice he learned while working at Google and other major companies.To be
fair, I [Apathy] was working at Google at the time, and every job I held
between 1995 and 2005 involved at least one of the largest websites on the
planet. I didn't come up with any of these ideas, just watched other smart
people I worked with who knew what they were doing and found (or wrote) tools
that did the same things. But the theme is always the same:Cache everything
you can and store the rest in some sort of database (not necessarily
relational and not necessarily centralized).Cache everything that doesn't
change rapidly. Most of the time you don't have to hit the database for
anything other than checking whether the users' new message count has
transitioned from 0 to (1 or more).Cache everything--templates, user message
status, the front page components--and hit the database once a minute or so to
update the front page, forums, e</p><p>6 0.89990652 <a title="602-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-19-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_19%2C_2013.html">1443 high scalability-2013-04-19-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 19, 2013</a></p>

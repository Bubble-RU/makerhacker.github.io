<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors, attended the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto  NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid, InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came from the audience, which was refreshing. 
 
Overall a genial evening with some good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at giving a wide ra</p><p>3 0.12031008 <a title="745-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-09-10_NoSQL_Systems_Reviewed.html">739 high scalability-2009-11-09-10 NoSQL Systems Reviewed</a></p>

A very thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of approaches to not being a relational database.

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: Update : Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was wrong about what he meant. His real point:  The meaning of the statement was that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a high priority task for them. 
 
At the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto , an audience member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really interesting:  NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.  
 
  The idea being that   NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance, etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships. With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it</p><p>6 0.071874127 <a title="745-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-21-SQL_%2B_NoSQL_%3D_Yes_%21.html">961 high scalability-2010-12-21-SQL + NoSQL = Yes !</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the “NoSQL vs. Relational” conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to build in, I’d like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint. In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I’ve inadvertently given myself plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches, and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say with a fair amount of certainty, that I’ve found a good compromise.

<p>Introduction: ArchCamp: Scalable Databasess (NoSQL) 
 
The ArchCamp unconference was held this past Friday at HackerDojo in Mountain View, CA.  There was plenty of pizza, beer, and great conversation.  This session started out free-form, but shaped up pretty quickly into a discussion of the popular open source scalable NoSQL databases and the architectural categories in which they belong.</p><p>5 0.7372086 <a title="745-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-09-NoSQL_on_the_Microsoft_Platform.html">875 high scalability-2010-08-09-NoSQL on the Microsoft Platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source. There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity: from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there’s Riak, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft Windows. I’m going to outline what’s available now and briefly touch on some opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.

<p>Introduction: Brian Aker gave this 10 minute  lightning talk  on NoSQL at the Nov 2009 OpenSQLCamp in Portland, Oregon. It's incredibly funny, probably because there's a lot of truth to what he's saying.

<p>Introduction: G'day,     I noticed the default sort order for the forum is to show the posts with the most replies first. That seems a bit odd for a forum. Would it not make sense to show the posts with the most recently replies first?     It is possible to re-sort the forum threads that way by clicking on the "Last post" header (twice). It would seem like a more sensible default.     I've checked and I see the same behaviour as both a registered (logged in) and anonymous user.

<p>Introduction: A lot of sites hosted in San Francisco are down because of at least 6 back-to-back power outages power outages. More details at  laughingsquid .
   
Sites like SecondLife, Craigstlist, Technorati, Yelp and all Six Apart properties, TypePad, LiveJournal and Vox are all down. The cause was an underground explosion in a transformer vault under a manhole at 560 Mission Street. Flames shot 6 feet out from the manhole cover. Over PG&E; 30,000 customers are without power.  What's perplexing is the UPS backup and diesel generators didn't kick in to bring the datacenter back on line. I've never toured that datacenter, but they usually have massive backup systems. It's probably one of those multiple simultaneous failure situations that you hope never happen in real life, but too often do. Or maybe the infrastructure wasn't rolled out completely.  Update: the cause was a cascade of failures in a tightly couples system that could never happen :-) Details at  Failure Happens: A summary of the power</p><p>4 0.29263982 <a title="745-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-24-Strategy%3A_Eliminate_Unnecessary_SQL.html">995 high scalability-2011-02-24-Strategy: Eliminate Unnecessary SQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: MySQL Expert Ronald Bradford explains how one key way to improve the scalability of a MySQL server, and undoubtedly nearly every other server, is to  eliminate unnecessary SQL , saying  the most efficient way to improve an SQL statement is to eliminate it :
  

The MySQL kernel can only physically process a certain number of SQL statements for a given time period (e.g. per second). Regardless of the type of machine you have, there is a physical limit. If you eliminate SQL statements that are unwarranted and unnecessary, you automatically enable more important SQL statements to run. There are numerous other downstream affects, however this is the simple math. To run more SQL, reduce the number of SQL you need to run.

  
Ronald shows how to use  mk-query-digest  to look at query execution times and determine which ones can be profitably whacked.

<p>Introduction: Hi,     We are running a backup solution that uploads every night the files our clients worked on during the day (Cabonite-like).   We have currently about 10GB of data per night, via http PUT requests (1 per file), and the files are written as-is on a NAS.   Our architecture is basically compound of a load balancer (hardware, sticky sessions), 5 servers (Tomcat under RHEL4/5, ) and a NAS (nfs 3).     Since our number of clients is rising, (as is our system load) how would you recommend we could scale our infrastructure? hardware and software? Should we go towards NAS sharding, more servers, NIO on tomcat...?

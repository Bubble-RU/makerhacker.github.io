<p>Introduction: Geir Magnusson from 10gen presented a talk titled Cloud Data Persistence or ‘We’re in a database reneaissance - pay attention” today at QCon London 2009. The main message of his talk was that “physical limitations of today’s technology combined with the computational complexity of conventional relational databases are driving databases into new exciting spaces”, or to put it simpler the database landscape is changing and we should keep our eyes on that.</p><p>4 0.22676013 <a title="544-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-07-Six_Ways_Twitter_May_Reach_its_Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal_of_One_Billion_Users.html">837 high scalability-2010-06-07-Six Ways Twitter May Reach its Big Hairy Audacious Goal of One Billion Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users  by 2013. Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in  2012 . But let's be optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is the user leader with over  400 million users . Will Facebook stumble or will they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's "low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has  106 million  registered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one billion users served?
 
From recent infrastructure announcements and information gleaned at  Chirp  ( videos ) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal 2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) D</p><p>5 0.18051362 <a title="544-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling_Twitter%3A_Making_Twitter_10000_Percent_Faster.html">639 high scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling Twitter: Making Twitter 10000 Percent Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 6:  Some interesting changes from Twitter's  Evan Weaver : everything in RAM now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability; switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them locally.  Update 5:   Twitter on Scala . A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure  (long lived processes) and why they moved to  Scala  to program against it (high level langu</p><p>6 0.14545676 <a title="544-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-15-Lessons_from_Yahoo%2C_eBay%2C_Orbitz%2C_LinkedIn_architecture.html">154 high scalability-2007-11-15-Lessons from Yahoo, eBay, Orbitz, LinkedIn architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There were many talks recently about twitter scalability and their specific choice of language such as Scala  to address their existing Ruby based scalability. In this post i tried to provide a more methodical approach for handling twitter scalability challenges that is centered around the right choice of architecture patterns rather then the language itself.   The architecture pattern are given in a generic fashion that is not specific to twitter itself and can serve anyone who is looking to build a scalable real time web application in the near future.</p><p>3 0.75438929 <a title="544-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-Twitter_as_a_scalability_case_study.html">323 high scalability-2008-05-19-Twitter as a scalability case study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot has been said already about Twitter's scalability issues. Many have given Twitter as an anti-pattern of how not to deal with scalability and have suggested different solutions for scaling it. As Twitter is famously a Ruby-on-Rails deployment, this case has also been used as a weapon in the language/platform wars between the RoR and Java camps, and to a lesser degree, also with the LAMP (PHP) camp</p><p>4 0.74249744 <a title="544-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-07-Six_Ways_Twitter_May_Reach_its_Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal_of_One_Billion_Users.html">837 high scalability-2010-06-07-Six Ways Twitter May Reach its Big Hairy Audacious Goal of One Billion Users</a></p>

Performance Anti-Patterns:    - Fixing Performance at the End of the Project    - Measuring and Comparing the Wrong Things    - Algorithmic Antipathy    - Reusing Software    - Iterating Because That’s What Computers Do Well    - Premature Optimization    - Focusing on What You Can See Rather Than on the Problem    - Software Layering    - Excessive Numbers of Threads    - Asymmetric Hardware Utilization    - Not Optimizing for the Common Case    - Needless Swapping of Cache Lines Between CPUs     For more detail   go there</p><p>2 0.85694164 <a title="544-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-17-Web_Accelerators_-_snake_oil_or_miracle_remedy%3F.html">250 high scalability-2008-02-17-Web Accelerators - snake oil or miracle remedy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perhaps this question is borderline off-topic but since high scalability solutions often have a global aspect I will give it a try...     Have anybody had any experience with different techniques for speeding up their application to places that have a problem with poor ping response time? Ideally I would love to be running only one data center world-wide but one day I know that our sales department will sign up a customer with an unacceptable response time... Could installing a web-accelerator in front of our application extend the reach of our current data center or will we just add complexity and another source of potential errors?</p><p>same-blog 3 0.83252054 <a title="544-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-18-QCon_London_2009%3A_Upgrading_Twitter_without_service_disruptions.html">544 high scalability-2009-03-18-QCon London 2009: Upgrading Twitter without service disruptions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How Big is a Yottabyte?  Not so big that the NSA can't hope to store it says  CrunchGear :  There are a thousand gigabytes in a terabyte, a thousand terabytes in a petabyte, a thousand petabytes in an exabyte, a thousand exabytes in a zettabyte, and a thousand zettabytes in a yottabyte. In other words, a yottabyte is 1,000,000,000,000,000GB . 
  The CMS data aggregation system . The Large Hadron Collider project is using  MongoDB as a cache .  Here we discuss a new data aggregation system which consumes, indexes and delivers information from different relational and non-relational data sources to answer cross data-service queries and explore meta-data associated with petabytes of experimental data.

<p>Introduction: We've seen a lot of  NoSQL  action lately built around distributed hash tables. Btrees are getting jealous. Btrees, once the king of the database world, want their throne back.  Paul Buchheit  surfaced a paper:  A practical scalable distributed B-tree  by Marcos K. Aguilera and Wojciech Golab, that might help spark a revolution.  From the Abstract:
   We propose a new algorithm for a practical, fault tolerant, and scalable B-tree distributed over a set of servers. Our algorithm supports practical features not present in prior work: transactions that allow atomic execution of multiple operations over multiple B-trees, online migration of B-tree nodes between servers, and dynamic addition and removal of servers. Moreover, our algorithm is conceptually simple: we use transactions to manipulate B-tree nodes so that clients need not use complicated concurrency and locking protocols used in prior work. To execute these transactions quickly, we rely on three techniques: (1) We use optimistic</p><p>6 0.79751724 <a title="544-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible_-__A_Simple_Model-Driven_Configuration_Management_and_Command_Execution_Framework.html">1230 high scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible -  A Simple Model-Driven Configuration Management and Command Execution Framework</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things). That's why scaling Facebook is hard  says Jeff Rothschild , Vice President of Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional web sites? Let's find out.
 
Traditional websites are easier to scale than social networking sites for two reasons:
  
 They usually access only their own data and common cached data. 
 Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one time. 
  
Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around single records using  distributed hashing schemes . And since only a few percent of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little</p><p>5 0.16873468 <a title="715-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-07-Six_Ways_Twitter_May_Reach_its_Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal_of_One_Billion_Users.html">837 high scalability-2010-06-07-Six Ways Twitter May Reach its Big Hairy Audacious Goal of One Billion Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users  by 2013. Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in  2012 . But let's be optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is the user leader with over  400 million users . Will Facebook stumble or will they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's "low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has  106 million  registered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one billion users served?
 
From recent infrastructure announcements and information gleaned at  Chirp  ( videos ) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal 2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) D</p><p>6 0.1624615 <a title="715-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-14-Scaling_Digg_and_Other_Web_Applications.html">512 high scalability-2009-02-14-Scaling Digg and Other Web Applications</a></p>

Twitter currently has  106 million  registered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one billion users served?
 
From recent infrastructure announcements and information gleaned at  Chirp  ( videos ) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal 2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) D</p><p>5 0.68461788 <a title="715-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster_Lost_Lead_Because_of_a_Failure_to_Scale.html">153 high scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster Lost Lead Because of a Failure to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important.  Jim Scheinman,  former Bebo and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to scale as why they lost the social networking race:   VB  : Can you tell me a bit about what you learned in your time at Friendster? 
 
     JS  :  For me, it basically came down to failed execution on the technology side — we had millions of Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling us that if we didn’t get our site working better soon, they’d be ‘forced to join’ a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpace…the rest is history. To be fair to Friendster’s technology team at the time, they were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites simply hadn’t had to deal with prior to Friendster.

<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech has  developed AdHoc , an advanced framework for sharing geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective. The premise of AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access to his or her resources without an IT administrator’s help, and with high security level of any exposed data or applications assured. It takes 3 easy steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization, add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join forces for more efficient results.  AdHoc was initially created for a consortium of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the administration</p><p>5 0.88669264 <a title="715-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-20-Smart_Companies_Fail_Because_they_Do_Everything_Right_-_Staying_Alive_to_Scale.html">1410 high scalability-2013-02-20-Smart Companies Fail Because they Do Everything Right - Staying Alive to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wired has a  wonderful interview  with  Clayton Christensen , author of the tech ninja's bible,  Innovator's Dilemma . Innovation is the name of the game in Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained with compelling examples by the man himself.
 
Just as every empire has fallen, every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.
 
He also talks about his new book,  The Capitalist's Dilemma , which addresses this puzzle: if corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?
 
If someone can help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here'</p><p>same-blog 6 0.88254893 <a title="715-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-06-10_Ways_to_Take_your_Site_from_One_to_One_Million_Users_by_Kevin_Rose__.html">715 high scalability-2009-10-06-10 Ways to Take your Site from One to One Million Users by Kevin Rose  </a></p>

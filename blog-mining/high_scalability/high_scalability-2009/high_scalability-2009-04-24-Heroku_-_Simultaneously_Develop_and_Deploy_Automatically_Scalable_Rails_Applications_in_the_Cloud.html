<p>Introduction: If you just want to visit Rome and not go full on Cloud Native like Netflix,
thenSoundslice'sAdrian HolovatyinWhy I left Heroku, and notes on my new AWS
setup provides a simple guide for helping make your first trip a good
one.First, let's dispose of why Soundslice left Heroku. The essence is because
of various issues "Heroku lost my trust." YMMV, but once a fact, what do you
do?After a consultation withScott VanDenPlas, former director of dev ops for
the Obama reelection tech team, they came up a simple transition guide that I
think is quite good and generally useful (full details in theoriginal post):
Bake an AMI. Install all the stuff you need on an AMI and use that as your
deployment unit. This works well for Netflix and for users who value a certain
sort of simplicity more than flexibility. There were a lot of comments saying
how it's better to use Chef/Puppet and configure instances on the fly, but
there's a confidence that only a baked image provides.Set up auto-scaling
rules.

<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: Update:GIGAOM onrPath Burns EC2 Appliances in a Web Portal. rBuilder adds a
portal that lets users turn software into virtual appliances.rPathdemoed their
virtual appliance management system at Monday'sAWS Meetup. What they do is
help you build a generic virtual machine image deployable on Amazon, VMWare,
Xen and other targets. The idea is to build your software application
independent of the underlying operating system and deploy it in your own or
someone else's datacenter without worrying about all the details.To put their
service in context think of rPath as how you build, deploy, and upgrade images
and someone likeRight Scalehas how you can run and managed a cluster of
deployed images.breakTo build a Virtual Appliance you pull together all your
packages through their web interface or through a Python based "recipe"
system, select a VM target, and "cook" it all into a VM image you can
immediately deploy and run.To make this magic happen they use theConary

<p>Introduction: In Resolved: Widespread Application Outage, Herokutells their story of how
they dealt with theAmazon outage. While taking 100% responsibility for the
downtime, they also shared a number of the strategies they used to bring their
service back to full working order.One ofHeroku'smost interesting strategies
wasn't a technical hack at all, but how they consciously went about deploying
their Ops personnel in response to the emergency. An outline of their strategy
is: Monitoring systems immediately alerted Ops to the problem. An on-call
engineer applied triage logic to the problem and classified it as serious,
which caused the on-callIncident Commanderto be woken out of restful slumber.

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've accumulated quite a rag tag collection of personal systems
scattered wide across a galaxy of different servers. For the past month I've
been on a quest to rationalize this conglomeration by moving everything to a
managed service of one kind or another. The goal: lift a load of worry from my
mind. I like to do my own stuff my self so I learn something and have control.
Control always comes with headaches and it was time for a little aspirin. As
part of the process GAE came in handy as a host for a few Twitter related
scripts I couldn't manage to run anywhere else. I recoded my simple little
scripts into Python/GAE and learned a lot in the process.breakIn the move I
exported HighScalability from a VPS and imported it into a shared hosting
service. I could never quite configure Apache and MySQL well enough that they
wouldn't spike memory periodically and crash the VPS. And since a memory crash
did not automatically restarted it was unacceptable. I also wrote a script t</p><p>3 0.78344059 <a title="579-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-05-A_Simple_6_Step_Transition_Guide_for_Moving_Away_from_X_to_AWS_.html">1470 high scalability-2013-06-05-A Simple 6 Step Transition Guide for Moving Away from X to AWS </a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm not sure what I was expecting the stack GOV.UK used at launch to look
like. Maybe some messenger owls and lots of cobwebs? But not so at all. So
much not so I thought any organization looking at their own stack for ideas
could learn something from the considered choices of others.The diversity of
technologies used was surprising. They use "at least five different
programming languages, three separate database types, two versions of an
operating system." Some may think of this as a weakness, but they think it a
strength:The reason we operate such a diverse ecosystem is that we are focused
on solving real problems. Our first task is to understand the problem or need
we are solving and then to choose the best tool for the job. If we restrict
ourselves to moulding the need to the tools we already have, then we risk not
solving the initial problem in the best way possible for the user. By
restricting software diversity or enforcing rigid organisational standards on
a project, there is a</p><p>5 0.75698447 <a title="579-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-06-BankSimple_Mini-Architecture_-_Using_a_Next_Generation_Toolchain.html">970 high scalability-2011-01-06-BankSimple Mini-Architecture - Using a Next Generation Toolchain</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I know people are always interested in what others are using to build their
systems.Alex Payne, CTO of the new startupBankSimple, gives us a quick hit on
their toolchain choices in this Quora thread. BankSimple positions itself as a
customer-focused alternative to online banking. You may remember Alex from
theearly days of Twitter. Alex was always helpful to me on Twitter's
programmer support list, so I really wish them well. Alex is also a bit of an
outside the box thinker, which is reflected in some of their choices:The JVM
acts as a convergence platform for these languages:Scala- ideal for writing
performance-sensitive components that need the safety and expressiveness of
the language's advanced type system.Clojure- rapidly prototype in a more
dynamic language while still offering the benefits of functional
programming.JRuby- makes available a bunch of great libraries and frameworks
for doing frontend web development, like Rails and Padrino.Frontend: MooTools
on the JavaScript side.</p><p>6 0.75415903 <a title="579-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-28-37signals_Architecture.html">663 high scalability-2009-07-28-37signals Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 4: Heroku versus GAE & GAE/JUpdate 3:Heroku has gone live!.
Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the
relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment
and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.Update 2:Heroku
Architecture. A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests
flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a
Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based
routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your
application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors. Dynos
themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware,
Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as
an application caching layer.Update: Aaron WorshamInterview with James
Lindenbaum, CEO of Heroku. Aaron nicely sums up their goal: Heroku is looking
to eliminate all the rea</p><p>2 0.95866513 <a title="579-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-12-Caching_and_Processing_2TB_Mozilla_Crash_Reports_in_memory_with_Hazelcast.html">1020 high scalability-2011-04-12-Caching and Processing 2TB Mozilla Crash Reports in memory with Hazelcast</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mozilla processes TB's of Firefox crash reports daily using HBase, Hadoop,
Python and Thrift protocol. The project is calledSocorro, a system for
collecting, processing, and displaying crash reports from clients. Today the
Socorro application stores about 2.6 million crash reports per day. During
peak traffic, it receives about 2.5K crashes per minute. In this article we
are going to demonstrate a proof of concept showing how Mozilla could
integrate Hazelcast into Socorro and achieve caching and processing 2TB of
crash reports with 50 node Hazelcast cluster. The video for the demo is
availablehere. Currently, Socorro has pythonic collectors, processors, and
middleware that communicate with HBase via the Thrift protocol. One of the
biggest limitations of the current architecture is that it is very sensitive
to latency or outages on the HBase side. If the collectors cannot store an
item in HBase then they will store it on local disk and it will not be
accessible to the processors or midd</p><p>3 0.95800537 <a title="579-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-eBay_Architecture.html">331 high scalability-2008-05-27-eBay Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:EBay's Randy Shoup spills the secrets of how to service hundreds of
millions of users and over two billion page views a day in ScalabilityBest
Practices: Lessons from eBayon InfoQ. The practices: Partition by Function,
Split Horizontally, Avoid Distributed Transactions, Decouple Functions
Asynchronously, Move Processing To Asynchronous Flows, Virtualize At All
Levels, Cache Appropriately.Update:eBay Serves 5 Billion API Calls Each Month.
Aren't we seeing more and more traffic driven by mashups composed on top of
open APIs? APIs are no longer a bolt on, they are your application.
Architecturally that argues for implementing your own application around the
same APIs developers and users employ.Who hasn't wondered how eBay does their
business? As one of the largest most loaded websites in the world, it can't be
easy. And the subtitle of the presentation hints at how creating such a
monster system requires true engineering: Striking a balance between site

<p>Introduction: What data structure is more sacred than the link list? If we get rid of it
what silly interview questions would we use instead? But not using linked-
lists is exactly what Aater Suleman recommends inShould you ever use Linked-
Lists?InThe Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connectionsone of the important
strategies is not scribbling data all over memory via pointers because
following pointers increases cache misses whichreduces performance. And
there's nothing more iconic of pointers than the link list.Here are Aeter's
reasons to be anti-linked-list:They reduce the benefit of out-of-order
execution.They throw off hardware prefetching.They reduce DRAM and TLB
locality.They cannot leverage SIMD.They are harder to send to GPUs.He also
demolishes the pros of linked-lists, finding arrays a better option in almost
every case. Good discussion in the comment section as not everyone
agrees.Patrick Wyatt detailshow a linked-list threading bugrepeatedly crashed

<p>Introduction: Jurriaan Persyn is a Lead Web Developer at Netlog, a social portal site that
gets 50 million unique visitors and 5+ billion page views per month. In this
paper Jurriaan goes into a lot of excellent nuts and bolts details about how
they used sharding to scale their system. If you are pondering sharding as a
solution to your scaling problems you'll want to read this paper. As the paper
is quite well organized there's no reason to write a summary, but I especially
liked this part from the conclusion:If you can do with simpler solutions
(better hardware, more hardware, server tweaking and tuning, vertical
partitioning, sql query optimization, ...) that require less development cost,
why invest lots of effort in sharding? On the other hand, when your visitor
statistics really start blowing through the roof, it is a good direction to
go. After all, it worked for us.</p><p>6 0.95498914 <a title="579-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-12-Creating_Scalable_Digital_Libraries.html">856 high scalability-2010-07-12-Creating Scalable Digital Libraries</a></p>

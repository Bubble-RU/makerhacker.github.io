</p><p>2 With this release GemFire touts some of the latest innovative features in data management. [sent-3, score-0.302]
</p><p>3 -	GemFire provides explicit control over when rebalancing can be triggered, on what class of data and even allows the administrator to simulate a "rebalance" operation to quantify the benefits before actually doing it. [sent-5, score-0.357]
</p><p>4 -	With built in instrumentation that captures throughput and latency metrics, GemFire now enables applications to sense changing performance patterns and proactively provision extra resources and trigger rebalancing. [sent-6, score-0.234]
</p><p>5 The end result is predictable data access throughput and latency without the need to overprovision capacity. [sent-7, score-0.329]
</p><p>6 -	Advanced Data Partitioning: Applications are no longer restricted by the memory available across the cluster to manage partitioned data. [sent-9, score-0.252]
</p><p>7 Applications can pool available memory as well as disk and stripe the data across memory and disk across the cluster. [sent-10, score-0.564]
</p><p>8 When the data fabric is configured as a cache, partitioned data can be expired or evicted so that only the most frequently used data is managed. [sent-11, score-0.817]
</p><p>9 -	Data-aware application behavior routing: There are several extensions added to the GemFire data-aware function execution service - a simple grid programming model that allows the application to synchronously or asynchronously execute application behavior on the data nodes. [sent-12, score-0.824]
</p><p>10 Applications invoke functions hinting the data they are dependent on and the service parallelizes the execution of the application function on all the grid nodes where the data is being managed. [sent-13, score-0.959]
</p><p>11 Applications can now define relationships between different classes of data to colocate all related data sets and application functions when routed to the data nodes can execute complex queries on in-process data. [sent-14, score-0.898]
</p><p>12 These and other features offered in the 'Function execution service' offers linear scalability for compute and data intensive applications. [sent-15, score-0.391]
</p><p>13 Simply add more nodes when demand spikes to rebalance data and behavior to increase the overall throughput for your application. [sent-16, score-0.653]
</p><p>14 -	API additions for C++, C#: Support for continuous querying, client side connection pooling and dynamic load balancing and ability to invoke server side functions. [sent-17, score-0.334]
</p><p>15 -	Cost based Query optimization: A new compact index to conserve memory utilizaton and enhanced query processor design with cost-based optimization has been introduced as part of this release. [sent-18, score-0.339]
</p><p>16 -	Developer productivity tools: It can be daunting when developers have to quickly develop and test their clustered application. [sent-19, score-0.081]
</p><p>17 Developers need the capability to browse the distributed data using ad-hoc queries, apply corrections or monitor resource utilization and performance metrics. [sent-20, score-0.387]
</p><p>18 A new graphical Data browser permits browsing and editing of data across the entire cluster, execution of ad-hoc queries and even create real-time table views that are continuously kept up-to-date through continuous queries. [sent-21, score-0.864]

<p>Introduction: After winning a CSC Leading Edge Forum (LEF) research grant, I (Paul Colmer) wanted to publish some of the highlights of my research to share with the wider technology community.
 
 What is an In Memory Data Grid? 
 
It is not an in-memory relational database, a NOSQL database or a relational database.  It is a different breed of software datastore.
 
In summary an IMDG is an ‘off the shelf’ software product that exhibits the following characteristics:
 
The data model is distributed across many servers in a single location or across multiple locations.  This distribution is known as a data fabric.  This distributed model is known as a ‘shared nothing’ architecture.
  
 All servers can be active in each site. 
 All data is stored in the RAM of the servers. 
 Servers can be added or removed non-disruptively, to increase the amount of RAM available. 
 The data model is non-relational and is object-based.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.   It's 2008: C</p><p>6 0.12109596 <a title="633-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: These are from  Laura Thomson of OmniTi :  
  Profile early, profile often.  Pick a profiling tool and learn it in and out.  
  Dev-ops cooperation is essential.  The most critical difference in organizations that handles crises well. 
  Test on production data.  Code behavior (especially performance) is often data driven. 
  Track and trend.  Understanding your historical performance characteristics is essential for spotting emerging problems. 
  Assumptions will burn you.  Systems are complex and often break in unexpected ways. 
  Decouple.  Isolate performance failures. 
  Cache.  Caching is the core of most optimizations. 
  Federate.  Data federation is taking a single data set and spreading it across multiple database/application servers. 
  Replicate.  Replication is making synchronized copies of data available in more than one place. 
  Avoid straining hard-to-scale resources.  Some resources are inherently hard to scale: Uncacheable’ data, Data with a very high read+write rate</p><p>5 0.77089876 <a title="633-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-09-GridwiseTech_revolutionizes_data_management.html">697 high scalability-2009-09-09-GridwiseTech revolutionizes data management</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech has  developed AdHoc , an advanced framework for sharing geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective. The premise of AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access to his or her resources without an IT administrator’s help, and with high security level of any exposed data or applications assured. It takes 3 easy steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization, add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join forces for more efficient results.  AdHoc was initially created for a consortium of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the administration</p><p>6 0.75955731 <a title="633-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-03-Hazelcast_2.0%3A_Big_Data_In-Memory.html">1221 high scalability-2012-04-03-Hazelcast 2.0: Big Data In-Memory</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From  FRESH Ports  and their website:    ISPman  is an ISP management software written in perl, using an LDAP backend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP.  It can be used to manage, DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration, cyrus mail boxes, proftpd etc.    
 
 ISPMan was written as a management tool for the network at 4unet where between 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is crazily growing. Managing these domains and their users was a little time consuming, and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these daemons fluently.  Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and users.  LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server can be scaled from 1 to n as required.  An LDAP entry called maildrop tells the SMTP server (postfix) where to deliver the mail.  The SMTP servers can be loadbalanced with one of many load balancing techniques.  The program is written with scalability and High availability in mind.

<p>Introduction: GemStone has unveiled GemFire 6.0 which is the culmination of several years of development and the continuous solving of the hardest data management problems in the world. With this release GemFire touts some of the latest innovative features in data management.  In this release:
 
-	GemFire introduces a resource manager to continuously monitor and protect cache instances from running out of memory, triggering rebalancing to migrate data to less loaded nodes or allow dynamic increase/decrease in the number of nodes hosting data for linear scalability without impeding ongoing operations (no contention points).  -	GemFire provides explicit control over when rebalancing can be triggered, on what class of data and even allows the administrator to simulate a "rebalance" operation to quantify the benefits before actually doing it.  -	With built in instrumentation that captures throughput and latency metrics, GemFire now enables applications to sense changing performance patterns and proactiv</p><p>3 0.9116863 <a title="633-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_Web_Log_Expert.html">36 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: Web Log Expert</a></p>

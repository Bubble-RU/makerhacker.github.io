How do you scale an  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure? This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can use to make the most of Amazon’s dynamic approach, and the architectural model you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.
 
I base my report on my experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming (Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS (Geographic Information System). It’s true that my experience in gaming ( IsCool, The Game ) is currently the most representative in terms of scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU – daily active users – at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability and da</p><p>4 0.1140549 <a title="492-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-07-10_Core_Architecture_Pattern_Variations_for_Achieving_Scalability.html">1138 high scalability-2011-11-07-10 Core Architecture Pattern Variations for Achieving Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Srinath Perera has put together a  strong list of architecture patterns  based on three meta patterns:  distribution, caching, and asynchronous processing. He contends these three are the primal patterns and the following patterns are but different combinations:
  
  LB (Load Balancers) + Shared nothing Units . Units that do not share anything with each other fronted with a load balancer that routes incoming messages to a unit based on some criteria. 
  LB + Stateless Nodes + Scalable Storage . Several stateless nodes talking to a scalable storage, and a load balancer distributes load among the nodes. 
  Peer to Peer Architectures (Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Content Addressable Networks (CAN)) . Algorithm for scaling up logarithmically. 
  Distributed Queues . Queue implementation (FIFO delivery) implemented as a network service. 
  Publish/Subscribe Paradigm . Network publish subscribe brokers that route messages to each other.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: Jesper Söderlund put together an excellent list of four general scalability patterns and four subpatterns in his post  Scalability patterns and an interesting story :
  
 
  Load distribution  - Spread the system load across multiple processing units                
 
  Load balancing / load sharing  - Spreading the load across many components with equal properties for handling the request 
  Partitioning  - Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to a component that owns that data specific           
 
  Vertical partitioning  - Spreading the load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions being handled by different processing units 
  Horizontal partitioning  - Spreading a single type of data element across many instances, according to some partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation, etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.

<p>Introduction: Alan Watts once observed how after we accepted Descartes' separation of the mind and body we've been trying to smash them back together again ever since when really they were never separate to begin with.      The database normalization-denormalization dualism has the same mobius shaped reverberations as Descartes' error. We separate data into a million jagged little pieces and then spend all our time stooping over, picking them and up, and joining them back together again.       Normalization has been standard practice now for decades. But times are changing. Many mega-website architects are concluding Watts was right: the data was never separate to begin with.  And even more radical, we may even need to store multiple copies of data.

<p>Introduction: O'Reilly Radar's James Turner conducted a  very informative interview  with Joe Stump, current CTO of  SimpleGeo  and former lead architect at  Digg , in which Joe makes some of his usually insightful comments on his experience using Cassandra vs MySQL. As Digg started out with a  MySQL oriented architecture  and has recently been  moving full speed  to Cassandra, his observations on some of their lessons learned and the motivation for the move are especially valuable. Here are some of the key takeaways you find useful:
  
  Precompute on writes, make reads fast . This is an oldie as a scaling strategy, but it's valuable to see how SimpleGeo is applying it to their problem of finding entities within a certain geographical region. Using Cassandra they've built two clusters: one for indexes and one for records. The records cluster, as you might imagine, is a simple data lookup. The index cluster has a carefully constructed key for every lookup scenario. The indexes are computed on the wr</p><p>5 0.75071895 <a title="492-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-22-Applying_Scalability_Patterns_to_Infrastructure_Architecture.html">906 high scalability-2010-09-22-Applying Scalability Patterns to Infrastructure Architecture</a></p>

The “ High Scalability ” blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not disappoint with a post  highlighting a set of scalability design patterns  that was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on “ 6 Ways to Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way. ”

<p>Introduction: As part of  Dr. Indranil Gupta 's  CS 525 Spring 2011 Advanced Distributed Systems  class, he has collected an incredible  list of resources on distributed systems . His  research group  is also doing some interesting work.
 
The  various topics  include: Before there Were Clouds, Cloud Computing, P2P Systems, Basic Distributed Computing Concepts, Sensor Networks, Overlays and DHTs, Cloud Programming, Cloud Scheduling, Key-Value Stores, Storage, Sensor Net Routing, Geo-Distribution, P2P Apps, In-network processing, Epidemics, Probabilistic Membership Protocols, Distributed Monitoring and  Management, Publish-Subscribe/CDNs, Measurement Studies, Old Wine: Stale or Vintage?, In Byzantium, Cloud Pricing, Other Industrial Systems, Structure of Networks, Completing the Circle, Green Clouds, Distributed Debugging, Flash!, The Middle or the End?, Availability-Aware Systems, Design Methodologies, Handling Stress, Sources of unreliability in networks, Handling Stress, Selfish algorithms, Securi</p><p>3 0.95252275 <a title="492-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:   My recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid expiration headers) is employ a    reverse proxy    as mentioned in this article.   In the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.  It's trivial to implement for anyone interested...</p><p>4 0.90975392 <a title="492-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-27-Product%3A_Sequoia_Database_Clustering_Technology.html">102 high scalability-2007-09-27-Product: Sequoia Database Clustering Technology</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sequoia  is a transparent middleware solution offering clustering, load balancing and failover services for any database. Sequoia is the continuation of the C-JDBC project. The database is distributed and replicated among several nodes and Sequoia balances the queries among these nodes. Sequoia handles node and network failures with transparent failover. It also provides support for hot recovery, online maintenance operations and online upgrades.
  Features in a nutshell    No modification of existing applications or databases.    Operational with any database providing a JDBC driver.    High availability provided by advanced RAIDb technology.    Transparent failover and recovery capabilities.    Performance scalability with unique load balancing and query result caching features.    Integrated JMX-based administration and monitoring.    100% Java implementation allowing portability across platforms with a JRE 1.4 or greater.    Open source licensed under Apache v2 license.

<p>Introduction: Deploying, running and monitoring application on a big cluster is a challenging task. Recently  Hazelcast  team deployed a demo application on Amazon EC2 platform to show how Hazelcast p2p cluster scales and screen recorded the entire process from deployment to monitoring.
 
Hazelcast is open source (Apache License), transactional, distributed caching solution for Java. It is a little more than a cache though as it provides distributed implementation of map, multimap, queue, topic, lock and executor service.Â 
 
Details of running 100 node Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2 can be  found here .

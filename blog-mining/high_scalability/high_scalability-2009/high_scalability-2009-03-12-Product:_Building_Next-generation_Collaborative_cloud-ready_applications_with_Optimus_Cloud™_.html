<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

Video by Rich Wolskiand a Visualization.com interviewRich Wolski on
Eucalyptus: Open Source Cloud Computing.Eucalyptusis generating some
excitement on theCloud Computinggroup as a potential vendor neutral EC2
compatible cloud platform. Two reasons why Eucalyptus is potentially
important: private clouds and cloud portability:breakPrivate clouds. Let's say
you want a cloud like infrastructure for architectural purposes but you want
it to run on your own hardware in your own secure environment. How would you
do this today? Hm....Cloud portability. With the number of cloud offerings
increasing how can you maintain some level of vendor neutrality among this
"swarm" of different options? Portability is a key capability for cloud
customers as the only real power customers have is in where they take their
business and the only way you can change suppliers is if there's a ready
market of fungible services. And the only</p><p>6 0.85386044 <a title="536-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-05-Intercloud%3A_How_Will_We_Scale_Across_Multiple_Clouds%3F.html">803 high scalability-2010-04-05-Intercloud: How Will We Scale Across Multiple Clouds?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences. Shows how to
analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what
I mean. Steve Souders, author ofHigh Performance WebsitesandYslow, hasten more
best practices to speed up your website:Split the initial payloadLoad scripts
without blockingDon't scatter scriptsSplit dominant content domainsMake static
content cookie-freeReduce cookie weightMinify CSSOptimize imagesUse iframes
sparinglyTo www or not to wwwSadly, according to String Theory, there are only
26.7 rules left, so get them while they're still in our dimension.Here

<p>Introduction: Update: Organism without a brain creates external memories for navigationshows
slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where
it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's
calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the
organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that
won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors
make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants.  InAfter Life: The
Strange Science Of Decaythere's a truly incredible sequence of gorgeously shot
video showing howcreeping slime moldsolves mazes and performs other other
amazing feats of computation. Take a look at what simple one celled organisms
can do:The whole video is really well done and shockingly revelatory. It's the
story of decay, how atoms created during the Big Bang and through countless
supernova explosions are continually rearranged and reused by the complex

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released
information onPregel. Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip.
Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure......to mine a wide range of
graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each
iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages
sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify
its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's
topology.Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this
limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but
so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing
problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much
faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to
use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

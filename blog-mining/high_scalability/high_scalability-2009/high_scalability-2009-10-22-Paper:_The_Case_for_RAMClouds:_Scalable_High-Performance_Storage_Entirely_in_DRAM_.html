<p>Introduction: Most every programmer who gets sucked into deep performance analysis for long
running processes eventually realizes memory allocation is the heart of evil
at the center of many of their problems. So you replace malloc with something
less worse. Or you tune your garbage collector like a fine ukulele. But
there's a smarter approach brought to you from the folks atRAMCloud, a
Stanford University production, which is a large scale, distributed, in-memory
key-value database.What they've found is that typical memory management
approaches don't work and using a log structured approach yields massive
benefits:Performance measurements of log-structured memory in RAMCloud show
that it enables high client through- put at 80-90% memory utilization, even
with artificially stressful workloads. In the most stressful workload, a
single RAMCloud server can support 270,000-410,000 durable 100-byte writes per
second at 90% memory utilization. The two-level approach to cleaning improves

Architect, gives thispresentationon how eBay scales, for free. Randy has done
a fabulous job in this presentation and in other talks listed at the end of
this post getting at the heart of the principles behind scalability. It's more
about ideas of how things work and fit together than a focusing on a
particular technology stack.Impressive StatsIn case you weren't sure, eBay is
big, with lots of: users, data, features, and change...Over 89 million active

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a

<p>Introduction: Update 8:The Cost of Latency by James Hamilton. James summarizing some latency
info from Steve Souder,Greg Linden, andMarissa Mayer. Speed [is] an
undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web.Update 7:How do you know when
you need more memcache servers?. Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache
not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed
Pays, in Milliseconds. Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a500
millisecondtrading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside,
Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together
an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.Update 5:Shopzilla's

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.Why flash rules for databasesThe economics of
flash memory are staggering.If you're not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.
Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory -
less than 100GB - great for in-memory solutions. There's a place for
rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data.
But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option. For
example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive
is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random
4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB
Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated
as slowest, but our internal testing showing solid performance. Most

<p>Introduction: "Data is everywhere, never be at a single location. Not scalable, not
maintainable."-Alex SzalayWhile Galileo played life and death doctrinal games
over the mysteries revealed by the telescope, another revolution went
unnoticed, the microscope gave up mystery after mystery and nobody yet
understood how subversive would be what it revealed. For the first time these
new tools of perceptual augmentation allowed humans to peek behind the veil of
appearance. A new new eye driving human invention and discovery for hundreds
of years.Data is anothermaterialthat hides, revealing itself only when we look
at different scales and investigate its underlying patterns. If the universe
is trulymade of information, then we are looking into truly primal stuff. A
new eye is needed for Data and an ambitious project calledData-scopeaims to be
the lens.A detailedpaperon the Data-Scope tells more about what it is:The

Google'sdatacenter is the computerview of the world. In that view all compute
resources (memory, CPU, storage) are fungible. They are interchangeable and
location independent, individual computers lose identity and become just a
part of a service.Thwarting that nirvana has been the abysmal performance of
commodity datacenter networks which have caused the preference of
architectures that favor the collocation of state and behaviour on the same
box. MapReduce famouslyships code over to storage nodesfor just this
reason.Change the network and you change the fundamental assumption driving
collocation based software architectures. You are then free to store data
anywhere and move compute anywhere you wish. The datacenter becomes the

<p>Introduction: Yes, I just got through watching the Superbowl so chips and salsa are on my
mind and in my stomach. In recreational eating more chips requires downing
more salsa. With mulitcore chips it turns out as cores go up salsa goes down,
salsa obviously being a metaphor for speed.Sandia National Laboratories found
in their simulations:a significant increase in speed going from two to four
multicores, but an insignificant increase from four to eight multicores.
Exceeding eight multicores causes a decrease in speed. Sixteen multicores
perform barely as well as two, and after that, a steep decline is registered
as more cores are added. The problem is the lack of memory bandwidth as well
as contention between processors over the memory bus available to each
processor.The implication for those following a diagonal scaling strategy is
to work like heck to make your system fit within eight multicores. After that
you'll need to consider some sort of partitioning strategy. What's interesting
is the rese</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88281173 <a title="726-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-22-Paper%3A_The_Case_for_RAMClouds%3A_Scalable_High-Performance_Storage_Entirely_in_DRAM_.html">726 high scalability-2009-10-22-Paper: The Case for RAMClouds: Scalable High-Performance Storage Entirely in DRAM </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stanford Info Lab is taking pains to document a direction we've been moving
for a while now, using RAM not just as a cache, but as the primary storage
medium. Manyquality products have built on this model. Even if the vision
isn't radical, the paper does produce a lot of data backing up the transition,
which is in itself helpful. From the The Abstract:Disk-oriented approaches to
online storage are becoming increasingly problematic: they do not scale grace-
fully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications, and improvements in
disk capacity have far out-stripped improvements in access latency and
bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called
RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems
are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity
servers. We believe that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage
with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access
latency. T</p><p>3 0.84849817 <a title="726-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-03-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Sep_3%2C_2010.html">893 high scalability-2010-09-03-Hot Scalability Links For Sep 3, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is byHasan Ceylan, an Open Source software enthusiast from
Istanbul.I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together
with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I
contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.Those were the days
our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and
applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot
of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we
can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml
descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to
use the curse called "XDoclet".On the other side, our company grew steadily,
our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and
ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew
considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of
money. The challenge we h</p><p>6 0.79897296 <a title="726-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-01-The_Mullet_Cloud_Selection_Pattern.html">1624 high scalability-2014-04-01-The Mullet Cloud Selection Pattern</a></p>

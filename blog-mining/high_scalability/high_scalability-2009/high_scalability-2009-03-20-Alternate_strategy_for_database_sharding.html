<p>Introduction: Update:A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview withGoogle engineer Max Ross on
Hibernate Shards. Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how
it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in
the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to
Google AppEngine (not much).To scale you are supposed to partition your data.
Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all
the details it's not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate
shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for
horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the
shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core
group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although
there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff
in the right way and it's very much worth looking at, especially if you use
Hiberna</p><p>5 0.11492443 <a title="546-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data
is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large
singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you
have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each
individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all
shards.There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys
across a shard cluster. Each has its pro’s and con’s and the one chosen should
be specific to the problems you’re trying to solve.</p><p>4 0.80122334 <a title="546-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Product%3A__Hibernate_Shards.html">24 high scalability-2007-07-24-Product:  Hibernate Shards</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Let suppose i have table which stored tags .Now user can enter keywords and i
have to search through all the records in table and find post which contain
tags entered by user .user can enter more than 1 keywords.What strategy
,technique i use to search fast .There maybe more than millions records and
many users are firing same query.Thanks</p><p>same-blog 2 0.78122908 <a title="546-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-20-Alternate_strategy_for_database_sharding.html">546 high scalability-2009-03-20-Alternate strategy for database sharding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An alternate strategy for database sharding which avoids queries across
different shards and merging results. A central repository of data is
maintained for some tables along with other shards. Can be used in calculating

<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of
Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of
the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data
servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective,
flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute and data-intensive
applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of
systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory,
and delivers 47.38 trillion floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS)
of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to
users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment
architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future.This

<p>Introduction: Hi all, a     I run a site that after a complete redesign have gotten a lot more traffic. The site provides free flash games, so the biggest traffic share goes to serving flash files (from about 100K and up to several megabytes in size each.)     I currently host the entire site on a hosting provider that have no traffic limits. But since they are very cheap (yet have served me very well all the time with at least 99,9% uptime), I don't trust them in allowing me to continue consuming more and more bandwidth. I just guess I'm going to reach some internal limit they have on day, so I'm looking into moving all the flash content over to a content delivery network of some sort.     Some recent traffic stats:   August: 12 GB   September: 22 GB   October: 55 GB   November: Currently 2,3 GB pr day on average, but it's rising..     I've been looking into Amazon S3, but have not decided on anything yet. So therefor I'm asking if there are any other provides I should consider, that operates withi</p><p>5 0.10839621 <a title="611-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-15-New_Website_Design_Considerations.html">276 high scalability-2008-03-15-New Website Design Considerations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I am in the design phase of getting a website up and running that will have scalability as a main concern.  I am looking for opinions on architecture and the like for this endeavor.     The site has a few unique characteristics that make scalability difficult.  Users will all have a pretty large amount of data that other users will be able to search.  The site will be entirely based around search.  The catch is that other users will be searching always with a stipulation of 'n' miles from me.  I imagine that fact will kill the possibility of query caching for most searches.     I have extensive experience with PHP and MYSQL, some experience with ASP.NET/C#, some experience with perl but can learn anything fast.  The site will start out on a single server but I want to be 100% certain that I architect the code and databases such that scaling will be simple.     What language should I code the site in?

<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,  I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was taking too much load.  There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain PHP/HTML coding is used.  Technology:  PHP -- 5.2 MYSQL -- 5.0 Apache -- 2.0 Linux  Following is all the server details of my site:   CPU :  Single Socket Dual Core AMD Opteron 1212HE Memory: 2GB DDR RAM Hard Drive: 250GB SATA Ethernet: 100Mb Primary Ethernet Card  (/var/log) # uname -a Linux 2.6.9-67.0.15.ELsmp #1 SMP Tue Apr 22 13:50:33 EDT 2008 i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux  kernel version: 2.6.9-67.0.15.ELsmp  (/var/log) # free -m  total       used</p><p>2 0.68504733 <a title="611-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-17-Scaling_in_Games_%26_Virtual_Worlds___.html">496 high scalability-2009-01-17-Scaling in Games & Virtual Worlds   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems Laboratories     * The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the high-tech industry.   * The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome of the evolution of these games.    * Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.    * The game server is used both to discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating (by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the server component.   * Using multiple servers is a basic mecha</p><p>3 0.68257129 <a title="611-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-29-Is_Eucalyptus_ready_to_be_your_private_cloud%3F.html">610 high scalability-2009-05-29-Is Eucalyptus ready to be your private cloud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: :  Eucalyptus Goes Commercial with $5.5M Funding Round .  This removes my objection that it's an academic project only. Go team go!   Rich Wolski , professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, gave a spirited talk on  Eucalyptus  to a large group of very interested cloudsters at the  Eucalyptus Cloud Meetup . If Rich could teach computer science at every school the state of the computer science industry would be stratospheric. Rich is dynamic, smart, passionate, and visionary. It's that vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement Eucalyptus and have been improving it and tracking Amazon's changes ever since.

<p>Introduction: Twitter Sees Its 20 Billionth Tweet  writes  Marshall Kirkpatrick of ReadWriteWeb. 
  Startups die for not having customers, so STOP thinking about how to scale . Alessandro Orsi says  focusing on the architecture and scaling possibilities of your app for millions of users is just plain dumb...concentrate on marketing...concentrate on user experience . Alessandro is perfectly correct, but this isn't the year the 2000 when the default architecture that is easy is also not scalable and when sites were built from scratch one painful user at a time.  Today neither is tue. In the era of social networks, where Facebook has 500 million users, successful applications can and often do spike to millions of users seemingly overnight. And you have to have some architecture. With today's tool-chains you don't have to choose easy and non-scalable. There are other options. Of course, it's all pointless without customers and that is what you need to worry about, but it's a false choice in this era to</p><p>5 0.65495306 <a title="611-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-13-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_Aug_13%2C_2010.html">880 high scalability-2010-08-13-Hot Scalability Links for Aug 13, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ezra Zygmuntowicz in a heart warming account of his      4 Years at Engine Yard   , has concluded in his experience that:  the true future of cloud computing for developers is to not think about servers at all. It is now time to focus on the Application and new levels of abstraction that allow folks to use the computing resources in easier and easier ways.

   bryanlatten :  Nothing like a million caching layers to screw up an already complicated deployment. Thankfully, there is beer. 
  jkalucki : Twitter isn't down, you are just using the wrong access methods... 
  andyedinborough : I don't mean to hate, but why would I give up performance and scalability for a dynamic language? Honestly, I don't get it. 
  AsitSinha : It's amazing.... to see the absence of an understanding of how capability plays a role in scalability.

<p>Introduction: Lightcloud is a distributed and persistentkey-value databasefromPlurk.com.
Performance is said to be comparable to memcached. It's different
thanmemcachedbbecause it scales out horizontally by adding new nodes. It's
different than memcached because it persists to disk, it's not just a cache.
Now you haveone more optionin the never ending quest to ditch the RDBMS.Their
website does a nice job explaining the system:Built on Tokyo Tyrant. One of
the fastest key-value databases [benchmark]. Tokyo Tyrant has been in
development for many years and is used in production by Plurk.com, mixi.jp and
scribd.com (to name a few)...Great performance (comparable to memcached!)Can

<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is
still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head
scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are
you still the same person?The Ise Grand Shrine has been in continuous
existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has
been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then
dismantled.Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a
living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what
is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the
shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that
imperative.You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects
like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed
in each new environment.The patterns of recurrence in software are the result
of Darwinian selectio</p><p>3 0.7808699 <a title="528-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-09-Paper%3A_Propagation_Networks%3A_A_Flexible_and_Expressive_Substrate_for_Computation_.html">839 high scalability-2010-06-09-Paper: Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation Propagation Networks: A
Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation, offers to help us break
free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of
autonomous but interconnected machines.  We can do this byorganizing
computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of
which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the
network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the
structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.The abstract from
his thesis is:In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of
computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The
traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large
memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with
computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected
with stateful storage cells. In so</p><p>4 0.73489511 <a title="528-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-18-Robert_Scoble%27s_Rules_for_Successfully_Scaling_Startups.html">352 high scalability-2008-07-18-Robert Scoble's Rules for Successfully Scaling Startups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignantFriendFeed threadcommiserating PodTech's
unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup.
Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with
them:Have a story.Have everyone on board with that story.If anyone goes off of
that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.Make sure
people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues
should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get
fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.Work ONLY for a leader who
will make the tough decisions.Build a place where excellence is expected,
allowed, and is enabled.Fire idiots quickly.If your engineering team can't
give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only
things that are measured ever get improved.When your stars aren't listened to
the company is in trouble.Getting rid of the CEO, even if it's all his fault,

<p>Introduction: If you are interested in future foward OS designs then you might find Akaros
worth a look. It's an operating system designed for many-core architectures
and large-scale SMP systems, with the goals of:Providing better support for
parallel and high-performance applicationsScaling the operating system to a
large number of cores A more indepth explanation of the motiviation behind
Akaros can be found inImproving Per-Node Efﬁciency in the Datacenter with
NewOS Abstractions by Barret Rhoden, Kevin Klues, David Zhu, and Eric
Brewer.The abstract:We believe datacenters can beneﬁt from more focus on per-
node efﬁciency, performance, and predictability, versus the more common focus
so far on scalability to a large number of nodes. Improving per-node efﬁciency
decreases costs and fault recovery because fewer nodes are required for the
same amount of work. We believe that the use of complex, general-purpose
operating systems is a key contributing factor to these inefﬁciencies.

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Summize  Computes Computing Resources for a Startup . Lots of nice graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost efficient for well used larger machines.  Long term storage costs may eat your saving away. And out of cloud bandwidth costs are high.     Update: via  ProductionScale , a nice Digital Web article on  how to setup S3 to store media files  and how Blue Origin was able to handle 3.5 million requests and 758 GBs in bandwidth in a single day for very little $$$. Also a Right Scale article on  Network performance within Amazon EC2 and to Amazon S3 . 75MB/s between EC2 instances, 10.2MB/s between EC2 and S3 for download, 6.9MB/s upload.       Now that Amazon's S3 (storage service) is   out of beta   and EC2 (elastic compute cloud) has added new   instance types   (the class of machine you can rent) with more CPU and more RAM, I thought it would be interesting to take a look out how their pricing stacks up.      The quick conclusion:  the m</p><p>3 0.16074976 <a title="526-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-29-Amazon_Improves_Diagonal_Scaling_Support_with_High-CPU_Instances.html">334 high scalability-2008-05-29-Amazon Improves Diagonal Scaling Support with High-CPU Instances</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now you can buy more cores on EC2 without adding more machines:     The High-CPU Medium Instance is billed at $0.20 (20 cents) per hour. It features 1.7 GB of memory, 5 EC2 Compute Units (2 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units Each), and 350 GB of instance storage, all on a 32-bit platform.   The High-CPU Extra Large Instance is billed at $0.80 (80 cents) per hour. It features 7 GB of memory, 20 EC2 Compute Units (8 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units each), and 1,690 GB of instance storage, all on a 64-bit platform.   Diagonal Scaling  is making a site faster by removing machines.

<p>Introduction: Update 35  :   How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational Database  . Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in order to mimic RDBMS joins:   Given the trade off between potential inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the latter.      Update 34  : Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?   Amazon dramatically drops SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB  . This puts SimpleDB on par with   Google App Engine  . They also announced  a few new features:   a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline uploading of multiple items or attributes  . One of the complaints against SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things. These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.

Now. Or you're doing it wrong.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by   Brian  Bulkowski  , CTO and co-founder of   Aerospike  , a leading clustered NoSQL  database, has worked in the area of high performance commodity systems  since 1989. 
   Why flash rules for databases     The economics of flash memory are staggering.    If you’re not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.   
   Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory – less than 100GB – great for in-memory solutions. There’s a place for rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data. But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option.  
   For example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random 4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated as slowest, but our internal testing showing</p><p>4 0.75263536 <a title="526-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-05-How_will_memristors_change_everything%3F_.html">823 high scalability-2010-05-05-How will memristors change everything? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: A non-random sample of my tech friends shows that not many have heard of  memristors  (though I do suspect vote tampering). I'd read a little about memristors in  2008  when the initial hubbub about the existence of memristors was raised. I, however,  immediately filed them into that comforting conceptual bucket of potentially revolutionary technologies I didn't have to worry about because like most wondertech, nothing would ever come of it. Wrong. After watching  Finding the   Missing  Memristor  by R. Stanley Williams I've had to change my mind. Memristors have gone from "maybe never" to holy cow this could happen soon and it could change everything.
 
Let's assume for the sake of dreaming memristors do prove out. How will we design systems when we have access to a new material that is two orders of magnitude more efficient from a power perspective than traditional transistor technologies, contains multiple petabits (1 petabit = 128TB) of persistent storage, and can be reconfigured t</p><p>5 0.71941036 <a title="526-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-30-37signals_Still_Happily_Scaling_on_Moore_RAM_and_SSDs.html">1183 high scalability-2012-01-30-37signals Still Happily Scaling on Moore RAM and SSDs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are so many architectural ideas swirling in the bit wind these days. Two of the biggest battles are cloud vs. bare metal and RAM vs. disk vs. SSD. 37signals has published two solid articles that are counter hype cycle in their message:
  

Technologists who grew up when RAM cost $1,000 per megabyte can have a hard time dealing with the luxury of RAM being virtually free.


The progress of technology is throwing an ever greater number of optimizations into the “premature evil” bucket never to be seen again.

  
37signals made quite a stir with their money shot of the  864GB of RAM they bought for a mere $12K  as part of their caching layer for Basecamp. That's a lot of memory for not a lot of money. There's nothing like actually seeing it in the flesh to bring the point home. Does that make  Memory Based Architectures  a little more appealing?
 
37signals then followed up with another provocative article:  Three years later, Mr. Moore is still letting us punt on database sharding</p><p>6 0.71913922 <a title="526-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-17-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_17th%2C_2014.html">1581 high scalability-2014-01-17-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 17th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rodrigo Campos  shared some interesting benchmark results  for AWS instances in the South America Region (SĂŁo Paulo) and US East Region (North Virginia). He summarized the results in this thread on the  Guerrilla Capacity Planning  list:
  
 The same instance type shows a different behavior depending on the region that it is running, this is particularly critical if you depend on multiple regions for disaster recovery or geographical load balancing 
 Generally speaking performance is better and more consistent in the South America region when compared to Virginia, this is probably due to the fact that SA region was the latest to be deployed. Maybe the SA datacenter uses new server models or it is just underutilized, but this is a wild guess  
 Write performance for the medium instance type in Virginia abruptly decays, dropping from almost 400 call/s to something around 300 calls/s, this is not very clear in the scatter plot but if you draw a time-based chart you can clearly see this pa</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91720927 <a title="526-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-05-Strategy%3A__In_Cloud_Computing_Systematically_Drive_Load_to_the_CPU.html">526 high scalability-2009-03-05-Strategy:  In Cloud Computing Systematically Drive Load to the CPU</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:     Linear Bloom Filters   by Edward Kmett. A Bloom filter is a novel data structure for approximating membership in a set. A Bloom join  conserves network bandwith  by exchanging cheaper, more plentiful local CPU utilization and disk IO.    Update:     What are Amazon EC2 Compute Units?  . Cloud providers charge for CPU time in voodoo units like "compute units" and "core hours."  Geva Perry takes on the quest of figuring out what these mean in real life.       I attended Sebastian Stadil's   AWS Training Camp   Saturday and during the class Sebastian brought up a wonderfully counter-intuitive idea:   CPU (EC2) costs a lot less than storage (S3, SDB) so you should systematically move as much work as you can to the CPU  . This is said to be the   Client-Cloud Paradigm  . It leverages the well pummeled trend that CPU power follows Moore's Law while storage follows   The Great Plains' Law   (flat). And what sane computing professional would do battle with Sir Moore and his   tru</p><p>3 0.85970229 <a title="526-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-07-What_Google_App_Engine_Price_Changes_Say_About_the_Future_of_Web_Architecture.html">1112 high scalability-2011-09-07-What Google App Engine Price Changes Say About the Future of Web Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things . -- Corinthians
 
 With this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs .  I like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.  -- Sylvain on  Google Groups 
 
The dream is dead. Google App Engine's bold  pay for what you use  dream dies as it leaves childish things behind and becomes a  real product .  Pricing will change . Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will change. But Google App Engine  will survive.   
 
Google is  shutting down  many of its  projects . GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank for it surving the  more wood behind  more deadly arrows push? Without a radical and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote in the long scroll of good ideas.

<p>Introduction: If Twitter is the “nervous system of the web” as some people think, then what is the brain that makes sense of all those signals (tweets) from the nervous system? That brain is the Twitter Analytics System and Kevin Weil,  as Analytics Lead at Twitter,  is the homunculus within in charge of figuring out what those over 100 billion tweets (approximately the number of neurons in the human brain) mean.
 
Twitter has only 10% of the expected 100 billion tweets now, but a good brain always plans ahead. Kevin gave a talk,  Hadoop and Protocol Buffers at Twitter , at the  Hadoop Meetup , explaining how Twitter plans to use all that data to an answer key business questions.
 
What type of questions is Twitter interested in answering? Questions that help them better understand Twitter. Questions like:
  
  How many requests do we serve in  a day?  
  What is the average latency? 
  How many searches happen in day?  
  How many unique queries, how many unique users, what is their geographic dist</p><p>5 0.85506916 <a title="526-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-04-Changing_Architectures%3A_New_Datacenter_Networks_Will_Set_Your_Code_and_Data_Free___.html">1316 high scalability-2012-09-04-Changing Architectures: New Datacenter Networks Will Set Your Code and Data Free   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: One consequence of IT   standardization and commodification    has been Google’s    datacenter is the computer    view of the world. In that view all compute resources (memory, CPU, storage) are fungible. They are interchangeable and location independent, individual computers lose identity and become just a part of a service.     Thwarting that nirvana has been the abysmal performance of commodity datacenter networks which have caused the preference of architectures that favor the collocation of state and behaviour on the same box. MapReduce famously    ships code over to storage nodes    for just this reason.    Change the network and you change the fundamental assumption driving collocation based software architectures. You are then free to store data anywhere and move compute anywhere you wish. The datacenter becomes the computer.     On the host side with an x8 slot running at    PCI-Express 3.0    speeds able to push 8GB/sec (that’s bytes) of bandwidth in both directions, we have</p><p>6 0.85493416 <a title="526-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-27-Amazon_Announces_Static_IP_Addresses_and_Multiple_Datacenter_Operation.html">289 high scalability-2008-03-27-Amazon Announces Static IP Addresses and Multiple Datacenter Operation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source.
There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity:
from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-
value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there's Riak, Tokyo Cabinet,
Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL
products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft
Windows. I'm going to outline what's available now and briefly touch on some
opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.You

<p>Introduction: Many enterprises' high-availability architecture is based on the assumption
that you can prevent failure from happening by putting all your critical data
in a centralized database, back it up with expensive storage, and replicate it
somehow between the sites. As I argued in one of my previous posts (Why
Existing Databases (RAC) are So Breakable!) many of those assumptions are
broken at their core, as storage is doomed to failure just like any other
device, expensive hardware doesn't make things any better and database
replication is often not enough.One of the main lessons that we can take from
the likes of Amazon and Google is that the right way to ensure continuous high
availability is by designing our system to cope with failure. We need to
assume that what we tend to think of as unthinkable will probably happen, as
that's the nature of failure. So rather than trying to prevent failures, we
need to build a system that will tolerate them.As we can learn from a recent
outage event in</p><p>5 0.11658101 <a title="748-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-09-Data_Replication_in_NoSQL_Databases.html">1279 high scalability-2012-07-09-Data Replication in NoSQL Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is the third guest post (part 1,part 2) of a series by Greg Lindahl, CTO
of blekko, the spam free search engine. Previously, Greg was Founder and
Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was the architect of the
InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build tightly-coupled
supercomputing clusters.blekko's home-grown NoSQL database was designed from
the start to support a web-scale search engine, with 1,000s of servers and
petabytes of disk. Data replication is a very important part of keeping the
database up and serving queries. Like many NoSQL database authors, we decided
to keep R=3 copies of each piece of data in the database, and not use RAID to
improve reliability. The key goal we were shooting for was a database which
degrades gracefully when there are many small failures over time, without
needing human intervention.Why don't we like RAID for big NoSQL databases?Most
big storage systems use RAID levels like 3, 4, 5, or 10 to improve
reliability.

<p>Introduction: At least in the articles on Plenty of Fish and Slashdot it was mentioned that
one can achieve higher performance by creating read-only and write-only
databases where possible.I have read the comments and tried unsuccessfully to
find more information on the net about this. I still do not understand the
concept. Can someone explain it in more detail, as well as recommend resources
for further investigation? (Are there books written specifically about this
technique?) I think it is a very important issue, because databases are
oftentimes the bottleneck.</p><p>4 0.59823751 <a title="748-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-21-SQL_%2B_NoSQL_%3D_Yes_%21.html">961 high scalability-2010-12-21-SQL + NoSQL = Yes !</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems
to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly
increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly
using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and
gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous
information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and
ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only
SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it's true that the marketing wave of NoSQL
has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that's been around for quite a
while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all,
everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend
of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very profitable
either.So, what'</p><p>5 0.58499128 <a title="748-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-13-Must_see%3A_5_Steps_to_Scaling_MongoDB_%28Or_Any_DB%29_in_8_Minutes.html">1114 high scalability-2011-09-13-Must see: 5 Steps to Scaling MongoDB (Or Any DB) in 8 Minutes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jared Rosoffconcisely, effectively, entertainingly, and convincingly gives an
8 minute MongoDB tutorialon scaling MongoDB at Scale Out Camp. The ideas
aren't just limited to MongoDB, they work for most any database: Optimize your
queries; Know your working set size; Tune your file system; Choose the right
disks; Shard. Here's an explanation of all 5 strategies:Optimize your queries.
Computer science works. Complexity analysis works. A btree search is faster
than a table scan. So analyze your queries. Use explain to see what your query
is doing. If it is saying it's using a cursor then it's doing a table scan.
That's slow. Look at the number of documents it looks at to satisfy a query.
Look at how long it takes. Fix: add indexes. It doesn't matter if you are
running on 1 or 100 servers.Know your working set size. Sticking memcache in
front of your database is silly. You have lots of RAM, use it. Embed your
cache in the database, which is how MongoDB works. Working set = Active

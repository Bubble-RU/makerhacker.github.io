<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: Google's Research Areas of Interest: Building scalable, robust cluster
applications.At Google we see distributed systems as a technology in its
infancy, with huge gaps in the supporting research  that represent some of the
most important problems in the space. Here are some examples:Resource
sharing,Balancing cost, performance, and reliability,Self-maintaining systems.

effective way I have found to understand SimpleDB is to think about it in
terms of something else we all use and understand -- a spreadsheet.Rackspace

I worked at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch startup. Over a
delicious Christmas punch my grandma asked me what I did for a living that I
could afford such extravagantly inexpensive gifts. Always so subtle. I
explained I worked on an ATM switch. Mistake. She sniffed, said that's nice,
and asked me why the Automated Teller Machine ate her bank card that morning.
No matter how hard I tried I couldn't convince her I didn't work on bank ATMs.
To all future job interrogations I waxed off, protesting I do boring software

<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle
traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch
or other very popular websites frontpage).Regular hosting companies
(especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get
crushed under the load in short time.But there is hope. A new breed of hosting
companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability
you need at a fraction of the cost.Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!”
(or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same
thing).Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting
companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of
them).Read the entire article aboutCloud computing, grid computing, utility

<p>Introduction: Hi, I stumbled on your site and I am thinking about starting a website. I
haven't received a good answer about what I should use to buildit, so I
thought I would give it a shot.I am a windows guy. I know .Net and ASP and how
to build web sites using that stack. But I notice most sites use LAMP and
that's what most people talk about using. What's wrong with using Windows?.Net

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:Now that we have a new computing paradigm,
Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data
vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds?
Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space,
and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still
seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids
versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are
a number of issues driving this uncertainty.read more at:BigDataMatters.com</p><p>5 0.97997302 <a title="743-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-23-When_to_migrate_your_database%3F.html">782 high scalability-2010-02-23-When to migrate your database?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming
your business - reports are out of date, your batch processing window is
nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database
consolidation - remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database
environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware,
OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are
clear,  what now?ďťżRead more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>6 0.97948235 <a title="743-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Paper%3A_Pig_Latin%3A_A_Not-So-Foreign_Language_for_Data_Processing.html">443 high scalability-2008-11-14-Paper: Pig Latin: A Not-So-Foreign Language for Data Processing</a></p>

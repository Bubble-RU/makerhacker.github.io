and in one consistent format.Since then a lot has happened.  It's now part of

<p>Introduction: It's been awhile since I've said anything about collectl and I wanted to let
this group know I'm currently working on an interface to ganglia since I've
seen a variety of posts ranging from how much data to log and where to log it
as well as which tools/mechanism to use for logging. From my perspective there
are essentially 2 camps on the monitoring front - one says to have distributed
agents all sending their data to a central point, but don't send too much or
too often. The other camp (which is the one I'm in) says do it all locally
with a highly efficient data collector, because you need a lot of data (I also
read a post in here about logging everything) and you can't possibly monitors
100s or 1Ks of nodes remotely at the granularity necessary to get anything
meaningful.Enter collectl and its evolving interface for ganglia. This will
allow you to log lots of detailed data on local nodes at the usual 10 sec
interval (or more frequent if you prefer) at about 0.1% system overhead while</p><p>5 0.1593148 <a title="719-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-06-How_do_you_monitor_the_performance_of_your_cluster%3F.html">558 high scalability-2009-04-06-How do you monitor the performance of your cluster?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had posted a note the other day about collectl and its ganglia interface but
perhaps I wasn't provocative enough to get any responses so let me ask it a
different way, specifically how do people monitor their clusters and more
importantly how often? Do you monitor to get a general sense of what the
system is doing OR do you monitor with the expectation that when something
goes wrong you'll have enough data to diagnose the problem? Or both? I suspect
both...Many cluster-based monitoring tools tend to have a data collection
daemon running on each target node which periodically sends data to some
central management station. That machine typically writes the data to some
database from which it can then extract historical plots. Some even put up
graphics in real-time.From my experience working with large clusters - and I'm
talking either many hundreds or even 1000s of nodes, most have to limit both
the amount of data they manage centrally as well as the frequency that they
collect it, oth</p><p>6 0.11182044 <a title="719-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-03-Product%3A_Collectl_-_Performance_Data_Collector.html">237 high scalability-2008-02-03-Product: Collectl - Performance Data Collector</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From theirwebsite:There are a number of times in which you find yourself
needing performance data. These can include benchmarking, monitoring a
system's general heath or trying to determine what your system was doing at
some time in the past. Sometimes you just want to know what the system is
doing right now. Depending on what you're doing, you often end up using
different tools, each designed to for that specific situation. Features
include:You are be able to run with non-integral sampling
intervals.Collectluses very little CPU. In fact it has been measured to use
<0.1% when run as a daemon using the default sampling interval of 60 seconds
for process and slab data and 10 seconds for everything else.Brief, verbose,
and plot formats are supported.You can report aggregated performance numbers
on many devices such as CPUs, Disks, interconnects such as Infiniband or
Quadrics, Networks or even Lustre file systems.Collectl will align its
sampling on integral second boundaries.Supports proce</p><p>4 0.68098027 <a title="719-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-06-How_do_you_monitor_the_performance_of_your_cluster%3F.html">558 high scalability-2009-04-06-How do you monitor the performance of your cluster?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected
availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P
systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show
you how! They havelaunched Wuala, the social online storage service which
scales as new nodes join the P2P network.The goal ofWua.lais to provide
distributed online storage that is:largescalablereliablesecureby harnessing
the idle resources of participating computers.This challenge is an old dream
of computer science. In fact asAndrew Tanenbaumwrote in 1995:"The design of a
world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by
millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise
for the reader"After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich,
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system,
Caleido is ready to unveil the result: Wuala. Wuala is a new way of storing,

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like?
Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing.
Specifically the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group(IPNSIG
).Ansible-likefaster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical
warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning
telegraph system.It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more
interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that
was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances
and with muchlonger delays:The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also
called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a
set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2]
Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances,
so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to
large delays and errors.[2] While the In</p><p>3 0.87397677 <a title="719-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL_and_Memcached%3A_End_of_an_Era%3F.html">785 high scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL and Memcached: End of an Era?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you look at the early days of this blog, when web scalability was still in
its heady bloom of youth, many of the articles had to do with
leveragingMySQLandmemcached. Exciting times. Shard MySQL to handle high write
loads, cache objects in memcached to handle high read loads, and then write a
lot of glue code to make it all work together. That was state of the art, that
was how it was done. The architecture of many major sites still follow this
pattern today, largely because with enough elbow grease, it works.This was a
pre-cloud, relational database dominated world, built from parts scrounged
from the remnants of enterprises and datacenters past.TwitterandDiggstarted in
this era, but are evolving into something different, as scaling pressures
increase and new purpose built technologies pop into being.With a little
perspective, it's clear the MySQL+memcached era is passing. It will stick
around for a while. Old technologies seldom fade away completely. Some still
ride horses.

If not, maybe collectl-utils will make it easier to do so</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm not sure how many people who follow this have even tried collectl but I
wanted to let you all know that I just released a set of utilities called
strangely enough collectl-utils, which you can get athttp://collectl-
utils.sourceforge.net. One web-based utility called colplot gives you the
ability to very easily plot data from multiple systems in a way that makes
correlating them over time very easy.Another utility called colmux lets you
look at multiple systems in real time. In fact if you go the page that
describes it in more detail you'll see a photo which shows the CPU loads on
192 systems one a second, one set of data/line! in fact the display so wide it
takes 3 large monitors side-by-side to see it all and even though you can't
actually read the displays you can easily see which systems are loaded and
which aren't.Anyhow give it a look and let me know what you think.-mark</p><p>5 0.86193609 <a title="719-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-01-How_to_update_video_views_count_effectively%3F.html">294 high scalability-2008-04-01-How to update video views count effectively?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I am building a video-sharing site and I'm looking for an efficient way to
update video views count.The easiest way would be to perform an SQL update to
increase the "views" counter every time a video is viewed, but naturally I
want to avoid DB write access as much as possible.I am looking for an
efficient temporary storage to which I could connect and say "increment views
of video X". Every so often I would save the changes to my main database, and
remove the counter from this temporary storage.I am having a hard time finding
such temporary storage, however. My first thought was memcache, but it's not
ideal as I wouldn't like to lose the data if memcache goes down. Also,
memcache's increment command requires that the key is already present - that
means that every time a video is viewed, I would have to check if the key
already exists in memcache, before I can actually send the increment
command.What do people use to solve this kind of issues?Kind regards,Tomasz</p><p>6 0.84247494 <a title="719-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-04-Number_of_load_balanced_servers.html">111 high scalability-2007-10-04-Number of load balanced servers</a></p>

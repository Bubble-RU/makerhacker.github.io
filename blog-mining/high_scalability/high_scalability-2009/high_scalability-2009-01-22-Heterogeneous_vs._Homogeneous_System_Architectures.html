<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: Enterprises want to protect their data.As the appetite for data volumes grows,
storage technology becomes a critical business asset on which business
continuity relies.My recent survey in the medium-size enterprise segment shows
the five dominant investment directions at the level of data management
architecture: disaster recovery (DR), high availability (HA), backup, data
processing performance and migration to more advanced databases.ďťż This
suggests that corporations generally have sufficiently structured data
collections but are concerned with business continuity and continuous
availability of data. What infrastructures can provide these assurances? In
this post I want to focus on yet another option, and that is the Real-Time
Data Integration model. As an example I am going to discuss Oracle GoldenGate,
which permits you to manage the data critical to your business in safety,
ensuring business continuity without disruption even if the data is
distributed among multiple, heterogeneou</p><p>5 0.082123108 <a title="500-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-06-05-Cloud_Architecture_Revolution.html">1654 high scalability-2014-06-05-Cloud Architecture Revolution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The introduction of cloud technologies is not a simple evolution of existing
ones, but a real revolution.  Like all revolutions, it changes the points of
views and redefines all the meanings. Nothing is as before.  This post wants
to analyze some key words and concepts, usually used in traditional
architectures, redefining them according the standpoint of the cloud.
Understanding the meaning of new words is crucial to grasp the essence of a
pure cloud architecture.<>THOMAS REID, Essays on the
Intellectual Powers of ManNowadays, it is required to challenge the limits of
traditional architectures that go beyond the normal concepts of scalability
and support millions of users (What's Up 500 Million) billions of transactions

<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>3 0.71450913 <a title="500-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-08-Microservices_-_Not_a_free_lunch%21.html">1628 high scalability-2014-04-08-Microservices - Not a free lunch!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBenjamin Wootton, CTO ofContino, a London based
consultancy specialising in applying DevOps and Continuous Delivery to
software delivery projects. Microservices are a style of software architecture
that involves delivering systems as a set of very small, granular, independent
collaborating services.Though they aren't a particularly new idea,
Microservices seem to have exploded in popularity this year, with articles,
conference tracks, and Twitter streams waxing lyrical about the benefits of
building software systems in this style.This popularity is partly off the back
of trends such as Cloud, DevOps and Continuous Delivery coming together as
enablers for this kind of approach, and partly off the back of great work at
companies such as Netflix who have very visibly applied the pattern to great
effect.Let me say up front that I am a fan of the approach. Microservices
architectures have lots of very real and significant benefits:The services

<p>Introduction: Companies earnings outstripforecasts, consumer confidence is retuning and city
bonuses areback. What does this mean for business? Growth! After the recent
years of cost cutting in IT budgets, there is the sudden fear induced from
increased demand. Pre-existing trouble points in IT infrastructures that have
lain dormant will suddenly be exposed. Monthly reporting and real time
analytics will suffer as data grows. IT departments across the land will be
crying out "The engine canna take no more captain". What can be done?.entry-
bodyWhat we need is a scalable system that grows with the business. A system
that can handle sudden increases in data growth without falling over. There
are two core principles to a scalable system (1) Users experience constant QoS
as demand grows (2) System Architects can grow system capacity proportionally
with the available resources. In other words, if demand increases twofold, it
is "enough" to purchase twice the hardware.This is linear growth. Is it enough

<p>Introduction: With the Chapultepec aqueduct, also namedthe great aqueduct, theAztecsbuilt a
novel uninterruptible water supply for providing fresh water to Tenochtitlan,
their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still
around today: It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built
with high availability in mind. We findengineers being engineers, no matter
the age:It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of
compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the
bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466
AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to
mitigate its thirst.The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of
Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of
the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got
dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe while the dirty pipe was
cleaned</p><p>6 0.68393499 <a title="500-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-31-Designing_for_Resiliency_will_be_so_2013.html">1379 high scalability-2012-12-31-Designing for Resiliency will be so 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading
retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent
applications. Furthermore, over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are
more likely to make a purchase after "liking" a brand they find online.

they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex
relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:the architectural
considerations behind their solutionwhy they chose memory over diskhow they
partitioned the data to gain scalabilitywhy they chose to execute code with
the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution frameworkhow they integrated
with Facebookwhy they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>6 0.91148233 <a title="500-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Book%3A_High_Performance_MySQL.html">16 high scalability-2007-07-16-Book: High Performance MySQL</a></p>

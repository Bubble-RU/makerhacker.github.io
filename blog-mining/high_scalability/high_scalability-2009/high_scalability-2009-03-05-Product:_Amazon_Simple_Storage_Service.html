graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost
efficient for well used larger machines. Long term storage costs may eat your
saving away. And out of cloud bandwidth costs are high.Update:

<p>Introduction: Now you can buy more cores on EC2 without adding more machines:The High-CPU
Medium Instance is billed at $0.20 (20 cents) per hour. It features 1.7 GB of
memory, 5 EC2 Compute Units (2 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units Each),
and 350 GB of instance storage, all on a 32-bit platform.The High-CPU Extra
Large Instance is billed at $0.80 (80 cents) per hour. It features 7 GB of
memory, 20 EC2 Compute Units (8 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units
each), and 1,690 GB of instance storage, all on a 64-bit platform.Diagonal

<p>Introduction: We build web applications…and there are plenty of them around. Now, if we hit
the jackpot and our application becomes very popular, traffic goes up, and our
servers are brought down by the hordes of people coming to our website. What
do we do in that situation?Of course, I am not talking here about the kind of
traffic Digg, Yahoo Buzz or other social media sites can bring to a website,
which is temporary overnight traffic, or a website which uses cloud computing
like Amazon EC2 service, MediaTemple Grid Service or Mosso Hosting Cloud
service.I am talking about traffic that consistently increases over time as
the service achieves success. Google.com, Yahoo.com, Myspace.com,
Facebook.com, Plentyoffish.com, Linkedin.com, Youtube.com and others are
examples of services which have constant high traffic.Knowing that users want
speed from their applications, these services will always use a Content

<p>Introduction: There has been a lot of speculation over how Apple'siCloudwould work. With the
Apple Worldwide Developers Conferencekeynotes having just completed, we
finally learned the truth. We can handle it. They made some interesting and
cost effective architecture choices that preserved the value of their devices
and the basic model of how their existing services work.A lot of pundits
foretold that with all the datacenters Apple was building we would get a
streaming music solution. Only one copy of music would be stored and then
streamed on demand to everyone. Or they could go the Google brute force method
and copy up all a user's music and play it on demand.Apple did neither. The
chose an interesting middle path that's not Google, Amazon, or even
MobileMe.They key idea is you no longer need a PC. Device content is now
synced over the air and is managed by the cloud, not your legacy computer.
Your data may not even be stored in the cloud, but the whole management,
syncing, and control of content</p><p>4 0.61886269 <a title="525-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-27-Video%3A_Storage_in_the_Cloud_at_Joyent.html">503 high scalability-2009-01-27-Video: Storage in the Cloud at Joyent</a></p>

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>2 0.91457939 <a title="525-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-17-Steve_Ballmer_Says_Microsoft_has_Over_1_Million_Servers_-_What_Does_that_Really_Mean%3F.html">1493 high scalability-2013-07-17-Steve Ballmer Says Microsoft has Over 1 Million Servers - What Does that Really Mean?</a></p>

his calculations are eye popping:Facilities: 15 to 30 large datacentersCapital
expense: $4.25 BillionTotal power: 300MWPower Consumption: 2.6TWh annuallyThe

<p>Introduction: In It's Time for Low Latency  Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's
time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency
datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for
programarchitectures will be revolutionary.  Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished
Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer
resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are
interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter
into single computer. Abstract from the paper:The operating systems community
has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays
in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs
round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will
be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation
delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it
will be up to us to ﬁnish the job and see</p><p>4 0.86931735 <a title="525-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex_Architecture.html">258 high scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Anatomy of a crash in a new part of Yandex written in Django. Writing
to a magic session variable caused an unexpected write into an InnoDB database
on every request. Writes took 6-7 seconds because of index rebuilding. Lots of
useful details on the sizing of their system, what went wrong, and how they
fixed it.Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their
search index. We only know a few fun facts about how they do things, nothing
at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I
thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with
Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:3.5 billion pages in the search
index.Over several thousand servers.35 million searches a day.Several data
centers around Russia.Two-layer architecture.The database is split in pieces
and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database
servers and brings it together for the user.Languages used: c++, perl, some
java.FreeBSD</p><p>5 0.85551274 <a title="525-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-26-Product%3A_HyperGraphDB_-_A_Graph_Database.html">766 high scalability-2010-01-26-Product: HyperGraphDB - A Graph Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the success ofNeo4jas a graph database in the NoSQL revolution, it's
interesting to see another graph database,HyperGraphDB, in the mix. Their
quick blurb on HyperGraphDB says it is a:general purpose, extensible,
portable, distributed, embeddable, open-source data storage mechanism. It is a
graph database designed specifically for artificial intelligence and semantic
web projects, it can also be used as an embedded object-oriented database for
projects of all sizes.From theNoSQL Archivethe summary on HyperGraphDB is:
API:Java(and Java Langs), Written in:Java,  Query Method:Javaor P2P,
Replication:P2P, Concurrency:STM, Misc: Open-Source, Especially for AI and
Semantic Web.So it has some interesting features, like software transactional
memory andP2P  for data distribution, but I found that my first and most
obvious question was not answered: what the heck is ahypergraphand why do I
care? Buried in the tutorial was:A HyperGraphDB database is a generalized
graph of entities. The gene</p><p>6 0.84432608 <a title="525-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_17%2C_2012.html">1195 high scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 17, 2012</a></p>

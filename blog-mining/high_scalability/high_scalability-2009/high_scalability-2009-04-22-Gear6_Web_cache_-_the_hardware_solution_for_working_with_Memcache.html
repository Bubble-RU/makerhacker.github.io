<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've
developed a soph</p><p>3 0.16495167 <a title="577-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-26-Marrying_memcached_and_NoSQL.html">927 high scalability-2010-10-26-Marrying memcached and NoSQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Memcached is one of the most common In-Memory cache implementation.  It was
originally developed by Danga Interactive for LiveJournal, but is now used by
many other sites as a side cache to speed up read mostly operations. It gained
popularity in the non-Java world, too, especially since it's a language-
neutral side cache for which few alternatives existed.  As a side-cache,
Memcache clients relies on the database as the system of record, The database
is still used for write,update and complex query operations.  Since the
memcached specification includes no query operations, memcached is not a
database alternative, unlike most of the NoSQL offerings. It also exclude
memcache from being a real solution for write scalability. As a result of that
many of the heavy sites started to move away from Memcache and replace it with
other NoSQL alternatives as noted in a recent highscalability post MySQL And
Memcached: End Of An Era?The transition away from memcached to NoSQL could
represent a la</p><p>4 0.15026277 <a title="577-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-16-%5BANN%5D_New_Open_Source_Cache_System.html">467 high scalability-2008-12-16-[ANN] New Open Source Cache System</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tugela Cacheis a cache system like memecached, but instead of storing data
just in RAM, it stores data in the file system using a b-tree. You trade
latency in order to have a very large cache. It's useful for sites that have
caching requirements that exceed their available memory. It uses the same wire
protocol asmemcachedso it can be dropped in without a hassle. From the
website:As large MediaWiki deployments may gain performance using Memcached,
at some level cost of RAM to store all objects becomes too high. In order to
balance resource usage and make more use of our Apache server disks, Tugela,

<p>Introduction: Ehcacheis a pure Java cache with the following features: fast, simple, small
foot print, minimal dependencies, provides memory and disk stores for
scalability into gigabytes, scalable to hundreds of cachesis a pluggable cache
for Hibernate, tuned for high concurrent load on large multi-cpu servers,
provides LRU, LFU and FIFO cache eviction policies, and is production tested.
Ehcache is used byLinkedInto cache member profiles. The user guide says it's
possible to get at 2.5 times system speedup for persistent Object Relational
Caching, a 1000 times system speedup for Web Page Caching, and a 1.6 times

<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are
continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand
and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable,
which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.Abstract:The long-running
nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow
processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across
multiplequeries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their
constituent, stateful operators - e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators.
To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a
shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static
techniquesfor partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as
workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue
to function robustly inthe face of these imbalances. To address this
challenge, we introduce a dataflo</p><p>same-blog 2 0.85546404 <a title="577-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-22-Gear6_Web_cache_-_the_hardware_solution_for_working_with_Memcache.html">577 high scalability-2009-04-22-Gear6 Web cache - the hardware solution for working with Memcache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Gear6 Web Cache hybrid DRAM-flash memory architecture allows for 5-10
times more memcache memory per unit of rack space than DRAM-only
configurations, and cuts memory costs by 50%. Other software enhancements
include a slab allocator that is more efficient than traditional memcache
implementations due to its fine-grained bucket sizing. Gear6 Web Cache also
supports object sizes greater than 1 megabyte and manages evictions based on
the cost of replacing objects, depending on the size and frequency of object
access. It intelligently places cache instances across DRAM and flash, taking
into account their different characteristics, while at the same time
monitoring their health and detecting and deâ&euro;?allocating faulty or failing
memory.Gear6 Web Cache is a Memcached protocol compliant solution that scales
and accelerates web applications, reduces memory footprint, enhances
availability and implements comprehensive Memcached management features.

<p>Introduction: What data structure is more sacred than the link list? If we get rid of it
what silly interview questions would we use instead? But not using linked-
lists is exactly what Aater Suleman recommends inShould you ever use Linked-
Lists?InThe Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connectionsone of the important
strategies is not scribbling data all over memory via pointers because
following pointers increases cache misses whichreduces performance. And
there's nothing more iconic of pointers than the link list.Here are Aeter's
reasons to be anti-linked-list:They reduce the benefit of out-of-order
execution.They throw off hardware prefetching.They reduce DRAM and TLB
locality.They cannot leverage SIMD.They are harder to send to GPUs.He also
demolishes the pros of linked-lists, finding arrays a better option in almost
every case. Good discussion in the comment section as not everyone
agrees.Patrick Wyatt detailshow a linked-list threading bugrepeatedly crashed

<p>Introduction: I don't know about you, but when I first learned about Redis my initial
thought was wow, why hasn't anyone done this before? My next thought was why
put this functionality in a separate process? Why not just embed it in your
own server code and skip the network path completely? Especially in a Service
Oriented Architecture there's no need for an extra hop or extra software
installation and configuration.Now you can embed Redis-like code directly into
your server withVedis \- anembeddable datastoreC library built with over 70
commands similar in concept to Redis but without the networking layer since
Vedis run in the same process of the host application. It's transactional,
cross platform, thread safe, key-value, supports terabyte sized databases, has
a GPL-like license (which isn't great for commercial apps), and supports an
on-disk as well as in-memory datastore.More about Vedis:Unlike most other
datastores (i.e. memcache, Redis), Vedis does not have a separate server
process. Vedis r</p><p>5 0.81836033 <a title="577-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-23-Database_Sharding_at_Netlog%2C_with_MySQL_and_PHP.html">519 high scalability-2009-02-23-Database Sharding at Netlog, with MySQL and PHP</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jurriaan Persyn is a Lead Web Developer at Netlog, a social portal site that
gets 50 million unique visitors and 5+ billion page views per month. In this
paper Jurriaan goes into a lot of excellent nuts and bolts details about how
they used sharding to scale their system. If you are pondering sharding as a
solution to your scaling problems you'll want to read this paper. As the paper
is quite well organized there's no reason to write a summary, but I especially
liked this part from the conclusion:If you can do with simpler solutions
(better hardware, more hardware, server tweaking and tuning, vertical
partitioning, sql query optimization, ...) that require less development cost,
why invest lots of effort in sharding? On the other hand, when your visitor
statistics really start blowing through the roof, it is a good direction to
go. After all, it worked for us.</p><p>6 0.81523085 <a title="577-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_22%2C_2012.html">1270 high scalability-2012-06-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 22, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Web Log Stormingis an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows.
The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any
other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down
to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and
how it fits into your desired scenario.Web Log Storming does far more than
just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with
interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of
activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.In
other words, analyze your web logs like never before!It's easy to track
sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to
each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and
keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the
top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed. You

<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: Does anyone know of any articles or papers that discuss the nuts and bolts of
how web analytics is implemented at organizations with large volumes of web
traffic and a critcal business need to analyze that data - e.g. places like
Amazon.com, eBay, and Google?Just as a fun project I'm planning to build my
own web log analysis app that can effectively index and query large volumes of
web log data (i.e. TB range). But first I'd like to learn more about how it's
done in the organizations whose lifeblood depends on this stuff. Even just a
high level architectural overview of their approaches would be nice to have.</p><p>6 0.093479507 <a title="519-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-10-Is_there_a_difference_between_partitioning_and_federation_and_sharding%3F.html">89 high scalability-2007-09-10-Is there a difference between partitioning and federation and sharding?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300
thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially
experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems
and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each
day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly
visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a
very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale
meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?Site:

<p>Introduction: The fascination over Instagram continues and fortunately we have several new
streams of information to feed the insanity. So consider this article an
update toThe Instagram Architecture Facebook Bought For A Cool Billion
Dollars, based primarily onScaling Instagram, a slide deck for an AirBnB tech
talk given by Instagram co-founder, Mike Krieger. Several other information
sources, listed at the bottom of the article, were also used.Unfortunately we
just have a slide deck, so the connective tissue of the talk is missing, but
it's still very interesting, in the same spirit of wisdom presentations we
often see after developers come up for air after spending significant time
spent in the trenches.If you expect to dive deep into the technological
details and find a billion reasons why Instagram was acquired, you will be
disappointed. That magic can be found in the emotional investment in the
relationship between all of the users and the product, not in the bits about
how they bytes are mana</p><p>4 0.64930689 <a title="519-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-04-Digg_Architecture.html">554 high scalability-2009-04-04-Digg Architecture</a></p>

- traffic that necessitated major internal upgrades.Traffic generated by
Digg's over 22 million famously info-hungry users and 230 million page views

grown from a tiny social experiment to one of the largest social networks,
delivering five billion pages per month to many millions of members who visit

forced us to evolve our architecture, eventually arriving at an enormously
capable platform.V1: PHP webapp, 100k users, 15 servers, 2004Tagged was born
in the rapid-prototyping culture of an incubator that usually launched two new
concepts each year in search of the big winner. LAMP was the natural choice
for this style of work, which emphasized flexibility and quick turnaround at a
time when Java development was mostly oriented towards development at large
enterprises, Python attracted too few programmers, and Perl brought the wrong
sort. Also, we knew that Yahoo was a big proponent of PHP, so it would be

<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are
continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand
and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable,
which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.Abstract:The long-running
nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow
processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across
multiplequeries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their
constituent, stateful operators - e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators.
To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a
shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static
techniquesfor partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as
workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue
to function robustly inthe face of these imbalances. To address this
challenge, we introduce a dataflo</p><p>same-blog 2 0.87103629 <a title="519-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-23-Database_Sharding_at_Netlog%2C_with_MySQL_and_PHP.html">519 high scalability-2009-02-23-Database Sharding at Netlog, with MySQL and PHP</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jurriaan Persyn is a Lead Web Developer at Netlog, a social portal site that
gets 50 million unique visitors and 5+ billion page views per month. In this
paper Jurriaan goes into a lot of excellent nuts and bolts details about how
they used sharding to scale their system. If you are pondering sharding as a
solution to your scaling problems you'll want to read this paper. As the paper
is quite well organized there's no reason to write a summary, but I especially
liked this part from the conclusion:If you can do with simpler solutions
(better hardware, more hardware, server tweaking and tuning, vertical
partitioning, sql query optimization, ...) that require less development cost,
why invest lots of effort in sharding? On the other hand, when your visitor
statistics really start blowing through the roof, it is a good direction to
go. After all, it worked for us.</p><p>3 0.86549926 <a title="519-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-22-Gear6_Web_cache_-_the_hardware_solution_for_working_with_Memcache.html">577 high scalability-2009-04-22-Gear6 Web cache - the hardware solution for working with Memcache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Gear6 Web Cache hybrid DRAM-flash memory architecture allows for 5-10
times more memcache memory per unit of rack space than DRAM-only
configurations, and cuts memory costs by 50%. Other software enhancements
include a slab allocator that is more efficient than traditional memcache
implementations due to its fine-grained bucket sizing. Gear6 Web Cache also
supports object sizes greater than 1 megabyte and manages evictions based on
the cost of replacing objects, depending on the size and frequency of object
access. It intelligently places cache instances across DRAM and flash, taking
into account their different characteristics, while at the same time
monitoring their health and detecting and deâ&euro;?allocating faulty or failing
memory.Gear6 Web Cache is a Memcached protocol compliant solution that scales
and accelerates web applications, reduces memory footprint, enhances
availability and implements comprehensive Memcached management features.

<p>Introduction: What data structure is more sacred than the link list? If we get rid of it
what silly interview questions would we use instead? But not using linked-
lists is exactly what Aater Suleman recommends inShould you ever use Linked-
Lists?InThe Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connectionsone of the important
strategies is not scribbling data all over memory via pointers because
following pointers increases cache misses whichreduces performance. And
there's nothing more iconic of pointers than the link list.Here are Aeter's
reasons to be anti-linked-list:They reduce the benefit of out-of-order
execution.They throw off hardware prefetching.They reduce DRAM and TLB
locality.They cannot leverage SIMD.They are harder to send to GPUs.He also
demolishes the pros of linked-lists, finding arrays a better option in almost
every case. Good discussion in the comment section as not everyone
agrees.Patrick Wyatt detailshow a linked-list threading bugrepeatedly crashed

<p>Introduction: I don't know about you, but when I first learned about Redis my initial
thought was wow, why hasn't anyone done this before? My next thought was why
put this functionality in a separate process? Why not just embed it in your
own server code and skip the network path completely? Especially in a Service
Oriented Architecture there's no need for an extra hop or extra software
installation and configuration.Now you can embed Redis-like code directly into
your server withVedis \- anembeddable datastoreC library built with over 70
commands similar in concept to Redis but without the networking layer since
Vedis run in the same process of the host application. It's transactional,
cross platform, thread safe, key-value, supports terabyte sized databases, has
a GPL-like license (which isn't great for commercial apps), and supports an
on-disk as well as in-memory datastore.More about Vedis:Unlike most other
datastores (i.e. memcache, Redis), Vedis does not have a separate server
process.

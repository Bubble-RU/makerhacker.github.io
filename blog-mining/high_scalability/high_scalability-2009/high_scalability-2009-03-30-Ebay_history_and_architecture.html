<p>Introduction: You don't even have to make a bid, Randy Shoup, an eBay Distinguished
Architect, gives thispresentationon how eBay scales, for free. Randy has done
a fabulous job in this presentation and in other talks listed at the end of
this post getting at the heart of the principles behind scalability. It's more
about ideas of how things work and fit together than a focusing on a
particular technology stack.Impressive StatsIn case you weren't sure, eBay is
big, with lots of: users, data, features, and change...Over 89 million active
users worldwide190 million items for sale in 50,000 categoriesOver 8 billion
URL requests per dayHundreds of new features per quarterRoughly 10% of items
are listed or ended every dayIn 39 countries and 10 languages24x7x36570
billion read / write operations / dayProcesses 50TB of new, incremental data
per dayAnalyzes 50PB of data per day10 LessonsThe presentation does a good job

<p>Introduction: PayPal gives yet another glowing reportof an app rewritten in node.js
experiencing substantial performance improvements. PayPal rewrote their
account overview page, one of the most trafficked apps on the website, which
was previously written in King Java.The benefits:Full-stack engineers. Using
JavaScript on both the front-end and the back-end removed an artificial
boundary between the browser and server, allowing engineers to code both.Built
almost twice as fast with fewer people Written in 33% fewer lines of code
Constructed with 40% fewer filesDouble the requests per second vs. the Java
application.35% decrease in the average response time for the same page.A
common pro Java response is an argument like clearly these people don't know
how to program Java. Or rewriting an application usually makes it faster. Or
the benchmark is faulty. And so on. Consider it noted. These are all potential
factors.Baron Schwartzfrom VividCortex has a different take. One based on
math.

<p>Introduction: Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail
system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded
architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each
with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies
(Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers . The benefit of this
approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA loadbalancing on the
perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move
accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users).
Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has
MySQL support. What we also liked about this approach was that it had no
dependency on a distributed or networked filesystem, so less chance of
corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches
capacity, we just off load users to a less used server. If any server goes
offline, it only affects the fraction of users</p><p>2 0.96559972 <a title="550-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling_IMAP_and_POP3.html">81 high scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling IMAP and POP3</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Terrastoreis a new-born document store which provides advanced scalability and
elasticity features without sacrificing consistency.Here are a few
highlights:Ubiquitous: based on the universally supported HTTP
protocol.Distributed: nodes can run and live everywhere on your
network.Elastic: you can add and remove nodes dynamically to/from your running
cluster with no downtime and no changes at all to your configuration.Scalable
at the data layer: documents are partitioned and distributed among your nodes,
with automatic and transparent re-balancing when nodes join and leave.Scalable
at the computational layer: query and update operations are distributed to the
nodes which actually holds the queried/updated data, minimizing network
traffic and spreading computational load.Consistent: providing per-document
consistency, you're guaranteed to always get the latest value of a single
document, with read committed isolation for concurrent
modifications.Schemaless: providing a collection-based i</p><p>4 0.94279289 <a title="550-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-21-n-phase_commit_for_FS_writes%2C_reads_stay_local.html">163 high scalability-2007-11-21-n-phase commit for FS writes, reads stay local</a></p>

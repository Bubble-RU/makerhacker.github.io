<p>Introduction: I first heard an enthusiastic endorsement ofSquarespacestreaming from the
ubiquitousLeo Laporteon one of his many Twit Live shows. Squarespace as afully
hosted, completely managed environment for creating and maintaining a website,
blog or portfoliowas of interest to me because they promise scalability and
this site doesn't have enough of that. But sadly, since they don't offer a
link preserving Drupal import our relationship was not meant to be.When a fine
reader of High Scalability, Brian Egge, (and all my readers are thrifty,
brave, and strong) asked me how Squarespace scaled I said I didn't know, but I
would try and find out. I emailed Squarespace a few questions and founder
Anthony Casalena and Director of Technical Operations Rolando Berrios were
kind enough to reply in some detail. The questions were both from Brian and
myself. Answers can be found below.Two things struck me most about
Squarespace's approach:They based their system on a memory grid, in this case

<p>Introduction: There was a bit of drama earlier when I posted a free job opening for Zynga.
It caused unfortunate and just plain wrong accusations. It also caused a
number of requests for more free job posts, which I should have anticipated,
but obviously I can't let this blog become cluttered with that kind of stuff.
Earlier I tried a job board type service, but that never really worked out. So
what to do? Someone suggested a sponsored post approach and I think that's a
good compromise. It minimizes the noise, let's people know about work, and
brings in a little revenue. It works like an advertisement. If you are
interested please let me know. When we have any job openings there will be a
sponsored post like this one, that you can easily ignore or pay attention to,
depending on your situation.Squarespace Looking for Full-time Scaling

<p>Introduction: Drupal 7 is having a scalability makeover. Karoly Negyesi, Drupal Core
Developer and Public Development Team Lead, explains the process in this
video:Drupal 7 APIs, scalability mindset. Karoly states the general theme of
the changes as:You give up some control and you get back scalability. An
interesting comment on the politics of scalability?Makeover may not be quite
the right word though. A makeover implies a cosmetic change, looking better by
changing the surface. Drupal's changes will go deeper than that, right to
Drupal's core. It's a genuine and authentic change that will hopefully allow
one of the Internet's most venerable Content Management Systems (CMSs) to
compete with a constant stream of younger and sexier models.Drupal is based on
an older LAMP stack approach where PHP modules are scooped up and merged
together each time a request is made to Drupal. Drupal's most intriguing idea
is how it is built, expands, and changes byweaving together a single systemout

really, but I'm trying to make a point here) inThe Art of Capacity
Planning:Using production traffic to define your resources ceilings in a
controlled setting allows you to see firsthand what would happen when you run
out of capacity in a particular resource. Of course I'm not suggesting that
you run your site into the ground, but better to know what your real (not
simulated) loads are while you're watching, than find out the hard way. In

<p>Introduction: A lot of sites hosted in San Francisco are down because of at least 6 back-to-
back power outages power outages. More details atlaughingsquid.breakSites like
SecondLife, Craigstlist, Technorati, Yelp and all Six Apart properties,
TypePad, LiveJournal and Vox are all down. The cause was an underground
explosion in a transformer vault under a manhole at 560 Mission Street. Flames
shot 6 feet out from the manhole cover. Over PG&E; 30,000 customers are without
power.What's perplexing is the UPS backup and diesel generators didn't kick in
to bring the datacenter back on line. I've never toured that datacenter, but
they usually have massive backup systems. It's probably one of those multiple
simultaneous failure situations that you hope never happen in real life, but
too often do. Or maybe the infrastructure wasn't rolled out completely.Update:
the cause was a cascade of failures in a tightly couples system that could
never happen :-) Details atFailure Happens: A summary of the power outage a</p><p>2 0.91213381 <a title="714-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-18-How_to_get_started_with_sizing_and_capacity_planning%2C_assuming_you_don%27t_know_the_software_behavior%3F.html">1566 high scalability-2013-12-18-How to get started with sizing and capacity planning, assuming you don't know the software behavior?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here's a common situation and question from themechanical-sympathyGoogle group
by Avinash Agrawal on the black art of capacity planning:How to get started
with sizing and capacity planning, assuming we don't know the software
behavior and its completely new product to deal with?Gil Tene, Vice President
of Technology and CTO & Co-Founder, wrote a very understandable and useful
answer that is worth highlighting:Start with requirements. I see way too many
"capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some
irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this
thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.There are two key
sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:In the
"How Much" part, you need to establish, based on expected business needs,

per second) that you expect to interact with at the peak time of normal
operations, and</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90092385 <a title="714-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability_has_Moved_to_Squarespace.com%21_.html">714 high scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability has Moved to Squarespace.com! </a></p>
<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting
HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting
services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary.
Thanks for the thought though.It's been a long long long process. Importing a
largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like
dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the
site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm
betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things.I'll
explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia
that needs to be handled to make the move complete:If you have a user account
and have posted on HighScalability before then you have a user account, but
since I don't know your passwords I had to make new passwords up for you. So

<p>Introduction: Matthew Might, as a first responder to a surprisetraffic surgeon his
inexpensive linode hosted blog, took emergency steps that you might find
useful in a similar situation:Find the bottleneck. Reloading the page in
firebug showed the first page took 24 seconds to load and after that
everything else loaded quickly. In retrospect this burst meant the site was
thread limited as the CPU was idle.Cut image sizes in halfwith a shell script
using ImageMagick's convert. Load time is now 12 seconds.Turn dynamic content
into static content using a static index.html file  copied using the browser's
"view source" feature. Load time is now 6 seconds.Added threadsto the Apache
configuration file. Load time is now 2 seconds. Crises averted.Because of this
quick thinking and quick action the patient survived to serve pages another
day.And in fine post-mortem tradition some of the future changes are: Run a
cron job to trigger an earlier alert. Email when requests exceed a per second

<p>Introduction: Sify.com is one of the leading portals in India. Samachar.com is owned by the
same company and is one of the top content aggregation sites in India,
primarily targeting Non-resident Indians from around the world. Ramki
Subramanian, an Architect at Sify, has been generous enough to describe the
common back-end for both these sites. One of the most notable aspects of their
architecture is that Sify does not use a traditional database. They query Solr
and then retrieve records from a distributed file system. Over the years many
people have argued for file systems over databases. Filesystems can work for
key-value lookups, but they don't work for queries, using Solr is a good way
around that problem. Another interesting aspect of their system is the use of
Drools for intelligent cache invalidation. As we have more and more data
duplicated in multiple specialized services, the problem of how to keep
themsynchronized is a difficult one. A rules engine is a clever
approach.Platform / ToolsLin</p><p>6 0.89191252 <a title="714-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-19-Heavy_upload_server_scalability.html">516 high scalability-2009-02-19-Heavy upload server scalability</a></p>

</p><p>6 That's OK, well maybe not for people who helped grow Amazon's ecosystem by offering a similar product, but so many projects use MySQL that this is a big win for a lot of people. [sent-9, score-0.087]
</p><p>7 It makes life easier even if the promise of infinite relational database storage has yet to be realized. [sent-10, score-0.208]
</p><p>8 If one of the reasons you were considering using a Platform as a Service is to knock the database item off your worry list, RDS is one more reason to consider playing your own general contractor and orchestrating all the elements together yourself. [sent-11, score-0.322]
</p><p>9 As more services become packaged into cloud capable components this is likely how many systems will be bolted together in the future. [sent-12, score-0.2]
</p><p>10 But we are left wondering, how RDS fits together with SimpleDB and all the other database options? [sent-13, score-0.219]
</p><p>11 As an organizing principle James came up with this taxonomy for databases based on what the customer wants to do, their intent:       features-first  - This is the relation database bucket where the database provides a lot of high level features that make the programmer's job a lot easier. [sent-15, score-0.874]
</p><p>12 They generally lack features and put a lot more responsibility back on the programmer. [sent-19, score-0.181]
</p><p>13 They generally don't have the features or scalability of other systems. [sent-22, score-0.094]

</p><p>15 So all you have to do is figure out your intention, find out where you are belong in the list, and make a choice :-) I know, you want it all, you deserve it all, but that doesn't seem to be happening. [sent-27, score-0.193]
</p><p>16 Sites for a very long time will be forged from a mix of technologies and we are the master mixoligists. [sent-28, score-0.115]

<p>Introduction: In an audacious move for such an established property, Netflix is moving their website out of the comfort of their own datacenter and into the wilds of the Amazon cloud. This paper by Netflix's Siddharth “Sid” Anand,  Netflix’s Transition to High-Availability Storage Systems , gives a detailed look at this transition and does a deep dive on SimpleDB best practices, focussing especially on techniques useful to those who are making the move from a RDBMS.
 
Sid is going to give a talk at QCon based on this paper and he would appreciate your feedback. So if you have any comments or thoughts please comment here or email Sid at  r39132@hotmail.com  or Twitter at @r39132 Here's the introduction from the paper:
  Circa late 2008, Netflix had a single data center. This single data center raised a few concerns. As a single-point-of-failure (a.k.a. SPOF), it represented a liability – data center outages meant interruptions to service and negative customer impact. Additionally, with growth in both</p><p>4 0.17685869 <a title="736-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-05-Anti-RDBMS%3A_A_list_of_distributed_key-value_stores.html">670 high scalability-2009-08-05-Anti-RDBMS: A list of distributed key-value stores</a></p>

 Update 7:   The Future of Scalable Databases  by Robin Mathew.
 
 Update 6:   NoSQL : If Only it Was that Easy . BJ Clark lays down the law on which databases are scalable: Tokyo - NO, Redis - NO, Voldemort - YES, MongoDB - Not Yet, Cassandra - Probably, Amazon S3 - YES * 2, MySQL - NO.  The real thing to point out is that if you are being held back from making something super awesome because you can’t choose a database, you are doing it wrong.   Update 5:   Exciting stuff happening in Japan at this Key-Value Storage meeting in Tokyo . Presentations on Groonga, Senna, Lux IO, Tokyo-Cabinet, Tx, repcached, Kai, Cagra, kumofs, ROMA, and Flare.

So my key point is, this kind of modelling is WORTH DOING, regardless of which database tool you end up using for physical storage.

<p>Introduction: The Key/Value Store becames more and more popular. When we use the Key/Value Store to store objects, we need to serialize/deserialize the objects as binary buffer. We have many ways to serialize/deserialize objects. A possible way is to use the Relational Database. Every value we store in the Key/Value Store is a SQLite instance. We can use the power of the Relational Database to manipulate the value. The SQL is very powerful for processing query request.   SPHiveDB = TokyoCabinet + SQLite http://code.google.com/p/sphivedb/  SPHiveDB is a server for sqlite database. It use JSON-RPC over HTTP to expose a network interface to use SQLite database.

<p>Introduction: Not surprisingly opinions on   SimpleDB   vary from it sucks, don't take my database, to it will change the world, who needs a database anyway? From a   quick survey of the blogosphere  , here's where SimpleDB stands at the moment:       SimpleDB Cons        No SLA. We don't know how reliable it will be, how fast it will be, or how consistent the performance will be.   Consistency constraints are relaxed. Reading data immediately after a write may not reflect the latest updates. To programmers used to transactions, this may be surprising, but many people think this is one of the tradeoffs that needs to be made to scale.   Database is a core competency. If you don't control your database you can't out compete your competition.     When your database is out of your control you can't guarantee it will work properly. You can't create the proper indexes and other optimizations.   No join or IN operator. You'll need to do multiple client side calls to simulate joins, which will be slow.

<p>Introduction: With so many database options available these days, like for the rest of life, it's natural to wonder how it all  fits together . Amazon complicated, or rather expanded the available options by introducing RDS, their  relational database service . RDS is MySQL safely cocooned as a manageable cloud element, resting boldly within an energy providing elastic  CPU pool , supported by a virtually  infinite supply  of very  capable virtualized storage  .
 
MySQL in AWS is  now easy  to start, stop, monitor, backup, snapshot, expand, and effortlessly move up and down the instance hierarchy. What it's not, contrary to what you might expect, is a scale-out solution, it's a scale-up solution. You get more by buying a bigger instance, not by horizontally adding more instances. There's a  limit . Admittedly a larger limit now with Amazon's new  high memory instances .
 
That's OK, well maybe not for people who helped grow Amazon's ecosystem by offering a similar product, but so many projects use M</p><p>2 0.90395033 <a title="736-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_4th%2C_2014.html">1626 high scalability-2014-04-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 4th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Looks interesting...  Abstract: Todayâ&euro;&trade;s data centers may contain tens of thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring tremendous cost. Nonuniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates application design and limits overall system performance. In this paper, we show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements. Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and interconnected commodi</p><p>4 0.88774395 <a title="736-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Deploying_MySQL_Database_in_Solaris_Cluster_Environments.html">454 high scalability-2008-12-01-Deploying MySQL Database in Solaris Cluster Environments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: MySQL™ database, an open source database, delivers high performance and reliability while keeping costs low by eliminating licensing fees. The Solaris™ Cluster product is an integrated hardware and software environment that can be used to create highly-available data services. This article explains how to deploy the MySQL database in a Solaris Cluster environment. The article addresses the following topics:         * "Advantages of Deploying MySQL Database with Solaris Cluster" on page 1 discusses the benefits provided by a Solaris Cluster deployment of the MySQL database.       * "Overview of Solaris Cluster" on page 2 provides a high-level description of the hardware and software components of the Solaris Cluster.       * "Installation and Configuration" on page 8 explains the procedure for deploying the MySQL database on a Solaris Cluster.

<p>Introduction: We've long known one of the virtues of the cloud is, through the magic of services and automation, that systems can be shut or tuned down when not in use. What may be surprising is how much money can be saved. 
 
This aspect of cloudiness got a lot of pub at  AWS re:Invent  and is being rebranded under the term  Cost-Aware Architecture . An  interesting example  was given by Ryan Park, Pinterest’s technical operations lead:
  
 20% of their systems are shutdown after hours in response to traffic loads 
 Reserved instances are used for standard traffic  
 On-demand and spot instances are used to handle the elastic load throughout the day. When more servers are needed for an auto-scaled service,  spot requests are opened and on-demand instances are started at the same time. Most services are targeted to run at about 50% on-demand and 50% spot. 
 Watchdog processes continually check what's running. More instances are launched when needed and terminated when not needed. If spot prices spik</p><p>6 0.88278711 <a title="736-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-26-Google_Pro_Tip%3A_Use_Back-of-the-envelope-calculations_to_Choose_the_Best_Design.html">978 high scalability-2011-01-26-Google Pro Tip: Use Back-of-the-envelope-calculations to Choose the Best Design</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ezra Zygmuntowicz in a heart warming account of his4 Years at Engine Yard, has
concluded in his experience that:the true future of cloud computing for
developers is to not think about servers at all. It is now time to focus on
the Application and new levels of abstraction that allow folks to use the
computing resources in easier and easier ways. Tweets of
Gold:bryanlatten:Nothing like a million caching layers to screw up an already
complicated deployment. Thankfully, there is beer.jkalucki: Twitter isn't
down, you are just using the wrong access methods...andyedinborough: I don't
mean to hate, but why would I give up performance and scalability for a
dynamic language? Honestly, I don't get it.AsitSinha: It's amazing.... to see
the absence of an understanding of how capability plays a role in
scalability.scottgal: Devs are HORRIBLE DBAs. Used to do Scalability labs for

<p>Introduction: Does anyone know of any articles or papers that discuss the nuts and bolts of
how web analytics is implemented at organizations with large volumes of web
traffic and a critcal business need to analyze that data - e.g. places like
Amazon.com, eBay, and Google?Just as a fun project I'm planning to build my
own web log analysis app that can effectively index and query large volumes of
web log data (i.e. TB range). But first I'd like to learn more about how it's
done in the organizations whose lifeblood depends on this stuff. Even just a
high level architectural overview of their approaches would be nice to have.</p><p>5 0.065785989 <a title="497-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-18-Code_deployment_tools.html">369 high scalability-2008-08-18-Code deployment tools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: G'day,I'm building an application to manage WordPress PHP code on many
servers. Our application will push down code updates to each server, as well
as performing backups and testing.I'm considering different methods of pushing
updated code onto the individual servers. I'm considering something like
Capistrano (I've no experience in Ruby though). I've also considered using
subversion and then remotely calling svn commands via SSH.Are there any other
tools specifically for this purpose? The servers will have persistent data
(the WordPress databases) so I don't want to re-image them every update. Plus,
they will each have a different set of plugins / themes, so building many
images would be too complex.If there are any papers on code deployment, or
other recommended reading, please point the links my way.Likewise, if anyone
has any suggestions, or would like more details, just let me know.Cheers

<p>Introduction: Counting at scale in a distributed environment issurprisingly hard. And it's a
subject we've covered before in various ways:Big Data Counting: How to count a
billion distinct objects using only 1.5KB of Memory,How to update video views
count effectively?,Numbers Everyone Should Know (sharded
counters).Kellabyte(which is an excellent blog) inScalable Eventually
Consistent Counterstalks about how the Cassandra counter implementation scores
well on the scalability and high availability front, but in so doing has "over
and under counting problem in partitioned environments."Which is often fine.
But if you want more accuracy there's a PN-counter, which is aCRDT (convergent
replicated data type)where "all the changes made to a counter on each node
rather than storing and modifying a single value so that you can merge all the
values into the proper final value. Of course the trade-off here is additional
storage and processing but there are ways to optimize this."And there's a

<p>Introduction: We've seen a lot ofNoSQLaction lately built around distributed hash tables.
Btrees are getting jealous. Btrees, once the king of the database world, want
their throne back.Paul Buchheitsurfaced a paper:A practical scalable
distributed B-treeby Marcos K. Aguilera and Wojciech Golab, that might help
spark a revolution.From the Abstract:We propose a new algorithm for a
practical, fault tolerant, and scalable B-tree distributed over a set of
servers. Our algorithm supports practical features not present in prior work:
transactions that allow atomic execution of multiple operations over multiple
B-trees, online migration of B-tree nodes between servers, and dynamic
addition and removal of servers. Moreover, our algorithm is conceptually
simple: we use transactions to manipulate B-tree nodes so that clients need
not use complicated concurrency and locking protocols used in prior work. To
execute these transactions quickly, we rely on three techniques: (1) We use
optimistic concurrency contro</p><p>6 0.62200344 <a title="497-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-22-Improving_performance_and_scalability_with_DDD.html">635 high scalability-2009-06-22-Improving performance and scalability with DDD</a></p>

The Lamport Papers, and Implementation Issues. Many old favorites on the list
and some that are likely new to you. My new favorite is "Frangipani: A
Scalable Distributed File System." How can you not love "Frangipani" as a
word?</p><p>2 0.49762169 <a title="497-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:My
recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget
with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid
expiration headers) is employ areverse proxyas mentioned in this article.In
the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a
single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a
single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max
server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.It's trivial to implement for
anyone interested...</p><p>3 0.47777027 <a title="497-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-19-High_Definition_Video_Delivery_on_the_Web%3F.html">447 high scalability-2008-11-19-High Definition Video Delivery on the Web?</a></p>

system such as the BBC iPlayer orRecast Digital's RDV1. What do you need to
consider on top of the Lessons Learned section in theYouTube

Google? Can you just use a CDN and scale efficiently? Would Amazon's cloud
services be a viable platform for high-definition video streaming?</p><p>4 0.47699559 <a title="497-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part ofDr. Indranil Gupta's CS 525 Spring 2011 Advanced Distributed Systems
class, he has collected an incredible list of resources on distributed
systems. Hisresearch groupis also doing some interesting work.Thevarious
topicsinclude: Before there Were Clouds, Cloud Computing, P2P Systems, Basic
Distributed Computing Concepts, Sensor Networks, Overlays and DHTs, Cloud
Programming, Cloud Scheduling, Key-Value Stores, Storage, Sensor Net Routing,
Geo-Distribution, P2P Apps, In-network processing, Epidemics, Probabilistic
Membership Protocols, Distributed Monitoring and  Management, Publish-
Subscribe/CDNs, Measurement Studies, Old Wine: Stale or Vintage?, In
Byzantium, Cloud Pricing, Other Industrial Systems, Structure of Networks,
Completing the Circle, Green Clouds, Distributed Debugging, Flash!, The Middle
or the End?, Availability-Aware Systems, Design Methodologies, Handling
Stress, Sources of unreliability in networks, Handling Stress, Selfish

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across
data centers, then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so
there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What
isChironFSand how does it work?Adapted from the ChironFS website:The Chiron
Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of
failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using
replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not
FILESYSTEMS.Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it
is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other
server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many
servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become
a real nightmare!</p><p>6 0.44406998 <a title="497-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">191 high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>

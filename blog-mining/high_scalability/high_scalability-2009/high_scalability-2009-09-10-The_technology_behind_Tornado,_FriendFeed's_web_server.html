<p>Introduction: This is an interview with Wade Simmons, an Infrastructure Engineer at
SimpleGeo, a service making iteasy for developers to create location-aware
applications, on their increasing use ofNode.js as a backend service
component, replacing code that would have at one time been written in Java,
Python or Ruby. Node.js is finding it's way into many stacks these days and I
was curious why that might be. My experience writing several messaging systems
is that programmers don't like the async model and it's a big surprise that a
pure async programming model like Node.js, especially one that uses server-
side Javascript, would be taking off. Wade was generous enough to help explain
their reasoning behind using Node.js at SimpleGeo. I'd really like to thank
Wade for taking the time for this interview. He did a really great job and
provided a lot of insight on how the modern web stack is evolving in the
crucible of real-life experience.  And here begins the interview with Wade

Here's Robert's plight:I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest
interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.It’s on
Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.Look at
who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind
WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of
FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the
“don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million

figure out the best architecture for the product.It's a server application,
what is supposed to serve A LOT of users at a time.Think of an IM application,
but not web style, more like ICQ\MSN applications... With web orientation.I've
read all about Meebo, Facebook Chat & etc architectures.But I'm still not sure
where to start on ICQ style (this is the first phase before I go totally
web).Can you direct me to some information on load balancing 10 million users?

<p>Introduction: I am excited about the upcoming release of two books on Web 2.0 and Cloud
Application Architectures by O'Reilly.Web 2.0 Architectures(estimated release
in May 2009)What entrepreneurs and information architects need to knowUsing
several high-profile Web 2.0 companies as examples, authors Duane Nickull,
Dion Hinchcliffe, and James Governor have distilled the core patterns of Web
2.0 coupled with an abstract model and reference architecture. The result is a
base of knowledge that developers, business people, futurists, and
entrepreneurs can understand and use as a source of ideas and inspiration.
Featured architectures include Google, Flickr, BitTorrent, MySpace, Facebook,
and Wikipedia.Cloud Application Architectures(estimated release in April
2009)Building Applications and Infrastructure in the CloudThis book by George

  Van Jacobson  : IP started as an overlay on the phone system; today the phone system is an overlay on IP. 
  @MarkDurbin104  : Unit of Logic: a Fathom? 
  @somic  : virtual infra with API is a cloud as much as a bunch of shell scripts are infra as code 
  @xaprb  : I'm going to settle the argument about linear scalability once and for all. Pianos are linearly scalable. Fish are not. End of story.

<p>Introduction: This question was sent in by Val, who asking for a little help in creating the next big thing. Any ideas? 
 
I'm  planning to run my own, first startup website and have been surfing the  webs for relevant info to plan the technology I will use for it (the  frontend and the backend, including the software and the hardware). The  website will be something like a combination of:
  
  MegaUpload (users will upload their files) 
  iTunes (users will be paid for their uploads) 
  and YouTube (in the future I'm planning to let users watch/listen to the content online, without downloading). 
  
I don't have any investors yet, nor the budget - I'm still preparing the  idea and I'm going to create first implementation (an "alpha version")  before I show it to potential investors. Hence the initial technologies  have to be extremely cheap *but* also highly scalable in the future so  that I don't have to redo anything when the website grows.    Unfortunately I don't have much experience in running</p><p>4 0.081355467 <a title="600-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_29%2C_2013.html">1431 high scalability-2013-03-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 29, 2013</a></p>

  @jstogdill  : Corporations over protect low value info assets (which screws up collaboration) and under protects high value assets. #strataconf 
  @sbtourist  : I think BigMemory-like approaches based on large put-and-forget memory cans, are rarely a solution to performance/scalability problems.

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up to  How will memristors change everything?  for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from  The SyNAPSE Project , was kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the  12th IEEE CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their Applications  - Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple more accessible presentations:

     The Telephone Wires of Manhattan in 1887  ( full )   
 $19 billion: you know what it is;  $46 billion : cost of Sochi Olympics;   400 gigabytes : data transmitted during the Sochi opening ceremony;  26.9 million : Stack Overflow community monthly visitors;  93 million : Candy Crush  daily active users;  200-400 Gbps : The New Normal in DDoS Attacks 
 Quotable Quotes:                                                
 
  @brianacton : Facebook turned me down. It was a great opportunity to connect with some fantastic people. Looking forward to life's next adventure. 
  @BenedictEvans : Flickr: $35m. Youtube: $1.65bn Whatsapp: $19bn. Mobile is big. And global. And the next computing platform. Paying attention? 
  @taziden : On the Internet, worst cases will become common cases #fosdem #postfix 
  Brian Hayes : Any quantum program must have a stovepipe architecture: Information flows straight through.

<p>Introduction: Making the world's knowledge computable  
  Today's Wolfram|Alpha is the first step in an ambitious, long-term project to make all systematic knowledge immediately computable by anyone.  You enter your question or calculation, and Wolfram|Alpha uses its built-in algorithms and growing collection of data to compute the answer. 
  Answer Engine vs Search Engine  
 When  Wolfram|Alpha  launches later today, it will be  one of the most computationally intensive websites on the internet . The  Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine  is an "answer engine" that is able to produce answers to various questions such as
  
 What is the GDP of France? 
 
 Weather is Springfield when David Ortiz was born 
 
 33 g of gold 
 
 LDL vs. serum potassium 150 smoker male age 40

<p>Introduction: Find out with Builtwith.com. It scans a site and guesses how the site is built. I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows,  PHP, Adsense, RSS, CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which AJAX library is used.

<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are Oprah...     Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast" where traffic peaked at 242Gbps.  A variable bitrate scheme was used so depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as 750Kbps.     Dan Rayburn thinks   The big take away from this webcast is that it shows proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.        To handle more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P</p><p>4 0.65311015 <a title="600-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Product%3A__Hibernate_Shards.html">24 high scalability-2007-07-24-Product:  Hibernate Shards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.
 
Hibernate Shards is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.   Hibernate Shards  key features:
  
  Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love: SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards. 
  Flexible sharding strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific logic. 
  Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your</p><p>5 0.62580478 <a title="600-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-16-The_5_Biggest_Ways_to_Boost_MySQL_Scalability.html">1099 high scalability-2011-08-16-The 5 Biggest Ways to Boost MySQL Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sean Hall  with some really good  MySQL advice : 
  
  Tune those queries . Biggest bang for your buck. Enable the slow query log and watch it. Once you've found a heavy resource intensive query, optimize it! Tune what receives real-world traffic.  
  Employ Master-Master Replication . Immediately have a read-only slave for your application to hit as well. 
  Use Your Memory . Set innodb_buffer_pool_size, key_buffer_size and other key options. 
  RAID Your Disk I/O . Use RAID 10 mirroring and striping. On EC2 striping across a number of EBS volumes using the Linux md software raid. 
  Tune Key Parameters . speeds up inserts & updates with innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2; create a tablespace and underlying datafile for each table with innodb_file_per_table.

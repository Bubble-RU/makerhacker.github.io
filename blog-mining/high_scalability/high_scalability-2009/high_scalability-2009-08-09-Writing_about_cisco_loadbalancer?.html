<p>Introduction: A recentInfoWorld articleclaims that "With Cisco expected to enter the blade
market and Sun expected to offer networking equipment, things could get
interesting awfully fast." How does this effect your infrastructure strategy
and decisions?Would you consider to build scalable web applications on the
Cisco Unified Computing System? Or would you consider to build a router out of
a server with the use of OpenSolaris and Project Crossbow as the article
suggests? Will any of these initiatives change the way we build scalable web
infrastructure or are these just attempts to sale these systems?What do you
think?</p><p>4 0.094709612 <a title="678-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-18-Forum_sort_order.html">370 high scalability-2008-08-18-Forum sort order</a></p>
<p>Introduction: G'day,I noticed the default sort order for the forum is to show the posts with
the most replies first. That seems a bit odd for a forum. Would it not make
sense to show the posts with the most recently replies first?It is possible to
re-sort the forum threads that way by clicking on the "Last post" header
(twice). It would seem like a more sensible default.I've checked and I see the
same behaviour as both a registered (logged in) and anonymous user.Cheers

<p>Introduction: The introduction of cloud technologies is not a simple evolution of existing
ones, but a real revolution.  Like all revolutions, it changes the points of
views and redefines all the meanings. Nothing is as before.  This post wants
to analyze some key words and concepts, usually used in traditional
architectures, redefining them according the standpoint of the cloud.
Understanding the meaning of new words is crucial to grasp the essence of a
pure cloud architecture.<>THOMAS REID, Essays on the
Intellectual Powers of ManNowadays, it is required to challenge the limits of
traditional architectures that go beyond the normal concepts of scalability
and support millions of users (What's Up 500 Million) billions of transactions
per day (Salesforce 1.3 billion), five 9s of availability (99.999 AOL).  I
wish all of you the success of the examples cited above, but do not think that

<p>Introduction: WebLog Expertis a fast and powerful access log analyzer. It will give you
information about your site's visitors: activity statistics, accessed files,
paths through the site, information about referring pages, search engines,
browsers, operating systems, and more. The program produces easy-to-read HTML
reports that include both text information (tables) and charts. View the
WebLog Expert sample report to get the general idea of the variety of
information about your site's usage it can provide.WebLog Expert can analyze
logs of Apache and IIS web servers. It can even read GZ and ZIP compressed
logs so you won't need to unpack them manually.The log analyzer features
intuitive interface. Built-in wizards will help you quickly and easily create

<p>Introduction: FromFRESH Portsand their website:ISPmanis an ISP management software written
in perl, using an LDAPbackend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP. It can be
used to manage,DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration,
cyrusmail boxes, proftpd etc.ISPMan was written as a management tool for the
network at 4unet wherebetween 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is
crazily growing.Managing these domains and their users was a little time
consuming,and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these
daemonsfluently. Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and
users.LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server canbe
scaled from 1 to n as required. An LDAP entry called maildroptells the SMTP
server (postfix) where to deliver the mail. The SMTPservers can be
loadbalanced with one of many load balancingtechniques. The program is written
with scalability and Highavailability in mind.This may not be the right
software for you if you want to run a sm</p><p>5 0.4570047 <a title="678-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring_the_software_behind_Facebook%2C_the_world%E2%80%99s_largest_site.html">845 high scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring the software behind Facebook, the world’s largest site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Peter Alguacil at Pingdom wrote a HighScalability worthy article on Facebook's
architecture: Exploring the software behind Facebook, the world's largest
site. It covers the challenges Facebook faces, the software Facebook uses, and
the techniques Facebook uses to keep on scaling.

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes

Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are

<p>Introduction: Michael Stonebraker sure knows how to stir up a storm. Unlike for others, that
doesn't make him a troll in my mind, he'sway too accomplishedin the field to
be that, but he does have a bit of Barnum & Bailey in him, which serves to get
the discussion flowing, and that's a good thing. A lot of previously hidden
wisdom and passion unlocks, which we'll try to capture here.This disturbance
in the force is over OldSQL vs NoSQL vsNewSQL. Warning, these are not crisp
categories, there's leakage all over the place, watch your step:OldSQL
(Oracle, MySQL, etc) refers to what some want to term as legacy relational
database like MySQL, that don't scale out horizontally with aplomb.NoSQL
(CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, Riak, Neo4j, etc) refers to, well,
a collection of technologies that aren't OldSQL, these often are designed to
scale out horizontally, aren't on ACID, and use schemaless non-relational
datamodels.NewSQL  (Xeround, Clustrix, NimbusDB, GenieDB, ScaleBase, VoltDB)
are databa</p><p>5 0.086112216 <a title="555-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Sun%27s_High-Performance_and_Reliable_Web_Proxy_Solution.html">456 high scalability-2008-12-01-Sun's High-Performance and Reliable Web Proxy Solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage
of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with
CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable
solution that</p><p>6 0.083849102 <a title="555-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-24-Scalability_Perspectives_%236%3A_Lew_Tucker_%E2%80%93_Virtual_Data_Centers_in_the_Open_Cloud.html">547 high scalability-2009-03-24-Scalability Perspectives #6: Lew Tucker – Virtual Data Centers in the Open Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jumping around the social mediasphere, it's not uncommon to feel the heat
generated in praise of a favorite this or that over all the clearly inferior
alternatives. Whilst human nature may never cool, I think Old Will had some
insight worth considering the next time a flame threatens to flicker forth:My
mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130)My mistress' eyes are
nothing like the sun;Coral is far more red than her lips' red ;If snow be
white, why then her breasts are dun;If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her
head.I have seen roses damask, red and white,But no such roses see I in her
cheeks;And in some perfumes is there more delightThan in the breath that from
my mistress reeks.I love to hear her speak, yet well I knowThat music hath a
far more pleasing sound;I grant I never saw a goddess go;My mistress, when she
walks, treads on the ground:And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rareAs any
she belied with false compare.-William Shakespeare</p><p>6 0.64963341 <a title="555-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-07-Sun_Acquires_Q-layer_in_Cloud_Computing_Play.html">486 high scalability-2009-01-07-Sun Acquires Q-layer in Cloud Computing Play</a></p>

Microsystems.Performance Anti-Patterns:- Fixing Performance at the End of the
Project- Measuring and Comparing the Wrong Things- Algorithmic Antipathy-
Reusing Software- Iterating Because That’s What Computers Do Well- Premature
Optimization- Focusing on What You Can See Rather Than on the Problem-
Software Layering- Excessive Numbers of Threads- Asymmetric Hardware

<p>Introduction: Abstract: When designing distributed web services, there are three properties
that are commonly desired: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
It is impossible to achieve all three. In this note, we prove this conjecture
in the asynchronous network model, and then discuss solutions to this dilemma
in the partially synchronous model.</p><p>3 0.55884087 <a title="555-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Product%3A_NetApp_MetroCluster_Software.html">28 high scalability-2007-07-25-Product: NetApp MetroCluster Software</a></p>
<p>Introduction: NetApp MetroCluster SoftwareCost-effective is an integrated high-availability
storage cluster and site failover capability.NetApp MetroCluster is an
integrated high-availability and disaster recovery solution that can reduce
system complexity and simplify management while ensuring greater return on
investment. MetroCluster uses clustered server technology to replicate data
synchronously between sites located miles apart, eliminating data loss in case
of a disruption. Simple and powerful recovery process minimizes downtime, with
little or no user action required.At one company I worked at they used the
NetApp snap mirror feature to replicate data across long distances to multiple
datacenters. They had a very fast backbone and it worked well. The issue with
NetApp is always one of cost, but if you can afford it, it's a good option.</p><p>4 0.49892575 <a title="555-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-27-Paper%3A_XORing_Elephants%3A_Novel_Erasure_Codes_for_Big_Data.html">1483 high scalability-2013-06-27-Paper: XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure Codes for Big Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Erasure codesare one of those seemingly magical mathematical creations that
with the developments described in the paper XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure
Codes for Big Data, are set to replace triple replication as the data storage
protection mechanism of choice.The result says Robin Harris (StorageMojo) in
an excellent article, Facebook's advanced erasure codes: "WebCos will be able
to store massive amounts of data more efficiently than ever before. Bad news:
so will anyone else."Robin says with cheap disks triple replication made sense
and was economical. With ever bigger BigData the overhead has become costly.
But erasure codes have always suffered from unacceptably long time to repair
times. This paper describes new Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) that are
efficiently repairable in disk I/O and bandwidth requirements:These systems
are now designed to survive the loss of up to four storage elements - disks,
servers, nodes or even entire data centers - without losing any data.

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your scaling pleasure, you may not  scale often, but when you
scale, please drink us:Quotably quotable quotes:@mardix: There is no single
point of truth in #NoSQL . #Consistency is no longer global, it's relative to
the one accessing it. #Scalability@kekline: RT @CurtMonash: "...from industry
figures, Basho/Riak is our third-biggest competitor." How often do you
encounter them? "Never have" #nosql@dave_jacobs: Love being in a city where I
can overhear a convo about Heroku scalability while doing deadlifts.

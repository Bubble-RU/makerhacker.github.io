<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: We've asked  What The Heck Are You Actually Using NoSQL For? . We've asked  101 Questions To Ask When Considering A NoSQL Database . We've even had a  webinar   What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for Scalable Web Applications .
 
Now we get to the point of considering use cases and which systems might be appropriate for those use cases.

First, let's cover what are the various data models. These have been adapted from  Emil Eifrem  and  NoSQL databases .

<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide web of data.     
   Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10 billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, with the Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge structure. This talk will discuss graph databases, their underlying data model, their querying mechanisms, and the benefits of the graph data structure for modeling and analysis.</p><p>5 0.12976474 <a title="733-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors, attended the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto  NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid, InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came from the audience, which was refreshing. 
 
Overall a genial evening with some good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at giving a wide ra</p><p>6 0.1288871 <a title="733-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-04-Jim_Starkey_is_Creating_a_Brave_New_World_by_Rethinking_Databases_for_the_Cloud.html">1092 high scalability-2011-08-04-Jim Starkey is Creating a Brave New World by Rethinking Databases for the Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey , founder of  NuoDB , in this  thread  on the Cloud Computing group, delivers a  masterful post  on why he thinks the relational model is the best overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave new lock free world.... 
 
I'll  [Jim Starkey]  go into more detail later in the post for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the s</p><p>3 0.78765917 <a title="733-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-07-Paper%3A_A_Co-Relational_Model_of_Data_for_Large_Shared_Data_Banks.html">1018 high scalability-2011-04-07-Paper: A Co-Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let's play a quick game of truth or sacrilage: are SQL and NoSQL are really just two sides of the same coin? That's what  Erik Meijer  and Gavin Bierman would have us believe in their "we can all get along and make a lot of money" article in the Communications of the ACM,  A Co-Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks . You don't believe it? It's math, so it must be true :-) Some key points:
  

In this article we present a mathematical data model for the most common noSQL databases—namely, key/value relationships—and demonstrate that this data model is the mathematical dual of SQL's relational data model of foreign-/primary-key relationships


...we believe that our categorical data-model formalization and monadic query language will allow the same economic growth to occur for coSQL key-value stores.

 ...In contrast to common belief, the question of big versus small data is orthogonal to the question of SQL versus coSQL. While the coSQL model naturally supports extreme sh</p><p>4 0.7764734 <a title="733-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-20-35%2B_Use_Cases_for_Choosing_Your_Next_NoSQL_Database.html">1064 high scalability-2011-06-20-35+ Use Cases for Choosing Your Next NoSQL Database</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For a great Christmas read forget  The Night Before Christmas , a heart warming poem written by Clement Moore for his children, that created the modern idea of Santa Clause we all know and anticipate each Christmas eve. Instead, curl up with a some potentÂ  eggnog , nog being any drink made with rum, and readÂ  CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control Â by Mihai Letia, Nuno PreguiĂ§a, and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),  a data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent .
 
From the introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed consistency issues:
  

Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach [</p><p>6 0.75358194 <a title="733-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-15-101_Questions_to_Ask_When_Considering_a_NoSQL_Database.html">1062 high scalability-2011-06-15-101 Questions to Ask When Considering a NoSQL Database</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Algorithms are moving out of the Platonic realm and are becoming dynamic first class players in real life. We've seen corporations become people. Algorithms will likely also follow that path to agency.
 
 Kevin Slavin  in his intriguing TED talk:  How Algorithms Shape Our World , gives many and varied examples of how algorithms have penetrated RL. 
 
One of his most interesting examples is from a highly technical paper on  Relativistic statistical arbitrage , which says to make money on markets you have to be where the people are, the red dots (on the diagram below), which means you have to put servers where the blue dots are, many of which are in the ocean. Here's the diagram from the paper:
 
 
 
Mr. Slavin neatly sums this up by saying:
  

And it's not the money that's so interesting actually. It's what the money motivates, that  we're actually terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency . And in that light, you go back and you look at Michael Najjar's ph</p><p>same-blog 2 0.94243121 <a title="733-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-29-Paper%3A_No_Relation%3A_The_Mixed_Blessings_of_Non-Relational_Databases.html">733 high scalability-2009-10-29-Paper: No Relation: The Mixed Blessings of Non-Relational Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This excellent survey of the field was  written by Ian Thomas Varley  as part of his Master of Science in Engineering program.
  
 The aim of this paper is to explore the conceptual design space of non-relational databases as compared to traditional relational databases. It is clear that the design needs of the two paradigms are different, but how fundamental are the differences, and what strategies can we use to transition our conceptual designs from one to the other? 
   There are a few things to like about this paper. A running a example is used to show the different ways to model data depending on which type of solution you are targeting, especially covering how many-to-many relationships are modeled, data integrity, and how to support optional attributes. There's also a brief survey of some of the major systems.            The most interesting section of the report is where it tackles the problem of design for non-relational systems. The approach has two different phases: design q</p><p>3 0.89882761 <a title="733-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Product%3A_lighttpd.html">29 high scalability-2007-07-25-Product: lighttpd</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lighttpd  (pronounced "lighty") is a web server which is designed to be secure, fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-critical environments. Its low memory footprint (compared to other web servers), light CPU load and its speed goals make lighttpd suitable for servers that are suffering load problems, or for serving static media separately from dynamic content. lighttpd is free software / open source, and is distributed under the BSD license. lighttpd runs on GNU/Linux and other Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows.

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 2 ( part 1 ) of  an interview  I did for the  Boundary blog . 
 
 Boundary:  There’s another battle coming down the pike between Amazon (AWS) and Google (GCE). How should the CTO decide which one’s best? 
 
 Hoff:  Given that GCE is still closed to public access we have very little common experience on which to judge. The best way to decide is as always, by running a few experiments. Pick a few representative projects, a representative team, implement the projects on both infrastructures, crunch some numbers, figure out the bigger picture and then select the one you wanted in the first place   .
 
Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, recently  wrote about his experiences  on both platforms and found some interesting differences: AWS has a much richer set of services; GCE is on-demand only, so AWS can be cheaper; GCE has faster disk and faster network IO, especially between datacenters; GCE has faster boot times and can mount read-only partitions across multiple</p><p>6 0.89015603 <a title="733-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud_AWS_Infrastructure_vs._Physical_Infrastructure.html">853 high scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud AWS Infrastructure vs. Physical Infrastructure</a></p>

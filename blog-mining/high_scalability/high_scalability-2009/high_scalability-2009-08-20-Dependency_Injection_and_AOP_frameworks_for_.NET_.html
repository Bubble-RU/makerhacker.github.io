<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip
than a</p><p>3 0.10642935 <a title="685-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-02-The_case_against_ORM_Frameworks_in_High_Scalability_Architectures.html">235 high scalability-2008-02-02-The case against ORM Frameworks in High Scalability Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let me begin by saying that I have used and continue to use various ORM
frameworks such as hibernate, ibatis, propel and activerecord in applications
and websites that have a user base ranging from a couple hundred to 500k
users. Especially for projects that have to be up and running in a short
duration of time, ORM frameworks significantly reduce the effort required to
manipulate and persist OOP objects by providing time saving facilities such as
automatically generated model objects, integrated unit testing, secure
variable substitution, etc. Hibernate even supports horizontal data
partitioning via Hibernate Shards.However, the lay of the land is
significantly different in the rarefied space occupied by applications needing
to support millions of users. Profiling an application at this level and
paying particular attention to the operations needed to move data to and from
the database, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the operations
are API related, whereby the ORM fr</p><p>4 0.1043232 <a title="685-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-21-Thread_Pool_Engine_in_MS_CLR_4%2C_and_Work-Stealing_scheduling_algorithm.html">575 high scalability-2009-04-21-Thread Pool Engine in MS CLR 4, and Work-Stealing scheduling algorithm</a></p>

<p>Introduction: FromWikipedia:SmartFrogis an open-source software framework, written in Java,
that manages the configuration, deployment and coordination of a software
system broken into components. These components may be distributed across
several network hosts. The configuration of components is described using a
domain-specific language, whose syntax resembles that of Java. It is a
prototype-based object-oriented language, and may thus be compared to Self.
The framework is used internally in a variety of HP products. Also, it is
being used by HP Labs partners like CERN.Related ArticlesDistributed Testing

<p>Introduction: All,My site would have heavy content (video/pictures). I'm looking for an
efficient IPS/IDS solution which would not introduce much of latency. I'm more
familiar with Cisco ASA and also familiar with Juniper, Foundry and others. I
also came across snort but haven't used it before. I'm more of looking for an

other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers.
I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.Could anyone share

<p>Introduction: Hi, if you were to design your own highly scalable website from scratch, what
technologies would you use?Based on Web 2.0 popularity, LAMP seems to be high
in the running. But would you tack on CakePHP? Drupal? or build your
framework/CMS from scratch?What version of Linux runs best for a scalable
website?Would you consider Windows and .NET? Java? Or do you want to throw a
brick at me for even suggesting such heresies?Would you prefer Postgres,
Tomcat, Perl, Python, or any of that other *NIX fancy stuff...why or why
not?Please forget for the moment, "use what you know" argument. I am pretty
versatile, and can look for an expert in whatever platform I choose. So all
skills being equal, I'm looking for the best community support, the fastest
development time and most importantly, the best scaling approach.Let's say,
for fun, that I'm planning for the website to have as many messages going back
& forth as an eBay.Definitely building this on a budget..Jason</p><p>6 0.62079096 <a title="685-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-02-Total_Cost_of_Ownership_for_different_web_development_frameworks.html">338 high scalability-2008-06-02-Total Cost of Ownership for different web development frameworks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Slashdot effect: overwhelming unprepared sites with an avalanche of reader's
clicks after being mentioned on Slashdot. Sure, we now have the "Digg effect"
and other hot new stars, but Slashdot was the original. And like many stars
from generations past, Slashdot plays the elder statesman's role with with
class, dignity, and restraint. Yet with millions and millions of users
Slashdot is still box office gold and more than keeps up with the young'ins.
And with age comes the wisdom of learning how to handle all those users. Just
how does Slashdot scale and what can you learn by going old school?breakSite:

<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most
of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to
the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez
introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide
web of data.Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on
the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10
billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for
applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, withthe
Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible
to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge
structure. This talk will discuss graph databases, their underlying data
model, their querying mechanisms, and the benefits of the graph data structure
for modeling and analysis.</p><p>4 0.96509945 <a title="685-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_22%2C_2013.html">1411 high scalability-2013-02-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 22, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With over 15 billion page views a month Tumblr has become an insanely popular
blogging platform. Users may like Tumblr for its simplicity, its beauty, its
strong focus on user experience, or its friendly and engaged community, but
like it they do.Growing at over 30% a month has not been without challenges.
Some reliability problems among them. It helps to realize that Tumblr operates
at surprisingly huge scales: 500 million page views a day, a peak rate of ~40k
requests per second, ~3TB of new data to store a day, all running on 1000+
servers.One of the common patterns across successful startups is the perilous
chasm crossing from startup to wildly successful startup. Finding people,
evolving infrastructures, servicing old infrastructures, while handling huge
month over month increases in traffic, all with only four engineers, means you
have to make difficult choices about what to work on. This was Tumblr's
situation. Now with twenty engineers there's enough energy to work on issues

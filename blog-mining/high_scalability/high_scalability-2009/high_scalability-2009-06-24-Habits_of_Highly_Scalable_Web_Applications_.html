<p>Introduction: By George Palmer of 3dogsbark.com. Covers:* How you start out: shared hosting,
web server DB on same machine. Move two 2 machines. Minimal code changes.*
Scaling the database. Add read slaves on their own machines. Then master-
master setup. Still minimal code changes.* Scaling the web server. Load
balance against multiple application servers. Application servers scale but
the database doesn't.* User clusters. Partition and allocate users to their
own dedicated cluster. Requires substantial code changes.* Caching. A large
percentage of hits are read only. Use reverse proxy, memcached, and language
specific cache.* Elastic architectures. Based on Amazon EC2. Start and stop
instances on demand. For global applications keep a cache on each continent,
assign users to clusters by location, maintain app servers on each continent,
use transaction replication software if you must replicate your site globally.</p><p>4 0.59411365 <a title="637-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-11-Friendster_Architecture.html">6 high scalability-2007-07-11-Friendster Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you evaluate and decide which web technologies (and there are myriads
out there) to use for your new web application, which one potentially gives
you the best performance, which one will likely give you the shortest time-to-
market? The Apache incubator projectOliomight help.Olio is a is an open source
web 2.0 toolkit to help evaluate the suitability, functionality and
performance of web technologies. Olio defines an example web2.0 application
(an events site somewhat like yahoo.com/upcoming) and provides three initial
implementations : PHP, Java EE and RubyOnRails (ROR). The toolkit also defines
ways to drive load against the application in order to measure
performance.Apache Olio could be used toUnderstand how to use various web 2.0
technologies such as AJAX, memcached, mogileFS etc. Use the code in the
application to understand the subtle complexities involved and how to get
around issues with these technologies.Evaluate the differences in the three
implementations: php, ruby</p><p>6 0.59175646 <a title="637-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-13-How_is_Berkely_DB_fare_against_other_Key-Value_Database.html">704 high scalability-2009-09-13-How is Berkely DB fare against other Key-Value Database</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ringo is an experimental, distributed, replicating key-value store based on
consistent hashing and immutable data. Unlike many general-purpose databases,
Ringo is designed for a specific use case: For archiving small (less than 4KB)
or medium-size data items (<100MB) in real-time so that the data can survive K
- 1 disk breaks, where K is the desired number of replicas, without any
downtime, in a manner that scales to terabytes of data. In addition to
storing, Ringo should be able to retrieve individual or small sets of data
items with low latencies (<10ms) and provide a convenient on-disk format for
bulk data access.Ringo is compatible with themap-reduce framework Discoand it
was started atNokia Research CenterPalo Alto.</p><p>3 0.70787454 <a title="637-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-Conference%3A_Infoscale_2008_in_Italy_%28June_4-6%29.html">322 high scalability-2008-05-19-Conference: Infoscale 2008 in Italy (June 4-6)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Third International Conference on Scalable Information Systems will focus
on a wide array of scalability issues and investigate new approaches to tackle
problems arising from the ever-growing size and complexity of information of
all kinds.Looking at theirtechnical programa lot of interesting topics will be
covered. I see sensor networks, a subject I'm really interested in, has a
number of sessions. That's unusual. And it's in Italy!</p><p>4 0.70201689 <a title="637-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-23-HA_for_switches.html">99 high scalability-2007-09-23-HA for switches</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,Can someone teach me how you implement network switch fail over since we
are paranoid for single point of failure.For example, you have:a dozen web
servers -> switch -> DB clusterthat switch is a SPOF. How does one implement
dual switch in a fail over fashion?</p><p>5 0.70175171 <a title="637-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-11-FTP_Sanity%3A_Redundancy%2C_archiving%2C_consolidation..html">208 high scalability-2008-01-11-FTP Sanity: Redundancy, archiving, consolidation.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Easy FTP redundancy and consolidation with the Open Source project Generic-
FTP. Works with probably any Linux FTP Server (ProFTPD only one tested). Get
rid of some single points of failure. A very easy to set up solution using
scripts written in PHP. Tested thoroughly in a production environment.</p><p>6 0.7015022 <a title="637-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-28-Job_queue_and_search_engine.html">332 high scalability-2008-05-28-Job queue and search engine</a></p>

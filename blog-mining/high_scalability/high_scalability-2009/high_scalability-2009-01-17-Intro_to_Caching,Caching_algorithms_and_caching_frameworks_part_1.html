<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've

makes is that we read about websites likeAmazonandFacebook that can literally

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>4 0.79556429 <a title="495-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-04-Strategy%3A_Cache_Larger_Chunks_-_Cache_Hit_Rate_is_a_Bad_Indicator.html">836 high scalability-2010-06-04-Strategy: Cache Larger Chunks - Cache Hit Rate is a Bad Indicator</a></p>

Invalidation, Replacement Policy, Optimal Replacement Policy, Caching
Algorithms, Least Frequently Used (LFU), Least Recently Used (LRU), Least
Recently Used 2(LRU2), Two Queues, Adaptive Replacement Cache (ACR), Most

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know
everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this
case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help?
Here's Robert's plight:I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest
interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.It’s on
Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.Look at
who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind
WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of
FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the
“don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million
users on Facebook in about 10 days.What would you ask?</p><p>4 0.75248176 <a title="495-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-08-Paper%3A_Sharding_with_Oracle_Database.html">487 high scalability-2009-01-08-Paper: Sharding with Oracle Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The upshot of the paper is Oracle rules and MySQL sucks for sharding. Which is
technically probable, if you don't throw in minor points like cost and ease of
use. The points where they think Oracle wins: online schema changes, more
robust replication, higher availability, better corruption handling, better
use of large RAM and multiple cores, better and better tested partitioning
features, better monitoring, and better gas mileage.</p><p>5 0.74658692 <a title="495-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-13-CloudCamp_London_2%3A_private_clouds_and_standardisation.html">441 high scalability-2008-11-13-CloudCamp London 2: private clouds and standardisation</a></p>

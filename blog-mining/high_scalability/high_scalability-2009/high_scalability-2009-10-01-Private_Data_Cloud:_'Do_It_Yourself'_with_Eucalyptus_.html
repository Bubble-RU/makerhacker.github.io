<p>Introduction: A bit over a month ago Amazon experienced its infamous AWS outage in the US
East Region. As a cloud evangelist, I was intrigued by the history of the
outage as it occurred. There were great posts during and after the outage from
those who went down. But more interestingly for me as architect were the
detailed posts of those who managed to survive the outage relatively unharmed,
such as SimpleGeo, Netflix,SmugMug, SmugMug's CTO, Twilio, Bizo and
others.Reading through the experience of others, I tried to summarize
thepatterns, principles and best practicesthat emerged from these posts, as I
believe we can learn a lot from them on how to design our business
applications to truly leverage on the benefits that the cloud offers in high
availability and scalability.The main principles, patterns and best practices
are:Design for failureStateless and autonomous servicesRedundant hot copies

<p>Introduction: Data centers are reshaping themselves by taking ideas from public cloud
providers, such as Amazon and Google. The idea is to make the data center more
cost-effective by enabling on-demand utility-based computing rather than
dedicated machines. At the same time, it is clear that to make IT operations
more effective, it doesn't make sense to run all the applications that are
currently hosted in a company's data center in the private cloud. This calls
for an integration between private and public cloud. In this post i discuss
some of the challenges involved in making that happen:1. How do we design
applications to be cloud-agnostic?2. How do we enable seamless fail-over to a
public cloud?3. Future-proofing: There are many cases in which we can't make a
clear decision as to where our application should be running at the time of
writing or developing the application. We would like to be in a position to
change the decision as to where our application will be running even after our
applicati</p><p>5 0.12763314 <a title="713-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-16-The_VeriScale_Architecture_-_Elasticity_and_efficiency_for_private_clouds.html">706 high scalability-2009-09-16-The VeriScale Architecture - Elasticity and efficiency for private clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model,
which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model,
networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as
services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the
datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed
application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing
sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the
datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to
scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt
easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sun's VeriScale architecture
provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun
Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures
for more than a decade. The features of these architectures, such as
elasticity, ar</p><p>6 0.12524375 <a title="713-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-07-Sun_Acquires_Q-layer_in_Cloud_Computing_Play.html">486 high scalability-2009-01-07-Sun Acquires Q-layer in Cloud Computing Play</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days - you only needed one, but then came along the
AS400's and soon you had ten - but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh
sh%# - now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and
datacenter operations!Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path?As a
technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other
CIO's on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context
to how they can leverage SpringCM' s easy, fast and affordable cloud
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done
in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a
combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those
services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be
outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud
services.What options do I have?In a recent conversation with a CIO

Eucalyptus: Open Source Cloud Computing.Eucalyptusis generating some
excitement on theCloud Computinggroup as a potential vendor neutral EC2
compatible cloud platform. Two reasons why Eucalyptus is potentially
important: private clouds and cloud portability:breakPrivate clouds. Let's say
you want a cloud like infrastructure for architectural purposes but you want
it to run on your own hardware in your own secure environment. How would you
do this today? Hm....Cloud portability. With the number of cloud offerings
increasing how can you maintain some level of vendor neutrality among this
"swarm" of different options? Portability is a key capability for cloud
customers as the only real power customers have is in where they take their
business and the only way you can change suppliers is if there's a ready
market of fungible services. And the only</p><p>4 0.76668483 <a title="713-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Useful_Cloud_Computing_Blogs.html">445 high scalability-2008-11-14-Useful Cloud Computing Blogs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Private Clouds provide many of the benefits of the Public Cloud, namely
elastic scalability, faster time-to-market and reduced OpEX, all within the
Enterprises own perimeter that complies to its governance. Leading commercial
Private Cloud products include VMware, Univa UD, Unisys. Open source solutions
include pro ducts like Globus Nimbus, Enomaly Elastic Computing Platform,
RESERVOIR and Eucalyptus.Read more

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.With a business associate, I am trying to develop a
financial software that handles financial reports of listed companies. We
managed to create this database with all the data necessary to do financial
analysis. My associate is a Business Intelligence specialist so he is keen to
use OLAPs databases like Microsoft Analysis Services or Jedox Palo, which
enables in-memory calculations and very fast aggregation, slicing and dicing
of data or write-backs.At the same time I did an online course (MOOC) from
Stanford CS184 called Startup Engineering which promoted/talked a lot about
javascript and especially node.js as the language of the future for servers.As
I am keen to use open-source technologies (would be keen to avoid MS SSAS) for
the development of a website to access this financial data , and there are so
many choices for databases out there (Postgre, MongoDB, MySQL etc..but don't

<p>Introduction: This strategy is from theLarge Hadron Colliderproject:Improvements in
performance per Watt have caused CERN to no longer sign hardware support
contracts longer than three years. Machines run until they die. They have a
very high utilization of equipment ('duty cycle', 7 x 24 x 365). Replacing
hardware makes more sense because of the lower cost and the power savings of
new hardware.</p><p>4 0.50571656 <a title="713-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-02-Why_Pinterest_Uses_the_Cloud_Instead_of_Going_Solo_-_To_Be_Or_Not_To_Be.html">1380 high scalability-2013-01-02-Why Pinterest Uses the Cloud Instead of Going Solo - To Be Or Not To Be</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To
$20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems hits Hacker News and
generates agood conversation. One of the common sentiments about the cloud was
raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own
hardware instead of using the cloud?Ryan Park, Operations Engineer at
Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfectmodern responseto that
ultimate existential design dilemma:Our #1 requirement has been to keep up
with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that
there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast
enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a
dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which
gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud
providers.AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to
the list price for on-demand instances.

<p>Introduction: There's a popular line of thought that says don't waste time on optimization
because developing features is more important than saving money. True, you can
always add resources, but at some point, especially in a more mature part of a
product lifecycle: performance equals $$$.Two great examples of this evolution
come from Facebook and Google. The upshot is that when you spend time and
money on optimizing your tool chain you can get huge wins in performance,
control, and costs. Certainly, don't bother if you are just starting, but at
some point you may want to switch to big development efforts in improving
efficiency.Facebook and HipHopThe Facebook example is quite well known:HipHop,
a static PHP compiler released in 2010, after two years of development. PHP
because Facebook implements their web tierin PHP. They've now developed a
dynamic compiler,HipHop VM, using techniques like JIT, side exits, HipHop
bytecode, type prediction, and parallel tracelet linking.This is an incredible

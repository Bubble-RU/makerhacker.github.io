<p>Introduction: Varnishis a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is
targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take
full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered
by these operating systems.Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high
performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be
configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like
computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.Varnish is reported to
be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>3 0.13684914 <a title="707-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-12-Using_Varnish_for_Paywalls%3A_Moving_Logic_to_the_Edge.html">1321 high scalability-2012-09-12-Using Varnish for Paywalls: Moving Logic to the Edge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post fromPer Buer, founder and CEO of Varnish Software,
provider of Varnish Cache, an open source web application accelerator freely
available at varnish-cache.org. Varnish powers a lot of really big websites
worldwide.We at Varnish Software are all about speed. Varnish Cache is built
for speed. It executes its policy code more or less a thousand times faster
than your typical Java or PHP based application servers, mostly due to the
fact that the configuration is compiled into system call free machine
code.System calls require expensive context switches, stall the CPU and wreck
havoc in the CPU cache so avoiding them makes the code fly. There are strong
limitations on what kind of logic you can move into Varnish Cache, but the
logic that you do move there will run very fast.An example is using Varnish
for access control to serve access controlled content from the caching edge
layer.The Varnish PaywallWho gets to access your content? In a traditional

between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level,
procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.The
accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into
physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce
implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined
Hadoop as a subproject.The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo!
are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and
execution of their data analysis tasks, compared tousing Hadoop

<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use

<p>Introduction: Save 25% on Hadoop Conference TicketsApache Hadoop is a hot technology getting
traction all over the enterprise and in the Web 2.0 world. Now, there's going
to be a conference dedicated to learning more about Hadoop. It'll be Friday,
October 2 at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City.Hadoop World, as it's being
called, will be the first Hadoop event on the east coast. Morning sessions
feature talks by Amazon, Cloudera, Facebook, IBM, and Yahoo! Then it breaks
out into three tracks: applications, development / administration, and
extensions / ecosystems. In addition to the conference itself, there will also
be 3 days of training prior to the event for those looking to go deeper. In
addition to general sessions speakers, presenters include Hadoop project
creator Doug Cutting, as well as experts on large-scale data from Intel,
Rackspace, Softplayer, eHarmony, Supermicro, Impetus, Booz Allen Hamilton,
Vertica, About.com, and other companies.Readers get a 25% discount if you

<p>Introduction: This Sun BluePrint article describes the storage architecture of the Tokyo
Institute of Technology TSUBAME grid. The Tokyo Institute of Technology is of
the world's leading technical institutes, and recently created the fastest
supercomputer in Asia, and one of the largest supercomputers outside of the
United States. By deploying Sun Fire x64 servers and data servers in a grid
architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective and flexible supercomputer
consisting of hundreds of systems, thousands of processors, terabytes of
memory and a petabyte of storage that supports users running common off-the-
shelf applications. This is the second of a three-article series. It describes
the steps to install and configuring the Lustre file system within the storage
architecture.</p><p>3 0.88965791 <a title="707-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-31-8_Lessons_We_Can_Learn_from_the_MySpace_Incident_-_Balance%2C_Vision%2C_Fearlessness.html">1014 high scalability-2011-03-31-8 Lessons We Can Learn from the MySpace Incident - Balance, Vision, Fearlessness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A surprising amount of heat and light was generated by the wholeMicrsoft vs
MySpacediscussion. Why people feel so passionate about this I'm not quite
sure, but fortunately for us, in the best sense of the web, it generated an
amazing number of insightful comments and observations. If we stand back and
take a look at the whole incident, what can we take a way that might help us
in the future?All computer companies are technology companies first.  A
repeated theme was that you can't be an entertainment company first. You are a
technology company providing entertainment using technology. The tech can
inform the entertainment side, the entertainment side drives features, but
they really can't be separated. An awesome stack that does nothing is useless.
A great idea on a poor stack is just as useless. There's a difficult balance
that must be achieved and both management and developers must be aware that
there's something to balance.All pigs are equal. All business failures are not

<p>Introduction: This post about using Hive and Hadoop for analytics comes straight from
Facebook engineers.Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the
functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-
engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis and business intelligence applications
used by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook products are also
based on analytics.These products range from simple reporting applications
like Insights for the Facebook Ad Network, to more advanced kind such as
Facebook's Lexicon product.As a result a flexible infrastructure that caters
to the needs of these diverse applications and users and that also scales up
in a cost effective manner with the ever increasing amounts of data being
generated on Facebook, is critical. Hive and Hadoop are the technologies that
we have used to address these requirements at Facebook.Read the rest of the

<p>Introduction: Since its inception,Amazon EC2has enabled companies to run highly scalable
infrastructure with minimal overhead.  Over the years, Amazon Web Services has
expanded with new offerings and additional regions around the world.All this
growth has made establishing a global footprint easier than ever.  And yet,
most EC2 customers still choose to operate in a single region.  While this is
fine for many applications, customers with significant web infrastructure are
depriving users of drastically improved performance.  Deploying infrastructure
in EC2's new regions cuts out one of the biggest sources of latency:
distance.Inthis post, I describe howBizosignificantly reduced load times by
implementing Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) to distribute traffic across
all Amazon regions.Click here to read more on Bizo's dev blog</p><p>6 0.8781898 <a title="707-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-04-Paper%3A__A_Web_of_Things_Application_Architecture_-_Integrating_the_Real-World_into_the_Web.html">1435 high scalability-2013-04-04-Paper:  A Web of Things Application Architecture - Integrating the Real-World into the Web</a></p>

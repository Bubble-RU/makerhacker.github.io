<p>Introduction: Update:  GIGAOM on  rPath Burns EC2 Appliances in a Web Portal . rBuilder adds a portal that lets users turn software into virtual appliances.    rPath  demoed their virtual appliance management system at Monday's  AWS Meetup . What they do is help you build a generic virtual machine image deployable on Amazon, VMWare, Xen and other targets. The idea is to build your software application independent of the underlying operating system and deploy it in your own or someone else's datacenter without worrying about all the details.   To put their service in context think of rPath as how you build, deploy, and upgrade images and someone like  Right Scale  has how you can run and managed a cluster of deployed images.
   
 To build a Virtual Appliance you pull together all your packages through their web interface or through a Python based "recipe" system, select a VM target, and "cook" it all into a VM  image you can immediately deploy and run.  To make this magic happen they use the  Conary</p><p>3 0.10872461 <a title="744-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: Update 2 : Read/WriteWeb  has a good article talking about the scalability issues of relational databases and how Dynamo solves them:  Amazon Dynamo: The Next Generation Of Virtual Distributed Storage . But since Dynamo is just another frustrating walled garden protected by barbed wire and guard dogs, its relevance is somewhat overstated.   Update :  Greg Linden  has a take on the paper where he questions some of Amazon's design choices: emphasizing write availability over fast reads, a lack of indexing support, use of random distribution for load balancing,  and punting on some scalability issues.  Werner Vogels, Amazon's avuncular CTO, just announced a new  paper  on the internal database technology Amazon uses to handle tens of millions customers. I'll dive into more details later, but I thought you'd want to read it hot off the blog. The bad news is it won't be a service. They are keeping this tech not so secret, but very safe. Happily, it's another real-life example to learn from.</p><p>5 0.10479248 <a title="744-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-13-Paper%3A_NoSQL_Databases_-_NoSQL_Introduction_and_Overview.html">1022 high scalability-2011-04-13-Paper: NoSQL Databases - NoSQL Introduction and Overview</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christof Strauch, from Stuttgart Media University, has written an incredible 120+ page paper titled  NoSQL Databases  as an introduction and overview to NoSQL databases . The paper was written between 2010-06 and 2011-02, so it may be a bit out of date, but if you are looking to take in the NoSQL world in one big gulp, this is your chance. I asked Christof to give us a  short taste of what he was trying to accomplish in his paper:
  

The paper aims at giving a systematic and thorough introduction and overview of the NoSQL field by assembling information dispersed among blogs, wikis and scientific papers. It firstly discusses reasons, rationales and motives for the development and usage of nonrelational database systems. These can be summarized by the need for high scalability, the processing of large amounts of data, the ability to distribute data among many (often commodity) servers, consequently a distribution-aware design of DBMSs.


The paper then introduces fundamental concepts,</p><p>6 0.1028983 <a title="744-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-03-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_March_3%2C_2010.html">787 high scalability-2010-03-03-Hot Scalability Links for March 3, 2010</a></p>

   bryanlatten :  Nothing like a million caching layers to screw up an already complicated deployment. Thankfully, there is beer. 
  jkalucki : Twitter isn't down, you are just using the wrong access methods... 
  andyedinborough : I don't mean to hate, but why would I give up performance and scalability for a dynamic language? Honestly, I don't get it. 
  AsitSinha : It's amazing.... to see the absence of an understanding of how capability plays a role in scalability.

<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node then that root node can become overwhelmed:
  
 The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal with the flood of requests. 
 The network interface becomes a bottleneck because a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an undisciplined system. 
  
One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.  Jeff Dean , Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this  Stanford video presentation :  Tree Distribution of Requests and Responses .
 
 
 
Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes. Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88148308 <a title="744-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-24-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_Nov_24_2009.html">744 high scalability-2009-11-24-Hot Scalability Links for Nov 24 2009</a></p>

Baker, Ph.D, from 1992.    I can categorically state that relational databases     set the commercial data processing industry back at least ten years    and wasted many of the billions of dollars that were spent on data processing.  Henry thought OO databases would change things. They didn't. The question is why?

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help? Here's Robert's plight:     I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.  It’s on Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.  Look at who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the “don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million users on Facebook in about 10 days.

<p>Introduction: This is the second guest post ( part 1 ,  part 3 ) of a series by Greg Lindahl, CTO of blekko, the spam free search engine.  Previously, Greg was Founder and Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was the architect of the InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build tightly-coupled supercomputing clusters.  
  What's so hard about crawling the web?  
Web crawlers have been around as long as the Web has -- and before the web, there were crawlers for gopher and ftp. You would think that 25 years of experience would render crawling a solved problem, but the vast growth of the web and new inventions in the technology of webspam and other unsavory content results in a constant supply of new challenges. The general difficulty of tightly-coupled parallel programming also rears its head, as the web has scaled from millions to 100s of billions of pages.
  Existing Open-Source Crawlers and Crawls

<p>Introduction: Counting at scale in a distributed environment is  surprisingly hard . And it's a subject we've covered before in various ways:  Big Data Counting: How to count a billion distinct objects using only 1.5KB of Memory ,  How to update video views count effectively? ,  Numbers Everyone Should Know (sharded counters) .
 
 Kellabyte  (which is an excellent blog) in  Scalable Eventually Consistent Counters  talks about how the Cassandra counter implementation scores well on the scalability and high availability front, but in so doing has "over and under counting problem in partitioned environments."
 
Which is often fine. But if you want more accuracy there's a PN-counter, which is a  CRDT (convergent replicated data type)  where "all the changes made to a counter on each node rather than storing and modifying a single value so that you can merge all the values into the proper final value. Of course the trade-off here is additional storage and processing but there are ways to optimize this."</p><p>3 0.10559785 <a title="564-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-22-Facebook%27s_New_Realtime_Analytics_System%3A_HBase_to_Process_20_Billion_Events_Per_Day.html">1008 high scalability-2011-03-22-Facebook's New Realtime Analytics System: HBase to Process 20 Billion Events Per Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook did it again. They've built another system capable of doing something useful with ginormous streams of realtime data. Last time we saw Facebook release their  New Real-Time Messaging System: HBase To Store 135+ Billion Messages A Month . This time it's a realtime analytics system handling  over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds . 
 
Alex Himel, Engineering Manager at Facebook,  explains what they've built  ( video ) and the scale required:
  

Social plugins have become an important and growing source of traffic for millions of websites over the past year. We released a new version of Insights for Websites last week to give site owners better analytics on how people interact with their content and to help them optimize their websites in real time. To accomplish this, we had to engineer a system that could process over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds.

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.  
 
We tend to think compute of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of datacenters in the future.
 
Given the diversity of compute resources it's reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API. They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever resources it doe</p><p>5 0.10050022 <a title="564-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-28-Design_Decisions_for_Scaling_Your_High_Traffic_Feeds.html">1538 high scalability-2013-10-28-Design Decisions for Scaling Your High Traffic Feeds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Guest post by Thierry Schellenbach, Founder/CTO of Fashiolista.com, follow @tschellenbach on Twitter and Github 
 
 Fashiolista  started out as a hobby project which we built on the side. We had absolutely no idea it would grow into one of the largest online fashion communities. The entire first version took about two weeks to develop and our feed implementation was dead simple. We’ve come a long way since then and I’d like to share our experience with scaling feed systems.
 
Feeds are a core component of many large startups such as Pinterest, Instagram, Wanelo and Fashiolista. At Fashiolista the feed system powers the  flat feed ,  aggregated feed  and the  notification  system. This article will explain the troubles we ran into when scaling our feeds and the design decisions involved with building your own solution. Understanding the basics of how these feed systems work is essential as more and more applications rely on them.

<p>Introduction: We talked about  42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase . Here are a few ways you can defend yourself, secrets revealed by scaling masters across the ages. Note that these are low level programming level moves, not large architecture type strategies.
  Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed Limit  
This is probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an application. What it means:
  
 Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion. 
 Devise ways of tying what you need to do to the individual resources. 
  
Some examples:
  
 Keep a list of purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of the line items because the number of items can be much larger than the number of purchase orders. You have kept the resource usage</p><p>3 0.61530191 <a title="564-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-05-Big_Data_Counting%3A_How_to_count_a_billion_distinct_objects_using_only_1.5KB_of_Memory.html">1222 high scalability-2012-04-05-Big Data Counting: How to count a billion distinct objects using only 1.5KB of Memory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Matt Abrams (@abramsm), from Clearspring, discussing how they are able to accurately estimate the cardinality of sets with billions of distinct elements using surprisingly small data structures. Their servers receive well over 100 billion events per month.  
 
At  Clearspring  we like to count things. Counting the number of distinct elements (the cardinality) of a set is challenge when the cardinality of the set     is large.
 
To better understand the challenge of determining the cardinality of large sets let's imagine that you have a 16 character ID and you'd like to count the number of distinct IDs that you've     seen in your logs. Here is an example:
 
4f67bfc603106cb2
 
 These 16 characters represent 128 bits. 65K IDs would require 1   megabyte of space. We receive over 3 billion events per day, and each   event has an ID. Those IDs require 384,000,000,000 bits or 45   gigabytes of storage.  And that is just the space that the ID field requires!

<p>Introduction: The Twelve Networking Truths  is one of a long series of timeless truths documented in sacred   April Fools'  RFC   s. Though issued in 1996, it's no less true today.
 
It's hard to pick a favorite because they are all good. But if I had to pick, it would be:
  

Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor understood unless experienced firsthand.

  
As we grow comfortable behind garden walls, clutching gadgets like lifelines and ideologies like shields, empathy is the true social network.

<p>Introduction: I'm seeking for a design pattern or advice or directions.     I need to count views/downloads of a set of resources, let them to be identified by their respective URLs.   This is not a big problem. I also need to keep a list of viewed/downloaded resources in the last X days. This list needs to be updated every now and then to reflect real last X days of usage. So resources that were requested prior to X days get evicted from it.   So it's sort of a black box, you feed messages (download request) in and it gives you that list of URLs with counters on the other end.     How would you go about designing it?</p><p>2 0.91532671 <a title="564-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-04-Alternative_Memcache_Usage%3A_A_Highly_Scalable%2C_Highly_Available%2C_In-Memory_Shard_Index.html">482 high scalability-2009-01-04-Alternative Memcache Usage: A Highly Scalable, Highly Available, In-Memory Shard Index</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While working with Memcache the other night, it dawned on me that it’s usage as a distributed caching mechanism was really just one of many ways to use it. That there are in fact many alternative usages that one could find for Memcache if they could just realize what Memcache really is at its core – a simple distributed hash-table – is an important point worthy of further discussion.     To be clear, when I say “simple”, by no means am I implying that Memcache’s implementation is simple, just that the ideas behind it are such. Think about that for a minute. What else could we use a simple distributed hash-table for, besides caching? How about using it as an alternative to the traditional shard lookup method we used in our Master Index Lookup scalability strategy, discussed previously here.</p><p>3 0.88976264 <a title="564-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-17-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_17%2C_2010.html">860 high scalability-2010-07-17-Hot Scalability Links for July 17, 2010</a></p>

 Scale the web by appointing a Crawler Czar? Tom Foremski has the idea that  Google should open up their index  so sites wouldn't have to endure the constant pounding by ravenous crawler bots. Don MacAskill of SmugMug estimates  50% of our web server CPU resources  are spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data over and over again?

<p>Introduction: In  Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation  we learn some shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):
  
  Average server utilization in many data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.  
 Surely that's just for old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade. 
  
It's a VM wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same server.
 
It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithm</p><p>5 0.88676131 <a title="564-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-05-Paper%3A_Scalability_Design_Patterns.html">402 high scalability-2008-10-05-Paper: Scalability Design Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have introduced pattern languages in my earlier post on  The Pattern Bible for Distributed Computing .  Achieving highest possible scalability is a complex combination of many factors. This PLoP 2007  paper  presents a pattern language that can be used to make a system highly scalable.  The Scalability Pattern Language introduced by Kanwardeep Singh Ahluwalia includes patterns to:
  
 Introduce Scalability 
 
 Optimize Algorithm 
 
 Add Hardware 
 
 Add Parallelism 
 
 Add Intra-Process Parallelism 
 Add Inter-Porcess Parallelism 
 Add Hybrid Parallelism 
 
 
 
 Optimize Decentralization 
 
 Control Shared Resources

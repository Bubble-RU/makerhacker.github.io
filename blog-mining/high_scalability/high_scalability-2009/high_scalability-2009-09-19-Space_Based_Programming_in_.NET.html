<p>Introduction: Summary    In this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out model.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.   It's 2008: C</p><p>6 0.10334335 <a title="709-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-24-Building_a_Scalable_Architecture_for_Web_Apps.html">392 high scalability-2008-09-24-Building a Scalable Architecture for Web Apps</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have introduced pattern languages in my earlier post on  The Pattern Bible for Distributed Computing .  Achieving highest possible scalability is a complex combination of many factors. This PLoP 2007  paper  presents a pattern language that can be used to make a system highly scalable.  The Scalability Pattern Language introduced by Kanwardeep Singh Ahluwalia includes patterns to:
  
 Introduce Scalability 
 
 Optimize Algorithm 
 
 Add Hardware 
 
 Add Parallelism 
 
 Add Intra-Process Parallelism 
 Add Inter-Porcess Parallelism 
 Add Hybrid Parallelism 
 
 
 
 Optimize Decentralization 
 
 Control Shared Resources 
 
 Automate Scalability</p><p>5 0.60246837 <a title="709-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-16-EE-Appserver_Clustering_OR_Terracota_OR_Coherence_OR_something_else%3F.html">384 high scalability-2008-09-16-EE-Appserver Clustering OR Terracota OR Coherence OR something else?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     I am very glad that this site exists, as I have learned more about clustering on this site than for quite some time reading stuff elsewhere. Oftentimes, one can find lots of material about clustering, but the practical real-life information is missing. Not so wih this site.     I am currently planning the development of an application which has a lot of enterprise features and requirements. On the other side (if the tiny chance of success might strike us), this application would not be an in-house application of a financial institution, or something like that, but some kind of communit/web 2.0 web site. Thus it is an enterprise application with (hopefully, but surely unlikely) the user numbers of a social networking site. Each user initiated transaction involves huge resssources business logic wise (including insane amounts of encryption oprations).     Of course, I do not intend to induldge into premature scaling, but to invest every minute I have into the implementation of bu</p><p>6 0.58420265 <a title="709-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-27-Three_steps_for_turning_a_tier-based-Spring-application_into_dynamically_scalable_services_%28video%29.html">432 high scalability-2008-10-27-Three steps for turning a tier-based-Spring-application into dynamically scalable services (video)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.

<p>Introduction: If Twitter is the “nervous system of the web” as some people think, then what is the brain that makes sense of all those signals (tweets) from the nervous system? That brain is the Twitter Analytics System and Kevin Weil,  as Analytics Lead at Twitter,  is the homunculus within in charge of figuring out what those over 100 billion tweets (approximately the number of neurons in the human brain) mean.
 
Twitter has only 10% of the expected 100 billion tweets now, but a good brain always plans ahead. Kevin gave a talk,  Hadoop and Protocol Buffers at Twitter , at the  Hadoop Meetup , explaining how Twitter plans to use all that data to an answer key business questions.
 
What type of questions is Twitter interested in answering? Questions that help them better understand Twitter. Questions like:
  
  How many requests do we serve in  a day?  
  What is the average latency? 
  How many searches happen in day?  
  How many unique queries, how many unique users, what is their geographic dist</p><p>4 0.97717118 <a title="709-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-19-How_Twitter_Stores_250_Million_Tweets_a_Day_Using_MySQL.html">1159 high scalability-2011-12-19-How Twitter Stores 250 Million Tweets a Day Using MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremy Cole , a DBA Team Lead/Database Architect at Twitter, gave a really good talk at the O'Reilly MySQL conference:  Big and Small Data at @Twitter , where the topic was thinking of Twitter from the data perspective.
 
One of the interesting stories he told was of the transition from Twitter's old way of storing tweets using temporal  sharding , to a more distributed approach using a new tweet store called T-bird, which is built on top of  Gizzard , which is built using MySQL.
  Twitter's original tweet store:   
 Temporally sharded tweets was a good-idea-at-the-time architecture. Temporal sharding simply means tweets from the same date range are stored together on the same shard. 
 The problem is tweets filled up one machine, then a second, and then a third. You end up filling up one machine after another. 
 This is a pretty common approach and one that has some real flaws:                         
 
  Load balancing . Most of the old machines didn't get any traffic because people</p><p>5 0.97580898 <a title="709-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-07-What_Google_App_Engine_Price_Changes_Say_About_the_Future_of_Web_Architecture.html">1112 high scalability-2011-09-07-What Google App Engine Price Changes Say About the Future of Web Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things . -- Corinthians
 
 With this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs .  I like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.  -- Sylvain on  Google Groups 
 
The dream is dead. Google App Engine's bold  pay for what you use  dream dies as it leaves childish things behind and becomes a  real product .  Pricing will change . Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will change. But Google App Engine  will survive.   
 
Google is  shutting down  many of its  projects . GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank for it surving the  more wood behind  more deadly arrows push? Without a radical and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote in the long scroll of good ideas.

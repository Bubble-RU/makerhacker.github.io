<p>Introduction: Update:   Good Vibrations  by Radovan Semančík. Lot's of interesting questions about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.   Google Wave  is a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new, convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users of  Google Wave  and we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to "federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.

<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his picture), in  I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything , reveals the stack used for building Google+:
  Our stack is pretty standard fare for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily most people don't run</p><p>5 0.6464833 <a title="640-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-13-Challenges_from_large_scale_computing_at_Google.html">409 high scalability-2008-10-13-Challenges from large scale computing at Google</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From Greg Linden on a talk Google Fellow Jeff Dean gave last week at University of Washington Computer Science titled "Research Challenges Inspired by Large-Scale Computing at Google" :   Coming away from the talk, the biggest points for me were the considerable interest in reducing costs (especially reducing power costs), the suggestion that the Google cluster may eventually contain 10M machines at 1k locations, and the call to action for researchers on distributed systems and databases to think orders of magnitude bigger than they often are, not about running on hundreds of machines in one location, but hundreds of thousands of machines across many locations.</p><p>6 0.63227987 <a title="640-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-16-Google%2B_Infrastructure_Update_-_the_JavaScript_Story.html">1143 high scalability-2011-11-16-Google+ Infrastructure Update - the JavaScript Story</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From their website:   Condor  is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial or parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user upon completion.  While providing functionality similar to that of a more traditional batch queueing system, Condor's novel architecture allows it to succeed in areas where traditional scheduling systems fail. Condor can be used to manage a cluster of dedicated compute nodes (such as a "Beowulf" cluster). In addition, unique mechanisms enable Condor to effectively harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop workstations. For instance, Condor can be configured to only use desktop machines where the keyboard</p><p>4 0.72541255 <a title="640-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-16-Reducing_Your_Website%27s_Bandwidth_Usage_-_how_to.html">494 high scalability-2009-01-16-Reducing Your Website's Bandwidth Usage - how to</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In this article Jeff Atwood (a rockstar programmer and one of   StackOverflow   website founders) discusses the measures of how you can reduce you bandwidth usage and refers specifically on high trafficked websites for which bandwidth is more costly than for an average website.          This is his experience and you can read more on his post on  CodingHorror.com .</p><p>5 0.651586 <a title="640-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-20-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_20%2C_2011.html">1045 high scalability-2011-05-20-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 20, 2011</a></p>

  Group Decision Making in Honey Bee Swarms . In distributed computing systems nodes reach a  quorum  when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:   A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating the swarm's move to this site.  Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.   Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across
data centers, then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so
there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What
isChironFSand how does it work?Adapted from the ChironFS website:The Chiron
Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of
failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using
replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not
FILESYSTEMS.Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it
is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other
server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many
servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become
a real nightmare!</p><p>4 0.61549366 <a title="653-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-27-Windows_and_SQL_Server_%3A_Receive_so_much_negativity_in_terms_of_the_Highly_Available%2C_Scalable_Platform...html">225 high scalability-2008-01-27-Windows and SQL Server : Receive so much negativity in terms of the Highly Available, Scalable Platform..</a></p>

they seem to consider them unreliable with limits around scalability,
performance and availability.And then you start looking at some of the big

Linux, MySQL,Oracle platforms that we dont see Windows and SQL Server in

<p>Introduction: Hi,Some time ago , martin fowler bloged about how HTTP cache headers can be
very effectively used in web site
design.http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/SegmentationByFreshness.htmlHow
actively HTTP cache headers are considered in web site design? I think it is a
great tool to reduce lot of load on server and should be considered before
designing any complex caching strategy. Thoughts?Thanks,Unmesh</p><p>5 0.67236626 <a title="653-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-07-RAFT_-_In_Search_of_an_Understandable_Consensus_Algorithm.html">1498 high scalability-2013-08-07-RAFT - In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If like many humans you've found evenPaxos Made Simplea bit difficult to
understand, you might enjoy RAFT as described inIn Search of an Understandable
Consensus Algorithm by Stanford'sDiego Ongaroand John Ousterhout. The video
presentation of the paper is given byJohn Ousterhout. Both the paper and the
video are delightfully accessible.mcherm has a good summary of the paper:A
consensus algorithm is: a cluster of servers should record a series of records
("log entries") in response to requests from clients of the cluster. (It may
also take action based on those entries.) It does so in a way that guarantees
that the responses seen by clients of the cluster will be consistent EVEN in
the face of servers crashing in unpredictable ways (but not loosing data that
was synched to disk), and networks introducing unpredictable delays or
communication blockages.Here's what Raft does. First, it elects a leader, then
the leader records the master version of the log, telling other cluster
servers w</p><p>6 0.67033696 <a title="653-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-16-How_Can_the_Large_Hadron_Collider_Withstand_One_Petabyte_of_Data_a_Second%3F.html">901 high scalability-2010-09-16-How Can the Large Hadron Collider Withstand One Petabyte of Data a Second?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From Greg Linden on a talk Google Fellow Jeff Dean gave last week at
University of Washington Computer Science titled "Research Challenges Inspired
by Large-Scale Computing at Google" :Coming away from the talk, the biggest
points for me were the considerable interest in reducing costs (especially
reducing power costs), the suggestion that the Google cluster may eventually
contain 10M machines at 1k locations, and the call to action for researchers
on distributed systems and databases to think orders of magnitude bigger than
they often are, not about running on hundreds of machines in one location, but
hundreds of thousands of machines across many locations.</p><p>3 0.17865458 <a title="734-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-24-Google_Spanner%27s_Most_Surprising_Revelation%3A_NoSQL_is_Out_and_NewSQL_is_In.html">1328 high scalability-2012-09-24-Google Spanner's Most Surprising Revelation: NoSQL is Out and NewSQL is In</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Google recently released apaper on Spanner, their planet enveloping tool for
organizing the world's monetizable information. Reading the Spanner paper I
felt it had that chiseled in stone feel that all of Google's best papers have.
An instant classic. Jeff Dean foreshadowed Spanner's humungousness as early
as2009.  Now Spanner seems fully online, just waiting to handle "millions of
machines across hundreds of datacenters and trillions of database rows."
Wow.The Wise have yet to weigh in on Spanner en masse. I look forward to more
insightful commentary. There's a lot to make sense of. What struck me most in
the paper was a deeply buried section essentially describing Google's
motivation for shifting away from NoSQL and toNewSQL. The money quote:We

<p>Introduction: The recent Data-Intensive Computing Symposium brought together experts in
system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific
applications, and information-based applications to better understand existing
capabilities in the development and application of large-scale computing
systems, and to explore future opportunities.Google Fellow Jeff Dean had a
very interesting presentation on Handling Large Datasets at Google: Current
Systems and Future Directions. He discussed:• Hardware infrastructure•
Distributed systems infrastructure:–Scheduling system–GFS–BigTable–MapReduce•
Challenges and Future Directions–Infrastructure that spans all
datacenters–More automationIt is really like a "How does Google work"

<p>Introduction: Greg Lindenlinks to a heavily lesson ladened LISA 2007 paper titledOn
Designing and Deploying Internet-Scale Servicesby James Hamilton of the
Windows Live Services Platform group. I know people crave nitty-gritty
details, but this isn't a how to configure a web server article. It hitches
you to a rocket and zooms you up to 50,000 feet so you can take a look at best
web operations practices from a broad, yet practical perspective. The author
and his team of contributors obviously have a lot of in the trenches
experience. Many non-obvious topics are covered. And there's a lot to learn
from.The paper has too many details to cover here, but the big sections
are:RecommendationsAutomatic Management and ProvisioningDependency

<p>Introduction: In a People of ACM interview withSanjay Ghemawat, a Google Fellow in the
Systems Infrastructure Group (MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, GFS, etc), talks
about a few interesting aspects of Google's culture.What Made Google
GoogleProgress is a modern idea. The conviction that future can be changed for
the better through individual advancement and action has over hundreds of
years driven an exponential growth in the technome.What drives progress?
Challenges. Individuals finding and defeating a challenge. There's usually
something someone wants to do so badly that they put in the effort, the
thought, and the money into solving all the problems. The results are often
something new and amazing.And so it was for Google:The main motivation behind
the development of much of Google's infrastructure was the challenge of
keeping up with ever-growing data sets. For example, at the same time Google's
web search was gaining usage very quickly, we were also scaling up the size of
our index dramatically a</p><p>5 0.71064085 <a title="734-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_16%2C_2011.html">1117 high scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 16, 2011</a></p>

Users;Testing at Google Scale: 1800 builds, 120 million test suites, 60
million tests run daily.From theDash Memoon Google's Plan:Go is a very
promising systems-programming language in the vein of C++. We fully hope and
expect that Go becomes the standard back-end language at Google over the next
few years.On GAE Go can load from a cold start in 100ms and the typical
instance size is 4MB. Is it any wonder Go is a go? Should we expect to see
Java and Python deprecated because Go is so much cheaper to run at
scale?Potent Quotables:@caciufo: 30x more scalability w/ many-core. So perf

CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control by Mihai Letia, Nuno Preguiรงa,
and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),a
data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent.From the
introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed
consistency issues:Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-
understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large
scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two
approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up
consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach
[7]. The alternati</p><p>3 0.91015303 <a title="734-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-03-Ideas_on_how_to_scale_a_shared_inventory_database%3F%3F%3F.html">236 high scalability-2008-02-03-Ideas on how to scale a shared inventory database???</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Performance guruSteve Souders gave his keynote presentation, Cache is King!
(slides), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of
how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get
the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results
on what gave the best web site performance improvements.In his base line test,
page loads took 7.65 seconds (median of three runs). What change--Fast
Network, No Javascript, or Primed Cache--would make the biggest performance
improvement? It was Primed Cache.Fast Network - Using a fast FIOS network the
load time was 4.13 seconds. Steve was surprised how big a difference this
made, given how much work must happen in the browser. No JavaScript - 4.74
seconds after disabling JavaScript. Both reduces transfers and skips parsing
by the browser. Steve thought the effect would have been larger.Primed Cache-
3.46 seconds using a warm cache, less than half than the empty cache page view

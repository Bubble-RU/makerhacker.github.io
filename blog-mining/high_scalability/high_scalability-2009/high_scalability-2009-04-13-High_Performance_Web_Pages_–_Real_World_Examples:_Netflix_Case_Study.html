<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: Youmight haveconsistency problems if you have: multiple datastores in multiple
datacenters, without distributed transactions, and with the ability to
alternately execute out of each datacenter;  syncing protocols that can fail
or sync stale data; distributed clients that cache data and then write old
back to the central store; a NoSQL database that doesn't have transactions
between updates of multiple related key-value records; application level
integrity checks; client drivenoptimistic locking.Sounds a lot like many
evolving, loosely coupled, autonomous, distributed systems these days. How do
you solve these consistency problems? Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix talks
about how they solved theirs in his excellent presentation, NoSQL @ Netflix :
Part 1, given to a packed crowd at aCloud Computing Meetup. You might be
inclined to say how silly it is to have these problems in the first place, but
just hold on. See if you might share some of their problems, before getting
all judgy:Netfli</p><p>4 0.098912403 <a title="566-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-26-Scale-up_vs._Scale-out%3A_A_Case_Study_by_IBM_using_Nutch-Lucene.html">583 high scalability-2009-04-26-Scale-up vs. Scale-out: A Case Study by IBM using Nutch-Lucene</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scale-up solutions in the form of large SMPs have represented the mainstream
of commercial computing for the past several years. The major server vendors
continue to provide increasingly larger and more powerful machines. More
recently, scale-out solutions, in the form of clusters of smaller machines,
have gained increased acceptance for commercial computing.Scale-out solutions
are particularly effective in high-throughput web-centric applications.In this
paper, we investigate the behavior of two competing approaches to parallelism,
scale-up and scale-out, in an emerging search application. Our conclusions
show that a scale-out strategy can be the key to good performance even on a
scale-up machine.Furthermore, scale-out solutions offer better
price/performance, although at an increase in management complexity.Read more
about scaling out/up and about the conclusions here (PDF - you can also

<p>Introduction: Pomegranateis a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular
storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at
increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support
applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high
concurrency, high throughput, and low latency. Their tests seem to indicate it
works:We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well
for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observedlinearly
increased more than100,000aggregate read and write requests served per second
(RPS). Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V
store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system
API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use.
Every application could use it out of the box.The features of Pomegranate
are:It handles billions of small files efficiently, even in one directory;It
provide separate and</p><p>3 0.54677022 <a title="566-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-07-RAFT_-_In_Search_of_an_Understandable_Consensus_Algorithm.html">1498 high scalability-2013-08-07-RAFT - In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If like many humans you've found evenPaxos Made Simplea bit difficult to
understand, you might enjoy RAFT as described inIn Search of an Understandable
Consensus Algorithm by Stanford'sDiego Ongaroand John Ousterhout. The video
presentation of the paper is given byJohn Ousterhout. Both the paper and the
video are delightfully accessible.mcherm has a good summary of the paper:A
consensus algorithm is: a cluster of servers should record a series of records
("log entries") in response to requests from clients of the cluster. (It may
also take action based on those entries.) It does so in a way that guarantees
that the responses seen by clients of the cluster will be consistent EVEN in
the face of servers crashing in unpredictable ways (but not loosing data that
was synched to disk), and networks introducing unpredictable delays or
communication blockages.Here's what Raft does. First, it elects a leader, then
the leader records the master version of the log, telling other cluster
servers w</p><p>4 0.53578568 <a title="566-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-31-BerkeleyDB_%26_other_distributed_high_performance_key-value_databases.html">50 high scalability-2007-07-31-BerkeleyDB & other distributed high performance key-value databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I currently use BerkeleyDB as an embedded
databasehttp://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/a decision which was
initially brought on by learning that Google used BerkeleyDB for their
universal sign-on feature.Lustre looks impressive, but their white paper shows
speeds of 800 files created per second, as a good number. However, BerkeleyDB
on my mac mini does 200,000 row creations per second, and can be used as a
distributed file system.I'm having I/O scalability issues with BerkeleyDB on
one machine, and about to implement their distributed replication feature (and
go multi-machine), which in effect makes it work like a distributed file
system, but with local access speeds. That's why I was looking at Lustre.The
key feature difference between BerkeleyDB and Lustre is that BerkeleyDB has a
complete copy of all the data on each computer, making it not a viable
solution for massive sized database applications. However, if you have < 1TB
(ie, one disk) of total possible data, it seems to</p><p>5 0.53523982 <a title="566-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Sync_data_on_all_servers.html">98 high scalability-2007-09-18-Sync data on all servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have a few apache servers ( arround 11 atm ) serving a small amount of data
( arround 44 gigs right now ).For some time I have been using rsync to keep
all the content equal on all servers, but the amount of data has been growing,
and rsync takes a few too much time to "compare" all data from source to
destination, and create a lot of I/O.I have been taking a look at MogileFS, it
seems a good and reliable option, but as the fuse module is not finished, we
should have to rewrite all our apps, and its not an option atm.Any ideas?I
just want a "real time, non resource-hungry" solution alternative for rsync.
If I get more features on the way, then they are welcome :)Why I prefer to use
a Distributed File System instead of using NAS + NFS?- I need 2 NAS, if I dont
want a point of failure, and NAS hard is expensive.- Non-shared hardware, all
server has their own local disks.- As files are replicated, I can save a lot
of money, RAID is not a MUST.Thnx in advance for your help and sorry for</p><p>6 0.5204522 <a title="566-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-17-Paper%3A_Consistent_Hashing_and_Random_Trees%3A_Distributed_Caching_Protocols_for_Relieving_Hot_Spots_on_the_World_Wide_Web.html">280 high scalability-2008-03-17-Paper: Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The ever amazingslime moldis not the only way to solve complex compute
problems without performing calculations. There is another:soap film.
Unfortunately for soap film it isn't nearly as photogenic as slime mold, all
we get are boring looking pictures, but the underlying idea is still
fascinating and ten times less spooky.As a quick introduction we'll lean on
Long Ouyang, who has really straightforward  explanation of how soap film
works inApproaching P=NP: Can Soap Bubbles Solve The Steiner Tree Problem In
Polynomial.It's computers, so playing the role of the motivating graph problem
we have theSteiner tree problem, which Ouyang explains as:Find the minimum
spanning tree for a bunch of vertices, given that you can add additional
points.Soap helps solve this problem because:Soap, in water, acts a
surfactant, which decreases the surface tension in water.This acts to minimize
the surface energy of the liquid.This should minimize surface area (graph
weight), and solve the problem.Dip two</p><p>4 0.53535378 <a title="566-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-Scaling_your_cookie_recipes.html">390 high scalability-2008-09-23-Scaling your cookie recipes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word
alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and
the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world
is:the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more
dough for many more cookies. It’s the difference between making enough dough
in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.Hey, pretty close to
the website notion. Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be
tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed
to do (quoted from the article):Be Patient- When making large batches of
cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.Use
Fresh Ingredients- This is always an important thing to keep in mind.Don’t use
as much leavening- When you’re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember
to scale down the amount of baking powder that you use.Watch the spice- As a

<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund put together an excellent list of four general scalability
patterns and four subpatterns in his postScalability patterns and an
interesting story:Load distribution- Spread the system load across multiple
processing unitsLoad balancing / load sharing- Spreading the load across many
components with equal properties for handling the requestPartitioning-
Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to
a component that owns that data specificVertical partitioning- Spreading the
load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions
being handled by different processing unitsHorizontal partitioning- Spreading
a single type of data element across many instances, according to some
partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation,
etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.Queuing and batch \- Achieve
efficiencies of scale by processing batches of data, usually because the
overhead of an operation is am</p><p>6 0.32015035 <a title="566-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce_for_Machine_Learning_on_Multicore.html">581 high scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore</a></p>

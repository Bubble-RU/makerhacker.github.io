<p>Introduction: Update 2:Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops
Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access
to production machin</p><p>5 0.11689443 <a title="574-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-07-How_Ruby_on_Rails_Survived_a_550k_Pageview_Digging.html">203 high scalability-2008-01-07-How Ruby on Rails Survived a 550k Pageview Digging</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Shanti Braforddetails how his Ruby on Railsbased website survived a 24 hour
550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup
details, so there's not much I can add.Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web
server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR,
nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved
performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of
the performance boost.Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a
very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>6 0.11663515 <a title="574-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-07-Six_Ways_Twitter_May_Reach_its_Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal_of_One_Billion_Users.html">837 high scalability-2010-06-07-Six Ways Twitter May Reach its Big Hairy Audacious Goal of One Billion Users</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot has been said already about Twitter's scalability issues. Many have
given Twitter as an anti-pattern of how not to deal with scalability and have
suggested different solutions for scaling it. As Twitter is famously a Ruby-
on-Rails deployment, this case has also been used as a weapon in the
language/platform wars between the RoR and Java camps, and to a lesser degree,
also with the LAMP (PHP) camp</p><p>4 0.72557986 <a title="574-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-07-Six_Ways_Twitter_May_Reach_its_Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal_of_One_Billion_Users.html">837 high scalability-2010-06-07-Six Ways Twitter May Reach its Big Hairy Audacious Goal of One Billion Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

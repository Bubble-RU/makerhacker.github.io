<p>Introduction: Geir Magnusson from 10gen presented a talk titled Cloud Data Persistence or ‘We’re in a database reneaissance - pay attention” today at QCon London 2009. The main message of his talk was that “physical limitations of today’s technology combined with the computational complexity of conventional relational databases are driving databases into new exciting spaces”, or to put it simpler the database landscape is changing and we should keep our eyes on that.</p><p>2 0.23809415 <a title="537-tfidf-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-18-QCon_London_2009%3A_Upgrading_Twitter_without_service_disruptions.html">544 high scalability-2009-03-18-QCon London 2009: Upgrading Twitter without service disruptions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Evan Weaver from Twitter presented a talk on Twitter software upgrades, titled Improving running components as part of the Systems that never stop track at QCon London 2009 conference last Friday. The talk focused on several upgrades performed since last May, while Twitter was experiencing serious performance problems.</p><p>3 0.10311224 <a title="537-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-15-Lessons_from_Yahoo%2C_eBay%2C_Orbitz%2C_LinkedIn_architecture.html">154 high scalability-2007-11-15-Lessons from Yahoo, eBay, Orbitz, LinkedIn architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm moving this from the forum section to the front page. Just FYI, any registered user can Submit a Link to this blog. You don't have to use the forums.       In The Architectures You've Always Wondered About track at the Qcon conference, Second Life, eBay, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Orbitz presented how they dealt with different aspects of their applications, such as scalability. There were quite a few lessons that I learned that day that I thought were worth sharing.</p><p>4 0.096251704 <a title="537-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-13-Challenges_from_large_scale_computing_at_Google.html">409 high scalability-2008-10-13-Challenges from large scale computing at Google</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From Greg Linden on a talk Google Fellow Jeff Dean gave last week at University of Washington Computer Science titled "Research Challenges Inspired by Large-Scale Computing at Google" :   Coming away from the talk, the biggest points for me were the considerable interest in reducing costs (especially reducing power costs), the suggestion that the Google cluster may eventually contain 10M machines at 1k locations, and the call to action for researchers on distributed systems and databases to think orders of magnitude bigger than they often are, not about running on hundreds of machines in one location, but hundreds of thousands of machines across many locations.</p><p>5 0.083210491 <a title="537-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-18-The_Missing_Piece_in_the_Virtualization_Stack_%28Part_1%29.html">762 high scalability-2010-01-18-The Missing Piece in the Virtualization Stack (Part 1)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This and the next post will discuss how virtualization and cloud computing, as we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today’s IT inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core inefficiencies lie. Virtualization principles must be extended to higher levels of the application stack, to make it easier for all of us to manage, tune and integrate applications. Otherwise we will continue to spend most of our time on things that don’t provide real value to the business.

<p>Introduction: The  Relational Cloud Project  is an effort by a group of researchers at MIT to  investigate technologies and challenges related to Database-as-a-Service within cloud-computing . They are trying to figure out how the advantages of the DaaS (Database-as-a-Service) model, that we've seen arise in other areas like OLAP and NoSQL, can be applied to relational databases. The DaaS advantages as they see them are: 1) predictable costs, proportional to the quality of service and actual workloads, 2) lower technical complexity, thanks to a unified and simplified service access interface, and 3) virtually infinite resources ready at hand. An interesting description of their approach is explained in the paper  Relational Cloud: A Database-as-a-Service for the Cloud . From the abstract:
  
 This paper introduces a new transactional “database-as-a-service” (DBaaS) called Relational Cloud. A DBaaS promises to move much of the operational burden of provisioning, conﬁguration, scaling, performance tun</p><p>3 0.61739695 <a title="537-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-06-NoSQL_Pain%3F_Learn_How_to_Read-write_Scale_Without_a_Complete_Re-write.html">1054 high scalability-2011-06-06-NoSQL Pain? Learn How to Read-write Scale Without a Complete Re-write</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lately I've been reading more cases were different people have started to realize the limitations of the NoSQL promise to database scalability. Note the references below:
     
  Why does Quora use MySQL as the data store instead of NoSQLs such as Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB etc?  
  Why did Diaspora abandon MongoDB for MySQL?  
  How scalable is CouchDB in practice, not just in theory?  
   

Take MongoDB for example. It's damn fast, but it doesn't really know how to save data reliably to disk. I've had it set up in a replica pair to mitigate that risk. Guess what - both servers in the pair failed and corrupted their data files at the same day.

  
It appears that for many, the switch to NoSQL can be rather painful. IMO that doesn't necessarily mean that NoSQL is wrong in general, but it's a combination of 1) lack of maturity 2) not the right tool for the job.
 
That brings the question of what's the alternative solution?
 
In the following post I tried to summarize the lessons from</p><p>4 0.6172843 <a title="537-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-16-The_NewSQL_Market_Breakdown.html">1025 high scalability-2011-04-16-The NewSQL Market Breakdown</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matt Aslett from the 451 group created a term called  “NewSQL ”. On the definition of NewSQL, Aslett writes:
  

“NewSQL” is our shorthand for the various new scalable/high performance SQL database vendors. We have previously referred to these products as ‘ScalableSQL’ to differentiate them from the incumbent relational database products. Since this implies horizontal scalability, which is not necessarily a feature of all the products, we adopted the term ‘NewSQL’ in the new report.


And to clarify, like NoSQL, NewSQL is not to be taken too literally: the new thing about the NewSQL vendors is the vendor, not the SQL.

  
As with NoSQL, under the NewSQL umbrella you can see various providers, with various solutions.
 
I think these can be divided into several sub-types:
  
  New MySQL storage engines . These give MySQL users the same programming interface, but scale very well. You can Xeround or Akiban in this field. The good part is that you still use MySQL, but on the downside it’s n</p><p>5 0.60857958 <a title="537-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-23-Building_a_Scalable_Key-Value_Database%3A_Project_Hydracus.html">885 high scalability-2010-08-23-Building a Scalable Key-Value Database: Project Hydracus</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The world of NoSQL and alternative database implementations (i.e.  non-relational) is deeply fascinating to me. I can’t help but be swept  up in the whirl of planet-scale web development scalability techniques  and the evolution of how developers think about building their  applications knowing that with success comes the inevitable need to  scale to levels almost unimaginable just five or ten years ago.
 
I’m going to make a prediction: Developers will be expected to  understand the fundamentals of how different database systems can be  applied within a singular application; their strengths and weaknesses,  and when it is appropriate to leverage them.
 
There’s a lot out there about scaling relational databases.  Partitioning your data over application-managed shards is a topic that  has seen its fair share of attention. But I think there’s a whole slew  over NoSQL databases that have been built and designed by some very  smart people that are new enough that their internals aren’t we</p><p>6 0.60022146 <a title="537-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-03-Ideas_on_how_to_scale_a_shared_inventory_database%3F%3F%3F.html">236 high scalability-2008-02-03-Ideas on how to scale a shared inventory database???</a></p>

What should Robert ask in his scalability interview?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help? Here's Robert's plight:     I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.  It’s on Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.  Look at who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the “don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million users on Facebook in about 10 days.       What would you ask?</p><p>4 0.59502411 <a title="537-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-17-Intro_to_Caching%2CCaching_algorithms_and_caching_frameworks_part_1.html">495 high scalability-2009-01-17-Intro to Caching,Caching algorithms and caching frameworks part 1</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Informative and  well organized post on caching .

<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node then that root node can become overwhelmed:
  
 The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal with the flood of requests. 
 The network interface becomes a bottleneck because a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an undisciplined system. 
  
One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.  Jeff Dean , Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this  Stanford video presentation :  Tree Distribution of Requests and Responses .
 
 
 
Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes. Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset</p><p>6 0.58014148 <a title="537-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-08-Paper%3A_Sharding_with_Oracle_Database.html">487 high scalability-2009-01-08-Paper: Sharding with Oracle Database</a></p>

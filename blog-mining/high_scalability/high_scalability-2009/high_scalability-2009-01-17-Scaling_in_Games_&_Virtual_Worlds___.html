<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact socially with friends using  Playfish  games on social platforms like The Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the fastest growing segment of the game industry:  social gaming , which is the love child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by why EA bought them for  $300 million  and they think a  $1 billion game  is possible): building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve systems, agile development and deployment, and  selling virtual good  as a business model.
 
How can a small company make all this happen?

<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson:  Game Industry Legends: Rob Pardo , where the future of gaming is discussed, there was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:
  Q. If the game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of those technical issues?

 


 Rob Pardo : I certainly think there's a lot of potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with the infrastructure that can have all those games up there.

Games are proving grounds for software architecture. They combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost sensitivity, and the need for profit.

<p>Introduction: Update:  As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change. What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better yesterday and a better tomorrow.   CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make CAPTCHA work ( Spammers Choose GMail ). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't really work because CAPTCHA solving markets ( Inside India’s CAPTCHA solving economy ) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game over :-)  Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is with humans.

<p>Introduction: Sorry, the content for this post apparently did not make the transition from the old HighScalability website, it's all messed up, but there's still a some useful content... 
 
 EVE Online  is "The World's Largest Game Universe", a massively multiplayer online game ( MMO ) made by CCP. EVE Online's Architecture is unusual for a MMOG because it doesn't divide the player load among different servers or shards. Instead, the same cluster handles the entire EVE universe. It is an interesting to compare this with the  Architecture of the Second Life Grid . How do they manage to scale?

<p>Introduction: Update:  As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change. What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better yesterday and a better tomorrow.   CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make CAPTCHA work ( Spammers Choose GMail ). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't really work because CAPTCHA solving markets ( Inside India’s CAPTCHA solving economy ) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game over :-)  Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is with humans.

<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson:  Game Industry Legends: Rob Pardo , where the future of gaming is discussed, there was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:
  Q. If the game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of those technical issues?

 


 Rob Pardo : I certainly think there's a lot of potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with the infrastructure that can have all those games up there.

<p>Introduction: Update: :  Eucalyptus Goes Commercial with $5.5M Funding Round .  This removes my objection that it's an academic project only. Go team go!   Rich Wolski , professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, gave a spirited talk on  Eucalyptus  to a large group of very interested cloudsters at the  Eucalyptus Cloud Meetup . If Rich could teach computer science at every school the state of the computer science industry would be stratospheric. Rich is dynamic, smart, passionate, and visionary. It's that vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement Eucalyptus and have been improving it and tracking Amazon's changes ever since.

<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems Laboratories     * The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the high-tech industry.   * The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome of the evolution of these games.    * Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.    * The game server is used both to discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating (by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the server component.   * Using multiple servers is a basic mecha</p><p>3 0.93148273 <a title="496-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-31-Need_help_on_Site_loading_%26_database_optimization_-_URGENT.html">611 high scalability-2009-05-31-Need help on Site loading & database optimization - URGENT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,  I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was taking too much load.  There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain PHP/HTML coding is used.

<p>Introduction: Ezra Zygmuntowicz in a heart warming account of his      4 Years at Engine Yard   , has concluded in his experience that:  the true future of cloud computing for developers is to not think about servers at all. It is now time to focus on the Application and new levels of abstraction that allow folks to use the computing resources in easier and easier ways.

<p>Introduction: GridGain   was kind enough to present at the September 17th instance of  the   Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group  . I've been curious about GridGain so I was glad to see them there. In short GridGain is:   an open source computational grid framework that enables Java developers to improve general performance of processing intensive applications by splitting and parallelizing the workload  . GridGain can also be thought of as a set of middleware primitives for building applications. GridGain's peer group of competitors includes GigaSpaces, Terracotta, Coherence, and Hadoop.     The speaker for GridGain was the President and Founder, Nikita Ivanov. He has a very pleasant down-to-earth way about him that contrasts nicely with a field given to religious discussions of complex taxomic definitions. Nikita first talked about cloud computing in general. He feels Java is the perfect gateway for cloud computing. Which is good because   GridGain only works with Java  .

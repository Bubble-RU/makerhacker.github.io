<p>Introduction: One stumbling block of the the great march towards virtualization is the
relatively poor performance of resource hungry applications like databases. We
are told to develop and test using VMs, but deploy without them. Which kind of
sucks IMHO. Maybe better virtualization technology can remove this split. This
paper talks about a different approach to virtualization called "container-
based" virtualization that can reportedly double the performance of
traditional hypervisor systems like Xen. It does this by trading isolation for
efficiency. Rather than maintaining complete isolation between VMs the
container approach shares resources between VMs and thus gives higher
performance while still guaranteeing strong fault, resource, and security
isolation. It's yet another battle in computing's endless war of creating and
destroying abstraction layers. I learned a lot from from this paper because of
how it compared and contrasted traditional hypervisor and container based
virtualization strate</p><p>3 0.17962739 <a title="533-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-07-Rumors_of_Signs_and_Portents_Concerning_Freeish_Google_Cloud.html">299 high scalability-2008-04-07-Rumors of Signs and Portents Concerning Freeish Google Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Rumor no more.Google Jumps Head First Into Web Services With Google
App Engine. The quick and dirty of it: developers simply upload their Python
code to Google, launch the application, and can monitor usage and other
metrics via a multi-platform desktop application. There were 10,000 developer
slots open and of course I was too late. More as the cobra strikes.Update:
TechCrunch reportsGoogle To Launch BigTable As Web Servicenext week. It
competes with Amazon's SimpleDB. Though it won't be truly comparable until
they also release an EC2 and S3 equivalent. An internet hit for each data
access is a little painful. As Jimmy says in Goodfellas, "That's the way. You
don't take no sh*t from nobody. "FirstDave Winerhallucinates a pig on the mean

<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>5 0.13412894 <a title="533-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-10-Can_cloud_computing_smite_down_evil_zombie_botnet_armies%3F.html">349 high scalability-2008-07-10-Can cloud computing smite down evil zombie botnet armies?</a></p>

availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a
great deal of sense once I thought about it.With SCIT you stop and restart VM

<p>Introduction: At a Cloud Computing Meetup, Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a
merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:Keeping Movies Running
Amid Thunderstorms. While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the
cloud, issues with capacity planning,thundering herds, latency problems,
andsimian armageddon, I found myself most taken with how they handlesoftware
deployment in the cloud.I've worked on half a dozen or more build and
deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large
organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability
that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant
software deployments:the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to
completely run a new release while running the old release at the same
time.The process goes something like: Acanary machineis launched first with
the new software load running real traffic to sanity test the load in a
production environment.

<p>Introduction: Are long VM instance spin-up times in the cloud costing you money? That's the
question that immediately came to mind whenJames Urquhart, in an interview at
the Stata Conference, made this thought provoking comment:the faster you can
get the resources into the hands of the people who use them, the more money
you save overall.One of the many super powers of the cloud iselasticity, the
ability to dynamically acquire and release resources in response to demand.
But like any good superhero, their strength must also form the basis of a not
quite fatal flaw. Years and years of angsty episodes are usually required to
explore this contradiction.In the case of the cloud, the weakness reveals
itself in slow VM spin-up times. Spinning up a VM in EC2 can take a little as
1-3 minutes, or can average 5-10 minutes, or it can take much longer if
there's heavy usage in your availability zone. EC2 is not alone. A common
complaint about Google App Engine is thecold-start problem. When a request
comes in,</p><p>5 0.70971906 <a title="533-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-29-Skype_Failed_the_Boot_Scalability_Test%3A_Is_P2P_fundamentally_flawed%3F.html">76 high scalability-2007-08-29-Skype Failed the Boot Scalability Test: Is P2P fundamentally flawed?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Skype's 220 millions users lost service for a stunning two days. The primary
cause for Skype's nightmare (can you imagine the beeper storm that went off?)
was a massive global roll-out of aWindow's patchtriggering the simultaneous
reboot of millions of machines across the globe. The secondary cause was a bug
in Skype's software that prevented "self-healing" in the face of such attacks.
The flood of log-in requests and a lack of "peer-to-peer resources" melted
their system.breakWho's fault is it? Is Skype to blame? Is Microsoft to blame?
Or is the peer-to-peer model itself fundamentally flawed in some way?Let's be
real, how could Skype possibly test booting 220 million servers over a random
configuration of resources? Answer: they can't. Yes, it's Skype's
responsibility, but they are in a bit of a pickle on this one.The boot
scenario is one of the most basic and one of the most difficult scalability
scenarios to plan for and test. You can't simulate the viciousness of real-

GigaSpaces XAP, Scalr, RightScale and FreedomOSS can be used to handle peak
load within EC2.Theo Schlossnagle, with his usual insight, talks about
inDissecting today's surgeshow the nature of internet traffic has evolved over
time. Traffic now spikes like a heart attack, larger and more quickly than
ever from traffic inflow sources like Digg and The New York Times. Theo
relates howAt least eight times in the past month, we've experienced from 100%
to 1000% sudden increases in traffic across many of our clientsand those spike
can happen as quickly as 60 seconds. To me this sounds a lot likePunctuated

<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word
alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and
the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world
is:the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more
dough for many more cookies. It’s the difference between making enough dough
in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.Hey, pretty close to
the website notion. Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be
tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed
to do (quoted from the article):Be Patient- When making large batches of
cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.Use
Fresh Ingredients- This is always an important thing to keep in mind.Don’t use
as much leavening- When you’re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember
to scale down the amount of baking powder that you use.Watch the spice- As a

<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund put together an excellent list of four general scalability
patterns and four subpatterns in his postScalability patterns and an
interesting story:Load distribution- Spread the system load across multiple
processing unitsLoad balancing / load sharing- Spreading the load across many
components with equal properties for handling the requestPartitioning-
Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to
a component that owns that data specificVertical partitioning- Spreading the
load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions
being handled by different processing unitsHorizontal partitioning- Spreading
a single type of data element across many instances, according to some
partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation,
etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.Queuing and batch \- Achieve
efficiencies of scale by processing batches of data, usually because the

<p>Introduction: InStack Overflow Architecture Update - Now At 95 Million Page Views A Month, a
commenter expressed surprise about Stack Overflow's backup strategy: Backup is
to disk for fast retrieval and to tape for historical archiving.The comment
was:Really? People still do this? I know some organizations invested a
tremendous amount in automated, robotic tape backup, but seriously, a site
founded in 2008 is backing up to tape?The Case of the Missing Gmail AccountsI
admit that I was surprised at this strategy too. In this age of copying data
to disk three times for safety, I also wondered if tape backups were still
necessary? Then, like in a movie, an event happened that made sense of
everything, Google suffered the quintessential #firstworldproblem, gmail
accounts went missing! Queue emphatic music. And what's more they were taking
a long time to come back. There was a palpable fear in the land that email
accounts might never be restored. Think about that. They might never be
restored...The Hero:</p><p>6 0.93443757 <a title="533-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-12-Google%3A_Taming_the_Long_Latency_Tail_-_When_More_Machines_Equals_Worse_Results.html">1207 high scalability-2012-03-12-Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail - When More Machines Equals Worse Results</a></p>

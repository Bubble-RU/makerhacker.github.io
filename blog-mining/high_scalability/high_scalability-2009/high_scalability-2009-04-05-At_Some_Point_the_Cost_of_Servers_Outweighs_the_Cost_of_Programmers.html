</p><p>3 You might wonder why the geekosphere cares so passionately which technology stack Twitter uses? [sent-11, score-0.059]
</p><p>4 It took some giant cajones to switch from a well defended platform like Ruby on Rails to an obscure language like Scala. [sent-16, score-0.223]
</p><p>5 Few people would have been brave enough to pull the trigger on that decision. [sent-17, score-0.059]
</p><p>6 Twitter didn't take this large leap out of ignorance or incompetence. [sent-18, score-0.059]
</p><p>7 But they have chosen the path less traveled and seem happy with the direction they are heading. [sent-26, score-0.147]
</p><p>8 If you aren't happy with their decision then that's a you problem, not a them problem. [sent-27, score-0.145]

In this post i tried to provide a more methodical approach for handling twitter scalability challenges that is centered around the right choice of architecture patterns rather then the language itself.   The architecture pattern are given in a generic fashion that is not specific to twitter itself and can serve anyone who is looking to build a scalable real time web application in the near future.</p><p>3 0.22611322 <a title="556-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling_Twitter%3A_Making_Twitter_10000_Percent_Faster.html">639 high scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling Twitter: Making Twitter 10000 Percent Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 6:  Some interesting changes from Twitter's  Evan Weaver : everything in RAM now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability; switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them locally.  Update 5:   Twitter on Scala . A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners.

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your scaling pleasure: 
  
 Twitterers tweet  200 million tweets  a day. Popular topics are eclectic, ranging from Swine Flu to Rebecca Black. Twitter has a really cool video on the global flow of  tweets in the world . Worth watching. It looks like a rainbow arcing across the northern hemisphere. 
  Amazon Cloud Now Stores 339 Billion Objects , more than doubling last years volume.  
 Quotable quotes for independence Alex:          
 
  n8foo : My fav part about the new #AWS pricing announcement - 500TB is the level where they say 'contact us'. 
  RoeyYaniv : Scalability guidelines - Technology can and will fail. The business should not.  
  stevedekorte : Are the folks advocating FP for scalability unaware of the Von Neumann bottleneck? 
  nivertech : #Hadoop is a guy with a machete in front of a jungle - it made a trail, but there are new better #BigData middleware offerings in the jungle

<p>Introduction: A lot has been said already about Twitter's scalability issues. Many have given Twitter as an anti-pattern of how not to deal with scalability and have suggested different solutions for scaling it. As Twitter is famously a Ruby-on-Rails deployment, this case has also been used as a weapon in the language/platform wars between the RoR and Java camps, and to a lesser degree, also with the LAMP (PHP) camp</p><p>3 0.77906883 <a title="556-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-06-BankSimple_Mini-Architecture_-_Using_a_Next_Generation_Toolchain.html">970 high scalability-2011-01-06-BankSimple Mini-Architecture - Using a Next Generation Toolchain</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Can anyone convincingly explain why properties sporting traffic statistics that may seem in-line with with the capabilities of a single big-iron machine need so many machines in their architecture?
 
This is a common reaction to architecture profiles on High Scalability: I could do all that on a few machines so they must be doing something really stupid. 
 
Lo and behold this same reaction also occurred to the article  The Architecture Twitter Uses to Deal with 150M Active Users . On Hacker News  papsosouid  voiced what a lot of people may have been thinking:
  

I really question the current trend of creating big, complex, fragile architectures to "be able to scale". These numbers are a great example of why, the entire thing could run on a single server, in a very straight forward setup. When you are creating a cluster for scalability, and it has less CPU, RAM and IO than a single server, what are you gaining? They are only doing 6k writes a second for crying out loud.

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose limits (  GAE Quotas  ,   Fotolog  ,   Facebook  ) as a means of protecting a website against service destroying   traffic spikes  . Twitter will reportedly   limit the number followers   to 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow Twitter to make some bank by   going freemium   and charging for adding more followers.     Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established ecosystem?      One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is, however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service. Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.      Now in Twitter's case the people with the most followers tend to be o</p><p>2 0.94973743 <a title="556-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-18-How_to_deal_with_an_I-O_bottleneck_to_disk%3F.html">251 high scalability-2008-02-18-How to deal with an I-O bottleneck to disk?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.     They're using a static server to deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.     I'm curious how other people have dealt with this situation.     Seperating into two different servers would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.88792658 <a title="556-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-05-At_Some_Point_the_Cost_of_Servers_Outweighs_the_Cost_of_Programmers.html">556 high scalability-2009-04-05-At Some Point the Cost of Servers Outweighs the Cost of Programmers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is the intriguing quote by Bill Venners in an interview with Twitter's Alex Payne on Twitter's heretical switch from a pure Ruby stack to a Ruby on Rails stack on the front-end and JVM/Scala on the back-end:      So performance was also one of the problems with JRuby, which I [Bill Venners] think helps explain better why they'd [Twitter] prefer Scala over Ruby or JRuby for some things.  I have often heard Rubyists say that although Ruby is slower than Java, for many things it is plenty fast enough, and they are right. The logic goes further, saying that servers are cheap, and programmers expensive, so it makes sense to tradeoff some runtime performance for programmer productivity. And I think that's very often true too, but not always.  If you have enough traffic, at some point the cost of servers outweighs the cost of programmers . I'm not sure whether Twitter is past that point, but they get a lot of traffic. And frankly this isn't an intrinsic tradeoff.

<p>Introduction: HackerEarth  is a coding skill practice and testing service that in a series of well written articles describes the trials and tribulations of building their site and how they overcame them:  Scaling Python/Django application with Apache and mod_wsgi ,  Programming challenges, uptime, and mistakes in 2013 , P ost-mortem: The big outage on January 25, 2014 ,  The Robust Realtime Server ,  100,000 strong - CodeFactory server ,  Scaling database with Django and HAProxy ,  Continuous Deployment System ,  HackerEarth Technology Stack .
 
What characterizes these articles and makes them especially helpful is a drive for improvement and an openness towards reporting what didn't work and how they figured out what would work.
 
As they say, mistakes happen when you are building a complex product with a team of just 3-4 engineers, but investing in infrastructure allowed them to take more breaks, roam the streets of Bangalore while their servers are happily serving thousands of requests every min</p><p>5 0.86524546 <a title="556-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-16-A_Short_on_the_Pinterest_Stack_for_Handling_3%2B_Million_Users.html">1193 high scalability-2012-02-16-A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling 3+ Million Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pinterest co-founder Paul Sciarra  shared a bit about their stack  on Quora:
  
 Python + heavily-modified Django at the application layer 
 Tornado and (very selectively) node.js as web-servers.   
 Memcached and membase / redis for object- and logical-caching, respectively.   
 RabbitMQ as a message queue.   
 Nginx, HAproxy and Varnish for static-delivery and load-balancing. 
 Persistent data storage using MySQL.   
 MrJob on EMR for map-reduce. 
 Git. 
  
Alex Popescu has  created a cool diagram  of the setup and provided some thoughtful analysis as well.</p><p>6 0.86195254 <a title="556-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-18-Georeplication%3A_When_Bad_Things_Happen_to_Good_Systems.html">1374 high scalability-2012-12-18-Georeplication: When Bad Things Happen to Good Systems</a></p>

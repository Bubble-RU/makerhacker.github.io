<p>Introduction: The Google Operating System blog has aninteresting poston Google's scale based
on an updated version of Google's paper about MapReduce.The input data for
some of the MapReduce jobs run in September 2007 was 403,152 TB (terabytes),
the average number of machines allocated for a MapReduce job was 394, while
the average completion time was 6 minutes and a half. The paper mentions that
Google's indexing system processes more than 20 TB of raw data.breakNiall
Kennedy calculates that the average MapReduce job runs across a $1 million
hardware infrastructure, assuming that Google still uses the same cluster
configurations from 2004: two 2 GHz Intel Xeon processors with Hyper-Threading
enabled, 4 GB of memory, two 160 GB IDE hard drives and a gigabit Ethernet
link.Greg Linden notices that Google's infrastructure is an important
competitive advantage. "Anyone at Google can process terabytes of data. And
they can get their results back in about 10 minutes, so they can iterate on it

<p>Introduction: Many people in the Apache Hadoop community have asked Yahoo! to publish the
version of Apache Hadoop they test and deploy across their large Hadoop
clusters. As a service to the Hadoop community, Yahoo is releasing the Yahoo!
Distribution of Hadoop -- a source code distribution that is based entirely on
code found in the Apache Hadoop project.This source distribution includes code
patches that they have added to improve the stability and performance of their
clusters. In all cases, these patches have already been contributed back to
Apache, but they may not yet be available in an Apache release of Hadoop.Read

<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great
presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: "High Performance at
Massive Scale -  Lessons learned at Facebook". The abstract for the talk
is:Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today
serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes
engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging
proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data
that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core
architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to
address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies
that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web
architectures.There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into
later, but I thought you might want a head start on learning how Facebook
handles 30K+ machines, 300 million</p><p>6 0.047855668 <a title="599-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Hive_-_A_Petabyte_Scale_Data_Warehouse_using_Hadoop.html">624 high scalability-2009-06-10-Hive - A Petabyte Scale Data Warehouse using Hadoop</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post about using Hive and Hadoop for analytics comes straight from
Facebook engineers.Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the
functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-
engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis and business intelligence applications
used by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook products are also
based on analytics.These products range from simple reporting applications
like Insights for the Facebook Ad Network, to more advanced kind such as
Facebook's Lexicon product.As a result a flexible infrastructure that caters
to the needs of these diverse applications and users and that also scales up
in a cost effective manner with the ever increasing amounts of data being
generated on Facebook, is critical. Hive and Hadoop are the technologies that
we have used to address these requirements at Facebook.Read the rest of the
article on Engineering @ Facebook's Notes page</p><p>3 0.69742084 <a title="599-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-11-Facebook%2C_Hadoop%2C_and_Hive.html">596 high scalability-2009-05-11-Facebook, Hadoop, and Hive</a></p>

<p>Introduction: CloudCamp returned to London yesterday, organised with the help of Skills
Matter at the Crypt on the Clarkenwell green. The main topics of this
cloud/grid computing community meeting were service-level agreements,
connecting private and public clouds and standardisation issues.</p><p>3 0.64093763 <a title="599-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-07-Help_a_Scoble_out._What_should_Robert_ask_in_his_scalability_interview%3F.html">405 high scalability-2008-10-07-Help a Scoble out. What should Robert ask in his scalability interview?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know
everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this
case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help?
Here's Robert's plight:I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest
interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.It’s on
Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.Look at
who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind
WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of
FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the
“don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million
users on Facebook in about 10 days.What would you ask?</p><p>4 0.50820494 <a title="599-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-21-Manage_virtualized_sprawl_with_VRMs.html">725 high scalability-2009-10-21-Manage virtualized sprawl with VRMs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The essence of my work is coming into daily contact with innovative
technologies. A recent example was at the request of a partner company who
wanted to answer- which one of these tools will best solve my virtualized
datacenter headache? After initial analysis all the products could be
classified as tools that troubleshoot VM sprawl, but there was no universally
accepted term for them. The most descriptive term  that I found was Virtual
Resource Manager (VRM) from DynamicOps. As I delved deeper into their
workings, the distinction between VRMs and Private Clouds became blurred. What
are the differences?Read more

<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node
then that root node can become overwhelmed:The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for
either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal
with the flood of requests.The network interface becomes a bottleneck because
a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then
clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an
undisciplined system.One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.
Jeff Dean, Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this
Stanford video presentation:Tree Distribution of Requests and
Responses.Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat
topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a
number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes.
Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset of
the leaf nodes.With this</p><p>6 0.3557156 <a title="599-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-23-Funny%3A_A_Cautionary_Tale_About_Storage_and_Backup.html">1162 high scalability-2011-12-23-Funny: A Cautionary Tale About Storage and Backup</a></p>

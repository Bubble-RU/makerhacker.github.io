this responsibility is given to Database layer. By using sequences or some
other technique. This is a problem for horizontal scalability.What are the

<p>Introduction: Hi,I would like feed back on a ID generator I just made. What positive and
negative effects do you see with this. It's programmed in Java, but could just
as easily be programmed in any other typical language. It's thread safe and
does not use any synchronization. When testing it on my laptop, I was able to
generate 10 million IDs within about 15 seconds, so it should be more than
fast enough.Take a look at the attachment.. (had to rename it from IdGen.java

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>5 0.098446161 <a title="606-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-06-Building_a_Unique_Data_Warehouse.html">716 high scalability-2009-10-06-Building a Unique Data Warehouse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are many reasons to roll your own data storage solution on top of
existing technologies. We've seen stories on HighScalability about custom
databases for very large sets of individual data(like Twitter) and large
amounts of binary data (like Facebook pictures). However, I recently ran into
a unique type of problem. I was tasked with recording and storing bandwidth
information for more than 20,000 servers and their associated networking
equipment. This data needed to be accessed in real-time, with less than a 5
minute delay between the data being recorded and the datashowing up on
customer bandwidth graphs on our customer portal.After numerous false starts
with off the shelf components and existing database clustering technology, we
decided we must roll our own system. The real key to our problem (literally)
was the ratio of the size of the key to the size of the actual data. Because
the tracked metric was so small (a 64-bit counter) compared to the unique
identifier (32-bit netwo</p><p>6 0.09042871 <a title="606-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-07-Scale_Indefinitely_on_S3_With_These_Secrets_of_the_S3_Masters.html">1205 high scalability-2012-03-07-Scale Indefinitely on S3 With These Secrets of the S3 Masters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What's cool about starting a new project is you finally have a chance to do it
right. You of course eventually mess everything up in your own way, but for
that one moment the world has a perfect order, a rightness that feels
satisfying and good. Arne Claassen, the CTO of notify.me, a brand new real
time notification delivery service, is in this honeymoon period now.Arne has
been gracious enough to share with us his philosophy of how to build a
notification service. I think you'll find it fascinating because Arne goes
into a lot of useful detail about how his system works.His main design
philosophy is to minimize the bottlenecks that form around synchronous access,
that is whensome resource is requested and the requestor ties up more
resources, waiting for a response. If the requested resource can't be
delivered in a timely manner, more and more requests pile up until the server
can't accept any new ones. Nobody gets what they want and you have an outage.

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg, the first paid employee at reddit, teaches us a lot about how
to create a successful social site in a really good talk he gave at the RAMP
conference. Watch it here at Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion-
Pitfalls and Lessons.Jeremy uses a virtue and sin approach. Examples of the
mistakes made in scaling reddit are shared and it turns out they did a lot of
good stuff too. Somewhat of a shocker is that Jeremy is now a Reliability
Architect at Netflix, so we get a little Netflix perspective thrown in for
free.Some of the lessons that stood out most for me: Think of SSDs as cheap
RAM, not expensive disk. When reddit moved from spinning disks to SSDs for the
database the number of servers was reduced from 12 to 1 with a ton of
headroom. SSDs are 4x more expensive but you get 16x the performance. Worth
the cost. Give users a little bit of power, see what they do with it, and turn
the good stuff into features. One of the biggest revelations for me was how

<p>Introduction: Hi all,I'm a big fan of http://highscalability.com/ and have been looking in
my current development to decompose my application along functional boundaries
as a route to being able to scale out the server side, specifically the
database layer. The problem comes when there are links between the data in
different components, ie one component holds all the user data, but another
component needs to reference a user as being an owner of some piece of data.
I'm currently doing this by holding the primary key information for each side
of the the link (as you would if they all lived in a single database), but
this link table needs to exist in both components to allow lookups to be done
in either direction, ie 'get the things a specific user owns' and 'get the
owners of this specific thing' would each use different components. The
alternative to this would be to store the link data in only one of the
components, but then the reverse lookups would require 2 calls instead of just
one.My question</p><p>5 0.713314 <a title="606-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-08-N%2B1%2Bcaching_is_ok%3F.html">561 high scalability-2009-04-08-N+1+caching is ok?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hibernate and iBATIS and other similar tools have documentation with
recommendations for avoiding the "N+1 select" problem. The problem being that
if you wanted to retrieve a set of widgets from a table, one query would be
used to to retrieve all the ids of the matching widgets (select widget_id from
widget where ...) and then for each id, another select is used to retrieve the
details of that widget (select * from widget where widget_id = ?). If you have
100 widgets, it requires 101 queries to get the details of them all.I can see
why this is bad, but what if you're doing entity caching? i.e. If you run the
first query to get your list of ids, and then for each widget you retrive it
from the cache. Surely in that case, N+1(+caching) is good? Assuming of course
that there is a high probability of all of the matching entities being in the
cache.I may be asking a daft question here - one whose answer is obviously
implied by the large scalable mechanisms for storing data that are in use

<p>Introduction: (Please bare with me, I'm a new, passionate, confident and terrified
programmer :D )Background:I'm pre-launch and 1 year into the development of my
application. My target is to be able to eventually handle millions of
registered users with 5-10% of them concurrent. Up to this point I've used
auto-increment to assign unique identifiers to rows. I am now considering
switching to a non-sequential strategy. Oh, I'm using the LAMP
configuration.My reasons for avoiding auto-increment:1. Complicates
replication when scaling horizontally. Risk of collision is significant (when
running multiple masters). Note: I've read the other entries in this forum
that relate to ID generation and there have been some great suggestions --
including a strategy that uses auto-increment in a way that avoids this
pitfall... That said, I'm still nervous about it.2. Potential bottleneck when
retrieving/assigning IDs -- IDs assigned at the database.My reasons for being
nervous about non-sequential IDs:1.

<p>Introduction: Kngine is Knowledge Web search engine designed to provide meaningful search
results, such as: semantic information about the keywords/concepts, answer the
user's questions, discover the relations between the keywords/concepts, and
link the different kind of data together, such as: Movies, Subtitles, Photos,
Price at sale store, User reviews, and Influenced storyGoalsKngine long-term
goal is to make all human beings systematic knowledge and experience
accessible to everyone. I aim to collect and organize all objective data, and
make it possible and easy to access. Our goal is to build on the advances of
Web search engine, semantic web, data representation technologies a new form
of Web search engine that will unleash a revolution of new
possibilities.Kngine tries to combine the power of Web search engines with the
power of Semantic search and the data representation to provide meaningful
search results compromising user needs.StatusKngine starts as a research
project in October 2008. Ov</p><p>4 0.76370627 <a title="606-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-01-Prismatic_Update%3A_Machine_Learning_on_Documents_and_Users.html">1294 high scalability-2012-08-01-Prismatic Update: Machine Learning on Documents and Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In update toPrismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning on Social Networks
to Figure Out What You Should Read on the Web, Jason Wolfe, even in the face
of deadening fatigue from long nights spent getting their iPhone app out, has
gallantly agreed to talk a little more about Primatic's approach to Machine
Learning.Documents and users are two areas where Prismatic applies ML (machine
learning):ML on DocumentsGiven an HTML document: learn how to extract the main
text of the page (rather than the sidebar, footer, comments, etc), its title,
author, best images, etcdetermine features for relevance (e.g., what the
article is about, topics, etc.)The setup for most of these tasks is pretty
typical. Models are trained using big batch jobs on other machines that read
data from s3, save the learned parameter files to s3, and then read (and
periodically refresh) the models from s3 in the ingest pipeline.All of the
data that flows out of the system can be fed back into this pipeline, which

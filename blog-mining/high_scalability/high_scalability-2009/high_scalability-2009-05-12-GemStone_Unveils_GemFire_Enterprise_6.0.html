<p>Introduction: GemStone has unveiled GemFire 6.0 which is the culmination of several years of
development and the continuous solving of the hardest data management problems
in the world. With this release GemFire touts some of the latest innovative
features in data management.In this release:- GemFire introduces a resource
manager to continuously monitor and protect cache instances from running out
of memory, triggering rebalancing to migrate data to less loaded nodes or
allow dynamic increase/decrease in the number of nodes hosting data for linear
scalability without impeding ongoing operations (no contention points).-
GemFire provides explicit control over when rebalancing can be triggered, on
what class of data and even allows the administrator to simulate a "rebalance"
operation to quantify the benefits before actually doing it.- With built in

<p>Introduction: GemStone's website recently recieved a major facelift over atwww.gemstone.com.
I felt that the users of this site might find our detailed description of how
we solve the hardest problems in data management interesting. This can be
viewed at:http://www.gemstone.com/hardest-problems(PDF available for
download).Also check out our industry page to see how GemFire applies to
multiple industries, then head over to the solutions page to see how GemFire
enables mainframe migration, real-time BI in data warehousing, RDB
scalup/speedup and the cloud. Finally, check out our community site if you
want a more technical view of GemFire. We hope you enjoy the new facelift and
content!</p><p>4 0.12888645 <a title="597-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-21-In_Memory_Data_Grid_Technologies.html">1160 high scalability-2011-12-21-In Memory Data Grid Technologies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After winning a CSC Leading Edge Forum (LEF) research grant, I (Paul Colmer)
wanted to publish some of the highlights of my research to share with the
wider technology community.What is an In Memory Data Grid?It is not an in-
memory relational database, a NOSQL database or a relational database.  It is
a different breed of software datastore.In summary an IMDG is an 'off the
shelf' software product that exhibits the following characteristics:The data
model is distributed across many servers in a single location or across
multiple locations.  This distribution is known as a data fabric.  This
distributed model is known as a 'shared nothing' architecture.All servers can
be active in each site.All data is stored in the RAM of the servers.Servers
can be added or removed non-disruptively, to increase the amount of RAM
available.The data model is non-relational and is object-based. Distributed

<p>Introduction: Recently I attended a lecture presented by Manik Surtani , JBoss Cache &
Infinispan project lead. The goal of the talk was to provide a technical
overview of both products and outline Infinispan's road-map. Infinispan is the
successor to the open-source JBoss Cache. JBoss Cache was originally targeted
at simple web page caching and Infinispan builds on this to take it into the
Cloud paradigm.Why did I attend? Well, over the past few years I have worked
on projects that have used commercial distributed caching (aka data grid)
technologies such as GemFire, GigaSpaces XAP or Oracle Coherence . These
projects required more functionality than is currently provided by open-source
solutions such as memcached or EHCache. Looking at the road-map for
Infinispan, I was struck by its ambition - will it provide the functionality
that I need?Read more at:http://bigdatamatters.com/bigdatamatters/2009/09

<p>Introduction: Infinispanis a highly scalable, open source licensed data grid platform in the
style ofGigaSpacesand OracleCoherence.From their website:The purpose of
Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent, designed
ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core architectures
while at the same time providing distributed cache capabilities. At its core
Infinispan exposes a JSR-107 (JCACHE) compatible Cache interface (which in
turn extends java.util.Map). It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer
network architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data
grid.Offering high availability via making replicas of state across a network
as well as optionally persisting state to configurable cache stores,
Infinispan offers enterprise features such as efficient eviction algorithms to
control memory usage as well as JTA compatibility.In addition to the peer-to-
peer architecture of Infinispan, on the roadmap is the ability to run farms of

<p>Introduction: GemFire Enterprise is in-memory distributed data management platform that
pools memory (and CPU, network and optionally local disk) across multiple
processes to manage application objects and behavior. With the 6.0 release,
GemFire has reached a stage of maturity in its evolution. GemStone touts this
version as the true 'best of breed' distributed caching technology, solving
scalability issues in all industries.</p><p>2 0.80350393 <a title="597-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-08-ID_generator.html">145 high scalability-2007-11-08-ID generator</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I would like feed back on a ID generator I just made. What positive and
negative effects do you see with this. It's programmed in Java, but could just
as easily be programmed in any other typical language. It's thread safe and
does not use any synchronization. When testing it on my laptop, I was able to
generate 10 million IDs within about 15 seconds, so it should be more than
fast enough.Take a look at the attachment.. (had to rename it from IdGen.java
to IdGen.txt to attach it)IdGen.java</p><p>3 0.77853554 <a title="597-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-20-Building_a_data_cycle_at_LinkedIn_with_Hadoop_and_Project_Voldemort.html">634 high scalability-2009-06-20-Building a data cycle at LinkedIn with Hadoop and Project Voldemort</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Smart Inspecthas added quite a few features specifically tailored to
highscalability and high performance environments to our tool over the
years.This includes the ability to log to memory and dump log files on
demand(when a crash occurs for example), special backlog queue features, a
logservice application for central log storage and a lot more.
Additionally,our SmartInspect Console (the viewer application) makes viewing,
filteringand inspecting large amounts of logging data a lot easier/practical.</p><p>5 0.7514928 <a title="597-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-30-Is_%22Scaling_Engineer%22_a_new_job_title%3F.html">335 high scalability-2008-05-30-Is "Scaling Engineer" a new job title?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Justin.tv is looking to hire aScaling Engineerto help scale their video
cluster, IRC server, web app, monitoring and search services. I've never seen
this job title before. A quick search that showed only a few previous
instances of it being used. Has anyone else seen Scaling Engineer as a job
title before?It's a great idea. Scaling is certainly a worthy specialty of
it's own. Why there's a difficult lingo, obscure tools, endlessly subtle
concepts, a massive body of knowledge to master, and many competing religious
factions. All a good start. Next I see a chain of Scalability Universities.
Maybe use all those Starbucks that are closing down. Contact me for franchise
opportunities :-)</p><p>6 0.7510311 <a title="597-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-01-Product%3A_MogileFS.html">53 high scalability-2007-08-01-Product: MogileFS</a></p>

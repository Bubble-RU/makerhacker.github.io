<p>Introduction: Update 2:Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops
Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access
to production machin</p><p>4 0.11353626 <a title="680-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-10-Is_there_a_difference_between_partitioning_and_federation_and_sharding%3F.html">89 high scalability-2007-09-10-Is there a difference between partitioning and federation and sharding?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unlike Theo Schlossnagle, author ofScalable Internet Architectures, I am not a
stickler for semantics because I have an unswerving faith in the ultimate
unknowability of the world as experienced by others. That's why it is Theo who
bravely tackles the differences in his informative blog postPartitioning vs.
Federation vs. Sharding. Royans Tharakan also talks about it on hisblog.Is
there a difference and does it really matter to all our intrepid scalable
website builders?breakGenerally whatever Theo says is probably close to the
truth. Yet, in my mind I think of partitioning as abasic level categoryand
federation and sharding as more specific (subordinate) instances of
partitioning. And partitioning is a more specific instance of the more more
general (superordinate) category divide-and-conquer. Which isn't a useful way
to think about the topic at all.So, let's say federation is like Star Trek.

Postmorterama:James Hamilton with somehigh powered perspectiveon the report
for the Fukushima Nuclear Accident. Apparently they haven't heard of the
blameless post-mortem. Lots of interesting stuff, but this is a potentially
disaster saving general lesson learned: operators can't figure out what is
happening or take appropriate action without detailed visibility into the
state of the system.Evernote with a nicely detailed noteon a recent outage. A
kernel panic happened while upgrading two new "shard" servers with 3x as much
RAM, SSDs instead of 15krpm disks, bonded networking, and an updated kernel.
They had to revert and shite loves to happen when other shite happens.Heroku
with theirpostmortem on what happenedwhen AWS went down. They lost 30% of
their instances across 3 AZs in the US-East region. Rich detail on the impact
of the AWS, but not much on what they can do about it in the future, probably
because there's not much</p><p>4 0.69462061 <a title="680-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-09-Have_you_collectl%27d_yet%3F__If_not%2C_maybe_collectl-utils_will_make_it_easier_to_do_so.html">719 high scalability-2009-10-09-Have you collectl'd yet?

<p>Introduction: I'm not sure how many people who follow this have even tried collectl but I
wanted to let you all know that I just released a set of utilities called
strangely enough collectl-utils, which you can get athttp://collectl-
utils.sourceforge.net. One web-based utility called colplot gives you the
ability to very easily plot data from multiple systems in a way that makes
correlating them over time very easy.Another utility called colmux lets you

<p>Introduction: FromWikipedia:HypericHQ is a popular open source IT Operations computer system
and network monitoring application software. It auto-discovers all system
resources and their metrics, including hardware, operating systems,
virtualization, databases, middleware, applications, and services. It watches
hosts and services that you specify, alerting you when things go bad and again
when they get better. It also provides historical charting and event
correlation for faster problem identification.The Hyperic HQ server is a
distributed J2EE application that runs on top of the open source JBoss
Application Server. It is written in Java and portable C code and runs on
Linux, Windows, Solaris, HP-UX and Mac OS X. Hyperic HQ Portal is a Java and
AJAX User Interface that includes:Inventory/Application Model & host

<p>Introduction: Update:as of the end of Q2 2011,Akamai had 95,811servers deployed
globally.Akamai is the CDN to the stars. It claims to deliver between 15 and
30 percent of all Web traffic, with major customers like Facebook, Twitter,
Apple, and the US military. Traditionally quite secretive, we get a peek
behind the curtain in this paper: The Akamai Network: A Platform for High-
Performance Internet Applications by Erik Nygren, Ramesh Sitaraman, and
Jennifer Sun. Abstract:Comprising more than 61,000 servers located across
nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers
hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of
enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet
applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the components and
capabilities of this large-scale distributed computing platform, and offer
some insight into its architecture, design principles, operation, and

<p>Introduction: Wildly popular VC blogger Fred Wilson defines in an excellent 27 minute
videothe ten most important criteria he uses when deciding to give the gold,
that is, fund a web application. Note, this video isfrom 2010, so no doubt the
ideas are still valid, but the importance of mobile vs web apps has probably
shifted to mobile, as Mr. Wilson says in a recent post: mobile is growing like
a weed. Speed- speed is more than a feature, it's a requirement. Mainstream
users are unforgiving. If something is slow they won't use it. Pingdom is used
to track speed across their portfolio. A trend they've noticed is that as an
application slows down they don't grow as quickly. Instant Utility- a service
must be instantly useful to users. Lengthy setup and configuration is a
killer. Tricks like crawling the web to populate information you expect to get
from your users later makes the service initially useful. YouTube won, for
example, with instant availability of uploaded video.Voice- Consumer software

<p>Introduction: If you are a startup you may find useful Guy Kawasaki's postFinancial Models
for Underachievers: Two Years of the Real Numbers of a Startup. Part of any
business plan are the projected guestimates. They are guestimates because
everyone keeps these numbers hidden like a Swiss bank account. But notRedfin.
They've bravely shared their initial cost projections, their actual numbers
from real life, and the lessons they've learned from the discrepancy between
the two...breakYou can find their model estimates and actuals for Rent, Per
Employee, Per Month (model: $250, actual: $336); Initial Per-Employee
Equipment Cost; Monthly Benefits, Per-Employee; Annual Payroll Tax; Quarterly
Bonus Payout, as a % of the Total Possible; Annual Payroll Increase for
Existing Employees; All-Company Meeting Cost, Per-Meeting, Per-Employee;
Annual Accounting Costs, and a few more.There is also a great lessons section:

<p>Introduction: The world of scalable databases is not a simple one. They come in every race,
creed, and color. Rick Cattell has brought some harmony to that world by
publishingHigh Performance Scalable Data Stores, a nicely detailed one stop
shop paper comparing scalable databases soley on the content of their
character. Ironically, the first step in that evaluation is dividing the world
into four groups:Key-value stores: Redis, Scalaris, Voldmort, and
Riak.Document stores: Couch DB, MongoDB, and SimpleDB.Record stores: BigTable,
HBase, HyperTable, and Cassandra.Scalable RDBMSs: MySQL Cluster, ScaleDB,
Drizzle, and VoltDB.The paper describes each system and then compares them on
the dimensions of Concurrency Control, Data Storage Replication, Transaction
Model, General Comments, Maturity, K-hits, License Language.And the winner is:
there are no winners. Yet. Rick concludes by pointing to a great convergence:I

<p>Introduction: In the "should I or shouldn't I" debate around deploying SSD, it always helps
to have real-world data. Fiesta! with alive-blog summary of a presentation by
Kenny Gorman onShutterfly on MongoDB Performance Tuning.What if you still need
more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs.
Shutterfly usesFacebook's flashcache: kernel module to cache data on SSD.
Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single
mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O.
Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can
delay sharding: less complexity.The wholeseries of posts has a lot of great
information and is worth a longer look, especially if you are considering
using MongoDB. Related ArticlesSlides forMongoSF 2011 slides: MongoDB

<p>Introduction: OK, thisinterview is with meon Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger
idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java
World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them
:-)The interview went an interesting direction, but there's more I'd like add
and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have
popped out at me:Java - It's the platform stupid. Java the language isn't the
big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM,
libraries, and toolsets.Java - It's the community stupid. A lot of creativity
is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability
challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing
Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.The fecundity of
the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our
multi-core future. There's a multi-core crisis going in case you haven't
heard. It's all you'll</p><p>3 0.095451564 <a title="701-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-16-Handle_1_Billion_Events_Per_Day_Using_a_Memory_Grid.html">513 high scalability-2009-02-16-Handle 1 Billion Events Per Day Using a Memory Grid</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Moshe Kaplan of RockeTiershows the life cycle of an affiliate marketing
systemthat starts off as a cub handling one million events per day and ends up
a lion handling 200 million to even one billion events per day. The resulting
system uses ten commodity servers at a cost of $35,000.Mr. Kaplan's paper is
especially interesting because it documents a system architecture evolution we
may see a lot more of in the future:database centric --> cache centric -->
memory grid.As scaling and performance requirements for complicated operations
increase, leaving the entire system in memory starts to make a great deal of
sense. Why use cache at all? Why shouldn't your system be all in memory from
the start?General Approach to Evolving the System to ScaleAnalyze the system
architecture and the main business processes. Detect the main hardware
bottlenecks and the related business process causing them. Focus efforts on

<p>Introduction: Recently I had to help users on one of my opensource project ISPMan.
http://ispman.netThis project started in 2001 as I was too unwilling to take
care of the DNS and VitualHosting stuff as it was a side-thing to the company
I worked for (so i wrote a software that took care of all these little
details)Summary: A large project that needs a rewrite can be done in a matter
of day.I will not give you a full case study about a project that went through
a re-write but a case study about how easy it is to re-write
something.breakDetails:My boss was cool enough to let me open-source the
project and obviously, I got a lot of cool-cred out of it.Later on I also did
some support and implementation and earned quiet some money with it.Eventually
I had to let the project go out of my hand to the community as I only did it
to facilitate a job that wasnt williing to do. (Setup DNS zones of multiple
servers, find out which host should host the website and put VirtualHost
section there, find out which m</p><p>5 0.093980104 <a title="701-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-30-Scaling_Out_MySQL.html">292 high scalability-2008-03-30-Scaling Out MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post covers two main options for scaling-out MySql and compare between
them. The first is based on data-base clustering and the second is based on In
Memory clustering a.k.a Data Grid. A special emphasis is given to a pattern
which shows how to scale our existing data base without changing it through a
combination of Data Grid and data base as a background service. This pattern
is referred to as Persistency as a Service (PaaS). It also address many of the
fequently asked question related to how performance, reliability and
scalability is achieved with this pattern.</p><p>6 0.093776315 <a title="701-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-06-Some_Hot_Links.html">695 high scalability-2009-09-06-Some Hot Links</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Stardog makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can
be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a recent article
StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable,
improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now
handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It
can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. What did they do
that you can also do?Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data
structures. For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue.Use
ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid
synchronization.Batch LRU evictions in a single thread. Triggered by several
LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by
additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times.Move to

potential solutions, that they've found while working with their clients. Too
Many Database Calls- too many database query per
request/transaction.Synchronized to Death- in a high-load or production
environment over-synchronization results in severe performance and scalability
problems.Too chatty on the remoting channels- too many calls across these
remoting boundaries and in the end causes performance and scalability
problems.Wrong usage of O/R-Mappers- incorrect usage of the framework itself
too often results in unexpected performance and scalability problems within
these frameworks.Memory Leaks- GC does not prevent memory leaks, it is
important to release object references as soon as they are no longer
needed.Problematic 3rd Party Code/Components- check of every framework before

<p>Introduction: Arvid Norbergon thelibtorrent bloghas put together an excellent list
ofprinciples of high performance programs, obviously derived from hard won
experience programming on bittorrent:Two fundamental causes of performance
problems:Memory Latency. A big performance problem on modern computers is the
latency of SDRAM. The CPU waits idle for a read from memory to come
back.Context Switching. When a CPU switches context "the memory it will access
is most likely unrelated to the memory the previous context was accessing.
This often results in significant eviction of the previous cache, and requires
the switched-to context to load much of its data from RAM, which is
slow."Rules to help balance the forces of evil:Batch work. Avoid context
switching by batching work. For example, there are vector versions of system
calls like writev() and readv() that operate on more than one item per call.
An implication is that you want to merge as many writes as possible.Avoid
Magic Numbers. They don't scale.</p><p>5 0.75411594 <a title="701-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-06-Paper%3A_Memory_Barriers%3A_a_Hardware_View_for_Software_Hackers.html">1471 high scalability-2013-06-06-Paper: Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's not often you get so enthusiastic a recommendation for a paper as Sergio
Bossa gives Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers: If you only
want to read one piece about CPUs architecture, cache coherency and memory
barriers, make it this one.It is a clear and well written article. It even has
a quiz. What's it about?So what possessed CPU designers to cause them to
inﬂict memory barriers on poor unsuspecting SMP software designers?In short,
because reordering memory references allows much better performance, and so
memory barriers are needed to force ordering in things like synchronization
primitives whose correct operation depends on ordered memory
references.Getting a more detailed answer to this question requires a good
understanding of how CPU caches work, and especially what is required to make
caches really work well. The following sections:present the structure of a
cache,describe how cache-coherency protocols ensure that CPUs agree on the

<p>Introduction: Recently, I was working on a project that was coming to a close. It was
related to optimizing a database using a Java based in-memory cache to reduce
the load. The application had to process up to a million objects per day and
was characterized by its heavy use of memory and the high number of read,
write and update operations. These operations were found to be the most
costly, which meant that optimization efforts were concentrated here.The
project had already achieved impressive performance increases, but one
question remained unanswered - would changing the JVM increase
performance?Read more at:http://bigdatamatters.com/bigdatamatters/2009/08/jvm-

<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000
or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is
estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High
Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as
uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.This post focuses on a
customer's backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a
dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA
features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the
challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services
and annual support?Read more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>5 0.78065884 <a title="701-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-22-The_high_scalability_community.html">220 high scalability-2008-01-22-The high scalability community</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,First of all; thanks for a creating a GREAT resource on high scalability
architecture. For us building high scalability solutions from the west coast
of (tiny) Norway good input on the subject isn't always abundant.Which leads
me to my next question; Are there any events or conferences on high
scalability / SaaS in the US or internationally that any of you would
recommend architects or data center managers to attend?</p><p>6 0.77233124 <a title="701-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-An_Open_Source_Web_Solution_-_Lighttpd_Web_Server_and_Chip_Multithreading_Technology__.html">452 high scalability-2008-12-01-An Open Source Web Solution - Lighttpd Web Server and Chip Multithreading Technology  </a></p>

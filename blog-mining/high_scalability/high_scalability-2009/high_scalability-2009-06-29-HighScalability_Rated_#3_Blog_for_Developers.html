eventually your IO system will be a bottleneck. [A] promising but more complex

<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: In a People of ACM interview withSanjay Ghemawat, a Google Fellow in the
Systems Infrastructure Group (MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, GFS, etc), talks
about a few interesting aspects of Google's culture.What Made Google
GoogleProgress is a modern idea. The conviction that future can be changed for
the better through individual advancement and action has over hundreds of
years driven an exponential growth in the technome.What drives progress?
Challenges. Individuals finding and defeating a challenge. There's usually
something someone wants to do so badly that they put in the effort, the
thought, and the money into solving all the problems. The results are often
something new and amazing.And so it was for Google:The main motivation behind
the development of much of Google's infrastructure was the challenge of
keeping up with ever-growing data sets. For example, at the same time Google's
web search was gaining usage very quickly, we were also scaling up the size of
our index dramatically a</p><p>5 0.61650717 <a title="642-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-12-Google%2B_is_Built_Using_Tools_You_Can_Use_Too%3A_Closure%2C_Java_Servlets%2C_JavaScript%2C_BigTable%2C_Colossus%2C_Quick_Turnaround.html">1078 high scalability-2011-07-12-Google+ is Built Using Tools You Can Use Too: Closure, Java Servlets, JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his
picture), in I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything,
reveals the stack used for building Google+:Our stack is pretty standard fare
for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and
JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-
source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and
template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to
maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on
hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates
server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the
JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make
it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on
stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily
most people don't run int</p><p>6 0.61644644 <a title="642-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-12-Strategy%3A_Limit_The_New%2C_Not_The_Old.html">363 high scalability-2008-08-12-Strategy: Limit The New, Not The Old</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey we're moving up in the world, jumping from 19th place to 3rd place. In
case you aren't sure what I'm talking about, Jurgen Appelo goes through this
massive effort ofranking blogsaccording to Google PageRank, Technorati
Authority, Alexa Rank, Google links, and Twitter Grader Rank.Through some
obviously mistaken calculations HighScalability comes out #3. Given all the
superb competition I'm not exactly sure how that can be. Well, thanks for all
the excellent people who contribute and all the even more excellent people
that read. Now at least I have something worthy to put on my tombstone :-)</p><p>2 0.77855283 <a title="642-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP.html">921 high scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In this post i wanted to spend sometime on the CAP theorem and clarify some of
the confusion that i often see when people associate CAP with scalability

alternative approachesYou can read the full articlehere</p><p>3 0.66354817 <a title="642-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-01-Moving_Beyond_End-to-End_Path_Information_to_Optimize_CDN_Performance.html">712 high scalability-2009-10-01-Moving Beyond End-to-End Path Information to Optimize CDN Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,
we analyze latencies measured</p><p>4 0.63598549 <a title="642-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-12-The_Rise_of_the_Virtual_Cellular_Machines.html">826 high scalability-2010-05-12-The Rise of the Virtual Cellular Machines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

<p>Introduction: RAMCube is a datacenter oriented design for RAM-based key-value store that
supports thousands or tens of thousands of servers to offer up to hundreds of
terabytes of RAM storage. Here's thePDF Paper describing the system and here's
avideo of the presentationgiven atHotCloud.The big idea is: RAMCube exploits
the proximity of a BCube network to construct a symmetric MultiRing structure,
restricting all failure detection and recovery trafﬁc within a one-hop
neighborhood, which addresses problems including false failure detection and
recovery trafﬁc congestion. In addition, RAMCube leverages BCube's multiple
paths between any pairs of servers to handle switch failures.A few notes:75%
of Facebook data is stored in memcache.RAM is 1000 time faster than diskRAM is
used in caches, but this increases application complexity as applications are
responsible for cache consistency.Under a high work load a 1% cache miss rate
can lead to a 10x performance penalty.So store data directly in RAM instead</p><p>6 0.61152613 <a title="642-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-15-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_Oct_15_2009_.html">722 high scalability-2009-10-15-Hot Scalability Links for Oct 15 2009 </a></p>

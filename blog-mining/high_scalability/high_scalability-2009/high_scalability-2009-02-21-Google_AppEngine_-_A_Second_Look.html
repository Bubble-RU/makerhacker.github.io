<p>Introduction: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as
a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. --
CorinthiansWith this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs.I
like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them
just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.-- Sylvain onGoogle GroupsThe
dream is dead. Google App Engine's boldpay for what you usedream dies as it
leaves childish things behind and becomes areal product.Pricing will change.
Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will
change. But Google App Engine will survive. Google isshutting downmany of
itsprojects. GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank
for it surving the more wood behindmore deadly arrows push? Without a radical
and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote

<p>Introduction: Update 3: ReadWriteWeb saysGoogle App Engine Announces New Pricing Plans,
APIs, Open Access. Pricing is specified but I'm not sure what to make of it
yet. An image manipulation library is added (thus the need to pay for more CPU
:-) and memcached support has been added. Memcached will help resolve the
can't write for every read problem that pops up when keeping counters.Update
2: onGWT.com threw a GAE load party and a lot of people came. The results
atLoad test : Google App Engine = 1, Community = 0. GAE handled a peak of 35
requests/second and a sustained 10 requests/second. Some think performance was
good, others not so good. My GMT watch broke and I was late to arrive. Maybe
next time. Also added a few new design rules from the post.Update: Added a few
new rules gleaned from theGAE Meetup: Design By Explicit Cost Model and Puts
are Precious.How do you structure your database using a distributed hash table

ourmassive multi-core futureby creating a shared nothing infrastructure based
firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU
services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage:
email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps. A shared nothing
request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures
must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google
is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy

<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling
65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate
problemBuddyPokeco-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution
at Wednesday'sFacebook Meetup. Slides for the complete talk arehere. For those
not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets
users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line
avatars.In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application.
It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play
mechanics, viral loops, and creative monetization strategies are all part of
if its everyday conceptualization. It mashes together different technologies,
not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way, but in a smart way that gets the
most bang for the buck. Part of it runs on Facebook servers (free). Part of it
runs on flash in a browser (free). Part of it runs on a storage cloud (higher
cost)</p><p>6 0.78543997 <a title="517-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-05-Strategy%3A_Planning_for_a_Power_Outage_Google_Style.html">789 high scalability-2010-03-05-Strategy: Planning for a Power Outage Google Style</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>4 0.95332694 <a title="517-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-13-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_13%2C_2013.html">1516 high scalability-2013-09-13-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 13, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look
around their documentation and seeing what stands out for me. It's not the
much speculatedsuper cluster VM. AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and
structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran awebsite out of S3with a
splash ofHerokuthrown in as a chaser.The idea is clearly to take advantage of
ourmassive multi-core futureby creating a shared nothing infrastructure based
firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU
services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage:
email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps. A shared nothing
request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures
must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google
is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy
creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build on. Now they

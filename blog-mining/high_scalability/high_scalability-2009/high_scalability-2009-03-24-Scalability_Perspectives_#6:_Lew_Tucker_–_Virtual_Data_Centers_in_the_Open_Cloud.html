<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are

<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage
of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with
CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable
solution that</p><p>6 0.18859386 <a title="547-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-14-Implementing_the_Lustre_File_System_with_Sun_Storage%3A_High_Performance_Storage_for_High_Performance_Computing.html">411 high scalability-2008-10-14-Implementing the Lustre File System with Sun Storage: High Performance Storage for High Performance Computing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the
Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that
provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It
also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke
about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week - here is the summary
of that presentation.ďťżhttp://gojko.net/2010/01/25/designing-applications-for-

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Lew TuckerLew Tucker is the Vice President and CTO of Sun

<p>Introduction: Searching around the HS website I noticed that there are no articles regarding
db2, which has an express edition, free of charge and from what I know there
aren't any restrictions.Being a powerful database system I thought it could
make be an alternative to MySQL, PostgreSQL databases.Here is the IBM
statement:"DB2 Express Edition for Community (DB2 Express-C) is a no charge
data server for use in development and deployment. DB2 Express-C supports a
full range of APIs, drivers, and interfaces for application development
including PHP, C/C++, and .NET. In addition, DB2 Express-C V9 contains
advanced XML features. DB2 Express-C provides ISVs an ideal starting database
server for Web, enterprise, and eBusiness applications.This IBM Redbook
provides fundamentals of DB2 application development with DB2 Express-C. It
covers the DB2 Express-C installation and configuration for application
development and skills and techniques for building DB2 applications with XML,
PHP, C/C++, Java, and .NET.</p><p>5 0.71897876 <a title="547-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-31-Paper%3A_Everything_You_Always_Wanted_to_Know_About_Synchronization_but_Were_Afraid_to_Ask.html">1541 high scalability-2013-10-31-Paper: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but Were Afraid to Ask</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly
speaking,</p><p>6 0.64541143 <a title="547-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-24-11_Secrets_of_a_Cloud_Scale_Consultant_That_They_Dont%27_Want_You_to_Know.html">428 high scalability-2008-10-24-11 Secrets of a Cloud Scale Consultant That They Dont' Want You to Know</a></p>

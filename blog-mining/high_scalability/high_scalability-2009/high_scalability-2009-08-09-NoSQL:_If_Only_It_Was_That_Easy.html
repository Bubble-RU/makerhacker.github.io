<p>Introduction: Complex applications coordinating work across a lot of machines often need a highly performing fault tolerant message layer. Though a blast to write, it's probably a better use of your time to use an off the shelf solution. And that's where  Spread  comes in. Flickr, for example, uses Spread to create real-time event feeds from their web server logs. What exactly is Spread?
   
 From the  Spread  website:
    Spread is an open source toolkit that provides a high performance messaging service that is resilient to faults across local and wide area networks. Spread functions as a unified message bus for distributed applications, and provides highly tuned application-level multicast, group communication, and point to point support. Spread services range from reliable messaging to fully ordered messages with delivery guarantees.  Spread can be used in many distributed applications that require high reliability, high performance, and robust communication among various subsets of members.

<p>Introduction: Kevin Clark, director of IT operations for Lucasfilm, discusses how their data center works:   * Linux-based platform, SUSE (looking to change), and a lot of proprietary open source applications for content creation.   * 4,500-processor render farm in the datacenter. Workstations are used off hours.    * Developed their own proprietary scheduler to schedule their 5,500 available processors.   * Render nodes, the blade racks (from Verari), run dual-core dual Opteron chips with 32GB of memory on board, but are expanding those to quad-core. Are an AMD shop.   * 400TB of storage online for production.   * Every night they write out 10-20TB of new data on a render. A project will use up to a hundred-plus terabytes of storage.   * Incremental backups are a challenge because the data changes up to 50 percent over a week.   * NetApps used for storage. They like the global namespace in the virtual file system.   * Foundry Networks architecture shop.

<p>Introduction: Update: Facebook pulls a Microsoft and embraces and extends by opening their platform to other social sites like Bebo. Very smart and unexpected. More info at  Facebook to let other sites access platform code .      This month's regular Facebook   Meetup   was held at Google and the topic of the day was   OpenSocial  . For those of you with real lives, OpenSocial "provides a common set of APIs for social applications across multiple websites." Over 200 excited people, hoping to do very exciting things, and dreaming of making an exciting pile of money, watched an OpenSocial presentation put on by a couple of appropriately knowledgeable evangelists. I could feel my social graph being more successfully monetized with each passing minute.      Normally the meetings are much smaller, but Google puts on a very nice spread, so I think people may have showed up to dine :-) Or they could have showed up to learn why and how they should code to the new uber social API.

<p>Introduction: In this  blog post  BJ Clark overviews the available key-value stores that aren't SQL based. On some projects he yields interesting experiences. Make sure to check out the comments as well.  The post has spread throughout social tiny text services so there is a chance you've already read it, but still worthwhile to put here.</p><p>3 0.5294109 <a title="677-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-20-Strategy%3A_Send_XHR_Request_on_Lost_Focus_Instead_of_For_Every_Character.html">127 high scalability-2007-10-20-Strategy: Send XHR Request on Lost Focus Instead of For Every Character</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Stewart shared this useful Ajax related scalability strategy:     We avoided XMLHttpRequests for individual keystrokes, choosing to go back to the server only when a field lost focus. Google can afford all the servers to handle the load for that, but we didn't want to.      Do you have a scalability strategy to share? Then   share it!  .</p><p>4 0.47109306 <a title="677-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-20-Strategy%3A_Consider_When_a_Service_Starts_Billing_in_Your_Algorithm_Cost.html">862 high scalability-2010-07-20-Strategy: Consider When a Service Starts Billing in Your Algorithm Cost</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At Monday's  Cloud Computing Meetup ,  Paco Nathan  gave an excellent   Getting Started on Hadoop   talk ( slides ). I found one of Paco's strategies particularly interesting: consider when a service starts charging in cost calculations. Depending on your use case it may be cheaper to go with a more expensive service that charges only for work accomplished rather than charging for both work + startup time.
 
The example is comparing the cost of running Hadoop on AWS yourself versus using Amazon's prepackaged Hadoop service,  Elastic MapReduce  (EMR). The thought may have gone through your mind as it did mine that it doesn't necessarily make sense to use Amazon's Hadoop service. Why pay a premium for EMR when Hadoop will run directly on AWS?
 
One reason is that Amazon has made significant changes to Hadoop to make it run more efficiently and easily on AWS. The other more surprising reason is cost.
 
When starting a 500 node Hadoop cluster, for example, you have to wait for all the node</p><p>5 0.46801418 <a title="677-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-05-Product%3A_HAProxy_-_The_Reliable%2C_High_Performance_TCP-HTTP_Load_Balancer.html">509 high scalability-2009-02-05-Product: HAProxy - The Reliable, High Performance TCP-HTTP Load Balancer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Load Balancing in Amazon EC2 with HAProxy.  Grig Gheorghiu writes a nice post  on HAProxy functionality and configuration: Emulating virtual servers, Logging, SSL, Load balancing algorithms, Session persistence with cookies, Server health checks, etc.  Adapted From the website:    HAProxy  is a free, very fast and reliable solution offering high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It is particularly suited for web sites crawling under very high loads while needing persistence or Layer7 processing. Supporting tens of thousands of connections is clearly realistic with todays hardware. Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing architectures very easy and riskless, while still offering the possibility not to expose fragile web servers to the Net.     
 
 Currently, two major versions are supported : * version 1.1 - maintains critical sites online since 200 The most stable and reliable, has reached years of uptime.

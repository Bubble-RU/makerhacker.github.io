<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>3 0.2363247 <a title="634-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Product%3A_Project_Voldemort_-_A_Distributed_Database.html">651 high scalability-2009-07-02-Product: Project Voldemort - A Distributed Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Presentation from theNoSQL conference:slides,video 1,video 2.Project
Voldemort is an open source implementation of the basic parts ofDynamo
(Amazon's Highly Available Key-value Store)distributed key-value storage
system. LinkedIn is using it in their production environment for "certain
high-scalability storage problems where simple functional partitioning is not
sufficient."From their website:Data is automatically replicated over multiple
servers.Data is automatically partitioned so each server contains only a
subset of the total dataServer failure is handled transparentlyPluggable
serialization is supported to allow rich keys and values including lists and
tuples with named fields, as well as to integrate with common serialization
frameworks like Protocol Buffers, Thrift, and Java SerializationData items are
versioned to maximize data integrity in failure scenarios without compromising
availability of the systemEach node is independent of other nodes with no
central point of fa</p><p>4 0.16474921 <a title="634-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-05-Anti-RDBMS%3A_A_list_of_distributed_key-value_stores.html">670 high scalability-2009-08-05-Anti-RDBMS: A list of distributed key-value stores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 8:Introducing MongoDB byEliot Horowit. Update 7: The Future of Scalable
Databases by Robin Mathew.Update 6:NoSQL : If Only it Was that Easy. BJ Clark
lays down the law on which databases are scalable: Tokyo - NO, Redis - NO,
Voldemort - YES, MongoDB - Not Yet, Cassandra - Probably, Amazon S3 - YES * 2,
MySQL - NO.The real thing to point out is that if you are being held back from
making something super awesome because you can't choose a database, you are
doing it wrong.Update 5:Exciting stuff happening in Japan at this Key-Value
Storage meeting in Tokyo. Presentations on Groonga, Senna, Lux IO, Tokyo-
Cabinet, Tx, repcached, Kai, Cagra, kumofs, ROMA, and Flare.Update 4:NoSQL and
the Relational Model: don't throw the baby out with the bathwaterby Matthew
Willson.So my key point is, this kind of modelling is WORTH DOING, regardless
of which database tool you end up using for physical storage.Update 3:Choosing
a non-relational database; why we migrated from MySQL to MongoDB. An

<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source.
There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity:
from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-
value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there's Riak, Tokyo Cabinet,
Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL
products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft
Windows. I'm going to outline what's available now and briefly touch on some
opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.You

<p>Introduction: Discois an open-source implementation of the MapReduce framework for
distributed computing. It was started atNokia Research Centeras a lightweight
framework for rapid scripting of distributed data processing tasks. The Disco
core is written in Erlang. The MapReduce jobs in Disco are natively described
as Python programs, which makes it possible to express complex algorithmic and
data processing tasks often only in tens of lines of code.</p><p>3 0.62087154 <a title="634-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-03-Building_a_Data_Intensive_Web_Application_with_Cloudera%2C_Hadoop%2C_Hive%2C_Pig%2C_and_EC2.html">669 high scalability-2009-08-03-Building a Data Intensive Web Application with Cloudera, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, and EC2</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Queuing work forprocessing in the backgroundis a time testedscalability
strategy. Queuing also happens to be one of those much needed tools where it
easy enough to forge for your own that we see a lot of different versions
made.Resque is GitHub'stake on a job queue and they've used it to process
million and millions of jobs so far.What is Resque?Redis-backedlibrary for
creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and
processing them later. Background jobs can be any Ruby class or module that
responds to perform. Your existing classes can easily be converted to
background jobs or you can create new classes specifically to do work. Or, you
can do both.GitHub tried and considered many other systems: SQS, Starling,
ActiveMessaging, BackgroundJob, DelayedJob, beanstalkd, AMQP,  and Kestrel,
but found them all wanting in one way are another. The latency for SQS was too
high. Others didn't make full use of Ruby. Others still had a lot of overhead.

<p>Introduction: The need for IT consolidation is most evident in two types of organizations.
In the first group, IT grew organically with business over the decades, and
survived changes of strategy, management, staff and vendor orientation. The
second group of businesses capital groups are characterized by rapid growth
through acquisitions (followed by attempts to integrate radically different IT
environments). In both groups, their IT infrastructures have typically been
pieced together over the past 20 (or more) years.ďťżRead more

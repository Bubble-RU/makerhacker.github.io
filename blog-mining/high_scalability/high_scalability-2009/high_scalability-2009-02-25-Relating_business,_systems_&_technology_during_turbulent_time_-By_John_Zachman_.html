<p>Introduction: One important high availability principle is concurrency control.  The idea is to allow only that much traffic through to your system which your system can handle successfully.  For example: if your system is certified to handle a concurrency of 100 then the 101st request should either timeout, be asked to try later  or wait until one of the previous 100 requests finish.  The 101st request should not be allowed to negatively impact the experience of the other 100 users.  Only the 101st request should be impacted.

<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week – here is the summary of that presentation.﻿

<p>Introduction: Pinterest co-founder Paul Sciarra  shared a bit about their stack  on Quora:
  
 Python + heavily-modified Django at the application layer 
 Tornado and (very selectively) node.js as web-servers.   
 Memcached and membase / redis for object- and logical-caching, respectively.   
 RabbitMQ as a message queue.   
 Nginx, HAproxy and Varnish for static-delivery and load-balancing. 
 Persistent data storage using MySQL.   
 MrJob on EMR for map-reduce. 
 Git. 
  
Alex Popescu has  created a cool diagram  of the setup and provided some thoughtful analysis as well.</p><p>4 0.68868685 <a title="523-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise.html">287 high scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose limits (  GAE Quotas  ,   Fotolog  ,   Facebook  ) as a means of protecting a website against service destroying   traffic spikes  . Twitter will reportedly   limit the number followers   to 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow Twitter to make some bank by   going freemium   and charging for adding more followers.     Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established ecosystem?      One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is, however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service.

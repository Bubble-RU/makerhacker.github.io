<p>Introduction: Hadoop is a distributed computing platform written in Java. It incorporates features similar to those of the   Google File System and of MapReduce to process vast amounts of data     "Hadoop is a Free Java software framework that supports data intensive distributed applications running on large clusters of commodity computers. It enables applications to easily scale out to thousands of nodes and petabytes of data" (Wikipedia)         * What platform does Hadoop run on?       * Java 1.5.x or higher, preferably from Sun       * Linux       * Windows for development       * Solaris</p><p>3 0.20452347 <a title="596-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-11-Yahoo%21_Distribution_of_Hadoop.html">627 high scalability-2009-06-11-Yahoo! Distribution of Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in the Apache Hadoop community have asked Yahoo! to publish the version of Apache Hadoop they test and deploy across their large Hadoop clusters. As a service to the Hadoop community, Yahoo is releasing the Yahoo! Distribution of Hadoop -- a source code distribution that is based entirely on code found in the Apache Hadoop project.   This source distribution includes code patches that they have added to improve the stability and performance of their clusters. In all cases, these patches have already been contributed back to Apache, but they may not yet be available in an Apache release of Hadoop.

<p>Introduction: This post about using Hive and Hadoop for analytics comes straight from Facebook engineers.  Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis and business intelligence applications used by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook products are also based on analytics.   These products range from simple reporting applications like Insights for the Facebook Ad Network, to more advanced kind such as Facebook's Lexicon product.   As a result a flexible infrastructure that caters to the needs of these diverse applications and users and that also scales up in a cost effective manner with the ever increasing amounts of data being generated on Facebook, is critical. Hive and Hadoop are the technologies that we have used to address these requirements at Facebook.

<p>Introduction: Recently, Google announced Google App Engine, another announcement in the rapidly growing world of cloud computing. This brings up some very serious questions:      1. If we want to take advantage of one of the clouds, are we doomed to be locked-in for life?    2. Must we re-write our existing applications to use the cloud?    3. Do we need to learn a brand new technology or language for the cloud?      This post presents a pattern that will enable us to abstract our application code from the underlying cloud provider infrastructure. This will enable us to easily migrate our EXISTING applications to cloud based environment thus avoiding the need for a complete re-write.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.95589012 <a title="596-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-11-Facebook%2C_Hadoop%2C_and_Hive.html">596 high scalability-2009-05-11-Facebook, Hadoop, and Hive</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A bit over a month ago Amazon experienced its infamous AWS outage in the US East Region. As a cloud evangelist, I was intrigued by the history of the outage as it occurred. There were great posts during and after the outage from those who went down. But more interestingly for me as architect were the detailed posts of those who managed to survive the outage relatively unharmed, such as  SimpleGeo ,  Netflix , SmugMug ,  SmugMug’s CTO ,  Twilio ,  Bizo  and others.
 
Reading through the experience of others, I tried to summarize the  patterns, principles and best practices  that emerged from these posts, as I believe we can learn a lot from them on how to design our business applications to truly leverage on the benefits that the cloud offers in high availability and scalability.
 
The main principles, patterns and best practices are:
  
 Design for failure 
 Stateless and autonomous services 
 Redundant hot copies spread across zones 
 Spread across several public cloud vendors and/or</p><p>5 0.94869244 <a title="596-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-30-Scalability_Perspectives_%235%3A_Werner_Vogels_%E2%80%93_The_Amazon_Technology_Platform.html">480 high scalability-2008-12-30-Scalability Perspectives #5: Werner Vogels – The Amazon Technology Platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives  is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.     Werner Vogels    Dr. Werner Vogels is Vice President & Chief Technology Officer at Amazon.com where he is responsible for driving the company’s technology vision, which is to continuously enhance the innovation on behalf of Amazon’s customers at a global scale. Prior to joining Amazon, he worked as a researcher at Cornell University where he was a principal investigator in several research projects that target the scalability and robustness of mission-critical enterprise computing systems. He is regarded as one of the world's top experts on ultra-scalable systems and he uses his weblog to educate the community about issues such as eventual consistency.

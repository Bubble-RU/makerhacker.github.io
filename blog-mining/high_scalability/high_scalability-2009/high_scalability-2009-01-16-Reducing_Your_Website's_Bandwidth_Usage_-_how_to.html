<p>Introduction: Jurgen Appelo of Noop.nl asked for nominations for top blogs and then performed a sophisticated weighting of their popularity based on page range, trust authority, Alexa rank, Google hits, and number of comments. When all the results poured out of the blender HighScalability was ranked 16th. Not bad! Joel on Software was number one, of course. The next few were: 2) Coding Horror by Jeff Atwood 3) Seth's Blog by Seth Godin and 4) Paul Graham: Essays Paul Graham. All excellent blogs. Very cool.</p><p>5 0.081654057 <a title="494-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-10-When_optimizing_-_don%27t_forget_the_Java_Virtual_Machine_%28JVM%29_.html">701 high scalability-2009-09-10-When optimizing - don't forget the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently, I was working on a project that was coming to a close. It was related to optimizing a database using a Java based in-memory cache to reduce the load. The application had to process up to a million objects per day and was characterized by its heavy use of memory and the high number of read, write and update operations. These operations were found to be the most costly, which meant that optimization efforts were concentrated here.  The project had already achieved impressive performance increases, but one question remained unanswered - would changing the JVM increase performance?

<p>Introduction: Low Cost, High Performance,Â Strong Security: Pick Any Three Â byÂ Chris Palmer has a funny and informative presentation where the main message is:  reduce the size and frequency of networkÂ communications, which will make your pages load faster, which will improve performance enough that you can use HTTPS all the time, which will make you safe and secure on-line, which is a good thing .
  The benefits of HTTPS for security are overwhelming, but people are afraid of the performance hit. The argument is successfully made that the overhead of HTTPS is low enough that you can afford the cost if you do some basic optimization. Reducing the number of HTTP requests is a good source of low hanging fruit.
   From the Yahoo UI Blog :
  
 Reducing the number of HTTP requests hasÂ the biggest impact on reducing response timeÂ and is often the easiest performanceÂ improvement to make.

    From the Experience of Gmail :Â 
  
 â€¦we found that there were betweenÂ fourteen and twenty-four HTTP requestsÂ require</p><p>4 0.51050037 <a title="494-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-30-Strategy%3A_Get_Servers_for_Free_and_Make_Users_Happy_by_Turning_on_Compression.html">1254 high scalability-2012-05-30-Strategy: Get Servers for Free and Make Users Happy by Turning on Compression</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edward Capriolo has a really interesting article on his dramatic performance expanding experience ofÂ   turning on compression for Cassandra   .   The idea: 
  
  Enabling compression shrunk 71GB of data down to Â 31GB, which caused more data to fit in RAM, which reduced disk IO to nearly nothing.  
  Compression means more data can be stored, which is like buying more machines without having to spend more money.  
  Compression means serving more data out of RAM, which means clients are happier because of the performance improvements.  
  The cost is higher CPU usage to perform the encrypt/decrypt. But disk IO is orders of magnitude slower than decompression and most servers have CPU to burn.  
  
 Edward's article is well written, has the specifics on how to turn on compression for Cassandra, pretty graphs, and lots more details.</p><p>5 0.49636137 <a title="494-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable_Web_Architectures_and_Application_State.html">656 high scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable Web Architectures and Application State</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From their website:   Condor  is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial or parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user upon completion.  While providing functionality similar to that of a more traditional batch queueing system, Condor's novel architecture allows it to succeed in areas where traditional scheduling systems fail. Condor can be used to manage a cluster of dedicated compute nodes (such as a "Beowulf" cluster). In addition, unique mechanisms enable Condor to effectively harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop workstations. For instance, Condor can be configured to only use desktop machines where the keyboard</p><p>5 0.49747062 <a title="494-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-10-Russ%E2%80%99_10_Ingredient_Recipe_for_Making_1_Million_TPS_on_%245K_Hardware.html">1319 high scalability-2012-09-10-Russâ€™ 10 Ingredient Recipe for Making 1 Million TPS on $5K Hardware</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My name is  Russell Sullivan , I am the author of AlchemyDB: a highly flexible NoSQL/SQL/DocumentStore/GraphDB-datastore built on top of redis. I have spent the last several years trying to find a way to sanely house multiple datastore-genres under one roof while (almost paradoxically) pushing performance to its limits.    I recently joined the NoSQL company    Aerospike    (formerly Citrusleaf) with the goal of incrementally grafting AlchemyDBâ€™s flexible data-modeling capabilities onto Aerospikeâ€™s high-velocity horizontally-scalable key-value data-fabric. We recently completed a peak-performance    TPS optimization project   : starting at 200K TPS, pushing to the recent community edition launch at 500K TPS, and finally arriving at our 2012 goal:    1M TPS on $5K hardware   .    Getting to one million over-the-wire client-server database-requests per-second on a single machine costing $5K is a balance between trimming overhead on many axes and using a shared nothing architecture to   i</p><p>6 0.48906153 <a title="494-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-20-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_20%2C_2011.html">1045 high scalability-2011-05-20-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 20, 2011</a></p>

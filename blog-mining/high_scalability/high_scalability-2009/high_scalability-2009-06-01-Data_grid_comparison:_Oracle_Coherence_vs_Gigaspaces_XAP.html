based applications are partitioned horizontally into self-sufficient units.
This leads to almost linear scalability of stateful, high-performance

<p>Introduction: Forrester released their new wave report:  The Forrester Waveâ&bdquo;˘: Elastic
Caching Platforms, Q2 2010where they listed GigaSpaces, IBM, Oracle, and
Terracotta as leading vendors in the field. In this post I'd like to take some
time to explain what some of these terms mean, and why they're important to
you. I'll start with a definition of Elastic Data Grid (Elastic Caching), how
it is different then other caching and NoSQL alternatives, and more
importantly -- I'll illustrate how it works through some real code
examples.You can read the full storyhere.</p><p>6 0.54415888 <a title="613-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling_Social_Ecommerce_Architecture_Case_study.html">1016 high scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling Social Ecommerce Architecture Case study</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The ever amazingslime moldis not the only way to solve complex compute
problems without performing calculations. There is another:soap film.
Unfortunately for soap film it isn't nearly as photogenic as slime mold, all
we get are boring looking pictures, but the underlying idea is still
fascinating and ten times less spooky.As a quick introduction we'll lean on
Long Ouyang, who has really straightforward  explanation of how soap film
works inApproaching P=NP: Can Soap Bubbles Solve The Steiner Tree Problem In
Polynomial.It's computers, so playing the role of the motivating graph problem
we have theSteiner tree problem, which Ouyang explains as:Find the minimum
spanning tree for a bunch of vertices, given that you can add additional
points.Soap helps solve this problem because:Soap, in water, acts a
surfactant, which decreases the surface tension in water.This acts to minimize
the surface energy of the liquid.This should minimize surface area (graph
weight), and solve the problem.Dip two</p><p>4 0.35025728 <a title="613-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-Scaling_your_cookie_recipes.html">390 high scalability-2008-09-23-Scaling your cookie recipes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word
alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and
the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world
is:the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more
dough for many more cookies. It’s the difference between making enough dough
in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.Hey, pretty close to
the website notion. Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be
tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed
to do (quoted from the article):Be Patient- When making large batches of
cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.Use
Fresh Ingredients- This is always an important thing to keep in mind.Don’t use
as much leavening- When you’re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember
to scale down the amount of baking powder that you use.Watch the spice- As a

<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund put together an excellent list of four general scalability
patterns and four subpatterns in his postScalability patterns and an
interesting story:Load distribution- Spread the system load across multiple
processing unitsLoad balancing / load sharing- Spreading the load across many
components with equal properties for handling the requestPartitioning-
Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to
a component that owns that data specificVertical partitioning- Spreading the
load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions
being handled by different processing unitsHorizontal partitioning- Spreading
a single type of data element across many instances, according to some
partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation,
etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.Queuing and batch \- Achieve
efficiencies of scale by processing batches of data, usually because the

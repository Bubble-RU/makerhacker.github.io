<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's

face are hardly ever addressed. We would like to change that, so here is our

to sell your digital content as professionally printed products, like photo
books, magazines or canvases - straight from your own website. There is an
API, too.Printcloud is the system that powers the print button. It exists in
the cloud only, growing when needed and becoming smaller if it can. The system
takes in print orders, magically transforms tough data into print-ready files
and routes the orders to the production facility that is closest to the
intended recipient.To preserve the environment, Peecho's philosophy is to

<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDBis a great follow up
to the idea inHow SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMSthat more programming is the
price paid for performance in SimpleDB. It shows how much work and
infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of
SimpleDB.Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you
want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests.
Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to
parallelize. Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a
little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.Parallelization is the
approach taken by Haakon@AWS in his Java code example of how to get the most
out of SimpleDB. You can find the code atIndexing and Querying Amazon S3
Metadata with Amazon SimpleDB. We'll also consider how a back-end service
architecture built on Erlang may be a better fit with cloud computing.breakTwo

single batch request which in the example save $30/month.Use SQS Long Polling
to reduce extra polling requests, cutting down empty receives, which in the
example saves ~$600 in empty receive leakage costs.Choose the right search
technology choice to save costs in AWS by matching your activity pattern to
the technology. For a small application with constant load or a heavily
utilized search tier or seasonal loads Amazon Cloud Search looks like the cost
efficient play. Use Amazon CloudFront Price Class to minimize costs by
selecting the right Price Class for your audience to potentially reduce
delivery costs by excluding Amazon CloudFront's more expensive edge
locations.Optimize ElastiCache Cluster</p><p>6 0.77702397 <a title="674-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon_Architecture.html">96 high scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's been a well kept secret, but you may have heard Facebook will Buy Photo-
Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion. Just what is Facebook buying? Here's
a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave
on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the
"canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we
know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it
then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...  Instagram is a free photo
sharing and social networking service for your iPhone that has been an instant
success. Growing to14 million usersin just over a year (now 30 million users),
they reached 150 million photos in August while amassing several terabytes of

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post about how boring and repetitive HA and scalability
problems can be solved via Open Source so you can focus on the interesting
tasks. The post was written byMaarten Ectors, responsible for Cloud Strategy
andFrank Mueller, a Juju Core developer, at Ubuntu/Canonical.High-availability
and scalability are exciting in general but there are certain problems that
experts see over and over again. The list is long but examples are setting up
MySQL clustering, sharding Mongo, adding data nodes to a Hadoop cluster,
monitoring with Ganglia, building continuous deployment solutions, integrating
Memcached / Varnish / Nginx,â&euro;Ś Why are we reinventing the wheel?At Ubuntu we
made it our goal to have the community solve these repetitive and often boring
tasks. How often have you had to set-up MySQL replication and scale it? What
if the next time you just simply do:juju deploy mysqljuju deploy mysql mysql-

<p>Introduction: I've been interested in sharding concepts since first hearing the term "shard"
a few years back. My interest had been piqued earlier, the first time I read
about Google's original approach to distributed search. It was described as a
hashtable-like system in which independent physical machines play the role of
the buckets. More recently, I needed the capacity and performance of a Sharded
system, but did not find helpful libraries or toolkits which would assist with
the configuration for my language of preference these days, which is Python.
And, since I had a few weeks on my hands, I decided I would begin the work of
creating these tools.The result of my initial work the Pyshards project, a
still-incomplete python and MySQL based horizontal partitioning and sharding
toolkit. HighScalability.com readers will already know that horizontal
partitioning is a data segmenting pattern in which distinct groups of physical
row-based datasets are distributed across multiple partitions. When the

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Elastic Load Balancer and EC2 instance bandwidth.It turns out we are
limited by bandwidth and not by CPU. Solution:use DNS Round Robin for two to
three HighCPU medium instances.Update:The Skinny Straw: Cloud Computing's
Bottleneck and How to Address It.For cloud computing, bandwidth to and from
the cloud provider is a bottleneck. Solution:Evaluate application architecture
and consider application partitioning.I'm writing this post as a sort of
penance. My sin was getting involved in another mutli-threaded mess of a
program that was rife with strange pauses and unexpected errors. I really
should have known better. But when APIs choose to make callbacks from some
mystery thread pool it's hard to keep things straight. I eventually sobered up
and posted all events to a queue so I could make sure the program would work
correctly. Doh. I may never know why the .Net console output stopped working,
but I'll live with it.And that reminded me that I've been meaning to write a

<p>Introduction: An unstated assumption is that clouds are scalable. But are they? Stick
thousands upon thousands of machines together and there are a lot of potential
bottlenecks just waiting to choke off your scalability supply. And if the
cloud is scalable what are the chances that your application is really
linearly scalable? At 10 machines all may be well. Even at 50 machines the
seas look calm. But at 100, 200, or 500 machines all hell might break loose.
How do you know?You know through real life testing. These kinds of tests are
brutally hard and complicated. who wants to do all the incredibly precise and
difficult work of producing cloud scalability tests?GridDynamicshas stepped up
to the challenge and has just released theirCloud Performance Reports.The
report is quite detailed so I'll just cover what I found most interesting.

<p>Introduction: Joe Armstrong is a co-inventor ofErlang and general all around renaissance
software tinkerer as shown by his excellent work on writing aC Compiler and
his voluminous work on GitHub.Given the success of Erlang it's probably no
surprise that he wrote his thesis on the ground breaking ideas behind Erlang:
Making reliable distributed systems in the presence of software errors.Even if
you have yet to join the cult of Erlang the principles behind Erlang are
universal and well worth exploring for your own designs. Highly
recommended.Introduction:How can we program systems which behave in a
reasonable manner in the presence of software errors? This is the central
question that I hope to answer in this thesis. Large systems will probably
always be delivered containing a number of errors in the software,
nevertheless such systems are expected to behave in a reasonable manner.To
make a reliable system from faulty components places certain requirements on
the system. The requirements can be satisf</p><p>4 0.077043533 <a title="751-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-01-Guess_How_Many_Users_it_Takes_to_Kill_Your_Site%3F.html">614 high scalability-2009-06-01-Guess How Many Users it Takes to Kill Your Site?</a></p>

least that's the capacity planning strategy John Allspaw recommends (not
really, but I'm trying to make a point here) inThe Art of Capacity
Planning:Using production traffic to define your resources ceilings in a
controlled setting allows you to see firsthand what would happen when you run
out of capacity in a particular resource. Of course I'm not suggesting that
you run your site into the ground, but better to know what your real (not
simulated) loads are while you're watching, than find out the hard way. In

<p>Introduction: This post is byHasan Ceylan, an Open Source software enthusiast from
Istanbul.I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together
with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I
contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.Those were the days
our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and
applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot
of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we
can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml
descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to
use the curse called "XDoclet".On the other side, our company grew steadily,
our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and
ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew
considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of
money.

<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>5 0.57490337 <a title="751-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-19-Is_it_time_to_get_rid_of_the_Linux_OS_model_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1177 high scalability-2012-01-19-Is it time to get rid of the Linux OS model in the cloud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You program in a dynamic language, that runs on a JVM, that runs on a OS
designed40 years ago for a completely different purpose, that runs on
virtualized hardware. Does this make sense? We've talked about this idea
before inMachine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting The Cloud From Scratch, where the
vision is to treatcloud virtual hardware as a compiler target, and converting
high-level language source code directly into kernels that run on it.As new
technologies evolve the friction created by our old tool chains and
architecture models becomes ever more obvious. Take, for example, what
ateamatUCSD is releasing: aphase-change memory prototype  -a solid state
storage device that provides performance thousands of times faster than a
conventional hard drive and up to seven times faster than current state-of-
the-art solid-state drives (SSDs).However, PCM has access latencies several
times slower than DRAM.This technology has obvious mind blowing implications,
but an interesting not so obvious im</p><p>6 0.56488836 <a title="751-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-12-Paper%3A_Mind_the_Gap%3A_Reconnecting_Architecture_and_OS_Research.html">1039 high scalability-2011-05-12-Paper: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I was looking at the pingdom infrastructure matrix
(http://royal.pingdom.com/royalfiles/0702_infrastructure_matrix.pdf) and I saw
that no sites are using Postgresql, and then I searched through
highscalability.com and saw very few mentions of postgresql. Are there any
examples of high-traffic sites that use postgresql? Does anyone have any
experience with it? I'm having trouble finding good, recent studies of
postgres (and postgres compared w/ mysql) online.</p><p>4 0.65465319 <a title="751-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-09-GridwiseTech_revolutionizes_data_management.html">697 high scalability-2009-09-09-GridwiseTech revolutionizes data management</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech hasdeveloped AdHoc, an advanced framework for sharing
geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the
resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective.The premise of
AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access
to his or her resources without an IT administrator's help, and with high
security level of any exposed data or applications assured.It takes 3 easy
steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization,
add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any
organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join
forces for more efficient results.AdHoc was initially created for a consortium
of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical
partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to
provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the
administration of the</p><p>5 0.63755155 <a title="751-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-11-Linkedin_architecture.html">148 high scalability-2007-11-11-Linkedin architecture</a></p>

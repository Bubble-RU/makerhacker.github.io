<p>Introduction: f230ce3face848ff842452a614358356This a follow-up post to an earlier poston the
Scaling Rails Screencast Series byGregg Pollack, when there were only 13
screencasts, now there are 21. Eight more have been added on topics like load
testing and database scaling. This series is of surprisingly high quality.
While I didn't view every screencast, I sampled a large set and found them to
have solid content and high production values. In fact, how did they make
these things? The instructor moves around in a little box while the content
flows around him. A very cool effect. But that wouldn't matter if the content
didn't deliver, here's what's new:Episode #14 - Rack & MetalEpisode #15 - Load

<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: Jesse Robbins at O'Reily Radar has a nicepost on how spendinga little up front
time on figuring out how to scale your operations process saves money on ops
people and allows you to save time adding and upgrading servers. Adding,
monitoring, and upgrading servers can get so incredibly screwed up that a herd
of squirrels has to work overtime just to put out a release. Or it can be one
button simple from your automated build system out to your servers. This is
one area where "do the simplest thing that could possibly work" is a dumb idea
and Jesse does a good job capturing the advantages of doing it right.</p><p>6 0.054171983 <a title="530-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-01-Cheap_storage%3A_how_backblaze_takes_matters_in_hand.html">692 high scalability-2009-09-01-Cheap storage: how backblaze takes matters in hand</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thisposton www.ilovebonnie.net documents some impressive system performance
improvements by the addition ofSquid Cache(a caching proxy) andAPC
Cache(opcode cache for PHP).Apache is able to deliver roughly 700% more
requests per second with Squid when serving 1KB and 100KB images.Server load
is reduced using Squid because the server does not have to create a bunch of
Apache processes to handle the requests.APC Cache took a system that could
barely handle 10-20 requests per second to handling 50-60 requests per second.
A 400% increase.APC allowed the load times to remain under 5 seconds even with
200 concurrent threads slamming on the server.These two caches are easy to
setup and install and allow you to get a lot more performance out of them.The
post has an in-depth discussion and a number of supporting charts. The primary
point is how simple it can be to improve performance and scalability by adding
caching.</p><p>3 0.5458799 <a title="530-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-28-A_Practical_Guide_to_Varnish_-_Why_Varnish_Matters.html">996 high scalability-2011-02-28-A Practical Guide to Varnish - Why Varnish Matters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeff Sufrom Factual.What is Varnish?Varnishis an open
source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack
and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for
both static and dynamic content.One great thing about Varnish is that it can
improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.
If you haven't heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven't used it),
please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive,
but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish's more advanced
features, you'll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.Some
of the high profile companies using Varnish include: Twitter, Facebook, Heroku
and LinkedIn.Our Use CaseOne of Factual's first high profile projects was
Newsweek's "America's Best High Schools: The List". After realizing that we
had only a few weeks to increase our throughput by tenfold, we looked into a</p><p>4 0.5286234 <a title="530-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-22-Building_and_Scaling_a_Startup_on_Rails%3A_12_Things_We_Learned_the_Hard_Way.html">518 high scalability-2009-02-22-Building and Scaling a Startup on Rails: 12 Things We Learned the Hard Way</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Garry Tan, cofounder of Posterous, lists 12 lessons for scaling that apply to
more than just Rails.Use cloud storage for static files.Use HTTP Cache Control
to tell the browser what it can cache.Use Sphinx for text search.Use InnoDB
for more crash resistant and faster writes.Don't use textbook Rails
ActiveRecord objects. Use New Relic to find exactly what is slow in your
system.Use memcache later so you find your database bottlenecks now.Use
mongrel proctitle to find your slow queries. You are only as fast as your
slowest queries.Use asynchronous job queuing to do work in parallel.Use
monitoring so you'll know when your site went down and why.Learn by reading
the source code, fixing problems, and submitting them back to the
community.Use new plugins. Old plugins can't be trusted.Use new information.
Old information can't be trusted.</p><p>5 0.52820653 <a title="530-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-24-21_Quality_Screencasts_on_Scaling_Rails.html">886 high scalability-2010-08-24-21 Quality Screencasts on Scaling Rails</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Facebook made quite a splash when they released theirnative iOS app, not
because of their app per se, but because of their conclusion that theirbiggest
mistake was betting on HTML5, so they had to go native.As you might imagine
this was a bit like telling a Great White Shark that its bark is worse than
its bite.  Acommon refrainwas Facebook simply had made a bad HTML5 site, not
that HTML5 itself is bad, as plenty of other vendors have made slick well
performing mobile sites.An interesting and relevant conversation given the
rising butt kickery of mobile. But we were lacking details. Now we aren't. If
you were wondering just why Facebook ditched HTML5, Tobie Langel inPerf
Feedback - What's slowing down Mobile Facebook, lists out the reasons:Tooling
/ Developer APIs. Most importantly, the lack of tooling to track down memory
problems. Scrolling performance.Scrolling must be fast and smooth and full

<p>Introduction: Debugging complex problems is 90% persistence and 50% cool tools. Brendan
Gregg in10 Performance Wins tells a fascinating story of how a team at Joyent
solved some weird and challenging performance issues deep in the OS. It took
lots of effort,DTrace, Flame Graphs,USE Method, and writing custom tools when
necessary. Here's a quick summary of the solved cases:Monitoring. 1000x
improvement. An application blocked while paging anonymous memory back in. It
was also blocked during file system fsync() calls. The application was
misconfigured and sometimes briefly exceeded available memory, getting page
out.Riak. 2x improvement. The Erlang VM used half the CPU count it was
supposed to, so CPUs remained unused.  Fix was a configuration change.MySQL.
380x improvement. Reads were slow. Cause was correlated writes. Fix was to
tune the cache flush interval on the storage controller.Various. 2800x
improvement. Large systems calls to getvmusage() could take a few seconds.
Cause was a priority invers</p><p>5 0.55111569 <a title="530-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-20-8_Ways_Stardog_Made_its_Database_Insanely_Scalable.html">1582 high scalability-2014-01-20-8 Ways Stardog Made its Database Insanely Scalable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stardog makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can
be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a recent article
StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable,
improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now
handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It
can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. What did they do
that you can also do?Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data
structures. For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue.Use
ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid
synchronization.Batch LRU evictions in a single thread. Triggered by several
LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by
additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times.Move to
SHA1 for hashing URIs, bnodes, and literal values. Making hash collisions
nearly impossible enable significant s</p><p>6 0.51225263 <a title="530-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-23-Strategy%3A_Use_Linux_Taskset_to_Pin_Processes_or_Let_the_OS_Schedule_It%3F.html">1536 high scalability-2013-10-23-Strategy: Use Linux Taskset to Pin Processes or Let the OS Schedule It?</a></p>

like to write today about some learned lessons from the biggest player in the
high Scalable Web application. I will divide the lessons into 4 points:* Start

<p>Introduction: Jeremiah Peschka with a great a set ofNotes on Scalability, just in case you
do reach your wildest expectations of success:Build it to Break. Plan for the
fact that everything you make is going to break. Design in layers that are
independent and redundant.Everything is a Feature. Your application is a set
of features created by a series of conscious choices made by considering
trade-offs. Scale Out, Not Up. Purchasing more hardware is easier than coding
and managing horizontal resources. Buy More Storage. Large numbers of smaller,
faster drives have more IOPS than fewer, larger drives.You're Going to Do It
Wrong. Be prepared to iterate on your ideas. You will make mistakes.  Be
prepared to re-write code and to quickly move on to the next idea.Please read

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: SinceThe Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage was published we've a had
few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their
Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East
Region. Netlix shared theirLessons Learned from the AWS Outage as did Heroku
(How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage), Smug Mug (How SmugMug survived the
Amazonpocalypse), and SimpleGeo (How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS
Downtime). The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of
response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been
almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon
was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to
talk about the event itself.Lesson for crisis handlers: deep dive post-mortems

<p>Introduction: Please seeThe Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage for a new
improved list.So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage.
Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some
chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and
their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the
cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a
prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change
remains...cloudy.I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes
out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's
a resource you think should be added, just let me know.Amazon's Explanation of

<p>Introduction: Amazon has a very will written account of their 8/8/2011 downtime:Summary of
the Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon RDS Service Event in the EU West
Region. Power failed, backup generators failed to kick in, there weren't
enough resources for EBS volumes to recover, API servers where overwhelmed, a
DNS failure caused failovers to alternate availability zones to fail, a double
fault occurred as the power event interrupted the repair of a different bug.
All kind of typical stuff that just seems to happen.Considering the previous
outage, the big question for programmers is: what does this mean? What does it
mean for how systems should be structured? Have we learned something that
can't be unlearned?The Amazon post has lots of good insights into how EBS and
RDS work, plus lessons learned. The short of the problem is large + complex =
high probability of failure. The immediate fixes are adding more resources,
more redundancy, more isolation between components, more automation, reduce

<p>Introduction: Many enterprises' high-availability architecture is based on the assumption
that you can prevent failure from happening by putting all your critical data
in a centralized database, back it up with expensive storage, and replicate it
somehow between the sites. As I argued in one of my previous posts (Why
Existing Databases (RAC) are So Breakable!) many of those assumptions are
broken at their core, as storage is doomed to failure just like any other
device, expensive hardware doesn't make things any better and database
replication is often not enough.One of the main lessons that we can take from
the likes of Amazon and Google is that the right way to ensure continuous high
availability is by designing our system to cope with failure. We need to
assume that what we tend to think of as unthinkable will probably happen, as
that's the nature of failure. So rather than trying to prevent failures, we
need to build a system that will tolerate them.As we can learn from a recent
outage event in</p><p>6 0.59343082 <a title="559-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-28-Netflix%3A_Continually_Test_by_Failing_Servers_with_Chaos_Monkey.html">964 high scalability-2010-12-28-Netflix: Continually Test by Failing Servers with Chaos Monkey</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>5 0.83269495 <a title="559-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-07-Using_ThreadLocal_to_pass_context_information_around_in_web_applications.html">115 high scalability-2007-10-07-Using ThreadLocal to pass context information around in web applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread
pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is
tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal
variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user
id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the
code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to
pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought isclass ReferenceIdGenerator
{public static setReferenceId(String login) {threadLocal.set(login +
System.currentMillis());}public static String getReferenceId() {return
threadLocal.get();}private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =new
ThreadLocal();}class MySevlet {void service(.....) {HttpSession session =
request.getSession(false);String userId =
session.get("userId");ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId);try
{doSomething();}finally {ReferenceIdGenerator.remove();}}This method is also</p><p>6 0.82308555 <a title="559-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-25-Peter_Norvig%27s_9_Master_Steps_to_Improving_a_Program.html">1601 high scalability-2014-02-25-Peter Norvig's 9 Master Steps to Improving a Program</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Making Hadoop Run FasterOne of the challenges in processing data is that the
speed at which we can input data is quite often much faster than the speed at
which we can process it. This problem becomes even more pronounced in the
context of Big Data, where the volume of data keeps on growing, along with a
corresponding need for more insights, and thus the need for more complex
processing also increases.Batch Processing to the RescueHadoop was designed to
deal with this challenge in the following ways:1. Use a distributed file
system: This enables us to spread the load and grow our system as needed.2.
Optimize for write speed: To enable fast writes the Hadoop architecture was
designed so that writes are first logged, and then processed. This enables
fairly fast write speeds.3. Use batch processing (Map/Reduce) to balance the
speed for the data feeds with the processing speed.Batch Processing
ChallengesThe challenge with batch-processing is that it assumes that the
feeds come in bursts. I</p><p>3 0.15591437 <a title="669-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-15-Need_help_with_your_Hadoop_deployment%3F_This_company_may_help%21.html">415 high scalability-2008-10-15-Need help with your Hadoop deployment? This company may help!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A group of top Silicon Valley engineers (ex-Yahoo, Facebook, Google) have come
together to launch a new startup calledCloudera.Not yet launched, it intends
to help other companies adopt a promising software platform called
Hadoop.Hadoopis an open-source software project (written in Java) designed to
let developers write and run applications that process huge amounts of data.
While it could potentially improve a wide range of other software, the
ecosystem supporting its implementation is still developing. Which is where
Cloudera hopes to make a place for itself.More on Hadoop: It uses the Google-
introduced MapReduce systems framework that divides applications into small
blocks of work, creating multiple replicas of data blocks that it places on
various computer nodes.It is already in use at large companies likeYahoo.Read

<p>Introduction: Aaron Kimball of Cloudera gives a wonderful 23 minute presentation
titledCloudera Hadoop Training: Thinking at Scale Clouderawhich talks about
"common challenges and general best practices for scaling with your data." As
a company Cloudera offers "enterprise-level support to users of Apache
Hadoop." Part of that offering is a really useful series oftutorial videos on
the Hadoop ecosystem.Like TV lawyer Perry Mason (or is it Harmon Rabb?), Aaron
gradually builds his case. He opens with the problem of storing lots of data.
Then a blistering cross examination of the problem of building distributed
systems to analyze that data sets up a powerful closing argument. With so much
testimony behind him, on closing Aaron really brings it home with why shared
nothing systems like map-reduce are the right solution on how to query lots of
data. They jury loved it.Here's the videoThinking at Scale. And here's a
summary of some of the lessons learned from the talk:Lessons LearnedWe can

version of Apache Hadoop they test and deploy across their large Hadoop
clusters. As a service to the Hadoop community, Yahoo is releasing the Yahoo!
Distribution of Hadoop -- a source code distribution that is based entirely on
code found in the Apache Hadoop project.This source distribution includes code
patches that they have added to improve the stability and performance of their
clusters. In all cases, these patches have already been contributed back to
Apache, but they may not yet be available in an Apache release of Hadoop.Read

<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use

<p>Introduction: Has a Java only Hadoop been getting you down? Now you can beHappy. Happy is
aframework for writing map-reduce programs for Hadoop using Jython. It files
off the sharp edges on Hadoop and makes writing map-reduce programs a breeze.
There's really no history yet on Happy, but I'm delighted at the idea of being
able to map-reduce inother languages. The more ways the better.From the
website:Happy is a framework that allows Hadoop jobs to be written and run in
Python 2.2 using Jython. It is aneasy way to write map-reduce programs for
Hadoop, and includes some new useful features as well.The current release
supports Hadoop 0.17.2.Map-reduce jobs in Happy are defined by sub-classing
happy.HappyJob and implementing amap(records, task) and reduce(key, values,
task) function. Then you create an instance of theclass, set the job
parameters (such as inputs and outputs) and call run().When you call run(),
Happy serializes your job instance and copies it and all accompanyinglibraries

<p>Introduction: Yahoo has developed a new language called Pig Latin that fit in a sweet spot
between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level,
procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.The
accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into
physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce
implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined
Hadoop as a subproject.The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo!
are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and
execution of their data analysis tasks, compared tousing Hadoop
directly.References:Apache Pig Wiki</p><p>5 0.78049654 <a title="669-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-11-Yahoo%21_Distribution_of_Hadoop.html">627 high scalability-2009-06-11-Yahoo! Distribution of Hadoop</a></p>

<p>Introduction: SummaryIn this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing
stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services
application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out
model.BioNati Shalom is the CTO and Founder ofGigaSpacesand responsible for
the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed
technology and architecture namely CORBA, Jini, J2EE, Grid and SOA. Nati is
the Head of the Israeli Grid consortium and an evangelist of Space Based
Architecture and Data Grid patterns. Blog:Gigaspaces BlogRead the rest of the

<p>Introduction: Varnishis a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is
targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take
full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered
by these operating systems.Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high
performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be
configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like
computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.Varnish is reported to
be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>4 0.44449282 <a title="669-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-09-No_to_SQL%3F_Anti-database_movement_gains_steam_%E2%80%93_My_Take.html">654 high scalability-2009-07-09-No to SQL?

<p>Introduction: Inthis posti wrote my view on the anti SQL database movement and where the
alternative approach fits in:- SQL databases are not going away anytime soon.-
The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.- There
is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions
alongside traditional SQL databases.In addition to the options that was
mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative
approach and how that fits into the puzzle. I used a real life scenario:

approach was the only option they could scale and meet their application
performance and response time requirements.</p><p>5 0.4329257 <a title="669-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-27-Comet_-_An_Example_of_the_New_Key-Code_Databases.html">979 high scalability-2011-01-27-Comet - An Example of the New Key-Code Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Comet is anactive distributed key-value storebuilt at the University of
Washington. The paper describing Comet is Comet: An active distributed key-
value store, there are also slides, and a MP3 of a presentation given atOSDI
'10. Here's a succinct overview of Comet:Today's cloud storage services, such
as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety
of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes,
fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility
first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption
keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage
service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their
data's behavior inside the storage service.I found this paper quite
interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-
value store, which turns it into what might called a key-code store. This is

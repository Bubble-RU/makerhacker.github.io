<p>Introduction: CDNs ( content delivery networks ) are the secret shadow super powers behind the web and Dan Rayburn at   streamingmedia.com    is the go to investigative reporter for quality information on CDNs. Every year Dan has a Content Delivery Summit on all things CDN and those videos are    now available   . Dan also gives a kind of    state of the industry talk    where he does something wonderful, he gives real numbers and prices. Dan really knows his stuff and is an excellent speaker, so watch the video, but here’s my gloss on the state of the CDN so far this year: 
  
  Massive growth . Large customers are expecting 126% growth in video traffic over last year; medium size customers are seeing 48% traffic growth, small sized customer are seeing 73.3% traffic growth. 
   More traffic != More profit   . Traffic growth doesn’t lead to more profit because the traffic growth is concentrated in larger customers that can make the best deals.

<p>Introduction: If you have a lot of static content to store and you aren't looking forward to setting up and maintaining your own giganto SAN,  maybe you can push off a lot of the hard lifting to a CDN?     Jesse Robbins at O'Reilly Radar posts that you have a lot more options now because the number of   Content Distribution Networks have doubled since last year  . In fact, Dan Rayburn says there are now   28 CDN   providers in the market. Hopefully you can find reasonable pricing at one of them.      Other than easing your burden, why might a CDN work for you? Because it makes your site faster and customers like that. How can a CDN so dramatically improve your site's performance?           Steve Saunders, author of   High Performance Web Sites: Essential Knowledge for Front-End Engineers  , has using a CDN has one of his "Thirteen Simple Rules for Speeding Up Your Web Site."

<p>Introduction: We build web applications…and there are plenty of them around. Now, if we hit the jackpot and our application becomes very popular, traffic goes up, and our servers are brought down by the hordes of people coming to our website. What do we do in that situation?     Of course, I am not talking here about the kind of traffic Digg, Yahoo Buzz or other social media sites can bring to a website, which is temporary overnight traffic, or a website which uses cloud computing like Amazon EC2 service, MediaTemple Grid Service or Mosso Hosting Cloud service.     I am talking about traffic that consistently increases over time as the service achieves success. Google.com, Yahoo.com, Myspace.com, Facebook.com, Plentyoffish.com, Linkedin.com, Youtube.com and others are examples of services which have constant high traffic.     Knowing that users want speed from their applications, these services will always use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver that speed.

<p>Introduction: Update  :  as of the end of Q2 2011,  Akamai had 95,811  servers deployed globally.     
 
Akamai is the CDN to the stars. It claims to deliver between 15 and 30 percent of all Web traffic, with major customers like Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and the US military. Traditionally quite secretive, we get a peek behind the curtain in this paper:  The Akamai Network: A Platform for High-Performance Internet Applications  by Erik Nygren, Ramesh Sitaraman, and Jennifer Sun. 
  Abstract:
 Comprising more than 61,000 servers located across nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the components and capabilities of this large-scale distributed computing platform, and offer some insight into its architecture, design principles, operation, and management.

<p>Introduction: Playing like the big boys may be getting cheaper. The big boys, like  YouTube , farm the serving of their most popular videos to a third party CDN. A lot of people were surprised YouTube didn't serve all their content themselves, but it makes sense. It allows them to keep up with demand without a large hit for infrastructure build out, much like leasing computers instead of buying them.
   
 The problem has been CDNs are expensive.  Om Malik reports in  Akamai & the CDN Price Wars  that may be changing. CDN service could be becoming affordable enough that you might consider using them as part of your scaling strategy.    Akamai , once the clear leader in the CDN field, is facing strong competition from the likes of Limelight Networks, Level 3, Internap, CDNetworks, Panther Express and EdgeCast Networks.  This  commoditization  may be bad for their stock prices, but it's good for website builders looking for new scaling strategies. EdgeCast, for example, passes on the cost savings when</p><p>3 0.89766645 <a title="576-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-23-State_of_the_CDN%3A_More_Traffic%2C_Stable_Prices%2C_More_Products%2C_Profits_-_Not_So_Much.html">1289 high scalability-2012-07-23-State of the CDN: More Traffic, Stable Prices, More Products, Profits - Not So Much</a></p>

<p>Introduction: All,     I'm just new to this and have a basic understanding how CDN works? My questions are:     1. How does CDN sync data with web servers for video/images? If I have a user to upload a video to my site, will it get stored directly in CDN or it comes to my webserver first and then sync-ed with cache server?     2. How to have only the dynamic video/image delivered through CDN while the rest is served by a webserver?   3. How sync happens and who pays for the bandwidth for sync?       I'd appreciate if someone could explain this.

<p>Introduction: Chris Dixon   unearthed a  great quote   from Douglas Adams on the nature of technological adoption that unsurprisingly hits the mark in our ever changing and evolving world:
  
 Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.  
 Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.  
 Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things

<p>Introduction: Update 10:     The Value of CDNs   by Mike Axelrod of Google.  Google implements a distributed content cache from within   large ISPs  . This allows them to serve content from the edge of the network and save bandwidth on the ISPs backbone.    Update 9:     Just Jump: Start using Clouds and CDNs  .

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 2 ( part 1 ) of  an interview  I did for the  Boundary blog . 
 
 Boundary:  There’s another battle coming down the pike between Amazon (AWS) and Google (GCE). How should the CTO decide which one’s best? 
 
 Hoff:  Given that GCE is still closed to public access we have very little common experience on which to judge. The best way to decide is as always, by running a few experiments. Pick a few representative projects, a representative team, implement the projects on both infrastructures, crunch some numbers, figure out the bigger picture and then select the one you wanted in the first place   .
 
Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, recently  wrote about his experiences  on both platforms and found some interesting differences: AWS has a much richer set of services; GCE is on-demand only, so AWS can be cheaper; GCE has faster disk and faster network IO, especially between datacenters; GCE has faster boot times and can mount read-only partitions across multiple</p><p>5 0.94259548 <a title="576-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-27-OpenStack_-_The_Answer_to%3A_How_do_We_Compete_with_Amazon%3F.html">888 high scalability-2010-08-27-OpenStack - The Answer to: How do We Compete with Amazon?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a  meetup  Wednesday on  OpenStack , whose tag line is  the open source, open standards cloud . I was shocked at the large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems to be. 
 
The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:
  
 OpenStack allows any organization to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage</p><p>6 0.94127309 <a title="576-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-17-Applications_Become_Black_Boxes_Using_Markets_to_Scale_and_Control_Costs.html">761 high scalability-2010-01-17-Applications Become Black Boxes Using Markets to Scale and Control Costs</a></p>

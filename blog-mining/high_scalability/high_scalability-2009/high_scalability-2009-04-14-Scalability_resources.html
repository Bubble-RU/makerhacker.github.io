<p>Introduction: I have 3 exp in building website using java.I work on only single
server.Website is not very scalable.I always wonder how ebay,youtube,monster
handle traffic, giving responses within seconds.From the google i find this
site and i hope i can also able to build very scalable website .I need
guidelines from where to start ,what are the things we needed.I know that
scalability comes through the use of distributed applications but don't how to
implement it.I see many website build in languages other than java so java is
good choice for building high scalable website.Thanks</p><p>4 0.11855865 <a title="569-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-10-The_Art_of_Capacity_Planning%3A_Scaling_Web_Resources.html">407 high scalability-2008-10-10-The Art of Capacity Planning: Scaling Web Resources</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3:The book was released! Find it on Amazon atThe Art of Capacity
Planning.Update 2:Maybe the iPhone can use a little capacity planning?What's
Behind the iPhone 3G Glitches:One source says Apple programmed the Infineon
chip to demand a more powerful 3G signal than the iPhone really requires. So
if too many people try to make a call or go on the Internet in a given area,
some of the devices will decide there's insufficient power and switch to the
slower networkâ&euro;&rdquo;even if there is enough 3G bandwidth available.Update:To get a
taste of what will be served,mySQL DBAhas a nice post titledCapacity Planning,
Architecture, Scaling, Response time, Throughput. You learn how to figure out
when your application will break by building a 3rd order polynomial. Cool
stuff!John Allspaw who is the Operations Engineering Manager at Flickr is
about to publish a book with O'Reilly.There are not much details so far but it
seems interesting and relevant to High Scalability.Allspaw combines personal

<p>Introduction: Surgeis a conference put on by OmniTI targeting practical Scalability matters.
OmniTI specializes in helping people solve their scalability problems, as is
only natural, as it was founded by Theo Schlossnagle, author of the
canonicalScalable Internet Architectures. Now that Surge 2011 is on the
horizon, they've generously made available nearly all thevideos from the Surge
2010conference.  A pattern hopefully every conference will follow (only don't
wait a year please). We lose a lot of collective wisdom from events not being
available online in a timely manner.In truth, nearlyall the talksare on topic
and are worth watching, but here are a few that seem especially relevant:Going

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose
limits (GAE Quotas,Fotolog,Facebook) as a means of protecting a website
against service destroyingtraffic spikes. Twitter will reportedlylimit the
number followersto 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow
Twitter to make some bank bygoing freemiumand charging for adding more
followers.Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting
aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established
ecosystem?One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let
everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is,
however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are
will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service.
Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.Now in Twitter's
case the people with the most followers tend to be opinion leaderswho shape

<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.They're using a static server to
deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that
the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on
serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.I'm curious how other
people have dealt with this situation.Seperating into two different servers
would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the
premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created
in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.93976992 <a title="569-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-14-Scalability_resources.html">569 high scalability-2009-04-14-Scalability resources</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are a few updates on the articlePaper: Don't Settle For Eventual:
Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS from Mike Freedman
and Wyatt Lloyd.Q: How software architectures could change in response to
casual+ consistency?A: I don't really think they would much. Somebody would
still run a two-tier architecture in their datacenter:  a front-tier of
webservers running both (say) PHP and our client library, and a back tier of
storage nodes running COPS.  (I'm not sure if it was obvious given the
discussion of our "thick" client -- you should think of the COPS client
dropping in where a memcache client library does...albeit ours has per-session
state.) Q: Why not just use vector clocks?A: The problem with vector clocks
and scalability has always been that the size of vector clocks in O(N), where
N is the number of nodes.  So if we want to scale to a datacenter with 10K
nodes, each piece of metadata must have size O(10K).  And in fact, vector
clocks alone only allow yo</p><p>5 0.92183197 <a title="569-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-09-Cell_Architectures.html">1242 high scalability-2012-05-09-Cell Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A consequence of Service Oriented Architectures is the burning need to provide
services at scale. The architecture that has evolved to satisfy these
requirements is a little known technique called the Cell Architecture.A Cell
Architecture is based on the idea that massive scale requires parallelization
and parallelization requires components be isolated from each other. These
islands of isolation are called cells. A cell is a self-contained installation
that can satisfy all the operations for a shard. A shard is a subset of a much
larger dataset, typically a range of users, for example. Cell Architectures
have several advantages:Cells provide a unit of parallelization that can be
adjusted to any size as the user base grows.Cell are added in an incremental
fashion as more capacity is required.Cells isolate failures. One cell failure
does not impact other cells.Cells provide isolation as the storage and
application horsepower to process requests is independent of other cells.Cells

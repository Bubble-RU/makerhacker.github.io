</p><p>5 Our Mass Transit System Must Supply Perceived Control   Given the warm inner glow we feel from being wrapped in the cold steel of our cars, if you want people to get out of their cars and onto mass transit you must provide the same level of perceived control. [sent-91, score-1.38]

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are hired at many software companies...   Agency  : So sorry you had to wait in the reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?  Applicant  : I drive a 2008 Subaru.  Agency  : That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent you.  Applicant  : That's OK. Any car will do.  Agency  : No, we can only take on clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way. There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take a chance.  Applicant  : I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt.</p><p>3 0.13488279 <a title="657-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_4%2C_2013.html">1381 high scalability-2013-01-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 4, 2013</a></p>

  Summary of the December 24, 2012 Amazon ELB Service Event in the US-East Region . A developer accidently caused some ELB data to be deleted. It's interesting to consider this  incident in the context of resiliency  and DevOps. Developers working on production, considered good, we should be full stack, models should be open, etc. Yet Amazon is responding by closing down production systems, just like the bad old days. Couldn't we have our cake and eat it too if the data was backed up and could have been restored quickly? Also,  Amazon's EC2 Outage: A Closer Look

<p>Introduction: Wired has a  wonderful interview  with  Clayton Christensen , author of the tech ninja's bible,  Innovator's Dilemma . Innovation is the name of the game in Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained with compelling examples by the man himself.
 
Just as every empire has fallen, every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.
 
He also talks about his new book,  The Capitalist's Dilemma , which addresses this puzzle: if corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?
 
If someone can help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here'</p><p>3 0.86252004 <a title="657-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-09-Why_My_Slime_Mold_is_Better_than_Your_Hadoop_Cluster.html">1225 high scalability-2012-04-09-Why My Slime Mold is Better than Your Hadoop Cluster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update :  Organism without a brain creates external memories for navigation  shows slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants.

<p>Introduction: This topic has been ripped directly from Lambda the Ultimate's  What will programming look like in 2020?  post. They are having a lively discussion and if you are interested in flexing your holiday thought muscles we might have a good discussion too.
 
Eight years is a difficult prediction horizon. It's too short to simply project out current trends and it's too long to discount potential technological breakthroughs coming to market. There's the challenge.
 
Some of my lousy predictions: 
  
  Programmers Will Form Guilds Around New Gamified Training Hubs  
  The Web Will Become More Closed Before it Becomes More Open  
  Not Everyone Will Become a Programmer  
  Focus Will Shift to Creating Bigger People Instead of Chasing Big Ideas  
   Programmers Will Form Guilds Around New Gamified Training Hubs

<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsay  is a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant, but it applies to software development too.
 
You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is there to help.
 
If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say" means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses, belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence a</p><p>6 0.83713841 <a title="657-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-14-I%2C_Cloud.html">919 high scalability-2010-10-14-I, Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be thankful for the  song  of the tinniest  sparrow  at  sunrise , I'll save you from all that. It's hard to tie scalability and the  giving of thanks  together, especially as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of time. But I think I found a sentiment in  A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and MIRACLES  by  James Bridle  that manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving thanks meaningfully together:
  

I distrust commercial definitions of innovation, and particularly of awesomeness. It’s an overused term. When I think of awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.


  So I started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.  


     


We’re not actually very good about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use metaphors and examples.

<p>Introduction: This is an all time favorite post. Even though I've seen this video a hundred times I still can't help but laugh... 
 
This is so funny I laughed until I cried! Definitely NSFW. OMG it's hilarious, but it's also not a bad overview of the issues. Especially loved:  You read the latest post on HighScalability.com and think you are a f*cking Google and architect and parrot slogans like Web Scale and Sharding but you have no idea what the f*ck you are talking about . There are so many more gems like that.

<p>Introduction: Update 17 :  Are Wireless Road Trains the Cure for Traffic Congestion?   BY   ADDY DUGDALE .  The concept of road trains--up to eight vehicles zooming down the road together--has long been considered a faster, safer, and greener way of traveling long distances by car 
 
 Update 16:  The first electric vehicle in the country  powered completely by ultracapacitors . The minibus can be fully recharged in fifteen minutes, unlike battery vehicles, which typically takes hours to recharge.
 
 Update 15:   How to Make UAVs Fully Autonomous . The Sense-and-Avoid system uses a four-megapixel camera on a pan tilt to detect obstacles from the ground. It puts red boxes around planes and birds, and blue boxes around movement that it determines is not an obstacle (e.g., dust on the lens).

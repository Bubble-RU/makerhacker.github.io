<p>Introduction: Making Hadoop Run Faster   
 

One of the challenges in processing data is that the speed at which we can input data is quite often much faster than the speed at which we can process it. This problem becomes even more pronounced in the context of Big Data, where the volume of data keeps on growing, along with a corresponding need for more insights, and thus the need for more complex processing also increases.


 Batch Processing to the Rescue 


Hadoop was designed to deal with this challenge in the following ways:


1. Use a distributed file system: This enables us to spread the load and grow our system as needed.


2. Optimize for write speed: To enable fast writes the Hadoop architecture was designed so that writes are first logged, and then processed. This enables fairly fast write speeds.


3. Use batch processing (Map/Reduce) to balance the speed for the data feeds with the processing speed.


 Batch Processing Challenges 


The challenge with batch-processing is that it assumes</p><p>3 0.061765231 <a title="635-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-18-QCon_London_2009%3A_Upgrading_Twitter_without_service_disruptions.html">544 high scalability-2009-03-18-QCon London 2009: Upgrading Twitter without service disruptions</a></p>

The “ High Scalability ” blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not disappoint with a post  highlighting a set of scalability design patterns  that was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on “ 6 Ways to Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way. ”

<p>Introduction: Aaron Kimball of Cloudera gives a wonderful 23 minute presentation titled  Cloudera Hadoop Training: Thinking at Scale Cloudera  which talks about "common challenges and general best practices for scaling with your data." As a company Cloudera offers "enterprise-level support to users of Apache Hadoop." Part of that offering is a really useful series of  tutorial videos on the Hadoop ecosystem .   Like TV lawyer Perry Mason (or is it Harmon Rabb?), Aaron gradually builds his case. He opens with the problem of storing lots of data. Then a blistering cross examination of the problem of building distributed systems to analyze that data sets up a powerful closing argument. With so much testimony behind him, on closing Aaron really brings it home with why shared nothing systems like map-reduce are the right solution on how to query lots of data. They jury loved it.   Here's the video  Thinking at Scale . And here's a summary of some of the lessons learned from the talk:

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see how!     Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed in a format called   Alexandrian form which draws on constructs used by Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:     The pattern name   The problem the pattern is trying to solve     Context   Solution   Examples   Design rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why experts use it       Patterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context, and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next ‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied.

<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper:  Pursue robust indefinite scalability , wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural networks, starting from scratch.
 
What is this strange thing called  indefinite scalability ? They sound like words that don't really go together:
  

Indefinite scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-engineered.


Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to program</p><p>4 0.71707171 <a title="635-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-20-Paper%3A_Flux%3A_An_Adaptive_Partitioning_Operator_for_Continuous_Query_Systems.html">604 high scalability-2009-05-20-Paper: Flux: An Adaptive Partitioning Operator for Continuous Query Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable, which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.  Abstract:
   The long-running nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across multiple queries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their constituent, stateful operators â&euro;&ldquo; e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators. To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static techniques for partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue to function robustly in the face of these imbalances. To address this challenge, we introduce</p><p>5 0.71482259 <a title="635-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-18-Paper%3A_The_Declarative_Imperative%3A_Experiences_and_Conjectures_in_Distributed_Logic.html">844 high scalability-2010-06-18-Paper: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic  is written by UC Berkeley's  Joseph Hellerstein  for a keynote speech he gave at  PODS . The video version of the talk is  here . You may have heard about Mr. Hellerstein through the  Berkeley Orders Of Magnitude  project ( BOOM ), whose purpose is to help  people build systems that are OOM (orders of magnitude) bigger than are building today, with OOM less effort than traditional programming methodologies . A noble goal which may be why BOOM was rated as a top 10 emerging technology for 2010 by  MIT Technology Review . Quite an honor.
 
The motivation for the talk is a familiar one: it's a dark period for computer programming and if we don't learn how to write parallel programs the children of Moore's law will destroy us all. We have more and more processors, yet we are stuck on figuring out how the average programmer can exploit them. The BOOM solution is the Bloom language which is based on  Dedalus:</p><p>6 0.7023735 <a title="635-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-12-Paper%3A_Scalable_Eventually_Consistent_Counters_over_Unreliable_Networks.html">1611 high scalability-2014-03-12-Paper: Scalable Eventually Consistent Counters over Unreliable Networks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech has  developed AdHoc , an advanced framework for sharing geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective. The premise of AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access to his or her resources without an IT administrator’s help, and with high security level of any exposed data or applications assured. It takes 3 easy steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization, add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join forces for more efficient results.  AdHoc was initially created for a consortium of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the administration</p><p>4 0.81158811 <a title="635-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-20-Smart_Companies_Fail_Because_they_Do_Everything_Right_-_Staying_Alive_to_Scale.html">1410 high scalability-2013-02-20-Smart Companies Fail Because they Do Everything Right - Staying Alive to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wired has a  wonderful interview  with  Clayton Christensen , author of the tech ninja's bible,  Innovator's Dilemma . Innovation is the name of the game in Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained with compelling examples by the man himself.
 
Just as every empire has fallen, every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.
 
He also talks about his new book,  The Capitalist's Dilemma , which addresses this puzzle: if corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?
 
If someone can help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here'</p><p>5 0.8062892 <a title="635-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-23-Postgresql_on_high_availability_websites%3F.html">73 high scalability-2007-08-23-Postgresql on high availability websites?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was looking at the pingdom infrastructure matrix (http://royal.pingdom.com/royalfiles/0702_infrastructure_matrix.pdf) and I saw that no sites are using Postgresql, and then I searched through highscalability.com and saw very few mentions of postgresql. Are there any examples of high-traffic sites that use postgresql? Does anyone have any experience with it? I'm having trouble finding good, recent studies of postgres (and postgres compared w/ mysql) online.</p><p>6 0.78497106 <a title="635-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-06-10_Ways_to_Take_your_Site_from_One_to_One_Million_Users_by_Kevin_Rose__.html">715 high scalability-2009-10-06-10 Ways to Take your Site from One to One Million Users by Kevin Rose  </a></p>

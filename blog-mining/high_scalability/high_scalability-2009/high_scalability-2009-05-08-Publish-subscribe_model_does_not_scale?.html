useful to learn how large installations manage all their unruly

<p>Introduction: It is widely recognized that MySQL is the most popular database software in
the world. Since its inception in 1995, there have been 11 million product
installations around the world in a wide variety of markets. There are more
installations of MySQL in use today than any other database architecture. From
startup companies hoping to be the next Web2.0 poster child to large global
enterprises, the MySQL database architecture has proven to be flexible,
extendable, scalable, and more than capable of filling high-capacity database
roles in very different venues.</p><p>4 0.10446273 <a title="595-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-10-Future_of_EJB3_%21%21_%3F%3F.html">179 high scalability-2007-12-10-Future of EJB3 !! ??</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere

<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and
Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper: Pursue robust
indefinite scalability, wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural
networks, starting from scratch.What is this strange thing calledindefinite
scalability? They sound like words that don't really go together:Indefinite
scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended
computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense
as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network
designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable
because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-
core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of
numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-
engineered.Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to
programmers using rei</p><p>3 0.67012304 <a title="595-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-31-Scaling_MySQL_on_Amazon_Web_Services.html">690 high scalability-2009-08-31-Scaling MySQL on Amazon Web Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've recently started working with a large company who is looking to take one
of their heavily utilized applications and move it to Amazon Web Services. I'm
not looking to start a debate on the merits of EC2, the decision to move to
aws is already made (and is a much better decision than paying a vendor
millions to host it).I've done my reasearch and I'm comfortable with creating
this environment with one exception, scaling MySQL. I havent done much work
with MySQL, i'm more of an Oracle guy up to now. I'm struggling to determine a
way to scale MySQL on the fly in a way so that replication works, the server
takes its proper place in line for master candidacy, and the apache servers
become aware of it.So this is really three questions:1. What are some proven
methods of load balancing the read traffic going from apache to MySQL.2. How
do I let the load balancing mechanism know when I scale up / down a new Mysql
Server?3. How to alert the master of the new server and initiate replication</p><p>4 0.66553211 <a title="595-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-30-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_30%2C_2010.html">869 high scalability-2010-07-30-Hot Scalability Links for July 30, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremy Zawodny, while performing data alchemy in the dungeons of Craigslist,
stored1,250,000,000 Key/Value Pairs in Redis on a 32GB Machine.Data sorting
world record: 1 terabyte, 1 minute. The system has 52 computer nodes, each
node is a commodity server with two quad-core processors, 24 gigabytes (GB)
memory and sixteen 500 GB disks. It's not just hardware though, they also
built a software that utilized all their CPU and RAM.Tweets of Gold:wm: I am
really getting the sense that none of you yokels waxing profound about
scalability actually has anything factual to sayjoestump: I think you can do
things to *mitigate* pain points up front. You don't need to over-engineer,
but it's not hard to look forward.danielcrenna: I love it when I check in

fine noose.Update 2: Kevin says thebiggest problems he sees with startups is
they need to scaletheir backend (no, the other one).Update: My bad.It's hard
to sell scalabilityso just forget it.The premise ofStartups and The Problem Of
Premature ScalaculationandDonâ&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Martis that
you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before
you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful
enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied
life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites
siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its
best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?If I ever believed this I
certainly don't believe it anymore. The world has changed, even since

<p>Introduction: on Wiki someone posted"...For relatively small installations, pub/sub provides
the opportunity for better scalability than traditional client-server, through
parallel operation, message caching, tree-based or network-based routing,
etc.However, as systems scale up to become datacenters with thousands of
servers sharing the pub/sub infrastructure, this benefit is often lost; in
fact, scalability for pub/sub products under high load in large deployments is
very much a research challenge."Does anyone have something to say regarding
scaling Publish/subscribe models?</p><p>2 0.97652048 <a title="595-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-Speed_up_%28Oracle%29_database_code_with_result_caching.html">230 high scalability-2008-01-29-Speed up (Oracle) database code with result caching</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the most interesting new features of Oracle 11 is the new function
result caching mechanism. Until now, making sure that a PL/SQL function gets
executed only as many times as necessary was a black art. The new caching
system makes that quite easy -- here is how it works.</p><p>3 0.97137105 <a title="595-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-18-limit_on_the_number_of_databases_open.html">252 high scalability-2008-02-18-limit on the number of databases open</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Youmight haveconsistency problems if you have: multiple datastores in multiple
datacenters, without distributed transactions, and with the ability to
alternately execute out of each datacenter;  syncing protocols that can fail
or sync stale data; distributed clients that cache data and then write old
back to the central store; a NoSQL database that doesn't have transactions
between updates of multiple related key-value records; application level
integrity checks; client drivenoptimistic locking.Sounds a lot like many
evolving, loosely coupled, autonomous, distributed systems these days. How do
you solve these consistency problems? Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix talks
about how they solved theirs in his excellent presentation, NoSQL @ Netflix :
Part 1, given to a packed crowd at aCloud Computing Meetup. You might be
inclined to say how silly it is to have these problems in the first place, but
just hold on. See if you might share some of their problems, before getting

<p>Introduction: Scale-Out is incrementally adding servers as needed to scale rather than
buying larger servers. Here's the MySQL idea of what ascale-out architecture
lookslike:ThisMySQL articlelists 5 problems to avoid when scaling out:Don't
Think Synchronously. Introduce asynchronous communication, parallelization,
and strategies to deal with approximate or slightly outdated data.Don't Think
Vertically.  Scaling by bigger machines won't work. Plan on horizontal scaling
and asynchronous architectures form the start which make it easy to add
capacity on demand.Don't Mix Transactions with Business
Intelligence.Transactions and analytics are inherently different. Separate out
different types of data onto different databases.Avoid Mixing Hot and Cold
Data.Static and fast changing data are inherently different. Separate out
different types of data onto different databases.Don't Forget the Power of
Memory.  Make data accessible in RAM by smartly partitioning data across
servers.More information atScale-Out</p><p>6 0.96407169 <a title="595-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-SSL_RPC_API_Scalability.html">620 high scalability-2009-06-05-SSL RPC API Scalability</a></p>

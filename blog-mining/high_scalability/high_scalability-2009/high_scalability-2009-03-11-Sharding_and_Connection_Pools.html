<p>Introduction: Hi, I aminterested in some experienced advice for choosing switches for a
colocated 2-tier architecture. I have the hardware chosen for the webservers,
app servers, and db servers, but need some advice on the network switch in
between:colocation port -> firewall(load balancer) -> 2+ web servers (app
servers) -> gigabit switch -> DB server(possibly cluster for future
expansion)the question is that I am just starting out, i wonder which
rackmount gigabit switch to select for the private LAN between the app server
-> DB servers. Do I need managed for that? Cisco switches are the best, but
they are the most expensive...I am looking at possibly using Dell/Netgear
gigabit switches.Thanks for any input</p><p>5 0.11571358 <a title="532-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture_to_Allow_High_Availability_File_Upload.html">262 high scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture to Allow High Availability File Upload</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if anyone has found any information on how to architect a
system to support high availability file uploads. My scenario: I have an
Apache server proxying requests to a bunch of Tomcat Java application servers.
When I need to upgrade my site, I stop and upgrade each of the Tomcat servers
one at a time. This seems to work well as Apache automatically routes
subsequent requests for the stopped app server to the remaining app servers
that are up. The problem is that if a user is uploading a file when the app
server is stopped, the upload fails and the user has to upload the file again.
This is problematic as uploading files is an integral feature of the site and
it's frustrating for the users to have to restart their uploads every time I
upgrade the site (which I want to be able to do frequently).Has anyone seen
any information on how this can be done or have ideas on how this can be
architected? I imagine sites like Flickr must have a solution to this problem
as I have</p><p>6 0.10890231 <a title="532-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed_content_system_with_bandwidth_balancing.html">605 high scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed content system with bandwidth balancing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,We have an application that allows the user to define a publicly available
resource with an ID. The ID can then be accessed via an HTTP call, passing the
ID. While we're not a picture site, thinking of a resource like a picture may
help understand what is going on.We need to be able to stop access to the
resource if it is accessed 'x' times in an hour, regardless of who is
requesting it.We see two options- go to the database for each request to see
if the # of returned in the last hour is within the limit.- keep a counter in
each of the application servers and sync the counters every few minutes or #
of requests to determine if we've passed the limit. The sync point would be
the database.Going to the database (and updating it!) each time we get a
request isn't very attractive.We also have a load balanced farm of servers, so
we know 'x' is going to have to be a soft limit if we count in the app
serevrs. (We know there will be a period of time between syncing the counts in
the app ser</p><p>5 0.67022401 <a title="532-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-SSL_RPC_API_Scalability.html">620 high scalability-2009-06-05-SSL RPC API Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all!So nice to start discussing cool things in this even cooler forum :)I
am having a problem .. which i believe is already solved but i would love
someone confirming actual experience with the same topic.We are building a
client / server architecture, consisting of a web server part and many
clients.Transport will be provided as either XML-RPC / SOAP / JSON or all at
once.All of the communication has to be encrypted and passed within SSL3.We
expect a high load when the application starts (> 2000 concurrent
requests).Combine this with xml parsing for the rpc api, things really look
ugly :)So it's a big mess :)It will not be that much database bound behind the
api - mostly files will be transferred from the server to the clients and
simple api for control.So it's pretty much a matter of 'what-to-do-with-ssl'.I
was thinking of hardware - NetApp or a similar application accelerator.Can
anyone give examples of a hardware piece that combines: Load balancer / SSL
accelerator?I have also b</p><p>6 0.63102973 <a title="532-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture_to_Allow_High_Availability_File_Upload.html">262 high scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture to Allow High Availability File Upload</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation Propagation Networks: A
Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation, offers to help us break
free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of
autonomous but interconnected machines.  We can do this byorganizing
computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of
which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the
network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the
structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.The abstract from
his thesis is:In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of
computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The
traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large
memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with

<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is
still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head
scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are
you still the same person?The Ise Grand Shrine has been in continuous
existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has
been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then
dismantled.Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a
living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what
is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the
shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that
imperative.You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects
like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed
in each new environment.The patterns of recurrence in software are the result
of Darwinian selectio</p><p>3 0.90884447 <a title="532-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-18-Robert_Scoble%27s_Rules_for_Successfully_Scaling_Startups.html">352 high scalability-2008-07-18-Robert Scoble's Rules for Successfully Scaling Startups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignantFriendFeed threadcommiserating PodTech's
unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup.
Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with
them:Have a story.Have everyone on board with that story.If anyone goes off of
that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.Make sure
people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues
should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get
fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.Work ONLY for a leader who
will make the tough decisions.Build a place where excellence is expected,
allowed, and is enabled.Fire idiots quickly.If your engineering team can't
give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only
things that are measured ever get improved.When your stars aren't listened to
the company is in trouble.Getting rid of the CEO, even if it's all his fault,

<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We
are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple
(any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would
be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally
there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database
server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that
particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and
how you resolved it?Thanks,Scott</p><p>5 0.84990752 <a title="532-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-26-Akaros_-_an_open_source_operating_system_for_manycore_architectures.html">1234 high scalability-2012-04-26-Akaros - an open source operating system for manycore architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are interested in future foward OS designs then you might find Akaros
worth a look. It's an operating system designed for many-core architectures
and large-scale SMP systems, with the goals of:Providing better support for
parallel and high-performance applicationsScaling the operating system to a
large number of cores A more indepth explanation of the motiviation behind
Akaros can be found inImproving Per-Node Efﬁciency in the Datacenter with
NewOS Abstractions by Barret Rhoden, Kevin Klues, David Zhu, and Eric
Brewer.The abstract:We believe datacenters can beneﬁt from more focus on per-
node efﬁciency, performance, and predictability, versus the more common focus
so far on scalability to a large number of nodes. Improving per-node efﬁciency
decreases costs and fault recovery because fewer nodes are required for the
same amount of work. We believe that the use of complex, general-purpose
operating systems is a key contributing factor to these inefﬁciencies.

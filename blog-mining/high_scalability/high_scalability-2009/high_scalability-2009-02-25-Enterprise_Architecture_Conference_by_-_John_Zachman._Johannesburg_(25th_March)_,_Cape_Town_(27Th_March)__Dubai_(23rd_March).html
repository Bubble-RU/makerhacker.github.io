<p>Introduction: John Zachman (Father of enterprise architecture)Given this renascent interest,
who better to explain the principles behind Enterprise Architecture than the
man himself, John Zachman, the originator of the " Zachman Framework for
Enterprise Architecture" Join this workshop in Johannesburg 25th Mar 09 and
Cape town in 27th March 09 and Mr.Zachman will explain how and why Enterprise
Architecture provides measure, such an implementation is a daunting task with
opportunities to fail lurking in many places.For more details visit

<p>Introduction: It's not often you get so enthusiastic a recommendation for a paper as Sergio
Bossa gives Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers: If you only
want to read one piece about CPUs architecture, cache coherency and memory
barriers, make it this one.It is a clear and well written article. It even has
a quiz. What's it about?So what possessed CPU designers to cause them to
inﬂict memory barriers on poor unsuspecting SMP software designers?In short,
because reordering memory references allows much better performance, and so
memory barriers are needed to force ordering in things like synchronization
primitives whose correct operation depends on ordered memory
references.Getting a more detailed answer to this question requires a good
understanding of how CPU caches work, and especially what is required to make
caches really work well. The following sections:present the structure of a
cache,describe how cache-coherency protocols ensure that CPUs agree on the
value of each location</p><p>5 0.076184154 <a title="521-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-08-Under_Snowden%27s_Light_Software_Architecture_Choices_Become_Murky.html">1575 high scalability-2014-01-08-Under Snowden's Light Software Architecture Choices Become Murky</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adrian Cockcroft on the future ofCloud, Open Source, SaaS and the End of
Enterprise Computing:Most big enterprise companies are actively working on
their AWS rollout now. Most of them are also trying to get an in-house cloud
to work, with varying amounts of success, but even the best private clouds are
still years behind the feature set of public clouds, which is has a big impact
on the agility and speed of product developmentWhile theSnowden
revelationshave tattered the thin veil of trust secreting Big Brother from We
the People, they may also be driving a fascinating new tension in architecture
choices between Cloud Native (scale-out, IaaS), Amazon Native (rich service
dependencies), and Enterprise Native (raw hardware, scale-up).This tension
became evident in a recentHipChat interviewwhere HipChat, makers of an AWS
based SaaS chat product, were busy creating an on-premises version of their
product that could operate behind the firewall in enterprise datacenters. This
is consistent w</p><p>6 0.076081961 <a title="521-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-05-Sponsored_Post%3A_TripAdvisor%2C_eHarmony%2C_NoSQL_Now%21%2C_Surge%2C_BioWare%2C_Tungsten%2C_deviantART%2C_Aconex%2C_Hadapt%2C_Mathworks%2C_AppDynamics%2C__ScaleOut%2C_Membase%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1073 high scalability-2011-07-05-Sponsored Post: TripAdvisor, eHarmony, NoSQL Now!, Surge, BioWare, Tungsten, deviantART, Aconex, Hadapt, Mathworks, AppDynamics,  ScaleOut, Membase, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so
I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if
a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have
attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If
you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in
the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please
comment on that too.Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of
them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade
away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these
days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work.
Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people
do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not. Taking all
that wisdom and stuffing it into a presentations is surprisingly hard wor</p><p>5 0.61268139 <a title="521-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-25-Advanced_BPM_program__in_USA_and_India__discount_for_Group_Membership.html">520 high scalability-2009-02-25-Advanced BPM program  in USA and India  discount for Group Membership</a></p>

support for applications• An understanding of basic Enterprise physics•
Recommendations for the Sr. Managers to understand the political realities and
organizational resistance in realizing EA vision and some excellent advices
for overcoming these barriers• Number of practical examples of how to work
with people who affect decisions on EA implementation• How to create value for
your organization by systematically recording assets, processes, connectivity,

<p>Introduction: I was looking at the pingdom infrastructure matrix
(http://royal.pingdom.com/royalfiles/0702_infrastructure_matrix.pdf) and I saw
that no sites are using Postgresql, and then I searched through
highscalability.com and saw very few mentions of postgresql. Are there any
examples of high-traffic sites that use postgresql? Does anyone have any
experience with it? I'm having trouble finding good, recent studies of
postgres (and postgres compared w/ mysql) online.</p><p>4 0.70106614 <a title="521-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-09-GridwiseTech_revolutionizes_data_management.html">697 high scalability-2009-09-09-GridwiseTech revolutionizes data management</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech hasdeveloped AdHoc, an advanced framework for sharing
geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the
resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective.The premise of
AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access
to his or her resources without an IT administrator's help, and with high
security level of any exposed data or applications assured.It takes 3 easy
steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization,
add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any
organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join
forces for more efficient results.AdHoc was initially created for a consortium
of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical
partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to
provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the
administration of the</p><p>5 0.63025075 <a title="521-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-11-Linkedin_architecture.html">148 high scalability-2007-11-11-Linkedin architecture</a></p>

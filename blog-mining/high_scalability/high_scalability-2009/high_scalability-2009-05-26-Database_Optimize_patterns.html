<p>Introduction: This article not about Mariah Carey, or its song. It's about Storing System, Database.   
First let's describe what means by odds:  In my social network, I found 93% of the mainstream developers sanctify the database, or at least consider it in any data persistence challenge as the ultimate, superhero, and undefeatable solution.  I think this problem come from the education, personally, and some companies also I think it's involved in this.  To start to fix this bad thinking, we all should agree in the following points:
  
 Every challenge have its own solutions, so whatever you want to save/persistent, there are always many solutions. For example the Web search engines, such as: Google, Kngine, Yahoo, Bing don't use database at all instead we use Indexes (Index file) for better performance. 
   
 The Database in general whatever the vendor it's slow compared with other solutions such as: Key-Value storing system, Index file, DHT. 
   
 The Database currently employ Relation Data model</p><p>3 0.10731214 <a title="607-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.    We're basically using a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget). Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.    I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>4 0.10199381 <a title="607-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-16-Facebook%27s_New_Real-time_Messaging_System%3A_HBase_to_Store_135%2B_Billion_Messages_a_Month.html">943 high scalability-2010-11-16-Facebook's New Real-time Messaging System: HBase to Store 135+ Billion Messages a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a new  Social Inbox  integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer in  The Underlying Technology of Messages :  HBase . HBase beat out MySQL, Cassandra, and a few others.
 
Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time Messages product. Facebook also has an extensive  MySQL infrastructure , but they found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could have built their own, but they chose HBase.
 
HBase is a   scaleout table store supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data  . Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system.

Learn How to Read-write Scale Without a Complete Re-write</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lately I've been reading more cases were different people have started to realize the limitations of the NoSQL promise to database scalability. Note the references below:
     
  Why does Quora use MySQL as the data store instead of NoSQLs such as Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB etc?  
  Why did Diaspora abandon MongoDB for MySQL?  
  How scalable is CouchDB in practice, not just in theory?  
   

Take MongoDB for example. It's damn fast, but it doesn't really know how to save data reliably to disk. I've had it set up in a replica pair to mitigate that risk. Guess what - both servers in the pair failed and corrupted their data files at the same day.

  
It appears that for many, the switch to NoSQL can be rather painful. IMO that doesn't necessarily mean that NoSQL is wrong in general, but it's a combination of 1) lack of maturity 2) not the right tool for the job.
 
That brings the question of what's the alternative solution?
 
In the following post I tried to summarize the lessons from</p><p>3 0.70633966 <a title="607-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-16-The_NewSQL_Market_Breakdown.html">1025 high scalability-2011-04-16-The NewSQL Market Breakdown</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matt Aslett from the 451 group created a term called  “NewSQL ”. On the definition of NewSQL, Aslett writes:
  

“NewSQL” is our shorthand for the various new scalable/high performance SQL database vendors. We have previously referred to these products as ‘ScalableSQL’ to differentiate them from the incumbent relational database products. Since this implies horizontal scalability, which is not necessarily a feature of all the products, we adopted the term ‘NewSQL’ in the new report.


And to clarify, like NoSQL, NewSQL is not to be taken too literally: the new thing about the NewSQL vendors is the vendor, not the SQL.

  
As with NoSQL, under the NewSQL umbrella you can see various providers, with various solutions.
 
I think these can be divided into several sub-types:

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by     Frédéric Faure      (architect at    Ysance   ), you can follow him on    twitter   .  
 
Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it’s true that the marketing wave of NoSQL has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that’s been around for quite a while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all, everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very p</p><p>5 0.64925581 <a title="607-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-23-When_to_migrate_your_database%3F.html">782 high scalability-2010-02-23-When to migrate your database?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming your business – reports are out of date, your batch processing window is nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database consolidation – remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware, OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are clear,  what now?﻿

<p>Introduction: From their website:    FAI  is an automated installation tool to install or deploy Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat, autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used for configuration management of a running system.  You can take one or more virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed, configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized management system for your Linux deployment.  
   
  FAI's target group are system administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a rendering farm,</p><p>same-blog 3 0.84455007 <a title="607-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-26-Database_Optimize_patterns.html">607 high scalability-2009-05-26-Database Optimize patterns</a></p>

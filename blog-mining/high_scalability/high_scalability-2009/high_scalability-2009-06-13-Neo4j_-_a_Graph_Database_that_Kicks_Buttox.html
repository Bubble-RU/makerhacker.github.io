<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw materials like iron. Then isn’t it  ironic , in the  Alanis Morissette  sense,  that in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles of stuff?  It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.
 
The piles of stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff. Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags, friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a valu</p><p>5 0.32178891 <a title="628-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-14-When_all_the_Program%27s_a_Graph_-_Prismatic%27s_Plumbing_Library.html">1406 high scalability-2013-02-14-When all the Program's a Graph - Prismatic's Plumbing Library</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.
 
Then you may observe after coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form of interacting patterns of flows.
 
Then you may think hey, a program isn't only useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over data and flow over other flows.
 
That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making available in the Graph extension to their  plumbing  package ( code examples ), which is described in an excellent post:  Graph: Abstractions for Structured Computation .

<p>Introduction: GraphChi  uses a  Parallel Sliding Windows  method which can: process a graph with mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of computation.
 
 
 
The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar to  Pregel , which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style of MapReduce.  Streaming graph updates  are supported.
 
About GraphChi, Carlos Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,  says :
  

A Mac Mini running GraphChi can analyze Twitter's social graph from 2010—which contains 40 million users and 1.2 billion connections—in 59 minutes. "The previous published result on this problem took 400 minutes using a cluster of about 1,000 computers

<p>Introduction: With the success of  Neo4j  as a graph database in the NoSQL revolution, it's interesting to see another graph database,   HyperGraphDB , in the mix. Their quick blurb on HyperGraphDB says it is a:   general purpose, extensible, portable, distributed, embeddable, open-source data storage mechanism. It is a graph database designed specifically for artificial intelligence and semantic web projects, it can also be used as an embedded object-oriented database for projects of all sizes. 
 
From the  NoSQL Archive  the summary on HyperGraphDB is: API:  Java  (and Java Langs), Written in: Java ,  Query Method:  Java  or P2P, Replication:  P2P , Concurrency:  STM , Misc: Open-Source, Especially for AI and Semantic Web.
 
So it has some interesting features, like software transactional memory and     P2P   for data distribution  , but I found that my first and most obvious question was not answered: what the heck is a  hypergraph  and why do I care? Buried in the tutorial was:

<p>Introduction: Update:   Social networks in the database: using a graph database . A nice post on representing, traversing, and performing other common social network operations using a graph database.  If you are  Digg  or  LinkedIn  you can build your own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network relationships. For those of more modest means  Neo4j , a graph database, is a good alternative.  A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges (relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs) on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for relationships."  A graph looks something like:    For more lovely examples take a look at the  Graph Image Gal</p><p>2 0.95735466 <a title="628-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-06-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_Aug_6%2C_2010.html">873 high scalability-2010-08-06-Hot Scalability Links for Aug 6, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Twitter Sees Its 20 Billionth Tweet  writes  Marshall Kirkpatrick of ReadWriteWeb. 
  Startups die for not having customers, so STOP thinking about how to scale . Alessandro Orsi says  focusing on the architecture and scaling possibilities of your app for millions of users is just plain dumb...concentrate on marketing...concentrate on user experience . Alessandro is perfectly correct, but this isn't the year the 2000 when the default architecture that is easy is also not scalable and when sites were built from scratch one painful user at a time.  Today neither is tue. In the era of social networks, where Facebook has 500 million users, successful applications can and often do spike to millions of users seemingly overnight. And you have to have some architecture. With today's tool-chains you don't have to choose easy and non-scalable. There are other options. Of course, it's all pointless without customers and that is what you need to worry about, but it's a false choice in this era to</p><p>3 0.95231456 <a title="628-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-06-An_Unorthodox_Approach_to_Database_Design_%3A_The_Coming_of_the_Shard.html">672 high scalability-2009-08-06-An Unorthodox Approach to Database Design : The Coming of the Shard</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Why you don’t want to shard.  by Morgon on the MySQL Performance Blog.  Optimize everything else first, and then if performance still isn’t good enough, it’s time to take a very bitter medicine.    Update 3:   Building Scalable Databases: Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemes  by Dare Obasanjo. Excellent discussion of why and when you would choose a sharding architecture, how to shard, and problems with sharding.  Update 2:   Mr. Moore gets to punt on sharding  by Alan Rimm-Kaufman of 37signals. Insightful article on design tradeoffs and the evils of premature optimization. With more memory, more CPU, and new tech like SSD,  problems can be avoided before more exotic architectures like sharding are needed.  Add features not infrastructure.  Jeremy Zawodny  says he's wrong wrong wrong. we're running multi-core CPUs at slower clock speeds. Moore won't save you.

<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary. Thanks for the thought though.  It's been a long long long process. Importing a largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things. I'll explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia that needs to be handled to make the move complete:

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Yurii responds with the  Top 10 Reasons to Avoid Document Databases FUD .     Update:  Top 10 Reasons to Avoid the SimpleDB Hype  by Ryan Park provides a well written counter take. Am I really that fawning? If so, doesn't that make me a dear?      All your life you've used a relational database. At the tender age of five you banged out your first SQL query to track your allowance. Your RDBMS allegiance was just assumed, like your politics or religion would have been assumed 100 years ago. They now say--you know them--that relations won't scale and we have to do things differently. New databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are what's different. As a long time RDBMS user what can you expect of SimpleDB? That's what Alex Tolley of MyMeemz.com set out to discover. Like many brave explorers before him, Alex gave a report of his adventures to the Royal Society of the   AWS Meetup  .

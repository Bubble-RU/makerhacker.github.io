<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: Amir Salihefendic, founder of Todoist and Wedoist, in   How to create very reliable web services   , has written an insightful post on strategies for creating reliable web services along with the tools needed to make it happen.  
  
   Realtime monitor everything   . Create a clear picture of what's going on at any time both past and present. Keep a log of errors and key application metrics. Visualize response times and other metrics for every computer in your network. Tools:    statsd   ,    Graphite   ,    Pingdom   ,    Cacti   ,    Nagios   .  
    Be proactive    . Don't optimize prematurely, but don't wait to optimize when in a crisis situation. Anticipate problems before they happen by monitoring and completely understanding your system. Think now about how to scale your system if load increases by several orders of magnitude.  
   Be notified when crashes happen   . Use tools like    Pingdom    and    crash_hound    to send notifications when problems do occur.

<p>Introduction: Unlike many of the existing Platforms, in this second-generation phase, its not going to be enough to package and bundle different individual middleware services and products (Web Containers, Messaging, Data, Monitoring, Automation and Control, Provisioning) and brand them under the same name to make them look as one. (Fusion? Fabric? A rose is a rose by any other name - and in this case, it's not a rose.)
 
The second-generation PaaS needs to come with a holistic approach that couples all those things together and provide a complete holistic experience. By that I mean that if I add a machine into cluster, I need to see that as an increase in capacity on my entire application stack, the monitoring system needs to discover that new machine and start monitoring it without any configuration setup, the load-balancer need to add it to its pool and so forth.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Benjamin Wootton , CTO of  Contino , a London based consultancy specialising in applying DevOps and Continuous Delivery to software delivery projects.  
 
Microservices are a style of software architecture that involves delivering systems as a set of very small, granular, independent  collaborating services.
 
Though they aren't a particularly new idea, Microservices seem to have exploded in popularity this year, with articles, conference tracks, and Twitter streams waxing lyrical about the benefits of building software systems in this style.
 
This popularity is partly off the back of trends such as Cloud, DevOps and Continuous Delivery coming together as enablers for this kind of approach, and partly off the back of great work at companies such as Netflix who have very visibly applied the pattern to great effect.
 
Let me say up front that I am a fan of the approach.  Microservices architectures have lots of very real and significant benefits:

<p>Introduction: Yesterday, I had a session during the  OpenStack Summit   where I tried to present a more general view on how we should be thinking about PaaS in the context of OpenStack.
 
The key takeaway :
 
The main goal of PaaS is to drive productivity into the  process  by which we can deliver new applications.
 
Most of the existing PaaS solutions take a fairly extreme approach with their abstraction of the underlying infrastructure and therefore fit a fairly small number of extremely simple applications and thus miss the real promise of PaaS.
 
Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk took a more bottom up approach giving us better set of tradeoffs between the abstraction and control which makes it more broadly applicable to a larger set of applications.

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like? Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing. Specifically the  InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group  (IPNSIG).
 
 
 
 Ansible-like  faster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning telegraph system.
 
It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances and with much  longer delays :
  

The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2] Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances, so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to large delays and</p><p>2 0.87546581 <a title="702-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala_-_P2P_Online_Storage_Cloud.html">368 high scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala - P2P Online Storage Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show you how! They have   launched Wuala  , the social online storage service which scales as new nodes join the P2P network.     The goal of   Wua.la   is to provide distributed online storage that is:     large   scalable   reliable   secure     by harnessing the idle resources of participating computers.     This challenge is an old dream of computer science. In fact as   Andrew Tanenbaum   wrote in 1995:    "The design of a world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise for the reader"      After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system, Caleido is ready to unveil the resu</p><p>same-blog 3 0.87120908 <a title="702-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-11-The_interactive_cloud.html">702 high scalability-2009-09-11-The interactive cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How many times have you been called in the middle of the night by your operation guys telling you that your application throws some odd red alerts? How many times did you found out that when those issues happens you don't have enough information to analyze this incident? have you tried to increase the log level just to find out that your problem became even worse - now your application throws tons of information in a continues basis most of which is complete garbage...  The current separation between the way we implement our application and the way we manage it leads to many of this ridicules situations. Cloud makes those things even worse.  In  this post  i suggest an alternative approach. Why don't we run our application the way we run our business?  I refer to this approach as the "interactive cloud" where our application behaves just like our project team and the operations just like our managers. As with our business our application would need to take more responsibility to the wa</p><p>4 0.8632499 <a title="702-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Sharding_with_Cookie-Based_Session_Storage.html">207 high scalability-2008-01-10-Sharding with Cookie-Based Session Storage</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you look at the early days of this blog, when web scalability was still in its heady bloom of youth, many of the articles had to do with leveraging  MySQL  and  memcached . Exciting times. Shard MySQL to handle high write loads, cache objects in memcached to handle high read loads, and then write a lot of glue code to make it all work together. That was state of the art, that was how it was done. The architecture of many major sites still follow this pattern today, largely because with enough elbow grease, it works.
 
This was a pre-cloud, relational database dominated world, built from parts scrounged from the remnants of enterprises and datacenters past.  Twitter  and  Digg  started in this era, but are evolving into something different, as scaling pressures increase and new purpose built technologies pop into being.
 
With a little perspective, it's clear the MySQL+memcached era is passing. It will stick around for a while. Old technologies seldom fade away completely.

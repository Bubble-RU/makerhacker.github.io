<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting
HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting
services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary.
Thanks for the thought though.It's been a long long long process. Importing a
largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like
dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the
site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm
betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things.I'll
explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia
that needs to be handled to make the move complete:If you have a user account
and have posted on HighScalability before then you have a user account, but
since I don't know your passwords I had to make new passwords up for you. So

you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before
you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful
enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied
life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites
siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its
best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?If I ever believed this I
certainly don't believe it anymore. The world has changed, even since

by a link on Yahoo's main page that caused an almost instantaneous 650,000

own properties can handle the truly massive flow from the main page. Turning
theGreat Eyeof the Internet towards an unsuspecting newborn site must be quite
the diaper ready experience. Theo Schlossnagle eerily prophesized about such
events inThe Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture:
massive, unexpected and sudden traffic spikes will become more common as a
fickle internet seeks ever for new entertainments (my summary). Exactly

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAndy Gelfond, VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy
has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the
earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and
operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site.
There's an update for this article atAn Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run
On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment. For TripAdvisor, scalability is woven into
our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture,
development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture
and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a
scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and
deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a
culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and
effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable consumer

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post bySiddharth Anand, a senior member of LinkedIn's
Distributed Data Systems team.Over the past 3 years, I've had the good fortune
to work with many emerging NoSQL products in the context of supporting the
needs of a high-traffic, customer facing web site.In 2010, I helped Netflix to
successfullytransition its web scale use-cases from Oracle to SimpleDB, AWS'
hosted database service. On completion of that migration, we started a second
migration, this time from SimpleDB to Cassandra. The first transition was key
to our move from our own data center to AWS' cloud. The second was key to our
expansion from one AWS Region to multiple geographically-distributed Regions
-- today Netflix serves traffic out of two AWS Regions, one in Virginia, the
other in Ireland (F1). Both of these transitions have been successful, but
have involved integration pain points such as the creation of database
replication technology.In December 2011, I moved to LinkedIn's Distributed

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things we are seeing is more tools and tool chains for
performing very high level operations quite simply.Vagrantis such a tool
forbuilding and distributing virtualized development environments.Web
developers use virtual environments every day with their web applications.
From EC2 and Rackspace Cloud to specialized solutions such as EngineYard and
Heroku, virtualization is the tool of choice for easy deployment and
infrastructure management. Vagrant aims to take those very same principles and
put them to work in the heart of the application lifecycle. By providing easy
to configure, lightweight, reproducible, and portable virtual machines
targeted at development environments, Vagrant helps maximize your productivity
and flexibility.If you've created a build and deployment system before Vagrant
does a lot of the work for you:Automated virtual machine creation
usingOracle's VirtualBoxAutomated provisioning of virtual environments

<p>Introduction: A firestorm of accusations circled around recently saying that Cassandra, the
elected-by-major-adopters emperor of the NoSQL movement, has no clothes. It
was said Twitter was dumping Cassandra; Reddit outages were linked to
Cassandra; and even Facebook, Cassandra's cradle of birth, was said to have
abandoned Cassandra. Shouts of NoSQL Fail! were heard in the streets. Much
gloating followed. Is the emperor really naked? Casually dressed maybe, but
not naked.(Note: after this point the article contains a flow chart that is
NSFW. Some people are very sensitive about cussing, so if that's you, please
go back, don't read on. Danger! There are no nude pictures or anything, just
some strong language. But this is my most favorite flow chart of all time, so
it's worth it :-)Is Twitter really abandoning Cassandra? Not according to
Twitter, which came out with a post,Cassandra at Twitter Today, explaining
that they are using Cassandra in production for geolocation and analytics.

<p>Introduction: I first heard an enthusiastic endorsement ofSquarespacestreaming from the
ubiquitousLeo Laporteon one of his many Twit Live shows. Squarespace as afully
hosted, completely managed environment for creating and maintaining a website,
blog or portfoliowas of interest to me because they promise scalability and
this site doesn't have enough of that. But sadly, since they don't offer a
link preserving Drupal import our relationship was not meant to be.When a fine
reader of High Scalability, Brian Egge, (and all my readers are thrifty,
brave, and strong) asked me how Squarespace scaled I said I didn't know, but I
would try and find out. I emailed Squarespace a few questions and founder
Anthony Casalena and Director of Technical Operations Rolando Berrios were
kind enough to reply in some detail. The questions were both from Brian and
myself. Answers can be found below.Two things struck me most about
Squarespace's approach:They based their system on a memory grid, in this case

<p>Introduction: It's been awhile since I've said anything about collectl and I wanted to let
this group know I'm currently working on an interface to ganglia since I've
seen a variety of posts ranging from how much data to log and where to log it
as well as which tools/mechanism to use for logging. From my perspective there
are essentially 2 camps on the monitoring front - one says to have distributed
agents all sending their data to a central point, but don't send too much or
too often. The other camp (which is the one I'm in) says do it all locally
with a highly efficient data collector, because you need a lot of data (I also
read a post in here about logging everything) and you can't possibly monitors
100s or 1Ks of nodes remotely at the granularity necessary to get anything
meaningful.Enter collectl and its evolving interface for ganglia. This will
allow you to log lots of detailed data on local nodes at the usual 10 sec
interval (or more frequent if you prefer) at about 0.1% system overhead while</p><p>6 0.96944356 <a title="691-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_5%2C_2011.html">1093 high scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 5, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We can all learn from problems. The Google App Engine team has created a
teachable moment through a remarkably honest and forthcomingpost-mortem for
February 24th, 2010 outagepost, chronicling in elaborate detail a power outage
that took down Google App Engine for a few hours.The world is ending! The
cloud is unreliable! Jump ship! Not. This is not evidence that the cloud is a
beautiful, powerful and unsinkable ship that goes down on its maiden voyage.
Stuff happens, no matter how well you prepare. If you think private
datacenters don't go down, well, then I have some rearangeable deck chairs to
sell you. The goal is to keep improving and minimizing those failure windows.
From that perspective there is a lot to learn from the problems the Google App
Engine team encountered and how they plan to fix them.Please read the article
for all the juicy details, but here's what struck me as key:Power fails. Plan
for it. This seems to happen with unexpected frequency for such expensive and

<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling
65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate
problemBuddyPokeco-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution
at Wednesday'sFacebook Meetup. Slides for the complete talk arehere. For those
not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets
users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line
avatars.In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application.
It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play
mechanics, viral loops, and creative monetization strategies are all part of
if its everyday conceptualization. It mashes together different technologies,
not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way, but in a smart way that gets the
most bang for the buck. Part of it runs on Facebook servers (free). Part of it
runs on flash in a browser (free). Part of it runs on a storage cloud (higher
cost)</p><p>3 0.84139985 <a title="1112-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-14-Strategy%3A_Cache_Application_Start_State_to_Reduce_Spin-up_Times.html">1023 high scalability-2011-04-14-Strategy: Cache Application Start State to Reduce Spin-up Times</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as
a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. --
CorinthiansWith this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs.I
like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them
just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.-- Sylvain onGoogle GroupsThe
dream is dead. Google App Engine's boldpay for what you usedream dies as it
leaves childish things behind and becomes areal product.Pricing will change.
Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will
change. But Google App Engine will survive. Google isshutting downmany of
itsprojects. GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank
for it surving the more wood behindmore deadly arrows push? Without a radical
and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote
in the long scroll of good ideas. The urgency involved is clearly reflected in

sorts 1 petabyte of data using 8000 computers in 33 minutes; 1 Billion on
Social Networks;Tumblr at 10 Billion Posts;Twitter at 100 Million
Users;Testing at Google Scale: 1800 builds, 120 million test suites, 60
million tests run daily.From theDash Memoon Google's Plan:Go is a very
promising systems-programming language in the vein of C++. We fully hope and
expect that Go becomes the standard back-end language at Google over the next
few years.On GAE Go can load from a cold start in 100ms and the typical
instance size is 4MB. Is it any wonder Go is a go? Should we expect to see
Java and Python deprecated because Go is so much cheaper to run at
scale?Potent Quotables:@caciufo: 30x more scalability w/ many-core. So perf

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>6 0.96648777 <a title="1112-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-10-WAN_Accelerate_Your_Way_to_Lightening_Fast_Transfers_Between_Data_Centers.html">119 high scalability-2007-10-10-WAN Accelerate Your Way to Lightening Fast Transfers Between Data Centers</a></p>

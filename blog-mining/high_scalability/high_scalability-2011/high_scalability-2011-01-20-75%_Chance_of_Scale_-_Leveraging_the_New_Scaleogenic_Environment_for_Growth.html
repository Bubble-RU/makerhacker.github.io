[sent-5, score-0.357]
</p><p>2 Tumblr is a good example of a product that grew beyond expectation because they managed both to execute and harness powerful growth factors. [sent-11, score-0.301]
</p><p>3 From  Tumblr :     Frankly, keeping up with growth has presented more work than our small team was prepared for — with traffic now climbing more than 500M pageviews each month. [sent-13, score-0.235]
</p><p>4 500 million pageviews a month is an amazing accomplishment. [sent-16, score-0.225]
</p><p>5 5 billion pageviews a month, and is now growing by 300 million pageviews per month and 25,000 new users a day. [sent-19, score-0.433]
</p><p>6 We usually don't think so, but applications are being built today in a  scaleogenic environment  that tends to encourage growth. [sent-41, score-0.581]
</p><p>7 S caleogenic  is a play on the word  obesogenic , which is a term for  factors tending to make individuals fat, creating  an environment that promotes gaining weight. [sent-42, score-0.227]
</p><p>8 We have a genetic propensity towards obesity as a survival mechanism, but that's just part of the story, the larger part is how our environment has changed to be one where cheap, high-caloric food and is always available and we need very little exercise to live. [sent-43, score-0.374]
</p><p>9 While not quite as powerful a force, we are seeing applications being deployed inside a  scaleogenic environment,  where a combination of factors can make an a application need to scale and scale quickly. [sent-45, score-0.826]
</p><p>10 Part of this environment has only recently been created in the form of app stores, social networks, and the explosion of mobile devices. [sent-46, score-0.456]
</p><p>11 Another part of this environment is quite self-consciously constructed, it has to do with applications using viral loops, gameification, social networking, and other techniques to create and leverage rapid growth factors. [sent-47, score-0.519]
</p><p>12 But they do increase the chances and increased chances means taking this part of your architecture seriously could pay off. [sent-50, score-0.321]
</p><p>13 Zynga and Playfish needed to scale to  hundreds of millions of users  quickly because they figured out how to harness  the power of social networks  in their game design. [sent-54, score-0.4]
</p><p>14 We are seeing this growth strategy used by nearly all categories of software now. [sent-55, score-0.176]
</p><p>15 Paul Scott's tweet  neatly summarizes the impact of mobile:  Holy crap, so when I launch the mobile client for this thing, they expect 100x more users to join. [sent-57, score-0.26]
</p><p>16 Evernote's experience  releasing on the Mac app store  offers another good case study for both the power of mobile and the power of app stores. [sent-65, score-0.359]
</p><p>17 Over 70% of Evernote’s new users came from mobile app stores in the last year. [sent-66, score-0.397]
</p><p>18 This has become a popular business model, but when you give away the milk a lot of people will suddenly want milkshakes, and that requires the ability to scale quickly at a very low cost. [sent-90, score-0.213]
</p><p>19 We are seeing a perfect storm of conditions for creating a scaleogenic environment that requires thinking about building scalable applications from the start:     Large pools of users are now being aggregated by social networks and mobile devices of all types. [sent-91, score-0.968]

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.  
 
Have we reached the end of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The End of" headlines. We've reached  The End of History  because the Western liberal democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government."  We've reached  The End of Science  because of the "fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions." We've even reached  The End of Theory  because all answers can be found in the continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're at  The End of the World ?
 
Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?
 
For a while I thought this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is because of the slow down of potential articles at m</p><p>3 0.74640226 <a title="976-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_4th%2C_2014.html">1626 high scalability-2014-04-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 4th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's being reportedYahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion. You may
recallInstagram was profiled on HighScalabilityand they were also bought by
Facebook for a ton of money. A coincidence? You be the judge.Just what is
Yahoo buying? The business acumen of the deal is not something I can judge,
but if you are doing due diligence on the technology then Tumblr would
probably get a big thumbs up. To see why, please keep on reading...With over
15 billion page views a month Tumblr has become an insanely popular blogging
platform. Users may like Tumblr for its simplicity, its beauty, its strong
focus on user experience, or its friendly and engaged community, but like it
they do.Growing at over 30% a month has not been without challenges. Some
reliability problems among them. It helps to realize that Tumblr operates at
surprisingly huge scales: 500 million page views a day, a peak rate of ~40k
requests per second, ~3TB of new data to store a day, all running on 1000+
servers.One of the common patt</p><p>6 0.73030353 <a title="976-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-13-Tumblr_Architecture_-_15_Billion_Page_Views_a_Month_and_Harder_to_Scale_than_Twitter.html">1191 high scalability-2012-02-13-Tumblr Architecture - 15 Billion Page Views a Month and Harder to Scale than Twitter</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Matt Abrams (@abramsm), from Clearspring, discussing how they are able to accurately estimate the cardinality of sets with billions of distinct elements using surprisingly small data structures. Their servers receive well over 100 billion events per month.  
 
At  Clearspring  we like to count things. Counting the number of distinct elements (the cardinality) of a set is challenge when the cardinality of the set     is large.
 
To better understand the challenge of determining the cardinality of large sets let's imagine that you have a 16 character ID and you'd like to count the number of distinct IDs that you've     seen in your logs. Here is an example:
 
4f67bfc603106cb2
 
 These 16 characters represent 128 bits. 65K IDs would require 1   megabyte of space. We receive over 3 billion events per day, and each   event has an ID. Those IDs require 384,000,000,000 bits or 45   gigabytes of storage.  And that is just the space that the ID field requires!

<p>Introduction: Inspired by a  xkcd comic ,  Peter Norvig ,  Director of Research at Google and all around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful systems profiled on HighScalability.  
 
 The original code is at  xkcd 1313: Regex Golf , which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's deliberate strategy for finding a regex.  
 
 The post demonstrating the iterated improvement of the program is at  xkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite Problems) . As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the program Peter recommends the following steps:

<p>Introduction: Hi,     In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought is   class ReferenceIdGenerator {   public static setReferenceId(String login) {      threadLocal.set(login + System.currentMillis());   }     public static String getReferenceId() {     return threadLocal.get();   }   private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =       new ThreadLocal();       }     class MySevlet {     void service(.....) {       HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);      String userId = session.get("userId");          ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId</p><p>4 0.94724715 <a title="976-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-16-The_NewSQL_Market_Breakdown.html">1025 high scalability-2011-04-16-The NewSQL Market Breakdown</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matt Aslett from the 451 group created a term called  “NewSQL ”. On the definition of NewSQL, Aslett writes:
  

“NewSQL” is our shorthand for the various new scalable/high performance SQL database vendors. We have previously referred to these products as ‘ScalableSQL’ to differentiate them from the incumbent relational database products. Since this implies horizontal scalability, which is not necessarily a feature of all the products, we adopted the term ‘NewSQL’ in the new report.


And to clarify, like NoSQL, NewSQL is not to be taken too literally: the new thing about the NewSQL vendors is the vendor, not the SQL.

  
As with NoSQL, under the NewSQL umbrella you can see various providers, with various solutions.
 
I think these can be divided into several sub-types:
  
  New MySQL storage engines . These give MySQL users the same programming interface, but scale very well. You can Xeround or Akiban in this field. The good part is that you still use MySQL, but on the downside it’s n</p><p>5 0.94692552 <a title="976-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-25-SongPop_Scales_to_1_Million_Active_Users_on_GAE%2C_Showing_PaaS_is_not_Pass%C3%A9.html">1412 high scalability-2013-02-25-SongPop Scales to 1 Million Active Users on GAE, Showing PaaS is not Passé</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Should you use PaaS for your next project? Often the answer is no because you want control, but here's an example from  SongPop  showing why the promise of PaaS is not passé. SongPop was able to autoscale to 60 million users, 1 million daily active users, deliver 17 terabytes/day of songs and images worldwide, handle 10k+ queries/second, all with a 6 person engineering team, and only one engineer working full-time on the backend.
 
Unfortunately there aren't a lot of details, but what there is can be found in  Scaling SongPop to 60 million users with App Engine and Google Cloud Storage . The outline follows the script. You start small. Let PaaS do the heavy lifting. And when you need to scale you just buy more resources and tune a little (maybe a lot). The payoff is you get to focus on feature development and can get by with a small team.
 
Here's a diagram of their architecture:

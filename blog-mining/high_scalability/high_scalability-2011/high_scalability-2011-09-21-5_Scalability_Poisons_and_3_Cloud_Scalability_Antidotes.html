<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing recent AWS price changes,seldo
mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good
question was asked:How do you even do anything without using EBS?Amazon
certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability
record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This
avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as
AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS
services like RDS or ELB.If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where
to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls gives a great answer:Well,
you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that,
you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual
node failure. I prefer to believe that if you can't roll your entire

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.How do you scale anAWS(Amazon Web Services) infrastructure?
This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can
use to make the most of Amazon's dynamic approach, and the architectural model
you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.I base my report on my
experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming
(Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS
(Geographic Information System). It's true that my experience in gaming
(IsCool, The Game) is currently the most representative in terms of
scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU - daily active
users - at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my
experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different
view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability
and data management.

<p>Introduction: Authored by Chris Fregly:  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS
Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.Ahead of the
upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi's
recentpresentationat an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few
of my recentFluxcapacitor.com consulting engagements, I've compiled a list of
10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS.1) Query AWS resource
metadata Can't remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge
cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?
awsnow.infois the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.
Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You're in luck.
There's now aREST API, as well!Note:  These are default soft limits and will
vary by account.2) Tame your S3 buckets Delete an entire S3 bucket with a

<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with theirProvisioned IOPSfor RDS,
EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn
a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model.
You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous
cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used.
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?Rodrigo
Campos put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he
describes inIOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012.The
result?Yes, AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and
Higher Performance IO:It is clear that the provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer
a huge performance upgrade when compared to the non-optimized EBS volumes, but
as data has to be spread among more underlying disks or systems, it seems that
the volume is increasingly more susceptible to performance

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.This blog post will tell you exactly how to build
a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-
terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays,
actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.You need to
know:Which SSDs workWhich chassis workHow to configure your RAID cardsIntel's
SATA solutions - combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell
R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized
database likeAerospike, enables high throughput and low latency.In a wide
configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can
cost-effectively serve at high throughput with 16T at $2.50 per GB with the

<p>Introduction: Sean Hullwith two helpful posts:5 Things That are Toxic to Scalability:Object
Relational Mappers.Create complex queries that hard to optimize and
tweak.Synchronous, Serial, Coupled or Locking Processes.Locks are like stop
signs, traffic circles keep the traffic flowing. Row level locking is better
than table level locking. Use async replication. Use eventual consistency for
clusters.One Copy of Your Database.A single database server is a choke point.
Create parallel databases and let a driver select between them.Having No
Metrics.Visualize what's happening to your system using one of the many
monitoring packages.Lack of Feature Flags.Be able to turn off features via a
flag so when a spike hits features can be turned off to reduce load.3 Ways to
Boost Cloud Scalability:Use Auto-scaling.Spin-up new instances when a
threshold is passed and back down again when traffic drops.Horizontally Scale

<p>Introduction: Harish Ganesan CTO of8KMiles has a very helpful blog, Cloud, Big Data and
Mobile, where he shows a nice analytical bent which leads to a lot of
practical advice and cost saving tips:Use SQS Batch Requests to reduce the
number of requests hitting SQS which saves costs. Sending 10 messages in a
single batch request which in the example save $30/month.Use SQS Long Polling
to reduce extra polling requests, cutting down empty receives, which in the
example saves ~$600 in empty receive leakage costs.Choose the right search
technology choice to save costs in AWS by matching your activity pattern to
the technology. For a small application with constant load or a heavily
utilized search tier or seasonal loads Amazon Cloud Search looks like the cost
efficient play. Use Amazon CloudFront Price Class to minimize costs by
selecting the right Price Class for your audience to potentially reduce
delivery costs by excluding Amazon CloudFront's more expensive edge
locations.Optimize ElastiCache Cluster</p><p>4 0.87906003 <a title="1121-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-23-Salesforce_Architecture_-_How_they_Handle_1.3_Billion_Transactions_a_Day.html">1521 high scalability-2013-09-23-Salesforce Architecture - How they Handle 1.3 Billion Transactions a Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post written byClaude Johnson, a Lead Site Reliability
Engineer atsalesforce.com.The following is an architectural overview of
salesforce.com's core platform and applications. Other systems such as
Heroku's Dyno architecture or the subsystems of other products such as
work.com and do.com are specifically not covered by this material, although
database.com is. The idea is to share with the technology community some
insight about how salesforce.com does what it does. Any mistakes or omissions
are mine.This is by no means comprehensive but if there is interest, the
author would be happy to tackle other areas of how salesforce.com works.
Salesforce.com is interested in being more open with the technology
communities that we have not previously interacted with. Here's to the start
of "Opening the Kimono" about how we work.Since 1999, salesforce.com has been
singularly focused on building technologies for business that are delivered
over the Internet, displacing traditional e</p><p>5 0.87212878 <a title="1121-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-23-This_stuff_isn%27t_taught%2C_you_learn_it_bit_by_bit_as_you_solve_each_problem..html">994 high scalability-2011-02-23-This stuff isn't taught, you learn it bit by bit as you solve each problem.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing
them." -- AristotleA really nice Internet moment happened in the HackerNews
thread Disqus: Scaling the World's Largest Django Application, when David
Kitchen crafted an awesome responseto a questionabout how you learn to build
scalable systems. It's so good I thought I would reproduce it
here.Question:asked by grovulent:Not like this is a problem I have to worry
about. But where on earth does one learn this stuff? The talk is useful - as
an overview of what they use - but I know nothing of how to implement a single
step.Answer: answered by David Kitchenofburo9:It's called experience. Which
perhaps sounds rude, but it's not meant to be.This stuff isn't taught per se,
you learn it bit by bit as you solve each problem that you face.I learned
about HAProxy when my site load exceeded that which a single web server could
manage.I learned about heartbeat when I had to update my HAProxy and it

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.
 
Let's change that.

<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users  by 2013. Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in  2012 . But let's be optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is the user leader with over  400 million users . Will Facebook stumble or will they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's "low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has  106 million  registered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one billion users served?
 
From recent infrastructure announcements and information gleaned at  Chirp  ( videos ) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal 2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) D</p><p>6 0.12159416 <a title="1145-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark_for_keeping_data_in_browser_in_AJAX_projects.html">565 high scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark for keeping data in browser in AJAX projects</a></p>

  @TomDSweeney : Alan Kay: “The past 30 years have been completely mundane. It’s all been scaling (of old technology) and Angry Birds”

 Quotable Quotes:                      
 
  @ML_Hipster : A machine learning researcher, a crypto-currency expert, and an Erlang programmer walk into a bar. Facebook buys the bar for $27 billion. 
 OH: Network effects don't happen on toll roads. 
  Benedict Evans : Google is a vast machine learning engine... and it spent 10-15 years building that learning engine and feeding it data. 
 
 
  Mining Experiment: Running 600 Servers for a Year Yields 0.4 Bitcoin . Yes, this is a far superior way of doing things. Chew up the commons for marginal gain. It's like old times. 
  Game designers, forget the sardines and go hunt some whale .  Swrve found : half of free-to-play games’ in-app purchases came from 0.15 percent of players. Only 1.5 percent of players of games in the Swrve network spent any money at all. 
 Google has a beta version of their  cloud pricing calculator .

<p>Introduction: Why is there something rather than nothing? That's the kind of question the  Large Hadron Collider  in CERN is hopefully poised to answer. And what is the output of this beautiful 17-mile long,  6 billion  dollar  wabi-sabish  proton smashing machine? Data. Great heaping torrents of Grand Canyon sized data. 15 million gigabytes every year. That's 1000 times the information printed in books every year. It's so much data 10,000 scientists will use a  grid  of  80,000+ computers , in 300 computer centers , in 50 different countries just to help make sense of it all.
 
How will all this data be collected, transported, stored, and analyzed? It turns out, using what amounts to sort of Internet of Particles instead of an Internet of Things.

  @cincura_net  : Wrong. *Shared* state kills scalability. 
  @kpshea  : When I think "cloud" computing, I imagine the gaseous Star Trek blob that ate red blood cells (your sensitive data). 
  @kotobuki  : I'm interested in scalability of personal fabrication. How to 'scale' in batch production stages will be a key, but still there are barriers. 
  @simonraikallen  : The two rules of scalability testing: (1) The bottleneck is always the database (2) You can never predict what the bottleneck will be.

<p>Introduction: If like many humans you've found even  Paxos Made Simple  a bit difficult to understand, you might enjoy RAFT as described in  In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm  by Stanford's  Diego Ongaro  and John Ousterhout. The video presentation of the paper is given by  John Ousterhout . Both the paper and the video are delightfully accessible.
 
 mcherm  has a good summary of the paper:
  
 A consensus algorithm is: a cluster of servers should record a series of records ("log entries") in response to requests from clients of the cluster. (It may also take action based on those entries.) It does so in a way that guarantees that the responses seen by clients of the cluster will be consistent EVEN in the face of servers crashing in unpredictable ways (but not loosing data that was synched to disk), and networks introducing unpredictable delays or communication blockages. 
  
 Here's what Raft does. First, it elects a leader, then the leader records the master version of the log, t</p><p>4 0.89430118 <a title="1145-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-16-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_June_16%2C_2010.html">842 high scalability-2010-06-16-Hot Scalability Links for June 16, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You're Doing it Wrong  by Poul-Henning Kamp. Don't look so guilty, he's not talking about you know what, he's talking about writing high-performance server programs:  Not just wrong as in not perfect, but wrong as in wasting half, or more, of your performance. What good is an  O(log2(n))  algorithm if those operations cause page faults and slow disk operations? For most relevant datasets an  O(n)  or even an  O(n^2)  algorithm, which avoids page faults, will run circles around it.   
  A Microsoft Windows Azure primer: the basics  by Peter Bright. Nice article explaining the basics of Azure and how it compares to Google and Amazon. 
 A call to change the name from  NoSQL to Postmodern Databases . Interesting idea, but the problem is the same one I have for Postmodern Art, when is it? I always feel like I'm in the post-post modern period, yet for art it's really in the early 1900s. Let's save future developers from this existential time crisis.

<p>Introduction: I remember the excitement of when Twitter first opened up their firehose.  As an early adopter of the Twitter API I could easily imagine some of the cool things you could do with all that data. I also remember the disappointment of learning that in the land of BigData, data has a price, and that price would be too high for little fish like me. It was like learning for the first time there would be no BigData Santa Clause.
 
For a while though I had the pleasure of pondering just how I would handle all that data. It's a fascinating problem. You have to be able to reliably consume it, normalize it, merge it with other data, apply functions on it, store it, query it, distribute it, and oh yah, monetize it. Most of that in realish-time. And if you are trying to create a platform for allowing the entire Internet do to the same thing to the firehose, the challenge is exponentially harder.
 
DataSift is in the exciting position of creating just such a firehose eating, data chomping machine.

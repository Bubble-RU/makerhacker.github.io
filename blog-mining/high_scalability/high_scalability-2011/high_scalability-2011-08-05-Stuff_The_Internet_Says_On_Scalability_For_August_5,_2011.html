<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.    We have a few earl</p><p>5 0.16680665 <a title="1093-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud_AWS_Infrastructure_vs._Physical_Infrastructure.html">853 high scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud AWS Infrastructure vs. Physical Infrastructure</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Frédéric Faure   (architect at  Ysance )  on the differences between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frédéric was kind enough to translate the original French version of this article into English. 
 
I’ve been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such as  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) and a traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you. Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure. I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.

  9nm  : IBM's carbon nanotube transistor that outperforms silicon;  YouTube : 4 Billion Views/Day;  864GB RAM : 37signals Memcache,  $12K  
 Quotable Quotes:                 
 
  Chad Dickerson : You can only get growth by feeding opportunities. 
  @launchany : It amazes me how many NoSQL database vendors spend more time detailing their scalability and no time detailing the data model and design 
  Google : Let's make TCP faster. 
  WhatsApp : we are now able to easily push our systems to over 2 million tcp connections! 
  Sidney Dekker : In a complex system…doing the same thing twice will not predictably or necessarily lead to the same results. 
  @Rasmusfjord : Just heard about an Umbraco site running on Azure that handles 20.000 requests /*second*

 A Friday the 13th Postmorterama:                       
 
 James Hamilton with some  high powered perspective  on the report for the Fukushima Nuclear Accident. Apparently they haven't heard of the blameless post-mortem. Lots of interesting stuff, but this is a potentially disaster saving general lesson learned: operators can’t figure out what is happening or take appropriate action without detailed visibility into the state of the system. 
 Evernote with a nicely detailed note  on a recent outage . A kernel panic happened while upgrading two new “shard” servers with 3x as much RAM, SSDs instead of 15krpm disks, bonded networking, and an updated kernel. They had to revert and shite loves to happen when other shite happens. 
 Heroku with their  postmortem on what happened  when AWS went down. They lost 30% of their instances across 3 AZs in the US-East region. Rich detail on the impact of the AWS, but not much on what they can do about it</p><p>6 0.83938199 <a title="1093-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-12-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_12%2C_2013.html">1439 high scalability-2013-04-12-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 12, 2013</a></p>

  Google Uses About 900,000 Servers ;  eBay deploys 100TB of flash storage  
 The cloud isn't for closers.  Another gaming startup pulls back from the cloud  by Derrick Harris. Digital Chocolate is following the Zynga strategy of moving games into higher performing datacenter infrastructure once it becomes popular enough in the cloud to justify the primo stuff. We talked about this strategy in  Zynga's Z Cloud - Scale Fast Or Fail Fast By Merging Private And Public Clouds . An architectural approach made all the more sensible with Amazon's new  AWS Direct Connect  service, which enables lower latency and higher bandwidth services by skipping the Internet and connecting directly to the AWS network.  AWS Direct Connect FAQs .  Amazon Virtual Private Cloud .

<p>Introduction: You don't even have to make a bid, Randy Shoup, anÂ eBay Distinguished Architect, gives this  presentation  on how eBay scales, for free. Randy has done a fabulous job in this presentation and in other talks listed at the end of this post getting at the heart of the principles behind scalability. It's more about ideas of how things work and fit together than a focusing on a particular technology stack.
  Impressive Stats  
In case you weren't sure, eBay is big, with lots of: users, data, features, and change...
  
 Over 89 million active users worldwide 
 190 million items for sale in 50,000 categories 
 Over 8 billion URL requests per day 
 Hundreds of new features per quarter 
 Roughly 10% of items are listed or ended every day 
 In 39 countries and 10 languages 
 24x7x365 
 70 billion read / write operations / day 
 Processes 50TB of new, incremental data per day 
 Analyzes 50PB of data per day 
   10 Lessons

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up to  How will memristors change everything?  for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from  The SyNAPSE Project , was kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the  12th IEEE CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their Applications  - Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple more accessible presentations:

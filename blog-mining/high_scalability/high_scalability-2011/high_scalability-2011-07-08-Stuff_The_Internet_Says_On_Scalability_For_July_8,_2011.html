<p>Introduction: LevelDBis an exciting new entrant into the pantheon of embedded databases,
notable both for its pedigree, being authored by the makers of the now
mythical Google MapReduce and BigTable products, and for its emphasis on
efficient disk based random access using log-structured-merge (LSM) trees. The
plan is to keep LevelDB fairly low-level. The intention is that it will be a
useful building block for higher-level storage systems. Basho isalready
investigatingusing LevelDB as one if its storage engines.In the past many
systems were built around embedded databases, though most developers now use
database servers connected to via RPCs. An embedded database is a database
distributed as a library and linked directly into your application. The
application is responsible for providing a service level API, sharding,
backups, initiating consistency checking, initiation rollback,  startup,
shutdown, queries, etc. Applications become the container for the database and
the manager of the database.Arc</p><p>3 0.14971599 <a title="1076-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-17-Product%3A_Hadoop.html">601 high scalability-2009-05-17-Product: Hadoop</a></p>

allows you to skip programming Hadoop at the low map-reduce level. You don't
have to know Java. Using the Pig Latin language, which is a scripting data
flow language, you can think about your problem as a data flow program. 10

<p>Introduction: Many people in the Apache Hadoop community have asked Yahoo! to publish the
version of Apache Hadoop they test and deploy across their large Hadoop
clusters. As a service to the Hadoop community, Yahoo is releasing the Yahoo!
Distribution of Hadoop -- a source code distribution that is based entirely on
code found in the Apache Hadoop project.This source distribution includes code
patches that they have added to improve the stability and performance of their
clusters. In all cases, these patches have already been contributed back to
Apache, but they may not yet be available in an Apache release of Hadoop.Read

one that can do what it should: perform alter table operations faster, has
efficient queries when most of the data is on disk and not in RAM, and matches
their data that now looks more document oriented than relational. A lot of

<p>Introduction: The Peregrine falcon is a bird of prey, famous for itshigh speed
divingattacks, feeding primarily on much slower Hadoops. Wait, sorry, it is
Kevin Burton of Spinn3r's newPeregrine project--anew FAST modern map reduce
framework optimized for iterative and pipelined map reduce jobs--that feeds on
Hadoops.If you don't know Kevin, he does a lot of excellent technical work
that he's kind enough to share it onhis blog. Only he hasn't been blogging
much lately, he's been heads down working on Peregrine. Now that Peregrine has
been released, here's a short email interview with Kevin on why you might want
to take upfalconry, the ancient sport of MapReduce.What does Spinn3r do that
Peregrine is important to you?Ideally it was designed to execute pagerank but
many iterative applications that we deploy and WANT to deploy (k-means) would
be horribly inefficient under Hadoop as it doesn't have any support for
merging and joining IO between tasks.  It also doesn't support pipeline jobs

<p>Introduction: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores, by a number of MIT
researchers, is a refreshingly practical paper on what it takes to scale Linux
and common applications like Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake,
Psearchy, and MapReduce to run on 48 core systems. A very timely paper given
moderately massive multicore systems are reportedly the near future of
computing.This paper must have taken a lot of work. They both tracked down
bottlenecks in a number of applications and the Linux kernel and they also
tried to fix them. Modestly speaking the authors said they made "modest"
changes to the kernel and applications, but there's nothing modest about what
they did. It's excellent work.After the next bit, which is the abstract, there
is a list of the problems they found and how they fixed them.The abstract:This
paper analyzes the scalability of seven system applications (Exim, memcached,
Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce) running on Linux on a

<p>Introduction: I'm not sure what I was expecting the stack GOV.UK used at launch to look
like. Maybe some messenger owls and lots of cobwebs? But not so at all. So
much not so I thought any organization looking at their own stack for ideas
could learn something from the considered choices of others.The diversity of
technologies used was surprising. They use "at least five different
programming languages, three separate database types, two versions of an
operating system." Some may think of this as a weakness, but they think it a
strength:The reason we operate such a diverse ecosystem is that we are focused
on solving real problems. Our first task is to understand the problem or need
we are solving and then to choose the best tool for the job. If we restrict
ourselves to moulding the need to the tools we already have, then we risk not
solving the initial problem in the best way possible for the user. By

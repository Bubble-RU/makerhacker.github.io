<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

not complicated. [There's] just a lot of it." \--Richard Feynmanon how the

<p>Introduction: I found the discussion of the available bandwidth of tree vs higher
dimensional virtual networks topologies quite, to quote Spock,fascinating:A
mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developersof
Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that
theGnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,
theNapster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network
isseverely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a
millionpeers. In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have
overlooked theintrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the
Gnutella network:a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the
definition).Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher
dimensionaltopologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of
interconnectiontopologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware
implementations(see, e.g., Culler et al. 1996; Buyya 1999</p><p>2 0.87933612 <a title="1163-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-29-Gone_Fishin%27_Two.html">1350 high scalability-2012-10-29-Gone Fishin' Two</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy thatthe best method to analyse spam is to become a
spammer, this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely
researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part
Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that
their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they
figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales
they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.Two different spam campaigns were
run on aStormbotnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-
peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide
computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit
new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to
download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the
executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon. The
downloaded compone</p><p>same-blog 4 0.86965024 <a title="1163-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-23-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_23%2C_2011.html">1163 high scalability-2011-12-23-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 23, 2011</a></p>

appointments; iPad2 == 1986 Cray 2 6 processor super computer; Watson: 200

storage and backup. Where is my data? I'm kinda big deal after all! I should
have listened to my postdoc, he can build cheaper storage than you can.Nothing
stirs up more energy than when someone says they are abandoning and old
beloved framework for a newer sexier model. Feelings of betrayal and
abandonment leak over everything, which is always a good draw for reality

And here we see the response onHacker News. Python got the job done for

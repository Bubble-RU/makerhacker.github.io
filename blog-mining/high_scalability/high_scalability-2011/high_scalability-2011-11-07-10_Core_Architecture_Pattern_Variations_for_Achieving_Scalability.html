<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see how!     Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed in a format called   Alexandrian form which draws on constructs used by Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:     The pattern name   The problem the pattern is trying to solve     Context   Solution   Examples   Design rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why experts use it       Patterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context, and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next ‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO of  Parallel Universe , a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time applications. 
 
A little over a month ago, we open-sourced a new in-memory data grid called  Galaxy . An in-memory data grid, or IMDG, is a clustered data storage and processing middleware that uses RAM as the authoritative and primary storage, and distributes data over a cluster for purposes of data and processing scalability and high-availability. A common feature of IMDGs is co-location of code and data, meaning that application code runs on all cluster nodes, each instance processing those data items residing in the local node's RAM.
 
While quite a few commercial and open-source IMDGs are available (like Terracotta, Gigaspaces, Oracle Coherence, GemFire, Websphere eXtreme Scale, Infinispan and Hazelcast), Galaxy has adopted a completely different architecture from all other IMDGs, to service some usage scenarios ill-fitted to the othe</p><p>5 0.12213776 <a title="1138-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-01-Google_Strategy%3A_Tree_Distribution_of_Requests_and_Responses.html">981 high scalability-2011-02-01-Google Strategy: Tree Distribution of Requests and Responses</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node then that root node can become overwhelmed:
  
 The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal with the flood of requests. 
 The network interface becomes a bottleneck because a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an undisciplined system. 
  
One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.  Jeff Dean , Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this  Stanford video presentation :  Tree Distribution of Requests and Responses .
 
 
 
Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes. Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset</p><p>6 0.1140549 <a title="1138-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-16-Database_Sharding_for_startups.html">492 high scalability-2009-01-16-Database Sharding for startups</a></p>

  Load balancing / load sharing  - Spreading the load across many components with equal properties for handling the request 
  Partitioning  - Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to a component that owns that data specific           
 
  Vertical partitioning  - Spreading the load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions being handled by different processing units 
  Horizontal partitioning  - Spreading a single type of data element across many instances, according to some partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation, etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.

<p>Introduction: Ricky Ho  in  Scalable System Design Patterns  has created a great list of scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary of the patterns are:
  
  Load Balancer  - a dispatcher determines which worker instance will handle a request based on different policies. 
  Scatter and Gather  - a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the client. 
  Result Cache  - a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save the actual execution. 
  Shared Space  - all workers monitors information from the shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached. 
  Pipe and Filter  - all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.

<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture principles then take a look at Will Larson's  Introduction to Architecting Systems for Scale . Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:
  
    Load Balancing: Scalability & Redundancy . Horizontal scalability and redundancy are usually achieved via load balancing, the spreading of requests across multiple resources.    
 
    Smart Clients . The   client has a list of hosts and load balances across that list of hosts. Upside is simple for programmers. Downside is it's hard to update and change. 
    Hardware Load Balancers . Targeted at larger companies, this is dedicated load balancing hardware. Upside is performance. Downside is cost and complexity. 
    Software Load Balancers . The recommended approach, it's  software that handles load balancing, health checks, etc.

<p>Introduction: Hi,      I saw an year ago that Netapp sold netcache to blu-coat, my site is a heavy NetCache user and we cached 83% of our site. We tested with Blue-coat and F5 WA and we are not getting same performce as NetCache.      Any of you guys have the same issue? or somebody knows another product can handle much traffic?     Thanks   Rodrigo</p><p>same-blog 2 0.85413849 <a title="1138-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-07-10_Core_Architecture_Pattern_Variations_for_Achieving_Scalability.html">1138 high scalability-2011-11-07-10 Core Architecture Pattern Variations for Achieving Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Srinath Perera has put together a  strong list of architecture patterns  based on three meta patterns:  distribution, caching, and asynchronous processing. He contends these three are the primal patterns and the following patterns are but different combinations:
  
  LB (Load Balancers) + Shared nothing Units . Units that do not share anything with each other fronted with a load balancer that routes incoming messages to a unit based on some criteria. 
  LB + Stateless Nodes + Scalable Storage . Several stateless nodes talking to a scalable storage, and a load balancer distributes load among the nodes. 
  Peer to Peer Architectures (Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Content Addressable Networks (CAN)) . Algorithm for scaling up logarithmically. 
  Distributed Queues . Queue implementation (FIFO delivery) implemented as a network service. 
  Publish/Subscribe Paradigm . Network publish subscribe brokers that route messages to each other.

From their website:  CTL is a flexible distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to break management processes into reusable control modules and execute them in distributed fashion over the network.  What does CTL do? CTL helps you leverage your current scripts and tools to easily automate any kind of distributed systems management or application provisioning task. Its good for simplifiying large-scale scripting efforts or as another tool in your toolbox that helps you speed through your daily mix of ad-hoc administration tasks.  What are CTL's features? CTL has many features, but the general highlights are:  * Execute sophisticated procedures in distributed environments - Aren't you tired of writing and then endlessly modifying scripts that loop over nodes and invoke remot</p><p>4 0.82880598 <a title="1138-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce_With_Ruby_Using_Hadoop.html">968 high scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce With Ruby Using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job on your Hadoop cluster. You will  not  need to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other platforms running bash and Java.
  

  

 Fire-Up Your Hadoop Cluster 

I choose the  Cloudera distribution of Hadoop  which is still 100% Apache licensed, but has some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released by  Doug Cutting , who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also started  Lucene , which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see, is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.

<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for "Cloud  API  portability," which implies a series of misconceptions.
 
If we break away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without settling on a common Cloud  API. 
 
In this post i'll be covering five common misconceptions people have  WRT  to cloud portability.
  
  Cloud portability = Cloud API portability . API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.  
  The main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in .Cloud portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-in.  
  Cloud portability isnâ&euro;&trade;t for startups . Every startup that is expecting rapid growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared to do so.</p><p>6 0.779423 <a title="1138-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-28-Need_for_change_in_your_IT_infrastructure_.html">731 high scalability-2009-10-28-Need for change in your IT infrastructure </a></p>

 the architectural considerations behind their solution 
 why they chose memory over disk

<p>Introduction: Space-based architectures are an alternative to the traditional n-tier model for enterprise applications. Instead of a vertical tier partitioning, space based applications are partitioned horizontally into self-sufficient units. This leads to almost linear scalability of stateful, high-performance applications.  This is a  recording of a talk I did last month  where I introduce space based programming and demonstrate how that works in practice on the .NET platform using Oracle Coherence and GigaSpaces.</p><p>5 0.093903601 <a title="1016-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-01-Data_grid_comparison%3A_Oracle_Coherence_vs_Gigaspaces_XAP.html">613 high scalability-2009-06-01-Data grid comparison: Oracle Coherence vs Gigaspaces XAP</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Recently, I was reading Todd Hoff's write-up on  FaceBook real time analytics system  . As usual, Todd did an excellent job in summarizing  this video  from Engineering Manager at Facebook  Alex Himel .
 
In  the first post , I’d like to summarize the case study, and consider some things that weren't mentioned in the summaries. This will lead to an architecture for building your own Realtime Time Analytics for Big-Data that might be easier to implement, using Facebook's experience as a starting point and guide as well as the experience gathered through a recent work with few of GigaSpaces customers. The  second post  provide a summary of that new approach as well as a pattern and a demo for building your own Real Time Analytics system..

<p>Introduction: Yesterday, I had a session during the  OpenStack Summit   where I tried to present a more general view on how we should be thinking about PaaS in the context of OpenStack.
 
The key takeaway :
 
The main goal of PaaS is to drive productivity into the  process  by which we can deliver new applications.
 
Most of the existing PaaS solutions take a fairly extreme approach with their abstraction of the underlying infrastructure and therefore fit a fairly small number of extremely simple applications and thus miss the real promise of PaaS.
 
Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk took a more bottom up approach giving us better set of tradeoffs between the abstraction and control which makes it more broadly applicable to a larger set of applications.
 
 The fact that OpenStack is opensource allows us to think differently on the things we can do at the platform layer.  We can create a tighter integration between the PaaS and IaaS layers and thus come up with better set of tradeoffs into the way we drive</p><p>6 0.57841021 <a title="1016-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-19-Alternatives_to_Google_App_Engine.html">423 high scalability-2008-10-19-Alternatives to Google App Engine</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just heard about some web sites where Velocity templates are used to render HTML  instead of using JSPs and all the processing in performed in servlets. Can JSPs cause issue with scalability?

<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent applications. Furthermore,  over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are more likely to make a purchase after “liking” a brand they find online. ( source  ) 
 
Sears Architect Tomer Gabel provides an insightful overview on how they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:
  
 the architectural considerations behind their solution 
 why they chose memory over disk 
 how they partitioned the data to gain scalability 
 why they chose to execute code with the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution framework 
 how they integrated with Facebook 
 why they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-memory caching and scale

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how to make it work. Dan Rayburn  has a post  pointing to a fascinating paper:  An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming , which talks in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the Internet. For Akamai they found:
  
 Each video is encoded in five versions at different bit rates and stored in separate files. 
 The client sends commands to the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds.  
 Akamai uses only the video level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame rate of the video is kept constant. 
 When a sudden drop in the available bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to the a large actuation delay. 
  For a sudden increase of the avai</p><p>5 0.8871029 <a title="1016-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-16-Paper%3A_Warp%3A_Multi-Key_Transactions_for_Key-Value_Stores.html">1459 high scalability-2013-05-16-Paper: Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL architecture."
 
 Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores Â overview:
  

Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture, transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or clock synchronization for this coordination.


This paper presents a novel protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could potentially yield a vio</p><p>6 0.84400046 <a title="1016-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Book%3A_High_Performance_MySQL.html">16 high scalability-2007-07-16-Book: High Performance MySQL</a></p>

 My car is eight years old this year. It has less than 30,000 miles on it. 
 
Yes, you heard that right, less than 30,000 miles. I don’t drive my car very often because, well, my commute is a short trip down two flights of stairs. I don’t need to go very far when I do drive it’s only ten miles or so round trip to the grocery store. So from my perspective, gas isn’t really very expensive. I may use a tank of gas a month, which works out to … well, it’s really not even worth mentioning the cost. But for someone who commutes every day – especially someone who commutes a long-distance every day – gas is expensive. It’s a significant expense every month for them and th</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 My youngest daughter, for example, would say gas is very expensive – but she’s got a smaller pool of cash from which to buy gas so relatively speaking, we’re both right.

</p><p>2 The way in which SSL is used – the ciphers, the certificate key lengths, the scale – has a profound impact on whether or not “computationally expensive” is an accurate statement or not. [sent-15, score-0.479]
</p><p>3 While NIST is not a standards body can require compliance or else, they can and do force government and military compliance and have shown their influence with commercial certificate authorities. [sent-26, score-0.464]
</p><p>4 This increase has a huge impact on the capacity of a server to process SSL and renders completely inaccurate the statement that SSL is not computationally expensive anymore. [sent-28, score-0.43]
</p><p>5 These are much less “easy” ciphers than RC4 but unfortunately they are also more computationally intense, which also has an impact on overall performance. [sent-34, score-0.414]
</p><p>6 Having more resources does not change the consumption of SSL, it simply means that from a mathematical point of view the consumption rates relative to the total  appear  to be different. [sent-46, score-0.328]
</p><p>7 Both their specialized hardware (if applicable) and general purpose CPUs significantly increase the capacity and performance of SSL/TLS encrypted traffic on such solutions, making their economy of scale much greater than that of server-side deployed SSL solutions. [sent-50, score-0.379]

</p><p>9 Reports that fail to factor in the associated performance and financial costs of maintaining valid certificates on each and every server – and the management / creation of SSL certificates for ephemeral virtual machines – are misleading. [sent-53, score-0.932]
</p><p>10 Such tactics attempt to reduce the capital expense associated with external SSL intermediaries by increasing the operational expense of purchasing and managing large numbers of SSL certificates – including having a ready store that can be used for virtual machine instances. [sent-55, score-0.618]
</p><p>11 Like IP address management in an increasingly dynamic environment, there is a diseconomy of scale that becomes evident as you attempt to scale the systems and processes involved. [sent-57, score-0.353]

</p><p>13 The promise of virtualization and  cloud computing  is to address the diseconomy of scale; the ability to provision and ready-to-function server complete with the appropriate web or application stack serving up an application for purposes of scale assumes that everything is ready. [sent-60, score-0.325]
</p><p>14 Each virtual image upon which a certificate is deployed must be pre-configured with the appropriate certificate and keys and you can’t launch the same one twice. [sent-62, score-0.803]

</p><p>17 The alternative is to fail to meet compliance (not acceptable for some) or simply deploy the keys and certificates on commoditized hardware (increases the risk of theft which could lead to far more impactful breaches). [sent-90, score-0.504]
</p><p>18 For some IT organizations to meet business requirements they will have to rely on some form of hardware-based solution for certificate and key management such as an HSM or FIPS 140-2 compliant hardware. [sent-91, score-0.361]
</p><p>19 The choices are deploy on every server (note this may become very problematic when trying to support virtual machines) or deploy on a single         intermediary that can support all servers at the same time, and scale without requiring additional hardware/software support. [sent-92, score-0.526]

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers podcast  Show 15 – Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls . The conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can be processed by a WAF ( Web Application Firewall ), which inspects HTTP for security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be necessary, but I digress.
 
To  terminate SSL  most shops run SSL connections into Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.
 
Load balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very efficiently in hardware.

<p>Introduction: Ezra Zygmuntowicz in a heart warming account of his      4 Years at Engine Yard   , has concluded in his experience that:  the true future of cloud computing for developers is to not think about servers at all. It is now time to focus on the Application and new levels of abstraction that allow folks to use the computing resources in easier and easier ways.

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this beautiful morning: 
 
 
  
 
  
  Group Decision Making in Honey Bee Swarms . In distributed computing systems nodes reach a  quorum  when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:   A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating the swarm's move to this site.  Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.   Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.

Here are  10 Things We Forgot to Monitor  from Bitly, along with good stories and copious amounts of code snippets. Well worth reading, especially after you've already started monitoring the lower hanging fruit.
 
An interesting revelation from the article is that:

Virtualization and cloud-based systems are very hype in the industry; however, most financial companies stray from those solutions. At ATMCash, we’ve approached virtualization not for the usual reason of scalability, but for the usually missed value of security.
 
In this article, I will introduce the concept of security added value in the utilization of virtualization and why people should consider deploying mini-clouds for those use-cases. 
  How do virtual machines help mitigate risk?  
I am sure most of you have heard of the recent  hacking in the financial sector . Financial companies are under constant hacking attempts and security is of the utmost importance. One of the bigger risks in system deployment is a breach in one of the stack components. Regular system patches and maintenance fix known exploits and issues, however, sometimes it may be too late and the component has already been breached. If the</p><p>5 0.7350778 <a title="987-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-22-Server_load_balancing_architectures%2C_Part_1%3A_Transport-level_load_balancing.html">426 high scalability-2008-10-22-Server load balancing architectures, Part 1: Transport-level load balancing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Server farms achieve high scalability and high availability through server load balancing, a technique that makes the server farm appear to clients as a single server. In this two-part article, Gregor Roth explores server load balancing architectures, with a focus on open source solutions. Part 1 covers server load balancing basics and discusses the pros and cons of transport-level server load balancing.         The barrier to entry for many Internet companies is low. Anyone with a good idea can develop a small application, purchase a domain name, and set up a few PC-based servers to handle incoming traffic. The initial investment is small, so the start-up risk is minimal. But a successful low-cost infrastructure can become a serious problem quickly. A single server that handles all the incoming requests may not have the capacity to handle high traffic volumes once the business becomes popular. In such a situations companies often start to scale up: they upgrade the existing infrastruc</p><p>6 0.72923982 <a title="987-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-26-WordPress.com_Serves_70%2C000_req-sec_and_over_15_Gbit-sec_of_Traffic_using_NGINX.html">1329 high scalability-2012-09-26-WordPress.com Serves 70,000 req-sec and over 15 Gbit-sec of Traffic using NGINX</a></p>

 My car is eight years old this year. It has less than 30,000 miles on it. 
 
Yes, you heard that right, less than 30,000 miles. I don’t drive my car very often because, well, my commute is a short trip down two flights of stairs. I don’t need to go very far when I do drive it’s only ten miles or so round trip to the grocery store. So from my perspective, gas isn’t really very expensive. I may use a tank of gas a month, which works out to … well, it’s really not even worth mentioning the cost. But for someone who commutes every day – especially someone who commutes a long-distance every day – gas is expensive. It’s a significant expense every month for them and th</p><p>2 0.95124215 <a title="987-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_18%2C_2011.html">992 high scalability-2011-02-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 18, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Shanti Braford  details how his Ruby on Rails  based website survived a 24 hour 550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup details, so there's not much I can add.   Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR, nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of the performance boost.    Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>5 0.93477738 <a title="987-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-07-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_7th%2C_2014.html">1607 high scalability-2014-03-07-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 7th, 2014</a></p>

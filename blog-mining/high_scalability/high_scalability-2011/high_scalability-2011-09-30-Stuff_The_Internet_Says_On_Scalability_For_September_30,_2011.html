<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: Ali Sadat ofMuleSoft gave interesting presentation at Saturday's Talk Cloudy
to Me! event about their experiences movingMule iON, their ESB (enterprise
service bus) product to the cloud.First, a little aboutTalk Cloudy to Me. This
event is the second one day cloud event put on by Sebastian Stadil, founder of
Scalr, as part of the Cloud Computing Meetup group, also created by Sebastian.
Sebastian has become a master at running these mini-conference style events.
Really a quality job by him and his dedicated crew. These events are free,
sponsored by various vendors; they are short, 11-5; the food is good, Thai;
the venue is nice, eBay; they are on topic, with cloud and other speakers
giving 30-45 minute talks.  More on the event when the video comes out. I type
as fast as I can but I can't do much without the video.Back to Ali Sadat.
While he gave a lot of lessons--the integration will your billing system will
take a lot longer than you think; talk to your Amazon account reps as they

<p>Introduction: In his blog post,Scaling WSO2 Stratos, Srinath Perera explains the scaling
architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure.
It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new
concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.Overall,
WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading
to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the
paper WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing.
ProblemStratos is multi-tenanted. In other words, there are many tenants. Each
tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants,
where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos
supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products
(e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants
may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, and Gadgets
etc. WSO2 Str</p><p>2 0.92426389 <a title="1129-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-16-S3_Failed_Because_of_Authentication_Overload.html">249 high scalability-2008-02-16-S3 Failed Because of Authentication Overload</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Being an authentic human being is difficult and apparently authenticating all
those S3 requests can be a bit overwhelming as well. Amazon fingered a lot of
processor heavy authentication requests as the reason for their
downtime:breakEarly this morning, at 3:30am PST, we started seeing elevated
levels of authenticated requests from multiple users in one of our locations.
While we carefully monitor our overall request volumes and these remained
within normal ranges, we had not been monitoring the proportion of
authenticated requests. Importantly, these cryptographic requests consume more
resources per call than other request types.Shortly before 4:00am PST, we
began to see several other users significantly increase their volume of
authenticated calls. The last of these pushed the authentication service over
its maximum capacity before we could complete putting new capacity in place.
In addition to processing authenticated requests, the authentication service
also performs account valida</p><p>3 0.91397685 <a title="1129-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-10-Building_Scalable_Databases%3A_Denormalization%2C_the_NoSQL_Movement_and_Digg.html">698 high scalability-2009-09-10-Building Scalable Databases: Denormalization, the NoSQL Movement and Digg</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database
schemas that ensures that the data is optimal for ad-hoc querying and that
modifications such as deletion or insertion of data does not lead to data
inconsistency. Database denormalization is the process of optimizing your
database for reads by creating redundant data. A consequence of
denormalization is that insertions or deletions could cause data inconsistency
if not uniformly applied to all redundant copies of the data within the
database.Read more on Carnage4life blog...</p><p>4 0.90493315 <a title="1129-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-21-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_21st%2C_2014.html">1617 high scalability-2014-03-21-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 21st, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:Good Vibrationsby Radovan SemanÄ?ik. Lot's of interesting questions
about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.Google
Waveis a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML
documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency
updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new,
convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users ofGoogle
Waveand we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open
platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and
become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to
"federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google
Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and
collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation
Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.Hereare

<p>Introduction: Guest post byAsya Kamsky, Principal Solutions Architect at MongoDB.This post
outlines ten things you need to know for operating MongoDB at scale based on
my experience working with MongoDB customers and open source users:MongoDB
requires DevOps, too.MongoDB is a database. Like any other data store, it
requires capacity planning, tuning, monitoring, and maintenance. Just because
it's easy to install and get started and it fits the developer paradigm more
naturally than a relational database, don't assume that MongoDB doesn't need
proper care and feeding. And just because it performs super-fast on a small
sample dataset in development doesn't mean you can get away without having a
good schema and indexing strategy, as well as the right hardware resources in
production! But if you prepare well and understand the best practices,
operating large MongoDB clusters can be boring instead of nerve-
wracking.Successful MongoDB users monitor everything and prepare for
growth.Tracking current capac</p><p>3 0.14211674 <a title="990-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_29%2C_2011.html">1089 high scalability-2011-07-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 29, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeff Behl, VP Ops @ LogicMonitor. Jeffhas been a bit
herder for the last 20 years, architecting and overseeing the infrastructure
for a number of SaaS based companies.  Data Replication for Disaster
RecoveryAn inevitable part of disaster recovery planning is making sure
customer data exists in multiple locations.  In the case of LogicMonitor, a
SaaS-based monitoring solution for physical, virtual, and cloud environments,
we wanted copies of customer data files both within a data center and outside
of it.  The former was to protect against the loss of individual servers
within a facility, and the latter for recovery in the event of the complete
loss of a data center.Where we were:  RsyncLike most everyone who starts off
in a Linux environment, we used our trusty friend rsync to copy data around.
Rsync is tried, true and tested, and works well when the number of servers,
the amount of data, and the number of files is not horrendous.  When any of
these are no longer</p><p>5 0.12813416 <a title="990-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-04-Sponsored_Post%3A_Uber%2C_ScaleOut_Software%2C_Couchbase%2C_Tokutek%2C_Logentries%2C_Booking%2C_Apple%2C_MongoDB%2C_BlueStripe%2C_AiScaler%2C_Aerospike%2C_LogicMonitor%2C_AppDynamics%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7__.html">1605 high scalability-2014-03-04-Sponsored Post: Uber, ScaleOut Software, Couchbase, Tokutek, Logentries, Booking, Apple, MongoDB, BlueStripe, AiScaler, Aerospike, LogicMonitor, AppDynamics, ManageEngine, Site24x7  </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Guest post byAsya Kamsky, Principal Solutions Architect at MongoDB.This post
outlines ten things you need to know for operating MongoDB at scale based on
my experience working with MongoDB customers and open source users:MongoDB
requires DevOps, too.MongoDB is a database. Like any other data store, it
requires capacity planning, tuning, monitoring, and maintenance. Just because
it's easy to install and get started and it fits the developer paradigm more
naturally than a relational database, don't assume that MongoDB doesn't need
proper care and feeding. And just because it performs super-fast on a small
sample dataset in development doesn't mean you can get away without having a
good schema and indexing strategy, as well as the right hardware resources in
production! But if you prepare well and understand the best practices,
operating large MongoDB clusters can be boring instead of nerve-
wracking.Successful MongoDB users monitor everything and prepare for
growth.Tracking current capac</p><p>5 0.75632209 <a title="990-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_24%2C_2011.html">1067 high scalability-2011-06-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 24, 2011</a></p>

application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out

you a place where you can make your own opinions about words known.As cool as
that is, what is really cool is the information they share in theirblogabout
their experiences building a web service. They've written an excellent series
of articles and presentations you may find useful:What has technology doSave &

<p>Introduction: Comet is anactive distributed key-value storebuilt at the University of
Washington. The paper describing Comet is Comet: An active distributed key-
value store, there are also slides, and a MP3 of a presentation given atOSDI
'10. Here's a succinct overview of Comet:Today's cloud storage services, such
as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety
of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes,
fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility
first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption
keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage
service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their
data's behavior inside the storage service.I found this paper quite
interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-
value store, which turns it into what might called a key-code store. This is

<p>Introduction: Cloud-based services for all things digital will either drive - or die by -
bandwidthConsumers, by definition, consume. In the realm of the Internet, they
consume far more than they produce. Or so it's been in the past. Broadband
connectivity across all providers have long offered asymmetric network feeds
because it mirrored reality: an HTTP request is significantly smaller than its
corresponding response, and in general web-based activity is heavily biased
toward fat download and thin upload speeds. The term "broadband" is really a
misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very
narrowband of a typical consumer's upload speed.cloud computing, or to be more
accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the
status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing
all things digital "in the cloud", network providers must consider the impact
on them - and the satisfaction of their customer base with performance over

<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says one of the
big lessons they've learned is to create lesschatty protocols:In the Netflix
data centers, we have a high capacity, super fast, highly reliable network.
This has afforded us the luxury of designing around chatty APIs to remote
systems. AWS networking has more variable latency. We've had to be much more
structured about "over the wire" interactions, even as we've transitioned to a
more highly distributed architecture.There's not a lot of advice out there on
how to create protocols. Combine that with a rush to the cloud and you have a
perfect storm for chatty applications crushing application performance.
Netflix is far from the first to be surprised by the less than stellar
networks inside AWS. A chatty protocol is one where a client makes a series of
requests to a server and the client must wait on each reply before sending the
next request. On a LAN this can work great. LAN's are typically fast, wide,

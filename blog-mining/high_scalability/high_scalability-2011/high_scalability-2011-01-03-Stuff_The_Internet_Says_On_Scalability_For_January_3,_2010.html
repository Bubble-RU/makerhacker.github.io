<p>Introduction: Update:Final Thoughts on SSD and MySQL AKA Battleship Spinn3r. Tips on how to
make your database 10x faster using solid state drives. Potential exists for
100x speedup.Solid-state drives(SSDs) are the holy grail of storage. The
promise of RAM speeds and hard disk like persistence have for years driven us
crazy with power user lust, but they've stayed tantalizingly just out of
reach. Always too expensive, too small, and oddly too slow. Has that changed?
Can you now miraculously have your cake and eat it too? Can you now have it
both ways? Is balancing work with family life now as easy as tripping over a
terabyte drive?In a pioneering series of blog articles Kevin Burton conducts
original research on next generation SSD drives in real world configurations.

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived
processes) and why they moved toScalato program against it (high level

<p>Introduction: I had a false beliefI thought I came here to stayWe're all just visitingAll
just breaking like wavesThe oceans made me, but who came up with me?Push me,
pull me, push me, or pull me out .So true Perl Jam(Push me Pull me lyrics), so
true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes.
Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from
servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.breakTo pull
events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server.
This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a
list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has
changed and makes those changes available to you. Knowing what has changed can
be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very
complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state
on what I client still needs to see.Polling is heavy man. Imagine all your

<p>Introduction: Wille Faler hascreated an excellent list of best practicesfor building
scalable and high performance systems. Here's a short summary of his
points:Offload the database- Avoid hitting the database, and avoid opening
transactions or connections unless you absolutely need to use them.What a
difference a cache makes- For read heavy applications caching is the easiest
way offload the database.Cache as coarse-grained objects as possible- Coarse-
grained objects save CPU and time by requiring fewer reads to assemble
objects.Don't store transient state permanently- Is it really necessary to
store your transient data in the database?Location, Location- put things close
to where they are supposed to be delivered.Constrain concurrent access to
limited resource- it's quicker to let a single thread do work and finish
rather than flooding finite resources with 200 client threads.Staged,
asynchronous processing- separate a process using asynchronicity into separate
steps mediated by queues and execut</p><p>4 0.99399942 <a title="967-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-12-Netflix%3A_Developing%2C_Deploying%2C_and_Supporting_Software_According_to_the_Way_of_the_Cloud.html">1155 high scalability-2011-12-12-Netflix: Developing, Deploying, and Supporting Software According to the Way of the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At a Cloud Computing Meetup, Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a
merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:Keeping Movies Running
Amid Thunderstorms. While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the
cloud, issues with capacity planning,thundering herds, latency problems,
andsimian armageddon, I found myself most taken with how they handlesoftware
deployment in the cloud.I've worked on half a dozen or more build and
deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large
organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability
that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant
software deployments:the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to
completely run a new release while running the old release at the same
time.The process goes something like: Acanary machineis launched first with
the new software load running real traffic to sanity test the load in a
production environment. If the ca</p><p>5 0.9902333 <a title="967-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-16-Paper%3A_Scaling_Online_Social_Networks_without_Pains.html">723 high scalability-2009-10-16-Paper: Scaling Online Social Networks without Pains</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We saw in Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale? scaling social
networks is a lot harder than you might think. This paper,Scaling Online
Social Networks without Pains, from a team at Telefonica Research in Spain
hopes to meet the challenge of status distribution, user generated content
distribution, and managing the social graph through a technique they callOne-
Hop Replication (OHR). OHRabstracts and delegates the complexity of scaling up
from the social network application. The abstract:Online Social Networks (OSN)
face serious scalability challenges due to their rapid growth and popularity.
To address this issue we present a novel approach to scale up OSN called One
Hop Replication (OHR). Our system combines partitioning and replication in a
middleware to transparently scale up a centralized OSN design, and therefore,
avoid the OSN application to undergo the costly transition to a fully
distributed system to meet its scalability needs. OHR exploits some of the

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:Quotable Quotes:@dbasch: The world is full of
"scalability engineers" who would die from an orgasm if their software ever
saw 10,000 requests in a day.@mtnygard: "Scaling issues are always expressed
as a queue backing up somewhere." --@moonpolysoft #strangeloop@rbranson: If
your data fits in main memory, you're doing it wrong. #strangeloop@peakscale:
Using schemaless DBs an "overreaction" & "confuses the poor impl. of schemas
with the value that schemas provide"@adrianco: GM: Performance analysis is
complicated by your brain thinking LINEARLY about a computer system that is
NONLINEAR. @littleidea: it's better to have infinite scalability and not need
it, than to need infinite scalability and not have itLooks like Google is on
the right track with their language understanding efforts. How hierarchical is

supporting the hypothesis that sequential structure may be fundamental to the

<p>Introduction: Sequoiais a transparent middleware solution offering clustering, load
balancing and failover services for any database. Sequoia is the continuation
of the C-JDBC project. The database is distributed and replicated among
several nodes and Sequoia balances the queries among these nodes. Sequoia
handles node and network failures with transparent failover. It also provides
support for hot recovery, online maintenance operations and online
upgrades.Features in a nutshellNo modification of existing applications or
databases.Operational with any database providing a JDBC driver.High
availability provided by advanced RAIDb technology.Transparent failover and
recovery capabilities.Performance scalability with unique load balancing and
query result caching features.Integrated JMX-based administration and
monitoring.100% Java implementation allowing portability across platforms with
a JRE 1.4 or greater.Open source licensed under Apache v2 license.Professional

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across
data centers, then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so
there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What
isChironFSand how does it work?Adapted from the ChironFS website:The Chiron
Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of
failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using
replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not
FILESYSTEMS.Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it
is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other
server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many
servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become
a real nightmare!</p><p>4 0.96171463 <a title="1024-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-12-Paper%3A_Mind_the_Gap%3A_Reconnecting_Architecture_and_OS_Research.html">1039 high scalability-2011-05-12-Paper: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research is a paper presented
atHotOS XIII, the place where researchers talk about making potential futures
happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by
Matt Welsh: Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa.In the VM/cloud age I
question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly
against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out
the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS
holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the
OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between
legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but
one possible future.Introduction:For too long, operating systems researchers
and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished
out. With occasional exceptions (e.g., virtualization support), architecture</p><p>5 0.95531064 <a title="1024-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>

recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget
with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid
expiration headers) is employ areverse proxyas mentioned in this article.In
the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a
single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a
single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max
server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.It's trivial to implement for
anyone interested...</p><p>6 0.94711041 <a title="1024-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-03-100_Node_Hazelcast_cluster_on_Amazon_EC2.html">820 high scalability-2010-05-03-100 Node Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2</a></p>

Ask me anything , reveals the stack used for building Google+:
  Our stack is pretty standard fare for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily most people don't run</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 to make it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily most people don't run into this in practice). [sent-4, score-0.124]
</p><p>2 Our backends are built mostly on top of BigTable and Colossus/GFS, and we use a lot of other common Google technologies such as MapReduce (again, like many other Google apps do). [sent-5, score-0.103]
</p><p>3 At first I read Clojure, which would have been a real surprise, but it's Closure, a suite of JavaScript tools consisting of a  library ,  compiler , and  templates . [sent-6, score-0.291]
</p><p>4 The compiler is a true compiler for JavaScript for making JavaScript download and run faster. [sent-7, score-0.208]
</p><p>5 While you don't have Google's stack available to you, you do have some open source options. [sent-11, score-0.202]
</p><p>6 Colossus  is Google's  next generation file system , a replacement for GFS. [sent-14, score-0.103]
</p><p>7 Since we don't know much about Colossus, it's hard to say what a suitable replacement would be. [sent-15, score-0.103]
</p><p>8 Google probably uses a custom  Java servlet  container, but the choice here doesn't matter that much. [sent-18, score-0.129]
</p><p>9 For Google+'s most innovative feature, video conferencing with Hangouts, GigaOM has a  good article on that stack , which is based on  Announcing Google+ Hangouts , written by Tech Lead Justin Uberti. [sent-25, score-0.113]

</p><p>11 They used vacuum tubes (thermionic valves) to perform the calculations. [sent-36, score-0.149]
</p><p>12 Once upon a time engineers within Google developed their own fast, lightweight servlet engine which we inside Google refer to as simply the "Google Servlet Engine" or GSE. [sent-39, score-0.183]
</p><p>13 Hector Yee has a good summary:  The Google infrastructure is far more stable and well documented than the open source variants. [sent-42, score-0.243]
</p><p>14 It's much easier to have a stable, massively scalable system built in the Google framework than with the equivalent open source tools. [sent-44, score-0.141]
</p><p>15 nostrademons on  JQuery vs Closure : Closure is used in basically every Google product. [sent-47, score-0.104]
</p><p>16 There's no comparison - in terms of pageviews, edge cases, and general real-world exposure, Closure is more widely used than probably every other JS library. [sent-48, score-0.1]
</p><p>17 JQuery is for sites that are primarily HTML but require some additional interactivity layered on via progressive enhancement. [sent-50, score-0.098]
</p><p>18 And in my experience, when I need cutting edge with GWT, I end up writing a bunch of wrappers for JavaScript functions, which makes me wonder why I'm not writing everything in JavaScript. [sent-54, score-0.167]
</p><p>19 (Like I said, the GWT library is very compelling and when planning a large project, Java often feels more comfortable for some. [sent-55, score-0.072]
</p><p>20 But we are moving toward a world where most of the foundational elements of Google+ will be part of a next generation version of Android, and the things that feel like apps on Google+ will be, in fact, apps running on that future social OS. [sent-57, score-0.258]

<p>Introduction: Update:   Offloading ALL JS Files To Google . Now you can let Google serve all your javascript files.  This article tells you how to do it (upload to Google Code Project) and why it's a big win (cheap, fast, caching, parallel downloads, save bandwidth).  Don't have a CDN? Why not let Google and Yahoo be your CDN? At least for Ajax libraries.  No charge. Google runs a  content distribution network and loading architecture for the most popular open source JavaScript libraries , which include: jQuery, prototype, script.aculo.us, MooTools, and dojo. The idea is web pages directly include your library of choice from Google's global, fast, and highly available network. Some have found much better performance and others experienced slower performance.  My guess is the performance may be slower if your data center is close to you, but far away users will be much happier. Some negatives: not all libraries are included, you'll load more than you need because all functionality is included.

<p>Introduction: Update 6: :  Back to the Future for Data Storage .  We are in the middle of a renaissance in data storage with the application of many new ideas and techniques; there's huge potential for breaking out of thinking about data storage in just one way.   Update 5 :  Building Scalable Web Applications with Google App Engine  by Brett Slatkin.
 
 Update 4 :  Why Google App Engine is broken and what Google must do to fix it  by Aral Balkan.  We don't care that it can scale. We care that it does scale. And that it scales when you need it the most.   Issues: 1MB limit on data structures; 1MB limit on data structures; the short-term high CPU quota; quotas in general; Admin? What's that?  Update 3 : BigTable  Blues . Catherine Devlin couldn't port an application to GAE because it can't do basic filtering and can't search 5,000 records without timing out: "Querying from 5000 records - too much for the mighty BigTable, apparently."

<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look around their documentation and seeing what stands out  for me. It's not the much speculated   super cluster VM  . AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran a   website out of S3   with a splash of   Heroku   thrown in as a chaser.      The idea is clearly to take advantage of our   massive multi-core future   by creating a shared nothing infrastructure based firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage: email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps.  A shared nothing request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build</p><p>6 0.12649386 <a title="1078-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-07-Rumors_of_Signs_and_Portents_Concerning_Freeish_Google_Cloud.html">299 high scalability-2008-04-07-Rumors of Signs and Portents Concerning Freeish Google Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:   Good Vibrations  by Radovan Semančík. Lot's of interesting questions about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.   Google Wave  is a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new, convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users of  Google Wave  and we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to "federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and collaborate using shared waves.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jeff Su  from Factual. 
 
 
  What is Varnish?  
 Varnish  is an open source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for both static and dynamic content.
 
One great thing about Varnish is that it can improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.  If you haven’t heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven’t used it), please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive, but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish’s more advanced features, you’ll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.
 
Some of the high profile companies using Varnish include:  Twitter ,  Facebook ,  Heroku  and  LinkedIn .
  Our Use Case  
One of Factual’s first high profile projects was  Newsweek’s “America’s Best High Schools: The List” . After realizing that we had only a few weeks to increase our</p><p>2 0.90333581 <a title="1078-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-16-What_if_Cars_Were_Rented_Like_We_Hire_Programmers%3F.html">1388 high scalability-2013-01-16-What if Cars Were Rented Like We Hire Programmers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are hired at many software companies...   Agency  : So sorry you had to wait in the reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?  Applicant  : I drive a 2008 Subaru.  Agency  : That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent you.  Applicant  : That's OK. Any car will do.  Agency  : No, we can only take on clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way. There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take a chance.  Applicant  : I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.89342242 <a title="1078-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-12-Google%2B_is_Built_Using_Tools_You_Can_Use_Too%3A_Closure%2C_Java_Servlets%2C_JavaScript%2C_BigTable%2C_Colossus%2C_Quick_Turnaround.html">1078 high scalability-2011-07-12-Google+ is Built Using Tools You Can Use Too: Closure, Java Servlets, JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his picture), in  I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything , reveals the stack used for building Google+:
  Our stack is pretty standard fare for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily most people don't run</p><p>4 0.88323665 <a title="1078-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-08-Typesafe_Interview%3A_Scala_%2B_Akka_is_an_IaaS_for_Your_Process_Architecture.html">1454 high scalability-2013-05-08-Typesafe Interview: Scala + Akka is an IaaS for Your Process Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an email interview with   Viktor Klang   , Director of Engineering at    Typesafe   , on the    Scala Futures    model &    Akka,    both topics on which is he is immensely passionate and knowledgeable.  
 
How do you structure your application? That’s the question I explored in the article  Beyond Threads And Callbacks . An option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.
   To remedy my oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe’s Viktor Klang, long time Scala hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He’s a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about. 
   I’ve implemented several Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO, service orchestration, failover, etc, so I’m innately skeptical about frameworks that remove control from the programmer at</p><p>5 0.88026679 <a title="1078-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_18%2C_2011.html">1007 high scalability-2011-03-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 18, 2011</a></p>

 The cloud is falling. Or at least shared networked storage as Reddit has a couple of long periods of downtime.  Good write up at Why reddit was down for 6 of the last 24 hours.  Upshot: Reddit is moving off EBS to local disks.

[sent-3, score-0.357]
</p><p>2 At the core of these papers are many many pages of rigorous mathematical analysis, but fortunately this  creamy goodness  is bookended with chocolatey cookies explaining what it all means. [sent-18, score-0.221]
</p><p>3 " Examples include access to "video on demand" via IPTV or over-the-top streaming; servers and storage  allocated on demand in "infrastructure as a service;" or "software as a service" such as  customer relationship management or sales force automation. [sent-20, score-0.405]
</p><p>4 We show that the benefits of on-demand provisioning depend on the interplay of demand with  forecasting, monitoring, and resource provisioning and de-provisioning processes and intervals,  as well as likely asymmetries between excess capacity and unserved demand. [sent-22, score-1.387]
</p><p>5 In any environment with constant demand or demand which may be accurately forecasted to an interval greater than the provisioning interval, on-demand provisioning has no value. [sent-23, score-1.753]
</p><p>6 For linear demand, loss is proportional to demand  monitoring and resource provisioning intervals. [sent-25, score-1.141]
</p><p>7 However, linear demand functions are easy to  forecast, so this benefit may not arise empirically. [sent-26, score-0.463]
</p><p>8 For exponential growth, such as found in social networks and games, any non-zero provisioning  interval leads to an exponentially growing loss, underscoring the critical importance of ondemand in such environments. [sent-27, score-0.877]
</p><p>9 For environments with randomly varying demand where the value at a given time is independent  of the prior interval—similar to repeated rolls of a die—on-demand is essential, and generates  clear value relative to a strategy of fixed resources, which in turn are best overprovisioned. [sent-28, score-1.063]
</p><p>10 For demand where the value is a random   delta from the prior interval—similar to a Random  Walk—there is a moderate benefit from time compression. [sent-29, score-0.744]
</p><p>11 Specifically, reducing process  intervals by a factor of  n  results in loss being reduced to a level of  1/square root of n  of its prior value. [sent-30, score-0.457]
</p><p>12 Thus, a two-fold reduction in cost requires a four-fold reduction in time. [sent-31, score-0.398]
</p><p>13 Finally, behavioral economic factors and cognitive biases such as hyperbolic discounting,  perception of wait times, neglect of probability, and normalcy and other biases modulate the  hard dollar costs addressed here. [sent-32, score-0.384]
</p><p>14 The degree of effect is related to traffic patterns:     We have seen that not only is there a time value of money, there is a money value of time, specifically, increased agility and responsiveness lead to reduced loss, including a reduction in missed opportunities. [sent-33, score-0.822]
</p><p>15 From a business perspective, one has to ask whether the reduction in monitoring or provisioning time that potentially results in reduced loss due to unserved demand or unused resources is worth it. [sent-35, score-1.62]
</p><p>16 For example, the cost for an enterprise or cloud provider to acquire and deploy dynamic provisioning software  compared to the losses associated with unserved demand or unutilized capacity make it an attractive proposition. [sent-38, score-1.281]
</p><p>17 For linearly growing or declining demand, a reduction in time (monitoring cycle or resource provisioning) offers a proportional reduction in cost. [sent-39, score-0.587]
</p><p>18 For exponential demand, the loss associated with even fixed interval provisioning grows exponentially, so on-demand provisioning is essential. [sent-40, score-1.325]
</p><p>19 The VM spin-up interval is your period of lost opportunity. [sent-41, score-0.219]
</p><p>20 If your traffic is bursty and/or growing exponentially, then you may be losing out on more profitable opportunities than you thought, because cloud elasticity doesn't match demand elasticity. [sent-42, score-0.752]

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.  
 
We tend to think compute of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of datacenters in the future.
 
Given the diversity of compute resources it's reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API. They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever resources it doe</p><p>5 0.11590888 <a title="1006-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something called   Self Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance   (SCIT).  Botnets  are created when vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks like a  dog chasing its tail ). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a great deal of sense once I thought about it.  With SCIT you stop and restart VM instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window vulnerability)....
   
 This short exposure window means worms and viri do not have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack. A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM</p><p>3 0.79318935 <a title="1006-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Are_we_seeing_the_renaissance_of_enterprises_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1354 high scalability-2012-11-05-Are we seeing the renaissance of enterprises in the cloud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is  indeed the case:
 
 Research  conducted by HP   found that the majority of businesses in the EMEA region  are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the cloud. Of the 940  respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-critical apps at some  point over the next two to five years.
 
A more recent  survey, by research firm  MeriTalk   and sponsored by VMware and EMC (NYSE: EMC  ), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to  move some mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within  two years, the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their  mission-critical apps to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of  their mission-critical apps to run in the cloud.

<p>Introduction: When you’re looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium  ecosystem, one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular  breed of fish is amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are  not, which means if you put them together in a confined space, they’re  going to fight. Viciously. To the death. Responsible aquarists try to  avoid such situations, so careful attention to the  conspecificity  of animals is a must.
 
Now,  while in many respects the data center ecosystem correlates well to an  aquarium ecosystem, in this case it does not. It’s what you usually get,  today, but its not actually the best model. That’s because what you  want in the data center ecosystem – particularly when it extends to  include public  cloud computing   resources – is conspecificity in infrastructure.
 
This  desire and practice is being seen both in enterprise data center  decision making as well as in startups suddenly dealing with massive  growth and increasingly encountering pe</p><p>5 0.77391684 <a title="1006-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-12-The_CIO%E2%80%99s_Problem%3A_Cloud_%E2%80%9CMess%E2%80%9D_or_Cloud_%E2%80%9CMash%E2%80%9D.html">918 high scalability-2010-10-12-The CIO’s Problem: Cloud “Mess” or Cloud “Mash”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days – you only needed one, but then came along the AS400’s and soon you had ten – but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh sh%# – now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and datacenter operations!
 
 Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path? 
 
As a technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other CIO’s on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context to how they can leverage SpringCM’ s easy, fast and affordable cloud Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud services.
 
 What options do I have?

<p>Introduction: I had a false belief I thought I came here to stay We're all just visiting All just breaking like waves The oceans made me, but who came up with me? Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out .     So true Perl Jam   (Push me Pull me lyrics)  , so true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes. Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.       To pull events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server. This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has changed and makes those changes available to you.  Knowing what has changed can be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state on what I client still needs to see.     Polling is heavy man.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.99547637 <a title="1006-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-17-Are_long_VM_instance_spin-up_times_in_the_cloud_costing_you_money%3F.html">1006 high scalability-2011-03-17-Are long VM instance spin-up times in the cloud costing you money?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Are long VM instance spin-up times in the cloud costing you money? That's the question that immediately came to mind when  James Urquhart , in an interview at the  Stata Conference , made this thought provoking comment:  the   faster you can get the resources into the hands of the people who use them, the more money you save overall .
 
One of the many super powers of the cloud is  elasticity , the ability to dynamically acquire and release resources in response to demand. But like any good superhero, their strength must also form the basis of a not quite fatal flaw. Years and years of angsty episodes are usually required to explore this contradiction.
 
In the case of the cloud, the weakness reveals itself in slow VM spin-up times. Spinning up a VM in EC2 can take a little as  1-3 minutes , or can  average 5-10 minutes , or it can take much longer if there's heavy usage in your availability zone. EC2 is not alone. A common complaint about Google App Engine is the  cold-start problem .</p><p>4 0.99522704 <a title="1006-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-12-Netflix%3A_Developing%2C_Deploying%2C_and_Supporting_Software_According_to_the_Way_of_the_Cloud.html">1155 high scalability-2011-12-12-Netflix: Developing, Deploying, and Supporting Software According to the Way of the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At a  Cloud Computing Meetup , Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:  Keeping Movies Running Amid Thunderstorms . While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the cloud, issues with capacity planning,  thundering herds , latency problems, and  simian armageddon , I found myself most taken with how they handle  software deployment in the cloud .
 
I've worked on half a dozen or more build and deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant software deployments:  the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to completely run a new release while running the old release at the same time .
 
The process goes something like:

What you can do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>6 0.99433553 <a title="1006-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-18-Paper%3A_The_Declarative_Imperative%3A_Experiences_and_Conjectures_in_Distributed_Logic.html">844 high scalability-2010-06-18-Paper: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:   Social networks in the database: using a graph database . A nice post on representing, traversing, and performing other common social network operations using a graph database.  If you are  Digg  or  LinkedIn  you can build your own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network relationships. For those of more modest means  Neo4j , a graph database, is a good alternative.  A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges (relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs) on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for relationships."  A graph looks something like:    For more lovely examples take a look at the  Graph Image Gal</p><p>3 0.22227186 <a title="1136-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-30-Running_Large_Graph_Algorithms_-_Evaluation_of_Current_State-of-the-Art_and_Lessons_Learned.html">801 high scalability-2010-03-30-Running Large Graph Algorithms - Evaluation of Current State-of-the-Art and Lessons Learned</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw materials like iron. Then isn’t it  ironic , in the  Alanis Morissette  sense,  that in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles of stuff?  It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.
 
The piles of stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff. Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags, friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a valu</p><p>4 0.18592533 <a title="1136-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Paper%3A_Graph_Databases_and_the_Future_of_Large-Scale_Knowledge_Management.html">626 high scalability-2009-06-10-Paper: Graph Databases and the Future of Large-Scale Knowledge Management</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dr. Daniel Abadi, author of the  DBMS Musings blog  and Cofounder of  Hadapt , which offers a product improving Hadoop performance by 50x on relational data, is now taking his talents to graph data in  Hadoop's tremendous inefficiency on graph data management (and how to avoid it) , which shares the secrets of getting Hadoop to perform 1000x better on graph data.
 
TL;DR:
  
 Analysing graph data is at the heart of  important data mining problems . 
 Hadoop is the tool of choice for many of these problems. 
 Hadoop style MapReduce works best on KeyValue processing, not graph processing, and can be well over a factor of 1000 less efficient than it needs to be. 
 Hadoop inefficiency has consequences in real world. Inefficiencies on graph data problems like improving power utilization, minimizing carbon emissions, and improving product designs, leads to a lot value being left on the table in the form of negative environmental consequences, increased server costs, increased data center spa</p><p>6 0.16121937 <a title="1136-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-18-Disks_Ain%27t_Dead_Yet%3A_GraphChi_-_a_disk-based_large-scale_graph_computation.html">1285 high scalability-2012-07-18-Disks Ain't Dead Yet: GraphChi - a disk-based large-scale graph computation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.
 
Then you may observe after coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form of interacting patterns of flows.
 
Then you may think hey, a program isn't only useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over data and flow over other flows.
 
That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making available in the Graph extension to their  plumbing  package ( code examples ), which is described in an excellent post:  Graph: Abstractions for Structured Computation .

<p>Introduction: GraphChi  uses a  Parallel Sliding Windows  method which can: process a graph with mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of computation.
 
 
 
The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar to  Pregel , which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style of MapReduce.  Streaming graph updates  are supported.
 
About GraphChi, Carlos Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,  says :
  

A Mac Mini running GraphChi can analyze Twitter's social graph from 2010—which contains 40 million users and 1.2 billion connections—in 59 minutes. "The previous published result on this problem took 400 minutes using a cluster of about 1,000 computers

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released information on  Pregel . Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip. Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure...
   ...to mine a wide range of graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's topology.  Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's  Tommy Reilly  .  
 
We at  NuoDB  were recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the  Google Compute Engine  by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google Developer Live Session by clicking  here .  In order to access the capabilities of GCE we decided to run the same  YCSB  based benchmark we ran at our  General Availability Launch  back in January. For those of you who missed it we demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.
 
Public cloud environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don’t call it a cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk t</p><p>same-blog 3 0.88991141 <a title="1136-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-03-Paper%3A_G2_%3A_A_Graph_Processing_System_for_Diagnosing_Distributed_Systems.html">1136 high scalability-2011-11-03-Paper: G2 : A Graph Processing System for Diagnosing Distributed Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the problems in building distributed systems is figuring out what the heck is going on. Usually endless streams of log files are consulted like ancients using  entrails  to divine the will of the Gods.
 
To rise above these ancient practices we must rise another level of abstraction and that's the approach described in a Microsoft research paper:  G2: A Graph Processing System for Diagnosing Distributed Systems , which uses  execution graphs that model runtime events and their correlations in distributed systems .
 
The problem with these schemes is viewing applications, written by programmers in low level code, as execution graphs. But we're heading in this direction in any case. To program a warehouse or an internet sized computer we'll have to write at higher levels of abstraction so code can be executed transparently at runtime on these giant distributed computers. There are many advantages to this approach, fault diagnosis and performance monitoring are just one of the wins</p><p>4 0.87337345 <a title="1136-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-10-Blog%3A_Esoteric_Curio_by_Theo_Schlossnagle.html">87 high scalability-2007-09-10-Blog: Esoteric Curio by Theo Schlossnagle</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pownce is a new social messaging application competing micromessage to micromessage with the likes of Twitter and Jaiku. Still in closed beta, Pownce has generously shared some of what they've learned so far. Like going to a barrel tasting of a young wine and then tasting the same wine after some aging, I think what will be really interesting is to follow Pownce and compare the Pownce of today with the Pownce of tomorrow, after a few years spent in the barrel. What lessons lie in wait for Pownce as they grow?

<p>Introduction: Now that we have the    C10K concurrent connection problem    licked, how do we level up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope, systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar. 
   To learn how it’s done we turn to    Robert Graham   , CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely fantastic talk at    Shmoocon 2013    called    C10M Defending The Internet At Scale   . 
  Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I’ve never heard of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn’t originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane and the data plane. The  problem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data plane , which we shouldn’t do at all.

  @adrianco : My takeaway from the MongoDB talk at ‪#gluecon‬ is that Mongo is implementing eventual scalability in the next version  
 The death of the general purpose computer is causing strange events like Facebook making their  own smart phone .

  Jony Ive : I feel that ideas are very fragile, so you have to be tender when they are in development. I realized that if he pissed on this, it would be so sad because I know it was so important. 
  @BenedictEvans : 100m users is the new 1m users. $4bn is the new $400m. 30 staff is the new 300 staff. 
  @postwait : Knowing the latency of every I/O on every spindle in every machine in every rack... over all of time. Done & eye-opening. Thanks @circonus.

<p>Introduction: If Google was a boxer then MapReduce would be a probing right hand that sets up the massive left hook that is  Dremel , Google's—scalable (thousands of CPUs, petabytes of data, trillions of rows), SQL based, columnar, interactive (results returned in seconds), ad-hoc—analytics system. If Google was a magician then MapReduce would be the shiny thing that distracts the mind while the trick goes unnoticed. I say that because even though Dremel has been around internally at Google since 2006, we have not heard a whisper about it. All we've heard about is MapReduce, clones of which have inspired entire new industries.  Tricky .
 
Dremel, according to Brian Bershad, Director of Engineering at Google, is targeted at solving  BigData class problems :
  

While we all know that systems are huge and will get even huger, the implications of this size on programmability, manageability, power, etc. is hard to comprehend.

  @ibogost : Disabling features of SimCity due to ineffective central infrastructure is probably the most realistic simulation of the modern city. 
  antirez : The point is simply to show how SSDs can't be considered, currently, as a bit slower version of memory. Their performance characteristics are a lot more about, simply, "faster disks". 
  @jessenoller : I only use JavaScript so I can gain maximum scalability across multiple cores. Also unicorns. Paint thinner gingerbread 
  @liammclennan : high-scalability ruby. Why bother? 
  @scomma : Problem with BitCoin is not scalability, not even usability. It's whether someone will crack the algorithm and render BTC entirely useless.

<p>Introduction: In the "should I or shouldn't I" debate around deploying SSD, it always helps to have real-world data. Fiesta! with a  live-blog    summary of a presentation by Kenny Gorman on  Shutterfly on MongoDB Performance Tuning .
  

What if you still need more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs. Shutterfly uses  Facebook’s flashcache : kernel module to cache data on SSD. Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O. Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can delay sharding: less complexity.

  
The whole  series of posts  has a lot of great information and is worth a longer look, especially if you are considering using MongoDB.

Owncloud is an open source cloud that provides a web interface for file access files from anywhere.

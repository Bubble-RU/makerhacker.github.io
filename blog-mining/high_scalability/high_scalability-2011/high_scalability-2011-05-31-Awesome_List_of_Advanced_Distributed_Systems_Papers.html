<p>Introduction: Marton Trencseni has collected a wonderful list of different papers on distributed systems. He's organized them into the following sections: The Google Papers, Distributed Filesystems, Non-relational Distributed Databases, The Lamport Papers, and Implementation Issues. Many old favorites on the list and some that are likely new to you. My new favorite is "Frangipani: A Scalable Distributed File System."

<p>Introduction: In case you are interested here's the info:     INFOSCALE 2009: The 4th International ICST Conference on Scalable Information Systems. 10-12 June 2009, Hong Kong, China.     In the last few years, we have seen the proliferation of the use of heterogeneous distributed systems, ranging from simple Networks of Workstations, to highly complex grid computing environments. Such computational paradigms have been preferred due to their reduced costs and inherent scalability, which pose many challenges to scalable systems and applications in terms of information access, storage and retrieval.     Grid computing, P2P technology, data and knowledge bases, distributed information retrieval technology and networking technology should all converge to address the scalability concern. Furthermore, with the advent of emerging computing architectures - e.g. SMTs, GPUs, Multicores. - the importance of designing techniques explicitly targeting these systems is becoming more and more important.

<p>Introduction: Art of Distributed   Part 1: Rethinking about distributed computing models  
I â&euro;&tilde;m getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability, and distributed storage systems.   Download the article in PDF format.   Download the article in MS Word format.   I wait for your comments, and questions, and I will answer it in part two.</p><p>5 0.74598926 <a title="1049-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Useful_Cloud_Computing_Blogs.html">445 high scalability-2008-11-14-Useful Cloud Computing Blogs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:   My recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid expiration headers) is employ a    reverse proxy    as mentioned in this article.   In the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.  It's trivial to implement for anyone interested...</p><p>same-blog 2 0.94147909 <a title="1049-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of  Dr. Indranil Gupta 's  CS 525 Spring 2011 Advanced Distributed Systems  class, he has collected an incredible  list of resources on distributed systems . His  research group  is also doing some interesting work.
 
The  various topics  include: Before there Were Clouds, Cloud Computing, P2P Systems, Basic Distributed Computing Concepts, Sensor Networks, Overlays and DHTs, Cloud Programming, Cloud Scheduling, Key-Value Stores, Storage, Sensor Net Routing, Geo-Distribution, P2P Apps, In-network processing, Epidemics, Probabilistic Membership Protocols, Distributed Monitoring and  Management, Publish-Subscribe/CDNs, Measurement Studies, Old Wine: Stale or Vintage?, In Byzantium, Cloud Pricing, Other Industrial Systems, Structure of Networks, Completing the Circle, Green Clouds, Distributed Debugging, Flash!, The Middle or the End?, Availability-Aware Systems, Design Methodologies, Handling Stress, Sources of unreliability in networks, Handling Stress, Selfish algorithms, Securi</p><p>3 0.91941506 <a title="1049-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">191 high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across data centers,  then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What is  ChironFS  and how does it work?
 
Adapted from the ChironFS website:   The Chiron Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not FILESYSTEMS.  Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become a real nightmare!</p><p>5 0.85788578 <a title="1049-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-27-Product%3A_Sequoia_Database_Clustering_Technology.html">102 high scalability-2007-09-27-Product: Sequoia Database Clustering Technology</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sequoia  is a transparent middleware solution offering clustering, load balancing and failover services for any database. Sequoia is the continuation of the C-JDBC project. The database is distributed and replicated among several nodes and Sequoia balances the queries among these nodes. Sequoia handles node and network failures with transparent failover. It also provides support for hot recovery, online maintenance operations and online upgrades.
  Features in a nutshell    No modification of existing applications or databases.    Operational with any database providing a JDBC driver.    High availability provided by advanced RAIDb technology.    Transparent failover and recovery capabilities.    Performance scalability with unique load balancing and query result caching features.    Integrated JMX-based administration and monitoring.    100% Java implementation allowing portability across platforms with a JRE 1.4 or greater.    Open source licensed under Apache v2 license.

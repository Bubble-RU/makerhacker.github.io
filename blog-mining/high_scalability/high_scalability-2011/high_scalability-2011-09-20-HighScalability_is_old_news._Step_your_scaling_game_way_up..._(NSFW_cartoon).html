<p>Introduction: This is a hilarious presentation by  Josh Berkus , called  Scale Fail , given at O'Reilly MySQL CE 2011. Josh is entertaining, well spoken, and cleverly hides insight inside chaos. And he makes some dang good points along the way.
  Josh has a problem, you see Josh has learned how to make sites that are both scalable and reliable. So he's puzzled why companies "whose downtime interfaces (Twitter) are more well known than their uptime interfaces" get all the attention, respect, and money for being failures.

<p>Introduction: This is an all time favorite post. Even though I've seen this video a hundred times I still can't help but laugh... 
 
This is so funny I laughed until I cried! Definitely NSFW. OMG it's hilarious, but it's also not a bad overview of the issues. Especially loved:  You read the latest post on HighScalability.com and think you are a f*cking Google and architect and parrot slogans like Web Scale and Sharding but you have no idea what the f*ck you are talking about . There are so many more gems like that.

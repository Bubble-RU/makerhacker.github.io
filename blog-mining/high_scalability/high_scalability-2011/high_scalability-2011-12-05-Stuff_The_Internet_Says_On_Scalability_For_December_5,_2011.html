<p>Introduction: ZooKeeper  is a  high available and reliable coordination system. Distributed applications use ZooKeeper to store and mediate updates key configuration information. ZooKeeper can be used for leader election, group membership, and configuration maintenance.  In addition  ZooKeeper can be used  for event notification, locking, and as a priority queue mechanism. It's a sort of  central nervous system for distributed systems where the role of the brain is played by the coordination service, axons are the network, processes are the monitored and controlled body parts, and events are the hormones and neurotransmitters used for messaging. Every complex distributed application needs a coordination and orchestration system of some sort, so the ZooKeeper folks at Yahoo decide to build a good one and open source it for everyone to use.   The target market for ZooKeeper are multi-host, multi-process C and Java based systems that operate in a data center.

<p>Introduction: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things . -- Corinthians
 
 With this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs .  I like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.  -- Sylvain on  Google Groups 
 
The dream is dead. Google App Engine's bold  pay for what you use  dream dies as it leaves childish things behind and becomes a  real product .  Pricing will change . Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will change. But Google App Engine  will survive.   
 
Google is  shutting down  many of its  projects . GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank for it surving the  more wood behind  more deadly arrows push? Without a radical and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote in the long scroll of good ideas.

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: Update 6: :  Back to the Future for Data Storage .  We are in the middle of a renaissance in data storage with the application of many new ideas and techniques; there's huge potential for breaking out of thinking about data storage in just one way.   Update 5 :  Building Scalable Web Applications with Google App Engine  by Brett Slatkin.
 
 Update 4 :  Why Google App Engine is broken and what Google must do to fix it  by Aral Balkan.  We don't care that it can scale. We care that it does scale. And that it scales when you need it the most.   Issues: 1MB limit on data structures; 1MB limit on data structures; the short-term high CPU quota; quotas in general; Admin? What's that?  Update 3 : BigTable  Blues . Catherine Devlin couldn't port an application to GAE because it can't do basic filtering and can't search 5,000 records without timing out: "Querying from 5000 records - too much for the mighty BigTable, apparently."

 Google's PageRank involves  500 million variables and 2 billion terms .  SeaMicro Packs 768 Cores Into its Atom Server .  Twitter: 1 Billion Items Delivered A Day Is Nice, Google+. We Do 350 Billion.  
 Potent quotables:      
 
  @merv  - Does elastic scalability matter? Ask Apple about 1 million e-transactions in a day. $30M worth of multi-gig downloads that must work. 
  @lmacvittie  - Cloud has shifted the focus of scalability from applications to architecture. 
  @bartbohn  - Love the phrase "anarchic scalability" by Roy Fielding 
  @iAjayMe  - Programming: I have come to the conclusion, if you want to do something right the first time (scalability,performance) write it in C++ 
  @mreferre  - Interesting discussion between @jamesurquhart and @lmacvittie about PaaS/App scalability (I think). Need google translator though...

<p>Introduction: What's cool about starting a new project is you finally have a chance to do it right. You of course eventually mess everything up in your own way, but for that one moment the world has a perfect order, a rightness that feels satisfying and good. Arne Claassen, the CTO of notify.me, a brand new real time notification delivery service, is in this honeymoon period now.  Arne has been gracious enough to share with us his philosophy of how to build a notification service. I think you'll find it fascinating because Arne goes into a lot of useful detail about how his system works.    His main design philosophy is to minimize the bottlenecks that form around synchronous access, that is when  some resource is requested and the requestor ties up more resources, waiting for a response. If the requested resource can’t be delivered in a timely manner, more and more requests pile up until the server can’t accept any new ones. Nobody gets what they want and you have an outage.

<p>Introduction: Algorithms are moving out of the Platonic realm and are becoming dynamic first class players in real life. We've seen corporations become people. Algorithms will likely also follow that path to agency.
 
 Kevin Slavin  in his intriguing TED talk:  How Algorithms Shape Our World , gives many and varied examples of how algorithms have penetrated RL. 
 
One of his most interesting examples is from a highly technical paper on  Relativistic statistical arbitrage , which says to make money on markets you have to be where the people are, the red dots (on the diagram below), which means you have to put servers where the blue dots are, many of which are in the ocean. Here's the diagram from the paper:
 
 
 
Mr. Slavin neatly sums this up by saying:
  

And it's not the money that's so interesting actually. It's what the money motivates, that  we're actually terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency . And in that light, you go back and you look at Michael Najjar's ph</p><p>4 0.93494415 <a title="1151-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-29-Paper%3A_No_Relation%3A_The_Mixed_Blessings_of_Non-Relational_Databases.html">733 high scalability-2009-10-29-Paper: No Relation: The Mixed Blessings of Non-Relational Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This excellent survey of the field was  written by Ian Thomas Varley  as part of his Master of Science in Engineering program.
  
 The aim of this paper is to explore the conceptual design space of non-relational databases as compared to traditional relational databases. It is clear that the design needs of the two paradigms are different, but how fundamental are the differences, and what strategies can we use to transition our conceptual designs from one to the other? 
   There are a few things to like about this paper. A running a example is used to show the different ways to model data depending on which type of solution you are targeting, especially covering how many-to-many relationships are modeled, data integrity, and how to support optional attributes. There's also a brief survey of some of the major systems.            The most interesting section of the report is where it tackles the problem of design for non-relational systems. The approach has two different phases: design q</p><p>5 0.93256098 <a title="1151-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-16-Facebook%27s_New_Real-time_Messaging_System%3A_HBase_to_Store_135%2B_Billion_Messages_a_Month.html">943 high scalability-2010-11-16-Facebook's New Real-time Messaging System: HBase to Store 135+ Billion Messages a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a new  Social Inbox  integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer in  The Underlying Technology of Messages :  HBase . HBase beat out MySQL, Cassandra, and a few others.
 
Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time Messages product. Facebook also has an extensive  MySQL infrastructure , but they found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could have built their own, but they chose HBase.
 
HBase is a   scaleout table store supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data  . Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system.

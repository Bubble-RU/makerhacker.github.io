 What is an In Memory Data Grid? 
 
It is not an in-memory relational database, a NOSQL database or a relational database.  It is a different breed of software datastore.
 
In summary an IMDG is an ‘off the shelf’ software product that exhibits the following characteristics:
 
The data model is distributed across many servers in a single location or across multiple locations.  This distribution is known as a data fabric.  This distributed model is known as a ‘shared nothing’ architecture.
  
 All servers can be active in each site. 
 All data is stored in the RAM of the servers. 
 Servers can be added or removed non-disruptively, to increase the amount of RAM available.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: GemStone has unveiled GemFire 6.0 which is the culmination of several years of development and the continuous solving of the hardest data management problems in the world. With this release GemFire touts some of the latest innovative features in data management.  In this release:
 
-	GemFire introduces a resource manager to continuously monitor and protect cache instances from running out of memory, triggering rebalancing to migrate data to less loaded nodes or allow dynamic increase/decrease in the number of nodes hosting data for linear scalability without impeding ongoing operations (no contention points).  -	GemFire provides explicit control over when rebalancing can be triggered, on what class of data and even allows the administrator to simulate a "rebalance" operation to quantify the benefits before actually doing it.  -	With built in instrumentation that captures throughput and latency metrics, GemFire now enables applications to sense changing performance patterns and proactiv</p><p>6 0.16289565 <a title="1160-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After winning a CSC Leading Edge Forum (LEF) research grant, I (Paul Colmer) wanted to publish some of the highlights of my research to share with the wider technology community.
 
 What is an In Memory Data Grid? 
 
It is not an in-memory relational database, a NOSQL database or a relational database.  It is a different breed of software datastore.
 
In summary an IMDG is an ‘off the shelf’ software product that exhibits the following characteristics:
 
The data model is distributed across many servers in a single location or across multiple locations.  This distribution is known as a data fabric.  This distributed model is known as a ‘shared nothing’ architecture.
  
 All servers can be active in each site. 
 All data is stored in the RAM of the servers. 
 Servers can be added or removed non-disruptively, to increase the amount of RAM available. 
 The data model is non-relational and is object-based.

<p>Introduction: GridGain   was kind enough to present at the September 17th instance of  the   Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group  . I've been curious about GridGain so I was glad to see them there. In short GridGain is:   an open source computational grid framework that enables Java developers to improve general performance of processing intensive applications by splitting and parallelizing the workload  . GridGain can also be thought of as a set of middleware primitives for building applications. GridGain's peer group of competitors includes GigaSpaces, Terracotta, Coherence, and Hadoop.     The speaker for GridGain was the President and Founder, Nikita Ivanov. He has a very pleasant down-to-earth way about him that contrasts nicely with a field given to religious discussions of complex taxomic definitions. Nikita first talked about cloud computing in general. He feels Java is the perfect gateway for cloud computing. Which is good because   GridGain only works with Java  .

<p>Introduction: Infinispan  is a highly scalable, open source licensed data grid platform in the style of  GigaSpaces  and Oracle  Coherence .
 
From their website:
   The purpose of Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent, designed ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core architectures while at the same time providing distributed cache capabilities.  At its core Infinispan exposes a JSR-107 (JCACHE) compatible Cache interface (which in turn extends java.util.Map).  It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer network architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data grid.  Offering high availability via making replicas of state across a network as well as optionally persisting state to configurable cache stores, Infinispan offers enterprise features such as efficient eviction algorithms to control memory usage as well as JTA compatibility.  In addition to the peer-to-peer architecture of Infinispan, on the roadmap is the ability to run f</p><p>4 0.75213104 <a title="1160-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: GemStone has unveiled GemFire 6.0 which is the culmination of several years of development and the continuous solving of the hardest data management problems in the world. With this release GemFire touts some of the latest innovative features in data management.  In this release:
 
-	GemFire introduces a resource manager to continuously monitor and protect cache instances from running out of memory, triggering rebalancing to migrate data to less loaded nodes or allow dynamic increase/decrease in the number of nodes hosting data for linear scalability without impeding ongoing operations (no contention points).  -	GemFire provides explicit control over when rebalancing can be triggered, on what class of data and even allows the administrator to simulate a "rebalance" operation to quantify the benefits before actually doing it.  -	With built in instrumentation that captures throughput and latency metrics, GemFire now enables applications to sense changing performance patterns and proactiv</p><p>6 0.74779856 <a title="1160-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-29-Product%3A_ScaleOut_StateServer_is_Memcached_on_Steroids.html">373 high scalability-2008-08-29-Product: ScaleOut StateServer is Memcached on Steroids</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,      We're running a enterprise SaaS solution that currently holds about 700 customers with up to 50.000 users per customer (growing quickly). Our customers have SLA agreements with us that contains guaranteed uptimes, response times and other performance counters. With an increasing number of customers and traffic we find it difficult to provide our customer with actual SLA data. We could set up external probes that monitors certain parts of the application, but this is time consuming with 700 customers (we do it today for our biggest clients). We can also extract data from web logs but they are now approaching about 30-40 GB a day.      What we really need is monitoring software that not only focuses on the internal performance counters but also lets us see the application from the customers viewpoint and allows us to aggregate data in different ways. Would the best approach be to develop a custom solution (for instance a distributed app that aggregates data from different logs e</p><p>2 0.95278281 <a title="1160-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-25-SongPop_Scales_to_1_Million_Active_Users_on_GAE%2C_Showing_PaaS_is_not_Pass%C3%A9.html">1412 high scalability-2013-02-25-SongPop Scales to 1 Million Active Users on GAE, Showing PaaS is not Passé</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Should you use PaaS for your next project? Often the answer is no because you want control, but here's an example from  SongPop  showing why the promise of PaaS is not passé. SongPop was able to autoscale to 60 million users, 1 million daily active users, deliver 17 terabytes/day of songs and images worldwide, handle 10k+ queries/second, all with a 6 person engineering team, and only one engineer working full-time on the backend.
 
Unfortunately there aren't a lot of details, but what there is can be found in  Scaling SongPop to 60 million users with App Engine and Google Cloud Storage . The outline follows the script. You start small. Let PaaS do the heavy lifting. And when you need to scale you just buy more resources and tune a little (maybe a lot). The payoff is you get to focus on feature development and can get by with a small team.

<p>Introduction: Hi,     In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought is   class ReferenceIdGenerator {   public static setReferenceId(String login) {      threadLocal.set(login + System.currentMillis());   }     public static String getReferenceId() {     return threadLocal.get();   }   private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =       new ThreadLocal();       }     class MySevlet {     void service(.....) {       HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);      String userId = session.get("userId");          ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId</p><p>4 0.92446339 <a title="1160-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-15-Sun_Customer_Ready_HPC_Cluster%3A_Reference_Configurations_with_Sun_Fire_X2200_M2_and_X2100_M2_Servers.html">418 high scalability-2008-10-15-Sun Customer Ready HPC Cluster: Reference Configurations with Sun Fire X2200 M2 and X2100 M2 Servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200 M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the switches.     These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are only available through Sun's factory integration.

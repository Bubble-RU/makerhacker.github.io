</p><p>3 Our emergency medics for this battle, in this free flowing and wide ranging  podcast , pinpoint the problem: through IPv6 and telco domination we are losing the original beauty and simplicity of the Internet. [sent-19, score-0.262]
</p><p>4 In summary:      We've effectively turned the Internet into a place with a bunch of tunnels infected with many layers of translation points. [sent-20, score-0.721]
</p><p>5 We are stuffing IPv4 and IPv6 packets into a buch of tunnels: MPLS, VPLS, PPoE, PPoA, etc. [sent-22, score-0.271]
</p><p>6 The IETF standards continually talk about tunnels, IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels, carrier grade NAT, 6RD, and even NAT. [sent-24, score-0.162]
</p><p>7 In  another post , Greg Ferro asks: Shouldn't we replace tunnels with routing and letting the network be a network, not a bunch of tunnels over the backbone? [sent-25, score-1.366]
</p><p>8 So there are lots of issues here, but the main themes are: 1) tunnels suck 2) centralization vs decentralization. [sent-29, score-0.786]
</p><p>9 From networking expert  Ivan Pepelnjak :      You can talk about tunneling when a protocol that should be lower in the protocol stack gets encapsulated in a protocol that you’d usually find above or next to it. [sent-32, score-0.448]
</p><p>10 The podcasters had a lot of reasons why tunnels aren't a good design:     MTU issues . [sent-38, score-0.698]
</p><p>11 Different networks have different packets sizes so packets have to be fragmented and reconstituted as they flow through the network. [sent-39, score-0.442]
</p><p>12 When packets are inside a tunnel you can’t apply your security policies to what is inside the payload. [sent-42, score-0.405]
</p><p>13 You can’t reorder packets inside a flow and within tunnels everything looks like one flow, so you can’t load share across flows. [sent-44, score-0.984]
</p><p>14 Once you put a packet in a tunnel you can’t react to network changes so there’s no guarantee that your traffic is taking the optimal path. [sent-46, score-0.174]
</p><p>15 We are introducing another layer of NAT called carrier grade NAT (evil). [sent-51, score-0.162]
</p><p>16 Overlays, tunnels and NAT bring complexity into a network that creates failure, in multiple modes, in many different ways. [sent-57, score-0.645]
</p><p>17 Focus on delivering packets instead of layering on higher margin complexity. [sent-67, score-0.277]
</p><p>18 The centralization push is coming from the carriers because complex services in the core are high margin services. [sent-71, score-0.454]
</p><p>19 And then the podcast wraps up with this call to action:   This telephony style thinking and demands to vendors is slowly killing the Internet. [sent-73, score-0.345]
</p><p>20 They are trying to impose a telephony model over the Internet, which means centralization and complexity. [sent-75, score-0.299]

<p>Introduction: Update:   VcubeV  - an OpenVPN-based solution designed to build and operate a multisourced infrastructure.   True high availability requires a presence in multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers.  Cloud computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling the playing field.  Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost,  Mosso and other providers.  The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk amongst  the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy Samovskiy in his Linux Journal article titled  Building a  Multisourced Infrastructure Using OpenVPN  .

<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak, in his short and information packed  REDUNDANT DATA CENTER INTERNET CONNECTIVIT Y video, shows why networking as played at the highest levels is something you want to leave to professionals, like a  large animal country vetenarian  delivering a stuck foal at 2AM on a dark and stormy night. 
 
There are always a lot questions about the black art of building redundant datacenter networks and there's a shortage of accessible explanations. What I liked about Ivan's video is how effortlessly he explains the issues and tradeoffs you can expect in designing your own solution, as well as giving creative solutions to those problems. A lot of years of experience are boiled down to a 17 minute video.
 
Ivan begins by showing what a canonical fully redundant datacenter would look like:
 
     
 
It's like an ark where everything goes two by two. You have two datacenters, each datacenter has redundant core switches, redundant servers, redundant disk arrays, redundant links between d</p><p>5 0.1079669 <a title="1140-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-07-Google_Finds%3A_Centralized_Control%2C_Distributed_Data_Architectures_Work_Better_than_Fully_Decentralized_Architectures.html">1627 high scalability-2014-04-07-Google Finds: Centralized Control, Distributed Data Architectures Work Better than Fully Decentralized Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For years a war has been fought in the software architecture trenches between the ideal of decentralized services and the power and practicality of centralized services. Centralized architectures, at least at the  management and control plane  level, are winning. And Google not only agrees, they are enthusiastic adopters of this model, even in places you don't think it should work.
 
Here's an excerpt from  Google Lifts Veil On “Andromeda” Virtual Networking , an excellent article by Timothy Morgan, that includes a money quote from  Amin Vahdat , distinguished engineer and technical lead for networking at Google:
  Like many of the massive services that Google has created, the Andromeda network has centralized control. By the way, so did the Google File System and the MapReduce scheduler that gave rise to Hadoop when it was mimicked, so did the BigTable NoSQL data store that has spawned a number of quasi-clones, and even the B4 WAN and the Spanner distributed file system that have yet</p><p>6 0.087069809 <a title="1140-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-13-The_Secret_to_10_Million_Concurrent_Connections_-The_Kernel_is_the_Problem%2C_Not_the_Solution.html">1456 high scalability-2013-05-13-The Secret to 10 Million Concurrent Connections -The Kernel is the Problem, Not the Solution</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like? Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing. Specifically the  InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group  (IPNSIG).
 
 
 
 Ansible-like  faster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning telegraph system.
 
It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances and with much  longer delays :
  

The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2] Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances, so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to large delays and</p><p>3 0.7768029 <a title="1140-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-30-Hot_New_Trend%3A_Linking_Clouds_Through_Cheap_IP_VPNs_Instead_of_Private_Lines_.html">645 high scalability-2009-06-30-Hot New Trend: Linking Clouds Through Cheap IP VPNs Instead of Private Lines </a></p>
<p>Introduction: You might think major Internet companies have a latency, availability, and bandwidth advantage because they can afford expensive dedicated point-to-point private line networks between their data centers. And you would be right. It's a great advantage. Or it at least it was a great advantage. Cost is the great equalizer and companies are now scrambling for ways to cut costs. Many of the most recognizable Internet companies are moving to IP VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) as a much cheaper alternative to private lines. This is a strategy you can effectively use too.  This trend has historical precedent in the data center. In the same way leading edge companies moved early to virtualize their data centers, leading edge companies are now virtualizing their networks using IP VPNs to build inexpensive private networks over a shared public network. In kindergarten we learned sharing was polite, it turns out sharing can also save a lot of money in both the data center and on the network.

Ivan begins by showing what a canonical fully redundant datacenter would look like:
 
     
 
It's like an ark where everything goes two by two. You have two datacenters, each datacenter has redundant core switches, redundant servers, redundant disk arrays, redundant links between d</p><p>5 0.76751041 <a title="1140-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-02-RFC_1925_-_The_Twelve_%28Timeless%29_Networking_Truths.html">1526 high scalability-2013-10-02-RFC 1925 - The Twelve (Timeless) Networking Truths</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Twelve Networking Truths  is one of a long series of timeless truths documented in sacred   April Fools'  RFC   s. Though issued in 1996, it's no less true today.
 
It's hard to pick a favorite because they are all good. But if I had to pick, it would be:
  

Some things in life can never be fully appreciated nor understood unless experienced firsthand.

  
As we grow comfortable behind garden walls, clutching gadgets like lifelines and ideologies like shields, empathy is the true social network.

<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient and made the diagnosis. What did they find?
  
  Diagnostic team : the  Packet Pushers  gang ( Greg Ferro ,  Jan Zorz ,  Ivan Pepelnjak ) in the podcast  How We Are Killing the Internet .  
  Diagnosis : invasive tunnelation. ( tubes anyone? ) 
  Prognosis : even Dr. House might not be able to help. 
  Cure : go back to what the Internet was; kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything; disrupt the telcos. 
  
This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder, tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's all being carried out on battlefield few get</p><p>2 0.6819334 <a title="1140-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-19-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_19%2C_2012.html">1344 high scalability-2012-10-19-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 19, 2012</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:
  
  @davilagrau : Youtube, GitHub,..., Are cloud services facing a entropic limit to scalability? 
 Async all the way down?  The Tyranny of the Clock : The cost of logic and memory dominated Turing's thinking, but today, communication rather than logic should dominate our thinking. Clock-free design uses less than half, about 40%, as much energy per addition as its clocked counterpart. We can regain the efficiency of local decision making by revolting against the pervasive beat of an external clock.  
  Why Google Compute Engine for OpenStack . Smart move. Having OpenStack work inside a super charged cloud, in private clouds, and as a bridge between the two ought to be quite attractive to developers looking for some sort of ally for independence. All it will take are a few victories to cement new alliances.

<p>Introduction: This may be a bit higher level then the general discussion here, but I think this is an important issue in how it relates to reliability and uptime. What kind of SLAs should we be expecting from SaaS services and platforms (e.g. AWS, Google App Engine, Google Premium Apps, salesforce.com, etc.)? Up to today, most SaaS services either have no SLAs or offer very weak penalties. What will it take to get these services up to the point where they can offer the SLAs that users (and more importantly, businesses) require? I presume most of the members here want to see more movement into the cloud and to SaaS services, and I'm thinking that until we see more substantial SLA guarantees, most businesses will continue to shy away as long as they can.     Would love to hear what others think. Or am I totally off base?</p><p>4 0.67170572 <a title="1140-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Paper%3A_Dynamo%3A_Amazon%E2%80%99s_Highly_Available_Key-value_Store.html">139 high scalability-2007-10-30-Paper: Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2 : Read/WriteWeb  has a good article talking about the scalability issues of relational databases and how Dynamo solves them:  Amazon Dynamo: The Next Generation Of Virtual Distributed Storage . But since Dynamo is just another frustrating walled garden protected by barbed wire and guard dogs, its relevance is somewhat overstated.   Update :  Greg Linden  has a take on the paper where he questions some of Amazon's design choices: emphasizing write availability over fast reads, a lack of indexing support, use of random distribution for load balancing,  and punting on some scalability issues.  Werner Vogels, Amazon's avuncular CTO, just announced a new  paper  on the internal database technology Amazon uses to handle tens of millions customers. I'll dive into more details later, but I thought you'd want to read it hot off the blog. The bad news is it won't be a service. They are keeping this tech not so secret, but very safe. Happily, it's another real-life example to learn from.</p><p>5 0.65016145 <a title="1140-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-04-Database_question_for_upcoming_project.html">379 high scalability-2008-09-04-Database question for upcoming project</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We will be developing an RIA that will have a lot of database access.  Think something like a QuickBooks but with about 50 transactions entered per hour per user.  Users will be in the system for 7 to 9 hours a day and there will be around 20,000 users, all logged in at the same time.     Reporting will be done just like a QuickBooks style app plus a lot of extra things you don't do in QuickBooks.     Our operations is familiar with W2003 Server and MS SQL Server so they are recommending we stick with that.  I originally requested Linux and PostgreSQL.     How far can a single database server get me?  If we have a 4 processor, 8 core, 128gb server, how far am I going to get before I need to shard or do something else?  I know there are a lot of factors involved but in general for this size of a site, what should the strategy be?       I've read almost all articles on this website but most of the applications are not RIA type of apps with this type of usage or they are architectures for</p><p>6 0.62891674 <a title="1140-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-21-Processing_100_Million_Pixels_a_Day_-_Small_Amounts_of_Contention_Cause_Big_Problems_at_Scale.html">1390 high scalability-2013-01-21-Processing 100 Million Pixels a Day - Small Amounts of Contention Cause Big Problems at Scale</a></p>

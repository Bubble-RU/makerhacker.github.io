Now. Or you're doing it wrong.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by   Brian  Bulkowski  , CTO and co-founder of   Aerospike  , a leading clustered NoSQL  database, has worked in the area of high performance commodity systems  since 1989. 
   Why flash rules for databases     The economics of flash memory are staggering.    If you’re not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.   
   Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory – less than 100GB – great for in-memory solutions. There’s a place for rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data. But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option.  
   For example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random 4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated as slowest, but our internal testing showing</p><p>3 0.12539373 <a title="1134-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>4 0.12360503 <a title="1134-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical_Scaling_Ascendant_-_How_are_SSDs_Changing__Architectures%3F.html">1291 high scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical Scaling Ascendant - How are SSDs Changing  Architectures?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.    We have a few earl</p><p>5 0.12352212 <a title="1134-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

 Quotable quotes:            
 
  Markus Frind :   Scaling is not very fun these days.  
  Mike Krieger : Scaling is like replacing all components on a car while driving it at 100 mph.  
  @jaykreps : We built servers that could handle 100k connections by building servers that could handle 10k connections and waiting a decade. 
  @RichExperiences : Twitter alone generates more than 7 terabytes of data every day, Facebook 10 TB...

 The cloud isn't for closers.  Another gaming startup pulls back from the cloud  by Derrick Harris. Digital Chocolate is following the Zynga strategy of moving games into higher performing datacenter infrastructure once it becomes popular enough in the cloud to justify the primo stuff. We talked about this strategy in  Zynga's Z Cloud - Scale Fast Or Fail Fast By Merging Private And Public Clouds . An architectural approach made all the more sensible with Amazon's new  AWS Direct Connect  service, which enables lower latency and higher bandwidth services by skipping the Internet and connecting directly to the AWS network.

  @marshallk  : Google runs 100-200 experiments every day on UI, algorithm & product 
  @styggiti  : The problem with companies like IBM and Oracle baking NoSQL "scalability" into their products isn't the tech, it's the $$ licensing. 
 
 
  Blazing fast node.js: 10 performance tips from LinkedIn Mobile . You may have thought that node.js made just everything magically fast, but Shravya Garlapati has some great strategies for going even faster: Avoid synchronous code; Turn off socket pooling;  Don't use Node.js for static assets; Render on the client-side; Use gzip; Go parallel; Go session-free; Use binary modules; Use standard V8 JavaScript instead of client-side libraries; Keep your code small and light.

<p>Introduction: How does Facebook handle the massive New Year's Eve traffic spike? Thanks to Mike Swift, in  Facebook gets ready for New Year's Eve , we get a little insight as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still interesting.
  Problem Setup   
 Facebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be shared on New Year's eve. 
 Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average of 130 friends. 
 Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then rendered. 
 Different events put different stresses on different parts of Facebook.       
 
 Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of capacity  
 News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve Jobs drive user status updates

<p>Introduction: I have a few apache servers ( arround 11 atm ) serving a small amount of data ( arround 44 gigs right now ).     For some time I have been using rsync to keep all the content equal on all servers, but the amount of data has been growing, and rsync takes a few too much time to "compare" all data from source to destination, and create a lot of I/O.     I have been taking a look at MogileFS, it seems a good and reliable option, but as the fuse module is not finished, we should have to rewrite all our apps, and its not an option atm.     Any ideas?     I just want a "real time, non resource-hungry" solution alternative for rsync. If I get more features on the way, then they are welcome :)     Why I prefer to use a Distributed File System instead of using NAS + NFS?     - I need 2 NAS, if I dont want a point of failure, and NAS hard is expensive.   - Non-shared hardware, all server has their own local disks.   - As files are replicated, I can save a lot of money, RAID is not a MUST.

<p>Introduction: You deserve a  HighScalability today :
  
  S3: 566 Billion Objects, 370K requests/sec ;  Titan: 38,400-processor, 20-petaflop  
  1,000,000 daily users and no cache . Wooga flash game with 50K DB updates/second, Ruby backend. They hit an IO wall with MySQL at 1000 DB updates/sec. They needed more so they went with Redis. Not quite honest to say no cache was used as everything is RAM, but maybe that's the point. Use a lot of automation. Inactive users are archived. Moved away from EBS.  
  Making dynamic sitesscale like static sites  by Wim Godden. Use Varnish, Nginx, and memcached.  
  The Lifecycle of a Web Page on StumbleUpon  infographic. 2.2 mllion web pages are added to StumbleUpon each month. Nice discussion of  bounce rate .

<p>Introduction: Think of building websites as engineering  composite materials . A composite material is when two or more materials are combined to create a third material that does something useful that the components couldn't do on their own. Composites like reinforced concrete have revolutionized design and construction. When building websites we usually bring different component materials together, like creating a composite, to get the features we need rather than building a completely new thing from scratch that does everything we want.
 
This approach has been seen as a hack because it leads to inelegancies like data duplication; great gobs of component glue; consistency issues; and messy operations. But what if the the composite approach is really a strength, not a hack, but a messy part of the world that needs to be embraced rather than belittled?
 
They key is to  see data as a material . Right now we are arguing which is the best single material to build with. Is it  NoSQL , relational, mass</p><p>5 0.87795055 <a title="1134-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-07-Update_on_Disqus%3A_It%27s_Still_About_Realtime%2C_But_Go_Demolishes_Python.html">1644 high scalability-2014-05-07-Update on Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes Python</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our last article on Disqus:  How Disqus Went Realtime With 165K Messages Per Second And Less Than .2 Seconds Latency , was a little out of date, but the folks at Disqus have been busy implementing, not talking, so we don't know a lot about what they are doing now, but we do have a short update in  C1MM and NGINX  by John Watson and an article  Trying out this Go thing .
 
So Disqus has grown a bit:
  
 1.3 billion unique visitors 
 10 billion page views 
 500 million users engaged in discussions 
 3 million communities 
 25 million comments 
  
They are still all about realtime, but Go replaced Python in their Realtime system:
  
 Original Realtime backend was written in a pretty lightweight Python + gevent. 
 The realtime service is a hybrid of CPU intensive tasks + lots of network IO. Gevent was handling the network IO without an issue, but at higher contention, the CPU was choking everything. Switching over to Go removed that contention, which was the primary issue that was being se</p><p>6 0.87720245 <a title="1134-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-02-Strategy%3A_Understanding_Your_Data_Leads_to_the_Best_Scalability_Solutions.html">481 high scalability-2009-01-02-Strategy: Understanding Your Data Leads to the Best Scalability Solutions</a></p>

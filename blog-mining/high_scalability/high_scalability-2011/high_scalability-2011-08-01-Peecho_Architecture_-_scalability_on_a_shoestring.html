<p>Introduction: Update 35:How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational
Database. Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in
order to mimic RDBMS joins:Given the trade off between potential
inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the
latter.Update 34: Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what
that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?Amazon dramatically drops
SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB. This puts
SimpleDB on par withGoogle App Engine. They also announced a few new
features:a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline
uploading of multiple items or attributes. One of the complaints against
SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things.
These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can
store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.Update 33: Amazon announcesElastic

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Yurii responds with theTop 10 Reasons to Avoid Document Databases
FUD.Update:Top 10 Reasons to Avoid the SimpleDB Hypeby Ryan Park provides a
well written counter take. Am I really that fawning? If so, doesn't that make
me a dear?All your life you've used a relational database. At the tender age
of five you banged out your first SQL query to track your allowance. Your
RDBMS allegiance was just assumed, like your politics or religion would have
been assumed 100 years ago. They now say--you know them--that relations won't
scale and we have to do things differently. New databases like SimpleDB and
BigTable are what's different. As a long time RDBMS user what can you expect
of SimpleDB? That's what Alex Tolley of MyMeemz.com set out to discover. Like
many brave explorers before him, Alex gave a report of his adventures to the
Royal Society of theAWS Meetup. Alex told a wild almost unbelievable tale of
cultures and practices so different from our own you almost could not believe

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: This is a part interview part guest with Sebastian Stadil, founder ofScalr, a
cheaper open-source version of RightScale. Scalr takes care of all the web
site infrastructure bits to on Amazon (and other clouds) so you don't have
to.I first met Sebastian at one of the original Silicon Valley Cloud Computing
Group meetups, a group which he founded. The meetings started in the tiny
offices of Intalio where Sebastian was working with this new fangled Amazon
thing to create an auto-scaling server farm on EC2. I remember distinctly how
Sebastian met everyone at the door with a handshake and a smile, making us all
feel welcome. Later I took one of the classes he created on how to use AWS. I
guess he figured all this cloud stuff was going somewhere and decided to start
Scalr.My only regret about this post is that the name Amazon does not begin
with the letter 'S', that would have made for an epic title.Getting to Know

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.Ahead of the
upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi's
recentpresentationat an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few
of my recentFluxcapacitor.com consulting engagements, I've compiled a list of
10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS.1) Query AWS resource
metadata Can't remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge
cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?
awsnow.infois the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.
Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You're in luck.
There's now aREST API, as well!Note:  These are default soft limits and will
vary by account.2) Tame your S3 buckets Delete an entire S3 bucket with a
single CLI command:  aws s3 rb s3://\--forceRecursively copy a

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Marcel Panse and Sander Nagtegaal from Peecho.Although
architecture descriptions are an interesting read, the problems that start-ups
face are hardly ever addressed. We would like to change that, so here is our
architecture story.Introducing a start-upThe Amsterdam-based
companyPeechooffers print-as-a-service. Our embeddableprint buttonallows you
to sell your digital content as professionally printed products, like photo
books, magazines or canvases - straight from your own website. There is an
API, too.Printcloud is the system that powers the print button. It exists in
the cloud only, growing when needed and becoming smaller if it can. The system
takes in print orders, magically transforms tough data into print-ready files
and routes the orders to the production facility that is closest to the
intended recipient.To preserve the environment, Peecho's philosophy is to
facilitate global ordering, but to aim for local production only.Expensive

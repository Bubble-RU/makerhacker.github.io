<p>Introduction: In the "should I or shouldn't I" debate around deploying SSD, it always helps
to have real-world data. Fiesta! with alive-blog summary of a presentation by
Kenny Gorman onShutterfly on MongoDB Performance Tuning.What if you still need
more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs.
Shutterfly usesFacebook's flashcache: kernel module to cache data on SSD.
Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single
mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O.
Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can
delay sharding: less complexity.The wholeseries of posts has a lot of great
information and is worth a longer look, especially if you are considering
using MongoDB. Related ArticlesSlides forMongoSF 2011 slides: MongoDB

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

and writer Alex Payne put it, these startups represent "the field offices of a
large distributed workforce assembled by venture capitalists and their
associate institutions," doing low-overhead, low-risk R&D; for five corporate
giants. In such a system, the real disillusionment isn't the discovery that
you're unlikely to become a billionaire; it's the realization that your

set up to fail by design.@aphyr: I was already sold on immutability, pure

<p>Introduction: Professor Lance Fortnow, in his blog post Drowning in Data, says complexity
has taught him this lesson:When storage is expensive, it is cheaper to
recompute what you've already computed. And that's the world we now live in:
Storage is pretty cheap but data acquisition and computation are even
cheaper.Jouni, one of the commenters, thinks the opposite is true:storage is
cheap, but computation is expensive. When you are dealing with massive data,
the size of the data set is very often determined by the amount of computing
power available for a certain price.With such data, a linear-time algorithm
takes O(1) seconds to finish, while a quadratic-time algorithm requires O(n)
seconds. But as computing power increases exponentially over time, the
quadratic algorithm gets exponentially slower.For me it's not a matter of
which is true, both positions can be true, but what's interesting is to think
that storage and computation are in some cases fungible. Your architecture can
decide which tradeof</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90679985 <a title="1166-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_30%2C_2011.html">1166 high scalability-2011-12-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 30, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Nothing shows how much software architectures have changed than the
intelligent scheduling of computation over differently priced compute
resources. This isn't just a false economy either. Vimeo saves up to 50% on
their video transcoding bill by intelligently playing the spot, reserved, and
on-demand markets. If you are ready for some advanced reindeer games then take
a look at  Vimeo EC2 transcoding where they explain their thinking. Even if
you don't like their rules, it's the strategy that matters. This presentation
was from 2011, so it would be interesting to see if the new reserved instance
market has made a difference in their strategy. Here's Vimeo's approach for
minimizing costs using spot, reserved, and on-demand instances:Never bid more
than threshold. It is currently set to 80% of on-demand price.Not more than 10
open spot requests at any time.Bid 10% more than the average price over last
hourBuy reserve instance capacity to meet non-peak hour loads.Use spots for

<p>Introduction: Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail
system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded
architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each
with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies
(Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers . The benefit of this
approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA loadbalancing on the
perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move
accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users).
Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has
MySQL support. What we also liked about this approach was that it had no
dependency on a distributed or networked filesystem, so less chance of
corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches
capacity, we just off load users to a less used server. If any server goes
offline, it only affects the fraction of users</p><p>6 0.8936615 <a title="1166-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling_IMAP_and_POP3.html">81 high scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling IMAP and POP3</a></p>

written by two guys nobody has ever heard of before. Well, not exactly. The
site was created by top programmer and blog starsJeff AtwoodandJoel Spolsky.
In that sense Stack Overflow is like a celebrity owned restaurant, only it
should be around for a while. Joel estimates 1/3 of all the programmers in the
world have used the site so they must be serving up something good.I fell in

Architecture Update - Now at 95 Million Page Views a Month. Time for another
update. This time from a podcast. Every week or so Jeff, Joel and guests sit
around and converse. The result is a podcast. In a recent podcast they talked
about some of their recent architecture issues, problems, and updates. And
since I wrote this article before my vacation, they've also published a new
architecture update article:The Stack Exchange Architecture - 2011 Edition,
Episode 1.My overall impression is they are in a comfortable place, adding new
sites, adding new features, making a house a home.Notable for their scale-up
architecture, you might expect with their growth that they would slam into a
wall. Not so. They've been able to scale-up the power of individual servers by
adding more CPU and RAM. SSD has been added in some cases. Even their flagship

<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good
SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and
make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was
written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in A day in the life of a slow page
at Stack Overflow, where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was
possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for
other pages the improvement was 100x.Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of
his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the
tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:Using theirmini-
profiler it was shown that abadge detail pagewas taking 630.3 ms to load,
298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL
queries for the page and how long each took.From the historical logs, which
are stored inHAProxy on a month-by-month basis, Sam was able to determine this

<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for

In that sense Stack Overflow is like a celebrity owned restaurant, only it
should be around for a while. Joel estimates 1/3 of all the programmers in the
world have used the site so they must be serving up something good.I fell in
deep like with Stack Overflow for purely selfish reasons, it helped me solve a
few difficult problems that were jabbing my eyes out with pain. I also

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the Stack Overflow Architecture.
Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack
Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up
and out in the last few years.Stack Overflow has grown up by more then
doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page
views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  Stack Overflow has
grown out by expanding into theStack Exchange Network, which includes Stack
Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different
sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.What hasn't changed is
Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted
this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been
handling their growth: Stack Exchange's Architecture in Bullet Points, Stack
Overflow's New York Data Center, Designing For Scalability of Management and

<p>Introduction: Like many other media content providers, libraries and museums are
increasingly moving their content onto the Web.  While the move itself is no
easy process (with digitization, web development, and training costs), being
able to successfully deliver content to a wide audience is an ongoing concern,
particularly for large libraries.Much of the concern is financial, as most
libraries do not have the internal budget or outside investors that for-profit
businesses enjoy.  Even large university libraries will face serious budget
constraints that even other university departments, such as science and
technology would not face.Creating a scalable infrastructure and also
distributing a large digital collection that can handle multiple requests,
requires planning that many librarians have not even imagined.  They must stop
thinking in terms of "one-item-per-customer" and start thinking in terms of
numerous users accessing the same information simultaneously.Content Delivery

<p>Introduction: At least in the articles on Plenty of Fish and Slashdot it was mentioned that
one can achieve higher performance by creating read-only and write-only
databases where possible.I have read the comments and tried unsuccessfully to
find more information on the net about this. I still do not understand the
concept. Can someone explain it in more detail, as well as recommend resources
for further investigation? (Are there books written specifically about this
technique?) I think it is a very important issue, because databases are
oftentimes the bottleneck.</p><p>4 0.89932191 <a title="998-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-23-Paper%3A_Don%E2%80%99t_Settle_for_Eventual%3A_Scalable_Causal_Consistency_for_Wide-Area_Storage_with_COPS.html">1146 high scalability-2011-11-23-Paper: Don’t Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-Area Storage with COPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Teams fromPrincetonand CMU areworking togetherto solve one of the most
difficult problems in the repertoire: scalable geo-distributed data stores.
Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple
datacenter database functionality for some time, but there's still a general
lack of available systems that work for complex data scenarios.The ideas in
this paper--Don't Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-
Area Storage with COPS--are different. It's not another eventually consistent
system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based
system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally
consistent system that achievesALPSsystem properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL,
etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete
successfully), Low-latency (operations complete quickly (single digit
milliseconds)), Partition-tolerant (operates with a partition), and Scalable

<p>Introduction: In many of the recent discussions on the design of large scale systems (a.k.a.
Web Scale) it was argued that the right set of tradeoffs for building large
scale systems would be to give away Consistency for Availability and Partition
tolerance. Those arguments relied on the foundation of the CAP theorem
developed in early 2000-2002. One of the core principals behind the CAP
theorem is that you must choose two out of the three CAP properties. In many
of the transactional systems giving away consistency is either impossible or
yields a huge complexity in the design of those systems. In this series of
posts, I've tried to suggest a different set of tradeoffs in which we could
achieve scalability without compromising on consistency. I also argued that
rather than choosing only two out of the three CAP properties we could choose
various degrees of all three. The degrees would be determined by the most
likely availability and partition tolerance scenarios in our specific
application.  The su</p><p>6 0.89895135 <a title="998-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_9%2C_2012.html">1206 high scalability-2012-03-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 9, 2012</a></p>

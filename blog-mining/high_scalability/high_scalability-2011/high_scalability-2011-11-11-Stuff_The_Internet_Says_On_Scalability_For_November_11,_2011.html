<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: OK, thisinterview is with meon Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger
idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java
World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them
:-)The interview went an interesting direction, but there's more I'd like add
and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have
popped out at me:Java - It's the platform stupid. Java the language isn't the
big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM,
libraries, and toolsets.Java - It's the community stupid. A lot of creativity
is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability
challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing
Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.The fecundity of
the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our
multi-core future. There's a multi-core crisis going in case you haven't
heard.

<p>Introduction: In some ways the original Amazon cloud, the one most of us still live in, was
like that really cool house that when you stepped inside and saw the oldgreen
shag carpetin the living room, you knew the house hadn't been updated in a
while. The network is a little slow, the processors are a bit dated, and
virtualization made the house just feel smaller. It has been difficult to run
high bandwidth or low latency workloads in the cloud. Bottlenecks everywhere.
Not a big deal for most applications, but for many high performance
applications (HPC) it was a killer.In a typical house you might just do a
remodel. Upgrade a few rooms. Swap out builder quality appliances with
gleaming stainless steel monsters. But Amazon has a big lot, instead of
remodeling they simply keep adding on entire new wings, kind of like the
Winchester Mystery Houseof computing.The first new wing added was aCPU based
HPC system featuring blazingly fastNehalem chips, virtualization replaced by a

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: NetApp MetroCluster SoftwareCost-effective is an integrated high-availability
storage cluster and site failover capability.NetApp MetroCluster is an
integrated high-availability and disaster recovery solution that can reduce
system complexity and simplify management while ensuring greater return on
investment. MetroCluster uses clustered server technology to replicate data
synchronously between sites located miles apart, eliminating data loss in case
of a disruption. Simple and powerful recovery process minimizes downtime, with
little or no user action required.At one company I worked at they used the
NetApp snap mirror feature to replicate data across long distances to multiple
datacenters. They had a very fast backbone and it worked well. The issue with
NetApp is always one of cost, but if you can afford it, it's a good option.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.89365643 <a title="1141-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_11%2C_2011.html">1141 high scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 11, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Erasure codesare one of those seemingly magical mathematical creations that
with the developments described in the paper XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure
Codes for Big Data, are set to replace triple replication as the data storage
protection mechanism of choice.The result says Robin Harris (StorageMojo) in
an excellent article, Facebook's advanced erasure codes: "WebCos will be able
to store massive amounts of data more efficiently than ever before. Bad news:
so will anyone else."Robin says with cheap disks triple replication made sense
and was economical. With ever bigger BigData the overhead has become costly.
But erasure codes have always suffered from unacceptably long time to repair
times. This paper describes new Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) that are
efficiently repairable in disk I/O and bandwidth requirements:These systems
are now designed to survive the loss of up to four storage elements - disks,
servers, nodes or even entire data centers - without losing any data.

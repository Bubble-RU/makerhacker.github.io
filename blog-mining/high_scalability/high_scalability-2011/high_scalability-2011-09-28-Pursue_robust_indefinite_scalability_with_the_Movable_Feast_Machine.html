<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research is a paper presented
atHotOS XIII, the place where researchers talk about making potential futures
happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by
Matt Welsh: Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa.In the VM/cloud age I
question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly
against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out
the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS
holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the
OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between
legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but
one possible future.Introduction:For too long, operating systems researchers
and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished
out.

<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation Propagation Networks: A
Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation, offers to help us break
free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of
autonomous but interconnected machines.  We can do this byorganizing
computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of
which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the
network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the
structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.The abstract from
his thesis is:In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of
computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The
traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large
memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with
computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected
with stateful storage cells. In so</p><p>3 0.82119024 <a title="1127-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-12-The_Rise_of_the_Virtual_Cellular_Machines.html">826 high scalability-2010-05-12-The Rise of the Virtual Cellular Machines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

<p>Introduction: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic
is written by UC Berkeley's Joseph Hellersteinfor a keynote speech he gave at
PODS. The video version of the talk is here. You may have heard about Mr.
Hellerstein through theBerkeley Orders Of Magnitude project (BOOM), whose
purpose is to help people build systems that are OOM (orders of magnitude)
bigger than are building today, with OOM less effort than traditional
programming methodologies. A noble goal which may be why BOOM was rated as a
top 10 emerging technology for 2010 byMIT Technology Review. Quite an
honor.The motivation for the talk is a familiar one: it's a dark period for
computer programming and if we don't learn how to write parallel programs the
children of Moore's law will destroy us all. We have more and more processors,
yet we are stuck on figuring out how the average programmer can exploit them.
The BOOM solution is the Bloom language which is based onDedalus: Dedalus is a

<p>Introduction: In some ways the original Amazon cloud, the one most of us still live in, was
like that really cool house that when you stepped inside and saw the oldgreen
shag carpetin the living room, you knew the house hadn't been updated in a
while. The network is a little slow, the processors are a bit dated, and
virtualization made the house just feel smaller. It has been difficult to run
high bandwidth or low latency workloads in the cloud. Bottlenecks everywhere.
Not a big deal for most applications, but for many high performance
applications (HPC) it was a killer.In a typical house you might just do a
remodel. Upgrade a few rooms. Swap out builder quality appliances with
gleaming stainless steel monsters. But Amazon has a big lot, instead of
remodeling they simply keep adding on entire new wings, kind of like the
Winchester Mystery Houseof computing.The first new wing added was aCPU based

<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and
Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper: Pursue robust
indefinite scalability, wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural
networks, starting from scratch.What is this strange thing calledindefinite
scalability? They sound like words that don't really go together:Indefinite
scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended
computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense
as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network
designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable
because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-
core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of
numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-
engineered.Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to
programmers using rei</p><p>2 0.8545931 <a title="1127-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-31-NSFW%3A_Hilarious_Fault-Tolerance_Cartoon_.html">667 high scalability-2009-07-31-NSFW: Hilarious Fault-Tolerance Cartoon </a></p>

<p>Introduction: InA Brief History of the Internetit was revealed that the Internet wasbased on
the idea that there would be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary
design. The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying technical
idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In this approach, the
choice of any individual network technology was not dictated by a particular
network architecture but rather could be selected freely by a provider and
made to interwork with the other networks through a meta-level
"Internetworking Architecture".  With the cloud we are in the same situation
today, just a layer or two higher up the stack. We have independent clouds
that we would like to connect and work seamlessly together, preferably with
the ease at which we currently connect nodes to a network and networks to the
Internet. This technology seems to be called theIntercloud: an interconnected
global "cloud ofclouds" as apposed to theInternetwhich is a "network of
networks."Vinton Cerf,p</p><p>4 0.72971255 <a title="1127-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN_is_Not_a_Silver_Bullet_for_Network_Scalability.html">1256 high scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN is Not a Silver Bullet for Network Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak(CCIE#1354 Emeritus) is Chief Technology Advisor atNIL Data
Communications,author of numerous webinarsandadvanced networking books, and
aprolific blogger. He's focusing on data center and cloud networking, network
virtualization, and scalable application design.OpenFlow is an interesting
emerging networking technology appearingseemingly out of nowhere with much
hype and fanfarein March 2011. More than a year later, there are two
commercial products based on OpenFlow (NEC's Programmable FlowandNicira's
Network Virtualization Platform) and probably less than a dozen production-
grade implementations (includingGoogle's G-Scale networkandIndiana
University's campus network). Is this an expected result for an emerging
technology or another case of overhyped technology hitting limits imposed by
reality?OpenFlow-based solutions have to overcome numerous problems every
emerging technology is facing, in OpenFlow's case ranging from compatibility
with existing chipsets to incomplet</p><p>5 0.71501315 <a title="1127-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-19-We_Finally_Cracked_the_10K_Problem_-_This_Time_for_Managing_Servers_with_2000x_Servers_Managed_Per_Sysadmin.html">1550 high scalability-2013-11-19-We Finally Cracked the 10K Problem - This Time for Managing Servers with 2000x Servers Managed Per Sysadmin</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In 1999 Dan Kegel issued a big hairy audacious challenge to web servers:It's
time for web servers to handle ten thousand clients simultaneously, don't you
think? After all, the web is a big place now.This became known as theC10K
problem. Engineers solved the C10K scalability problems by fixing OS kernels
and moving away from threaded servers like Apache to event-driven servers like
Nginx and Node.Today we are considering an even bigger goal, how to support10
Million Concurrent Connections, which requires even more radical techniques.No
similar challenge was issued for managing servers in a datacenter, but
according toDave Nearyfrom Red Hat, in a recentFLOSS Weekly episode, we have
passed the 10K barrier for server management with 10,000 or more servers
managed per sysadmin.Should we let this milestone pass without
mention?Absolutely not! It's a stunning accomplishment with 200x-2000x
increases in productivity. Dave said he remembered in the 1990s it took one
sysadmin to manage 4 or 5 W</p><p>6 0.71356297 <a title="1127-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

 My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red ; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200 M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the switches.     These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are only available through Sun's factory integration.

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives  is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.     Lew Tucker    Lew Tucker is the Vice President and CTO of Sun Microsystems’ Cloud Computing initiative.     Lew’s career has been focused on scalable computing and web development. Lew worked at Sun Microsystems through the 1990’s. In 2002, Lew joined Salesforce.com and led the design and implementation of App Exchange. After Salesforce.com, Lew was CTO at Radar Networks, where he focused on the scalable design and build out of its semantic web service.    The Sun Cloud API    Sun has recently   announced   its   open RESTful API   for creating and managing cloud resources, including compute, storage, and networking components.

<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable solution that</p><p>6 0.062929489 <a title="1060-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-07-Sun_Acquires_Q-layer_in_Cloud_Computing_Play.html">486 high scalability-2009-01-07-Sun Acquires Q-layer in Cloud Computing Play</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jumping around the social mediasphere, it's not uncommon to feel the heat generated in praise of a favorite this or that over all the clearly inferior alternatives. Whilst human nature may never cool, I think Old Will had some insight worth considering the next time a flame threatens to flicker forth:
 
  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130)  
  
 
 
 

 My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red ; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damask, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground: And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare.

<p>Introduction: Hey guys,  There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy vmware...everywhere.  I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when it comes to resources.  What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.  Today we get lots of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well.  40x HP blades, apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's.  (20 servers in 2 datacentres).  The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our internal networks.  This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have ever lived by while working on the inet.  No airgaps from the unknown to the known!  I am interested in feedback on this scenario.  From a resource perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.  Do you think t</p><p>3 0.59232605 <a title="1060-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_31%2C_2012.html">1315 high scalability-2012-08-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 31, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors, attended the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto  NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid, InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came from the audience, which was refreshing. 
 
Overall a genial evening with some good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at giving a wide ra</p><p>4 0.24346367 <a title="1064-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-How_I_Learned_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Love_Using_a_Lot_of_Disk_Space_to_Scale.html">327 high scalability-2008-05-27-How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Using a Lot of Disk Space to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3 : ReadWriteWeb says  Google App Engine Announces New Pricing Plans, APIs, Open Access . Pricing is specified but I'm not sure what to make of it yet. An image manipulation library is added (thus the need to pay for more CPU :-) and memcached support has been added. Memcached will help resolve the can't write for every read problem that pops up when keeping counters.  Update 2 : onGWT.com threw a GAE load party and a lot of people came. The results at  Load test : Google App Engine = 1, Community = 0 . GAE handled a peak of 35 requests/second and a sustained 10 requests/second. Some think performance was good, others not so good. My GMT watch broke and I was late to arrive. Maybe next time. Also added a few new design rules from the post.   Update : Added a few new rules gleaned from the  GAE Meetup : Design By Explicit Cost Model and Puts are Precious.  How do you structure your database using a distributed hash table like  BigTable ? The answer isn't what you might expect.

<p>Introduction: Update:   Social networks in the database: using a graph database . A nice post on representing, traversing, and performing other common social network operations using a graph database.  If you are  Digg  or  LinkedIn  you can build your own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network relationships. For those of more modest means  Neo4j , a graph database, is a good alternative.  A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges (relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs) on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for relationships."  A graph looks something like:    For more lovely examples take a look at the  Graph Image Gal</p><p>6 0.21515876 <a title="1064-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-05-Drop_ACID_and_Think_About_Data.html">589 high scalability-2009-05-05-Drop ACID and Think About Data</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey , founder of  NuoDB , in this  thread  on the Cloud Computing group, delivers a  masterful post  on why he thinks the relational model is the best overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave new lock free world.... 
 
I'll  [Jim Starkey]  go into more detail later in the post for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the s</p><p>4 0.84555638 <a title="1064-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-16-Seven_Signs_You_May_Need_a_NoSQL_Database.html">779 high scalability-2010-02-16-Seven Signs You May Need a NoSQL Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus' long lost  NoSQL  codex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs you may need a NoSQL database...
  
  You noticed a lot of your database fields are really serialized complex objects in disguise . Why bother with a RDBMS at all then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a schemaless database from the start. 
  Using a standard query language has become too confining . You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so standard, it's really  not a challenge  anymore. You need to be different. Then NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely different  query mechanism . 
  Your toolbox only contains a hammer . Hammers wh</p><p>5 0.83294833 <a title="1064-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors, attended the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto  NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid, InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came from the audience, which was refreshing. 
 
Overall a genial evening with some good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at giving a wide ra</p><p>6 0.80959648 <a title="1064-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-29-Paper%3A_No_Relation%3A_The_Mixed_Blessings_of_Non-Relational_Databases.html">733 high scalability-2009-10-29-Paper: No Relation: The Mixed Blessings of Non-Relational Databases</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 17 :  Are Wireless Road Trains the Cure for Traffic Congestion?   BY   ADDY DUGDALE .  The concept of road trains--up to eight vehicles zooming down the road together--has long been considered a faster, safer, and greener way of traveling long distances by car 
 
 Update 16:  The first electric vehicle in the country  powered completely by ultracapacitors . The minibus can be fully recharged in fifteen minutes, unlike battery vehicles, which typically takes hours to recharge.
 
 Update 15:   How to Make UAVs Fully Autonomous . The Sense-and-Avoid system uses a four-megapixel camera on a pan tilt to detect obstacles from the ground. It puts red boxes around planes and birds, and blue boxes around movement that it determines is not an obstacle (e.g., dust on the lens).  Update 14:   ATNMBL is a concept vehicle  for 2040 that represents the end of driving and an alternative approach to car design.

 Who am I? I have 50 petabytes of data stored in Hadoop and Teradata, 400 million items for sale, 250 million queries a day, 100,000 pages served per second, 112 million active users, $75 billions sold in 2012...If you  guessed eBay  then you've won the auction. 
 Quotable Quotes:                                          
 
   Controlled Experiments at Large Scale : Bing found that every 100ms faster they deliver search result pages yields 0.6% more in revenue  
  Luis Bettencourt : A city is first and foremost a social reactor. It works like a star, attracting people and accelerating social interaction and social outputs in a way that is analogous to how stars compress matter and burn brighter and faster the bigger they are.

<p>Introduction: We've asked  What The Heck Are You Actually Using NoSQL For? . We've asked  101 Questions To Ask When Considering A NoSQL Database . We've even had a  webinar   What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for Scalable Web Applications .
 
Now we get to the point of considering use cases and which systems might be appropriate for those use cases.
  What are your options?  
First, let's cover what are the various data models. These have been adapted from  Emil Eifrem  and  NoSQL databases . 
 
 Document Databases 
  
 Lineage: Inspired by Lotus Notes. 
 Data model: Collections of documents, which contain key-value collections. 
 Example: CouchDB, MongoDB  
 Good at: Natural data modeling. Programmer friendly. Rapid development. Web friendly, CRUD. 
             Graph Databases    
 
 Lineage: Euler and graph theory. 
 Data model: Nodes & relationships, both which can hold key-value pairs 
 Example: AllegroGraph, InfoGrid, Neo4j 
 Good at:  Rock complicated graph problems. Fast.</p><p>4 0.96165305 <a title="1064-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-08-Google_AppEngine_-_A_First_Look.html">301 high scalability-2008-04-08-Google AppEngine - A First Look</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look around their documentation and seeing what stands out  for me. It's not the much speculated   super cluster VM  . AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran a   website out of S3   with a splash of   Heroku   thrown in as a chaser.      The idea is clearly to take advantage of our   massive multi-core future   by creating a shared nothing infrastructure based firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage: email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps.  A shared nothing request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build</p><p>5 0.96026075 <a title="1064-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets_to_Fotolog%27s_Scaling_Success.html">106 high scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300 thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?

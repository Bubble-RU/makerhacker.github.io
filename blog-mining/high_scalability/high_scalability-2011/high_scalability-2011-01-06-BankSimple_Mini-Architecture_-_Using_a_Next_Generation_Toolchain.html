<p>Introduction: This is the intriguing quote by Bill Venners in an interview with Twitter's Alex Payne on Twitter's heretical switch from a pure Ruby stack to a Ruby on Rails stack on the front-end and JVM/Scala on the back-end:      So performance was also one of the problems with JRuby, which I [Bill Venners] think helps explain better why they'd [Twitter] prefer Scala over Ruby or JRuby for some things.  I have often heard Rubyists say that although Ruby is slower than Java, for many things it is plenty fast enough, and they are right. The logic goes further, saying that servers are cheap, and programmers expensive, so it makes sense to tradeoff some runtime performance for programmer productivity. And I think that's very often true too, but not always.  If you have enough traffic, at some point the cost of servers outweighs the cost of programmers . I'm not sure whether Twitter is past that point, but they get a lot of traffic. And frankly this isn't an intrinsic tradeoff.

<p>Introduction: Update 6:  Some interesting changes from Twitter's  Evan Weaver : everything in RAM now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability; switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them locally.  Update 5:   Twitter on Scala . A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure  (long lived processes) and why they moved to  Scala  to program against it (high level langu</p><p>4 0.11796419 <a title="970-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-29-Strategy%3A_Let_Google_and_Yahoo_Host_Your_Ajax_Library_-_For_Free.html">665 high scalability-2009-07-29-Strategy: Let Google and Yahoo Host Your Ajax Library - For Free</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Offloading ALL JS Files To Google . Now you can let Google serve all your javascript files.  This article tells you how to do it (upload to Google Code Project) and why it's a big win (cheap, fast, caching, parallel downloads, save bandwidth).  Don't have a CDN? Why not let Google and Yahoo be your CDN? At least for Ajax libraries.  No charge. Google runs a  content distribution network and loading architecture for the most popular open source JavaScript libraries , which include: jQuery, prototype, script.aculo.us, MooTools, and dojo. The idea is web pages directly include your library of choice from Google's global, fast, and highly available network. Some have found much better performance and others experienced slower performance.  My guess is the performance may be slower if your data center is close to you, but far away users will be much happier. Some negatives: not all libraries are included, you'll load more than you need because all functionality is included.

<p>Introduction: In Scalability   issues for dummies  Alex Barrera talks movingly about the challenges he faces trying to scale his startup  inkzee  as the lone developer.  Inkzee is an  online news reader that automatically groups similar topics . This is a cool problem and is one you know right away is going to have some killer scalability problems as the number of feeds and the number of users increase. And these problems lead to the point of the post, to  explain here what are scalability problems and how deep the repercussions are for a small company , which Alex does admirably.   Some takeaways:
   Sites are composed of a frontend and backend. The backend isn't visible to users, but it does all the work and this is where the scalability problems show up.    As more and more users use a site it becomes slow because more users reveal bottlenecks in the system that weren't visible before.    There can be many many reasons for these bottlenecks. They are often very hard to find because the backend sy</p><p>6 0.11058214 <a title="970-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-The_Search_for_the_Source_of_Data_-_How_SimpleDB_Differs_from_a_RDBMS.html">306 high scalability-2008-04-21-The Search for the Source of Data - How SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot has been said already about Twitter's scalability issues. Many have given Twitter as an anti-pattern of how not to deal with scalability and have suggested different solutions for scaling it. As Twitter is famously a Ruby-on-Rails deployment, this case has also been used as a weapon in the language/platform wars between the RoR and Java camps, and to a lesser degree, also with the LAMP (PHP) camp</p><p>4 0.7147693 <a title="970-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-14-Designing_a_Scalable_Twitter.html">568 high scalability-2009-04-14-Designing a Scalable Twitter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There were many talks recently about twitter scalability and their specific choice of language such as Scala  to address their existing Ruby based scalability. In this post i tried to provide a more methodical approach for handling twitter scalability challenges that is centered around the right choice of architecture patterns rather then the language itself.   The architecture pattern are given in a generic fashion that is not specific to twitter itself and can serve anyone who is looking to build a scalable real time web application in the near future.</p><p>5 0.68202871 <a title="970-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-03-GOV.UK_-_Not_Your_Father%27s_Stack.html">1469 high scalability-2013-06-03-GOV.UK - Not Your Father's Stack</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm not sure what I was expecting the stack  GOV.UK used at launch  to look like. Maybe some messenger owls and lots of cobwebs? But not so at all. So much not so I thought any organization looking at their own stack for ideas could learn something from the considered choices of others.
 
The diversity of technologies used was surprising. They use "at least five different programming languages, three separate database types, two versions of an operating system." Some may think of this as a weakness, but they think it a strength:
  

The reason we operate such a diverse ecosystem is that we are focused on solving real problems. Our first task is to understand the problem or need we are solving and then to choose the best tool for the job. If we restrict ourselves to moulding the need to the tools we already have, then we risk not solving the initial problem in the best way possible for the user. By restricting software diversity or enforcing rigid organisational standards on a project,</p><p>6 0.67829376 <a title="970-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie_Lamport_to_Programmers%3A_You%27re_Doing_it_Wrong.html">1625 high scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie Lamport to Programmers: You're Doing it Wrong</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1 copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random server to serve the file as a temp fix...     It's a small video streaming service. I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's psuedo streaming, but it works.     I have been looking at MogileFS, which would solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar). However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth % usage?     Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>2 0.99549651 <a title="970-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-07-Using_ThreadLocal_to_pass_context_information_around_in_web_applications.html">115 high scalability-2007-10-07-Using ThreadLocal to pass context information around in web applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought is   class ReferenceIdGenerator {   public static setReferenceId(String login) {      threadLocal.set(login + System.currentMillis());   }     public static String getReferenceId() {     return threadLocal.get();   }   private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =       new ThreadLocal();       }     class MySevlet {     void service(.....) {       HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);      String userId = session.get("userId");          ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId</p><p>3 0.97979105 <a title="970-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-25-Peter_Norvig%27s_9_Master_Steps_to_Improving_a_Program.html">1601 high scalability-2014-02-25-Peter Norvig's 9 Master Steps to Improving a Program</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Inspired by a  xkcd comic ,  Peter Norvig ,  Director of Research at Google and all around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful systems profiled on HighScalability.  
 
 The original code is at  xkcd 1313: Regex Golf , which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's deliberate strategy for finding a regex.  
 
 The post demonstrating the iterated improvement of the program is at  xkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite Problems) . As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the program Peter recommends the following steps:

<p>Introduction: In  MemSQL Architecture  we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps eliminate contention and make writes fast. 
 
If this all sounds a little pie-in-the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it clearer:  A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List .
 
From the abstract:
  We propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization, searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms, this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that</p><p>5 0.97606641 <a title="970-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-07-Six_Lessons_Learned_Deploying_a_Large-scale_Infrastructure_in_Amazon_EC2_.html">559 high scalability-2009-04-07-Six Lessons Learned Deploying a Large-scale Infrastructure in Amazon EC2 </a></p>

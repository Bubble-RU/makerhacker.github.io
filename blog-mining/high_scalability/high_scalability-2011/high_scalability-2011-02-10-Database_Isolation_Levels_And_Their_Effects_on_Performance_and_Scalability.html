For example, some people believe that transactions are only related to data manipulation and not to queries, which is an incorrect assumption. Transaction Isolation is all about queries, and the consistency and completeness of the data retrieved by queries. This is how it works:
 
Isolation gives the querying user the feeling that he owns the database. It does not matter that hundreds or thousands of concurrent users work with the same database and the same schema (or even the same data). These other uses can generate new data, modify existing data or perform any other action. The querying user must be able to get a complete, consistent picture of the data, unaffected by other users’ actions.
 
Let’s take the following scenario, which is based on an Orders table that has 1,000,000 rows, with a disk size of 20 GB:
  
 8:00: UserA started a query “SELECT</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Let’s take the following scenario, which is based on an Orders table that has 1,000,000 rows, with a disk size of 20 GB:     8:00: UserA started a query “SELECT * FROM orders”, which queries all the rows of the table. [sent-8, score-0.69]
</p><p>2 In our scenario, this query usually takes approximately five minutes to complete, as the database must fully scan the table’s blocks from start to end and extract the rows. [sent-9, score-0.482]
</p><p>3 8:04: UserA’s query process arrives at the row modified by UserB. [sent-12, score-0.553]
</p><p>4 Will UserA get the original row value or the new row value? [sent-15, score-0.552]
</p><p>5 The new row value is legitimate and committed, but it was updated after UserA’s query started. [sent-16, score-0.605]
</p><p>6 The answer is not clear cut, and depends on the isolation level of the transaction. [sent-17, score-0.493]
</p><p>7 This isolation level is called  dirty reads , which means that read data is not consistent with other parts of the table or the query, and may not yet have been committed. [sent-21, score-0.906]
</p><p>8 This isolation level ensures the quickest performance, as data is read directly from the table’s blocks with no further processing, verifications or any other validation. [sent-22, score-0.767]
</p><p>9 This is because in the READ COMMITTED isolation level, the rows returned by a query are the rows that were committed when the  query  was started. [sent-25, score-1.519]
</p><p>10 The change made by UserB was not present when the  query  started, and therefore will not be included in the query result. [sent-26, score-0.855]
</p><p>11 This is because in the REPEATABLE READ isolation level, the rows returned by a query are the rows that were committed when the  transaction  was started. [sent-28, score-1.325]
</p><p>12 The change made by UserB was not present when the  transaction  was started, and therefore will not be included in the query result. [sent-29, score-0.661]
</p><p>13 This means that “ All consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot established by the first read ” (from MySQL documentation. [sent-30, score-0.699]
</p><p>14 SERIALIZABLE: This isolation level specifies that all transactions occur in a completely isolated fashion, meaning as if all transactions in the system were executed serially, one after the other. [sent-36, score-0.729]
</p><p>15 In Oracle, the REPEATABLE READ level is not supported and SERIALIZABLE provides the highest isolation level. [sent-39, score-0.493]
</p><p>16 The default isolation level in MySQL’s InnoDB is REPEATABLE READ, which provides a rather high isolation. [sent-41, score-0.493]
</p><p>17 Consider again this key sentence for the REPEATABLE READ isolation level: “ All consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot established by the first read ”. [sent-42, score-1.124]
</p><p>18 Since old values of row data are required for current queries, databases use a special segment to store old row values and snapshots. [sent-43, score-0.715]
</p><p>19 During query execution, each row is examined and if it is found to be  too new , an older version of this row is extracted from the rollback segment to comprise the query result. [sent-47, score-1.397]
</p><p>20 During the time it takes to process the query, more updates come in, making query execution time even longer! [sent-51, score-0.488]

With both the F1 and  Spanner  papers out its now possible to understand their interplay a bit holistically. So lets start by revisiting the key goals of both systems.
   Key Goals of F1′s design    
 
 System must be able to scale up by adding resources 
 Ability to re-shard and rebalance data without application changes 
 ACID consistency for transactions 
 Full SQL support, support for indexes 
 
       Spanner’s objectives    
 
 Main focus is on managing cross data center replicated data 
 Ability to re-shard and rebalance data 
 Automatically migrates data across machines

<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi Media, Inc:
   Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide for yourself.   
Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)  An interesting observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal</p><p>5 0.12638831 <a title="986-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL%3A_An_Overview_of_the_Various_Query_Semantics_in_the_Post_Only-SQL_World.html">867 high scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL: An Overview of the Various Query Semantics in the Post Only-SQL World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of  many of the scalability issues that we face today with traditional  database approach.
 
I think that the main reason so many people  have come to see SQL as the source of all evil is the fact that,  traditionally, the query language was burned into the database  implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to the  traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.
 
This view has  brought on a flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a  different aspect that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach,  such as a document model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as  Key/Value query.
 
Most of the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject,  and tend to use query semantics and architecture interchangeably. In  Part I  of this post i tried to provide quick overview of what  each query term stands for in the context of the NoSQL world .  Part II  illustrates those ide</p><p>6 0.12423931 <a title="986-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-22-Spanner_-_It%27s_About_Programmers_Building_Apps_Using_SQL_Semantics_at_NoSQL_Scale.html">1345 high scalability-2012-10-22-Spanner - It's About Programmers Building Apps Using SQL Semantics at NoSQL Scale</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with   MemSQL    cofounder’s    Eric Frenkiel    and    Nikita Shamgunov   , in which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their technology.     MemSQL ruffled a few feathers with their claim of being the fastest database in the world. According to their benchmarks MemSQL can execute 200K TPS on an EC2   Quadruple   Extra Large   and on a 64 core machine they can push 1.2 million transactions a second.     Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using a combination of technologies like    MVCC   , code generation,    lock-free data structures   ,    skip lists   , and    in-memory execution   . Familiar as in SQL and nothing but SQL. The only interface to MemSQL is SQL.    It’s right to point out MemSQL gets a boost by being a first release. Only a limited subset of SQL is supported, neither rep</p><p>4 0.74897873 <a title="986-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Database_Design_101.html">281 high scalability-2008-03-18-Database Design 101</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a firm schema.  I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding.  The data is essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song.  This lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together.  This will be in a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by artist album or song.  By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by.  The problem is that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it?  Should I go with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table?

With both the F1 and  Spanner  papers out its now possible to understand their interplay a bit holistically. So lets start by revisiting the key goals of both systems.
   Key Goals of F1′s design    
 
 System must be able to scale up by adding resources 
 Ability to re-shard and rebalance data without application changes 
 ACID consistency for transactions 
 Full SQL support, support for indexes 
 
       Spanner’s objectives    
 
 Main focus is on managing cross data center replicated data 
 Ability to re-shard and rebalance data 
 Automatically migrates data across machines 
 
  F1 – An overview  
 
 
 F1 is built on top of Spanner. Spanner offers support for for features such as – strong consistency through distributed transactions (2PC), global ordering based on timestam</p><p>6 0.67441344 <a title="986-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-01-FastBit%3A_An_Efficient_Compressed_Bitmap_Index_Technology.html">587 high scalability-2009-05-01-FastBit: An Efficient Compressed Bitmap Index Technology</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's time to do something a little different and for me that doesn't mean cutting off my hair and joining a monastery, nor does it mean buying a cherry red convertible (yet), it means doing a webinar!
  
 On December 14th, 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM EST, I'll be hosting  What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for Scalable Web Applications .  
 The webinar is sponsored by VoltDB, but it will be completely vendor independent, as that's the only honor preserving and technically accurate way of doing these things. 
 The webinar will run about 60 minutes, with 40 minutes of speechifying and 20 minutes for questions. 
 The hashtag for the event on Twitter will be  SQLNoSQL . I'll be monitoring that hashtag if you have any suggestions for the webinar or if you would like to ask questions during the webinar.

<p>Introduction: How do you scale an inbox that has multiple highly volatile feeds? That's a problem faced by social networks like Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter. Follow a few hundred event sources and it's hard to scalably order an inbox so that you see a correct view as event sources continually publish new events.
 
This can be considered like a  view materialization  problem in a database. In a database a view is a virtual table defined by a query that can be accessed like a table. Materialization refers to when the data behind the view is created. If a view is a join on several tables and that join is performed when the view is accessed, then performance will be slow. If the view is precomputed access to the view will be fast, but more resources are used, especially considering that the view may never be accessed.
 
Your wall/inbox/stream is a view on all the people/things you follow. If you never look at your inbox then materializing the view in your inbox is a waste of resources, yet you'll be ma</p><p>4 0.92317557 <a title="986-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-29-10_Things_Bitly_Should_Have_Monitored.html">1587 high scalability-2014-01-29-10 Things Bitly Should Have Monitored</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Monitor, monitor, monitor. That's the advice every startup gives once they reach a certain size. But can you ever monitor enough? If you are Bitly and everyone will complain when you are down, probably not.
 
Here are  10 Things We Forgot to Monitor  from Bitly, along with good stories and copious amounts of code snippets. Well worth reading, especially after you've already started monitoring the lower hanging fruit.
 
An interesting revelation from the article is that:
  

We run bitly split across two data centers, one is a managed environment with DELL hardware, and the second is Amazon EC2.  

   
  Fork Rate . A strange configuration issue caused processes to be created at a rate of several hundred a second rather than the expected 1-10/second.  
  Flow control packets .  A network configuration that honors flow control packets and isn’t configured to disable them, can temporarily cause dropped traffic. 
  Swap In/Out Rate . Measure the right thing.

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++ to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and platform independence (Java Bytecode). They may even have gotten better throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution, you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor. Why? Because of the unpredictable pauses introduced by the garbage collector which result in significant jitter (variance of execution time).      In this post Frederic Pariente  Engineering Manager at Sun Microsystems posted a summary of a case study on how the use of Sun Real Time JVM and  GigaSpaces was used in the context of of a customer proof-of-concept this summer to ensure   guaranteed latency per m</p><p>6 0.91146553 <a title="986-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-20-Berkeley_DB_Architecture_-_NoSQL_Before_NoSQL_was_Cool.html">1196 high scalability-2012-02-20-Berkeley DB Architecture - NoSQL Before NoSQL was Cool</a></p>

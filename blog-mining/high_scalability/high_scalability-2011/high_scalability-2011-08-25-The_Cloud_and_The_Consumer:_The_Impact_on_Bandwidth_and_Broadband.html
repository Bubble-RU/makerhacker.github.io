<p>Introduction: Remember  when the iPhone launched? Remember the complaints about the device not  maintaining calls well? Was it really the hardware? Or was it the  service provider network, overwhelmed by not just the call volume but  millions of hyper-customers experimenting with their new toy? Look – a  video! Look a video  and a call.  Hey, I’m on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and streaming audio at the same time I’m making a call! How awesome is that?
 
Meanwhile,  there’s an entire army of operators at a service provider’s NOC who are  stalking through the data center with scissors because it’s the only  way to stop the madness.
 
Service providers, probably better  than any other, understand “services”. For longer than the enterprise  has been talking about them, service providers have been implementing  them. They’ve got their own set of standards and reference architectures  and even language to describe them, but in a nutshell that’s what a  service provider does: offers services.

<p>Introduction: How do you keep in sync a crescendo of data between data centers over a slow WAN? That's the question   Alberto   posted a few weeks ago. Normally I'm not into all boy bands, but I was frustrated there wasn't a really good answer for his problem. It occurred to me later a WAN accelerator might help turn his slow WAN link into more of a LAN, so the overhead of copying files across the WAN wouldn't be so limiting. Many might not consider a WAN accelerator in this situation, but since my friend Damon Ennis works at the WAN accelerator vendor   Silver Peak  , I thought I would ask him if their product would help. Not surprisingly his answer is yes! Potentially a lot, depending on the nature of your data. Here's a no BS overview of their product:           What is it? - Scalable WAN Accelerator from Silver Peak (http://www.silver-peak.com)   What does it do? - You can send 5x-100x times more data across your expensive, low-bandwidth WAN link.

<p>Introduction: You might think major Internet companies have a latency, availability, and bandwidth advantage because they can afford expensive dedicated point-to-point private line networks between their data centers. And you would be right. It's a great advantage. Or it at least it was a great advantage. Cost is the great equalizer and companies are now scrambling for ways to cut costs. Many of the most recognizable Internet companies are moving to IP VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) as a much cheaper alternative to private lines. This is a strategy you can effectively use too.  This trend has historical precedent in the data center. In the same way leading edge companies moved early to virtualize their data centers, leading edge companies are now virtualizing their networks using IP VPNs to build inexpensive private networks over a shared public network. In kindergarten we learned sharing was polite, it turns out sharing can also save a lot of money in both the data center and on the network.

<p>Introduction: Update  :  as of the end of Q2 2011,  Akamai had 95,811  servers deployed globally.     
 
Akamai is the CDN to the stars. It claims to deliver between 15 and 30 percent of all Web traffic, with major customers like Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and the US military. Traditionally quite secretive, we get a peek behind the curtain in this paper:  The Akamai Network: A Platform for High-Performance Internet Applications  by Erik Nygren, Ramesh Sitaraman, and Jennifer Sun. 
  Abstract:
 Comprising more than 61,000 servers located across nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the components and capabilities of this large-scale distributed computing platform, and offer some insight into its architecture, design principles, operation, and management.

<p>Introduction: I found the discussion of the available bandwidth of tree vs higher dimensional virtual networks topologies quite, to quote Spock,  fascinating :   A mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developers of Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that the Gnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,  the Napster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network is severely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a million peers.  In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have overlooked the intrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the Gnutella network: a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the definition).  Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher dimensional topologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of interconnection topologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware implementations (see, e.g., Culler et</p><p>6 0.67822093 <a title="1105-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-22-Paper%3A_Revisiting_Network_I-O_APIs%3A_The_netmap_Framework.html">1213 high scalability-2012-03-22-Paper: Revisiting Network I-O APIs: The netmap Framework</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Cloud-based services for all things digital will either drive – or die by – bandwidth
 
   Consumers, by definition, consume. In the realm of the Internet, they consume far more than they produce. Or so it’s been in the past. Broadband connectivity across all providers have long offered asymmetric network feeds because it mirrored reality: an HTTP request is significantly smaller than its corresponding response, and in general web-based activity is heavily biased toward fat download and thin upload speeds. The term “broadband” is really a misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very narrowband of a typical consumer’s upload speed.
 
 cloud computing  , or to be more accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing all things digital “in the cloud”, network providers must consider the impact on them – and the satisfaction of their customer base with performa</p><p>2 0.90628558 <a title="1105-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-27-Three_steps_for_turning_a_tier-based-Spring-application_into_dynamically_scalable_services_%28video%29.html">432 high scalability-2008-10-27-Three steps for turning a tier-based-Spring-application into dynamically scalable services (video)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Summary    In this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out model.

<p>Introduction: Comet is an  active distributed key-value store  built at the University of Washington. The paper describing Comet is  Comet: An active distributed key-value store , there are also  slides , and a  MP3  of a presentation given at  OSDI '10 . Here's a succinct  overview of Comet :
  

Today's cloud storage services, such as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes, fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their data's behavior inside the storage service.

  
I found this paper quite interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-value store, which turns it into what might called a  key-code</p><p>4 0.84816843 <a title="1105-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-23-Product%3A_Varnish.html">74 high scalability-2007-08-23-Product: Varnish</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Varnish  is a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered by these operating systems.  Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.  Varnish is reported to be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>5 0.83989638 <a title="1105-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-09-No_to_SQL%3F_Anti-database_movement_gains_steam_%E2%80%93_My_Take.html">654 high scalability-2009-07-09-No to SQL?

<p>Introduction: In  this post  i wrote my view on the anti SQL database movement and where the alternative approach fits in:  - SQL databases are not going away anytime soon.  - The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.  - There is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions alongside traditional SQL databases.  In addition to the options that was mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative approach and how that fits into the puzzle. I used a real life scenario:   scalable Social network based eCommerce site where i outlined how in-memory approach was the only option they could scale and meet their application performance and response time requirements.</p><p>6 0.8255915 <a title="1105-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-06-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_6th%2C_2013.html">1559 high scalability-2013-12-06-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 6th, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean: can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something useful? 
 
Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often do very little to help front-line developers succeed. 
 
How many ideas break out of academia into industry in computer science?

  The unbearable cost of the cloud?   @marcoarment : My experiment with Amazon CloudSearch was going very well until I imported half of subscribers' bookmarks and saw it would cost $10k/month. 
  @JBossMike : Serious question: Do the Node.js hipsters enjoy not knowing WTF they're talking about when they talk about software scalability?

 Good discussion on the advisability of early stage ventures developing APIs that must be supported forever. Charlie Kindel says  Don’t Build APIs , unil you get more experience with your product you'll just get them wrong and be stuck with suppoprt. Pretty much everyone else disagrees, thinking the value of APIs outshines the risk.  Insightf</p><p>4 0.76903677 <a title="1113-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_22%2C_2011.html">1028 high scalability-2011-04-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 22, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be squashed.     To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer 2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtai</p><p>same-blog 2 0.86004776 <a title="1113-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_9%2C_2011.html">1113 high scalability-2011-09-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 9, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important.  Jim Scheinman,  former Bebo and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to scale as why they lost the social networking race:   VB  : Can you tell me a bit about what you learned in your time at Friendster? 
 
     JS  :  For me, it basically came down to failed execution on the technology side — we had millions of Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling us that if we didn’t get our site working better soon, they’d be ‘forced to join’ a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpace…the rest is history. To be fair to Friendster’s technology team at the time, they were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites simply hadn’t had to deal with prior to Friendster.

<p>Introduction: If you just can't get enough high scalability talk you might want to take a look GigaOm's Structure 08 conference. The slate of speakers looks appropriately interesting and San Francisco is truly magical this time of year. High Scalability readers even get a price break is you use the HIGHSCALE discount code! I'll be on vacation so I won't see you there, but it looks like a good time. For a nice change of pace consider visiting   MoMA   next door.  Here's a blurb on the conference:   A reminder to our readers about Structure 08, GigaOm's upcoming conference dedicated to web infrastructure. In addition to keynotes from leaders like Jim Crowe, chairman and CEO of Level 3 Communications and Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon, the event will feature workshops from Google App Engine, Microsoft and a special workshop from Fenwick and West who will cover how to raise money for an infrastructure start up.

<p>Introduction: Neil Conway  from Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk at  a meetup today  in San Francisco on a new paper:  Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming  - extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. 
 
The description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the paper:
  Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability. Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of strong consistency can be very challenging.

 


In this talk, I'll discuss work from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a broader range of</p><p>6 0.76241827 <a title="1113-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_5%2C_2013.html">1487 high scalability-2013-07-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 5, 2013</a></p>

the network is slow, but the problem is usually dropped packets due to
congestion. It's not usually latency, it's usually packet loss. Packet loss
causes TCP to back off and retransmit, which causes applications to appear
slow.Packet loss can be caused by a flakey transceiver, but the problem is
usually network congestion. Somewhere on the network there's fan-in, a

<p>Introduction: You might think major Internet companies have a latency, availability, and
bandwidth advantage because they can afford expensive dedicated point-to-point
private line networks between their data centers. And you would be right. It's
a great advantage. Or it at least it was a great advantage. Cost is the great
equalizer and companies are now scrambling for ways to cut costs. Many of the
most recognizable Internet companies are moving to IP VPNs (Virtual Private
Networks) as a much cheaper alternative to private lines. This is a strategy
you can effectively use too.This trend has historical precedent in the data
center. In the same way leading edge companies moved early to virtualize their
data centers, leading edge companies are now virtualizing their networks using
IP VPNs to build inexpensive private networks over a shared public network. In
kindergarten we learned sharing was polite, it turns out sharing can also save
a lot of money in both the data center and on the network.The line</p><p>4 0.14129221 <a title="1051-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-11-Strategy%3A_Don%27t_Use_Polling_for_Real-time_Feeds.html">759 high scalability-2010-01-11-Strategy: Don't Use Polling for Real-time Feeds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ivan Zuzak wrote a fascinating article onReal-time feed processing and
filteringusing Google App Engine to buildFeed-buster, a service thatinserts
MediaRSS tags into feeds that don't have them. He talks about using polling
andPubSubHubBub(real-time) to process FriendFeed feeds. Ivan is trying to
devise a separate filtering service where: filtering services should be
applied as close to the publisheras possible so notifications that nobody
wants don't waste network resource.processing services should be applied as
close to the subscriberso that the original update may be transported through
the network as a single notification for as long as possible.Besides being a
generally interesting article, Ivan makes an insightful observation on the
nature of using polling services in combination with metered
Infrastructure/Platform services:Polling is bad because AppEngine applications
have afixed free daily quotafor consumed resources, when the number of feeds
the service processed increased -t</p><p>5 0.12794557 <a title="1051-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-13-The_Secret_to_10_Million_Concurrent_Connections_-The_Kernel_is_the_Problem%2C_Not_the_Solution.html">1456 high scalability-2013-05-13-The Secret to 10 Million Concurrent Connections -The Kernel is the Problem, Not the Solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>6 0.1259165 <a title="1051-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-11-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Conditioning_Collection.html">1421 high scalability-2013-03-11-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Conditioning Collection</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says one of the
big lessons they've learned is to create lesschatty protocols:In the Netflix
data centers, we have a high capacity, super fast, highly reliable network.
This has afforded us the luxury of designing around chatty APIs to remote
systems. AWS networking has more variable latency. We've had to be much more
structured about "over the wire" interactions, even as we've transitioned to a
more highly distributed architecture.There's not a lot of advice out there on
how to create protocols. Combine that with a rush to the cloud and you have a
perfect storm for chatty applications crushing application performance.
Netflix is far from the first to be surprised by the less than stellar
networks inside AWS. A chatty protocol is one where a client makes a series of
requests to a server and the client must wait on each reply before sending the
next request. On a LAN this can work great. LAN's are typically fast, wide,

<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday
you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is
technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient
and made the diagnosis. What did they find?Diagnostic team: the Packet Pushers
gang (Greg Ferro,Jan Zorz,Ivan Pepelnjak) in the podcast How We Are Killing
the Internet.Diagnosis: invasive tunnelation. (tubes anyone?)Prognosis: even
Dr. House might not be able to help.Cure: go back to what the Internet was;
kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything;
disrupt the telcos.This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--
but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's
where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder,
tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's
all being carried out on battlefield few get to see: the infrastructure of

<p>Introduction: Who hasn't cursed their network for being slow while waiting for that annoying
little hour glass of pain to release all its grains of sand? But what's really
going on? Is your network really slow? PacketPushers Show 45 - Arista - EOS
Network Software Architecture has a good explanation of what may be really at
fault (paraphrased):Network operators get calls from application guys saying
the network is slow, but the problem is usually dropped packets due to
congestion. It's not usually latency, it's usually packet loss. Packet loss
causes TCP to back off and retransmit, which causes applications to appear
slow.Packet loss can be caused by a flakey transceiver, but the problem is
usually network congestion. Somewhere on the network there's fan-in, a
bottleneck develops, queues build up to a certain point, and when a queue
overflows it drops packets. Often the first sign of this happening is
application slowness.Queues get deeper and deeper because the network is
getting more and more use</p><p>2 0.93592989 <a title="1051-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-01-The_Pattern_Bible_for_Distributed_Computing.html">400 high scalability-2008-10-01-The Pattern Bible for Distributed Computing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>3 0.91330081 <a title="1051-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-05-A_Yes_for_a_NoSQL_Taxonomy.html">737 high scalability-2009-11-05-A Yes for a NoSQL Taxonomy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In many posts, such as: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges I
mentioned that synchronization the access to the shared resource is the major
challenge to write parallel code.The synchronization and coordination take
long time from the overall execution time, which reduce the benefits of the
parallelism; the synchronization and coordination also reduce the
scalability.There are many forms of synchronization and coordination, such
as:Create Task object in frameworks such as: Microsoft TPL, Intel TDD, and
Parallel Runtime Library. Create and enqueue task objects require
synchronization that it's takes long time especially if we create it into
recursive work such as: Quick Sort algorithm.Synchronization the access to
shared data.But there are a few techniques to avoid these issues, such as:
Shared-Nothing, Actor Model, and Hyper Object (A.K.A. Combinable Object).
Simply if we reduce the shared data by re-architect our code this will gives
us a huge benefits in performance and s</p><p>5 0.89729822 <a title="1051-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-16-WTF_is_Elastic_Data_Grid%3F_%28By_Example%29.html">843 high scalability-2010-06-16-WTF is Elastic Data Grid? (By Example)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Forrester released their new wave report:  The Forrester Waveâ&bdquo;˘: Elastic
Caching Platforms, Q2 2010where they listed GigaSpaces, IBM, Oracle, and
Terracotta as leading vendors in the field. In this post I'd like to take some
time to explain what some of these terms mean, and why they're important to
you. I'll start with a definition of Elastic Data Grid (Elastic Caching), how
it is different then other caching and NoSQL alternatives, and more
importantly -- I'll illustrate how it works through some real code
examples.You can read the full storyhere.</p><p>6 0.886666 <a title="1051-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-12-Report_from_OpenSocial_Meetup_at_Google.html">183 high scalability-2007-12-12-Report from OpenSocial Meetup at Google</a></p>

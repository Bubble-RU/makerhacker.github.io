<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Final Thoughts on SSD and MySQL AKA Battleship Spinn3r . Tips on how to make your database 10x faster using solid state drives. Potential exists for 100x speedup.       Solid-state drives   (SSDs) are the holy grail of storage. The promise of RAM speeds and hard disk like persistence have for years driven us crazy with power user lust, but they've stayed tantalizingly just out of reach. Always too expensive, too small, and oddly too slow. Has that changed? Can you now miraculously have your cake and eat it too? Can you now have it both ways? Is balancing work with family life now as easy as tripping over a terabyte drive?     In a pioneering series of blog articles Kevin Burton conducts original research on next generation SSD drives in real world configurations. For an experience report on his great adventure you can turn to:         Could SSD Mean a Rise in MyISAM Usage?  ,   Serverbeach, MySQL and Mtron SSDs  ,   Prediction: SSD Blades in 2008  ,   Zeus IOPS - Another High</p><p>4 0.14365527 <a title="980-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-22-It%27s_the_Fraking_IOPS_-_1_SSD_is_44%2C000_IOPS%2C_Hard_Drive_is_180.html">1066 high scalability-2011-06-22-It's the Fraking IOPS - 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS, Hard Drive is 180</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future? Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's  Artur Bergman  wants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the math already.
 
Here's Artur's logic:
  
 Wikia is all SSD in production. The new Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential, 6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past, you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs. 
 SSDs are cheaper than drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives. 
 With 8 million files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based). 
 4 GB/sec random read average latency 1 msec. 
 2.2 GB/sec random write average latency 1 msec.

  @fakesigi :  Thanks for the correction. I saw cloud computing, scalability and my brain turned off.  
  @BVA100 : I disagree with "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". We ought to be forward thinkers, concerned with leading indicators and scalability.

 Now we really know why vampires feed on blood...they are elastically acquiring more compute power.  Your Next Computer May Be Made of...Blood!  It's those  memristors  again. Ancient vamps are really just giant super computers. 
  Twitter now at 155 million tweets a day , up from 55 million a year ago. 
   10,000-core Linux supercomputer built in Amazon cloud  By Jon Brodkin. T he 10,000 cores were composed of 1,250 instances with eight cores each, as well as 8.75TB of RAM and 2PB disk space. The cluster ran for eight hours at a cost of $8,500 .

<p>Introduction: It's time to do something a little different and for me that doesn't mean cutting off my hair and joining a monastery, nor does it mean buying a cherry red convertible (yet), it means doing a webinar!
  
 On December 14th, 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM EST, I'll be hosting  What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for Scalable Web Applications .  
 The webinar is sponsored by VoltDB, but it will be completely vendor independent, as that's the only honor preserving and technically accurate way of doing these things. 
 The webinar will run about 60 minutes, with 40 minutes of speechifying and 20 minutes for questions. 
 The hashtag for the event on Twitter will be  SQLNoSQL . I'll be monitoring that hashtag if you have any suggestions for the webinar or if you would like to ask questions during the webinar.

<p>Introduction: Monitor, monitor, monitor. That's the advice every startup gives once they reach a certain size. But can you ever monitor enough? If you are Bitly and everyone will complain when you are down, probably not.
 
Here are  10 Things We Forgot to Monitor  from Bitly, along with good stories and copious amounts of code snippets. Well worth reading, especially after you've already started monitoring the lower hanging fruit.
 
An interesting revelation from the article is that:
  

We run bitly split across two data centers, one is a managed environment with DELL hardware, and the second is Amazon EC2.  

   
  Fork Rate . A strange configuration issue caused processes to be created at a rate of several hundred a second rather than the expected 1-10/second.  
  Flow control packets .  A network configuration that honors flow control packets and isn’t configured to disable them, can temporarily cause dropped traffic. 
  Swap In/Out Rate . Measure the right thing.

 Something we get to say more often than you might expect - funny NoSQL comic:  How to Write a CV  (SFW) 
 Playtomic shows hows how to  handle over 300 million events per day, in real time, on a budget .  
  More Speed, at $80,000 a Millisecond . Does  latency matter ? Oh yes... “On the Chicago to New York route in the US, three milliseconds can mean the difference between US$2,000 a month and US$250,000 a month.”

  @jkalucki : Throwing 1,920 CPUs and 4TB of RAM at an annoyance, as you do. @jointheflock 
  @hkanji : Scale can come quick and come hard. Be prepared. 
  @elenacarstoiu : When you say #Cloud, everybody's thinking lower cost. Agility, scalability and fast access are advantages far more important.

<p>Introduction: How do you scale an inbox that has multiple highly volatile feeds? That's a problem faced by social networks like Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter. Follow a few hundred event sources and it's hard to scalably order an inbox so that you see a correct view as event sources continually publish new events.
 
This can be considered like a  view materialization  problem in a database. In a database a view is a virtual table defined by a query that can be accessed like a table. Materialization refers to when the data behind the view is created. If a view is a join on several tables and that join is performed when the view is accessed, then performance will be slow. If the view is precomputed access to the view will be fast, but more resources are used, especially considering that the view may never be accessed.
 
Your wall/inbox/stream is a view on all the people/things you follow. If you never look at your inbox then materializing the view in your inbox is a waste of resources, yet you'll be ma</p><p>6 0.89352441 <a title="980-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-19-Gigaspaces_curbs_latency_outliers_with_Java_Real_Time.html">471 high scalability-2008-12-19-Gigaspaces curbs latency outliers with Java Real Time</a></p>

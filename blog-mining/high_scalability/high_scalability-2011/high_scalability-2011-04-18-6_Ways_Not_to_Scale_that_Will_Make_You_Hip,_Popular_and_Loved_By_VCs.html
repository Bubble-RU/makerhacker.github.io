<p>Introduction: Brian Zimmer, architect at travel startup Yapta, highlights some worst practices jeopardizing the growth and scalability of a system:   * The Golden Hammer. Forcing a particular technology to work in ways it was not intended is sometimes counter-productive. Using a database to store key-value pairs is one example. Another example is using threads to program for concurrency.   * Resource Abuse. Manage the availability of shared resources because when they fail, by definition, their failure is experienced pervasively rather than in isolation. For example, connection management to the database through a thread pool.   * Big Ball of Mud. Failure to manage dependencies inhibits agility and scalability.   * Everything or Something. In both code and application dependency management, the worst practice is not understanding the relationships and formulating a model to facilitate their management. Failure to enforce diligent control is a contributing scalability inhibiter.   * Forgetting to che</p><p>5 0.10968725 <a title="1026-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone.

  @kellabyte : XBOX Live scaling up from 15,000 servers to 300,000 servers. That's some scale right there. 
  @giuseppegurgone : [...] that could work for small projects. "why do we worry about scalability on day 1?" because tomorrow it could be too late :) 
  Max Boot : American troops found their tactics and technology, still designed to defeat an opponent like the now defunct Red Army, woefully inadequate to deal with these new threats. In this sort of war, there were no flanks to turn, few bastions to storm, no capitals to seize.

<p>Introduction: This is a hilarious presentation by  Josh Berkus , called  Scale Fail , given at O'Reilly MySQL CE 2011. Josh is entertaining, well spoken, and cleverly hides insight inside chaos. And he makes some dang good points along the way.
  Josh has a problem, you see Josh has learned how to make sites that are both scalable and reliable. So he's puzzled why companies "whose downtime interfaces (Twitter) are more well known than their uptime interfaces" get all the attention, respect, and money for being failures. Just doing your job doesn't make you a hero.  You need these self-inflicted wounds in-order to have the war stories to share at conferences. They get the attention. Just doing your job is boring. This is so unfair in that way life can be. 
 
  
 
So if you want to turn the tables and take the low road to fame and fortune, here's Josh's program for learning how not to scale:
  
  Be trendy . Use the tool that has the most buzz: NoSQL, Cloud, MapReduce, Rails, RabbitMQ.

<p>Introduction: For a great Christmas read forget  The Night Before Christmas , a heart warming poem written by Clement Moore for his children, that created the modern idea of Santa Clause we all know and anticipate each Christmas eve. Instead, curl up with a some potentÂ  eggnog , nog being any drink made with rum, and readÂ  CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control Â by Mihai Letia, Nuno PreguiĂ§a, and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),  a data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent .
 
From the introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed consistency issues:
  

Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach [</p><p>4 0.82053006 <a title="1026-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-02-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_2%2C_2012.html">1203 high scalability-2012-03-02-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 2, 2012</a></p>

 Quotable quotes:             
 
  @karmafile : "Scalability" is a much more evil word than we make it out to be 
  @ostaquet : More hardware won't solve #SQL resp. time issues; proper indexing does. 
  @datachick : All computing technology is the rearrangement of data. Data is the center of the universe 
 ‏ @jamesurquhart : "Complexity is a characteristic of the system, not of the parts in it." 
 
 
 Data is the star of the cat walk, looking fierce in Ilya Katsov's impeccably constructed post on  NoSQL Data Modeling Techniques : In this article I provide a short comparison of NoSQL system families from the data modeling point of view and digest several common modeling techniques.  
 Peter Burns  talks computer nanosecond time scales  as a human might experience them. Your memory == computer registers , L1 cache == papers kept close by, L2 cache == books, RAM == the library down the street, and going to disk is a 3 year odessy for data.

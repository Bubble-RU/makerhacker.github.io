<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says one of the
big lessons they've learned is to create lesschatty protocols:In the Netflix
data centers, we have a high capacity, super fast, highly reliable network.
This has afforded us the luxury of designing around chatty APIs to remote
systems. AWS networking has more variable latency. We've had to be much more
structured about "over the wire" interactions, even as we've transitioned to a
more highly distributed architecture.There's not a lot of advice out there on
how to create protocols. Combine that with a rush to the cloud and you have a
perfect storm for chatty applications crushing application performance.
Netflix is far from the first to be surprised by the less than stellar
networks inside AWS. A chatty protocol is one where a client makes a series of
requests to a server and the client must wait on each reply before sending the
next request. On a LAN this can work great. LAN's are typically fast, wide,

<p>Introduction: All,I'm just new to this and have a basic understanding how CDN works? My
questions are:1. How does CDN sync data with web servers for video/images? If
I have a user to upload a video to my site, will it get stored directly in CDN
or it comes to my webserver first and then sync-ed with cache server?2. How to
have only the dynamic video/image delivered through CDN while the rest is
served by a webserver?3. How sync happens and who pays for the bandwidth for
sync?I'd appreciate if someone could explain this.Regards,Janakan Rajendran</p><p>4 0.16419147 <a title="1001-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Letting_Clients_Know_What%27s_Changed%3A_Push_Me_or_Pull_Me%3F.html">205 high scalability-2008-01-10-Letting Clients Know What's Changed: Push Me or Pull Me?</a></p>

pull me, push me, or pull me out .So true Perl Jam(Push me Pull me lyrics), so

Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from
servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.breakTo pull
events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server.
This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a
list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has
changed and makes those changes available to you. Knowing what has changed can
be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very
complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state
on what I client still needs to see.Polling is heavy man. Imagine all your

<p>Introduction: Youmight haveconsistency problems if you have: multiple datastores in multiple
datacenters, without distributed transactions, and with the ability to
alternately execute out of each datacenter;  syncing protocols that can fail
or sync stale data; distributed clients that cache data and then write old
back to the central store; a NoSQL database that doesn't have transactions
between updates of multiple related key-value records; application level
integrity checks; client drivenoptimistic locking.Sounds a lot like many
evolving, loosely coupled, autonomous, distributed systems these days. How do
you solve these consistency problems? Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix talks
about how they solved theirs in his excellent presentation, NoSQL @ Netflix :
Part 1, given to a packed crowd at aCloud Computing Meetup. You might be
inclined to say how silly it is to have these problems in the first place, but
just hold on. See if you might share some of their problems, before getting

few ways you can defend yourself, secrets revealed by scaling masters across
the ages. Note that these are low level programming level moves, not large
architecture type strategies.Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed LimitThis
is probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an
application. What it means:Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you
know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of
objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of
objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion.Devise ways of tying
what you need to do to the individual resources.Some examples:Keep a list of
purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of
the line items because the number of items can be much larger than the number
of purchase orders. You have kept the resource usage proportional to the

<p>Introduction: This strategy targets reducing the amount of protocol data in packets by
sending only the attributes that are needed. Google calls this Partial
Response and Partial Update.Netflix posted about adopting this strategy in
their recent Netflix API redesign. We've seen previously how Netflix improved
performance by creatingless chatty protocols.As a consequence packet sizes
rise as more data is being stuffed into each packet in order to reduce the
number of round trips. But we don't like large packets either (memory usage
and packet processing overhead), so we have to think of creative ways to
shrink them back down.The change Netflx is making is to conceptualize their
API as a database. What does this mean?Apartial responseis like a SQL select
statement where you can specify only the fields you want back. Only the
attributes of interest are requested.  Previously all fields for objects were
returned, even if the client didn't need them. So the goal is reduce payload
sizes by being more sele</p><p>2 0.94799078 <a title="1001-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_11%2C_2012.html">1244 high scalability-2012-05-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 11, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: "It's all a numbers game - the dirty little secret of scalable systems"Martin
Thompsonis a High Performance Computing Specialist with a real mission to
teach programmers how to understand the innards of modern computing systems.
He has many talks and classes (listed below) on caches, buffers, memory
controllers, processor architectures, cache lines, etc.His thought is
programmers do not put a proper value on understanding how the underpinnings
of our systems work. We gravitate to the shiny and trendy. His approach is not
to teach people specific programming strategies, but to teach programmers to
fish so they can feed themselves. Without a real understanding strategies are
easy to apply wrongly.  It's strange how programmers will put a lot of effort
into understanding complicated frameworks like Hibernate, but little effort
into understanding the underlying hardware on which their programs run.A major
tenant of Martin's approach is to "lead by experimental observation rather
than what</p><p>4 0.93395811 <a title="1001-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-06-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Aggregation_Collection.html">1418 high scalability-2013-03-06-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Aggregation Collection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What good are problems without solutions? In 42 Monster Problems That Attack
As Loads Increase we talked about problems. In this first post (OK, there was
an earlier post, but I'm doing some reorganizing), we'll cover what I
callaggregation strategies.Keep in mind these are low level architecture type
suggestions of how to structure the components of your code and how they
interact. We're not talking about massive scale-out clusters here, but of what
your applications might like like internally, way below the service level
interface level. There's a lot more to the world than evented
architectures.Aggregation simply means we aren't using stupid queues. Our
queues will be smart. We are deeply aware of queues as containers of work that
eventually dictate how the entire system performs. As work containers we know
intimately what requests and data sit in our queues and we can use that
intelligence to our great advantage.Prioritize WorkThe key idea to it all is

<p>Introduction: The argument for a massively multicore future is now familiar: while clock
speeds have leveled off, device density is increasing, so the future is cheap
chips with hundreds and thousands of cores. That's the inexorable logic behind
our multicore future.The unsolved question that lurks deep in the dark part of
a programmer's mind is: how on earth are we to program these things? For
problems that aren'tembarrassingly parallel, we really have no idea. IBM
Research'sDavid Ungarhas an idea. And it's radical in the extreme...Grace
Hopperonce advised "It's easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to get
permission." I wonder if she had any idea that her strategy for dealing with
human bureaucracy would the same strategy David Ungar thinks will help us tame
the technological bureaucracy of 1000+ core systems?You may recognize David as

technology in the JVM and the prototype model used by Javascript. He's also

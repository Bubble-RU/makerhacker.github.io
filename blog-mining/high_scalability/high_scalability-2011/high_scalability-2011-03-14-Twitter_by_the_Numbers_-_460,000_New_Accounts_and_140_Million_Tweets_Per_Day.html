<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood

<p>Introduction: If Twitter is the "nervous system of the web" as some people think, then what
is the brain that makes sense of all those signals (tweets) from the nervous
system? That brain is the Twitter Analytics System and Kevin Weil, as
Analytics Lead at Twitter, is the homunculus within in charge of figuring out
what those over 100 billion tweets (approximately the number of neurons in the
human brain) mean.Twitter has only 10% of the expected 100 billion tweets now,
but a good brain always plans ahead. Kevin gave a talk,Hadoop and Protocol
Buffers at Twitter, at theHadoop Meetup, explaining how Twitter plans to use
all that data to an answer key business questions.What type of questions is
Twitter interested in answering? Questions that help them better understand
Twitter. Questions like:How many requests do we serve in a day?What is the
average latency?How many searches happen in day?How many unique queries, how
many unique users, what is their geographic distribution?What can we tell
about as</p><p>5 0.14763834 <a title="1004-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-24-Build_your_own_twitter_like_real_time_analytics_-_a_step_by_step_guide.html">1251 high scalability-2012-05-24-Build your own twitter like real time analytics - a step by step guide</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Major social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter have developed
their own architectures for handling the need for real-time analytics on huge
amounts of data. However, not every company has the need or resources to build
their own Twitter-like solution.In this example we have taken the same Twitter
/Facebook-like blueprint, and made it simple enough for developers to
implement. We have taken the following approach in our implementation: Use In
Memory Data Grid (XAP) for handling the real time stream data-
processing.BigData data-base (Cassandra) for storing the historical data and
manage the trend analytics Use Cloudify (cloudifysource.org)  for managing and
automating the deployment on private or public cloudThe example demonstrate a
simple case of word count analytics. It uses Spring Social to plug-in to real
twitter feeds. The solution is designed to efficiently cope with getting and
processing the large volume of tweets. First, we partition the tweets so that

<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: Hello highscalability world. I just discovered this site yesterday in a search
for a scalability resource and was very pleased to find such useful
information. I have some questions regarding distributed caching that I was
hoping the scalability intelligentsia trafficking this forum could answer. I
apologize for my lack of technical knowledge; I'm hoping this site will
increase said knowledge! Feel free to answer all or as much as you want. Thank
you in advance for your responses and thank you for a great resource!1.) What
are the standard benchmarks used to measure the performance of memcached or
mySQL/memcached working together (from web 2.0 companies etc)?2.) The little
research I've conducted on this site suggests that most web 2.0 companies use
a combination of mySQL and a hacked memcached (and potentially sharding). Does
anyone know if any of these companies use an enterprise vendor for their
distributed caching layer? (At this point in time I've only heard of Jive
software using</p><p>3 0.77475482 <a title="1004-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-10-How_FarmVille_Scales_-_The_Follow-up.html">792 high scalability-2010-03-10-How FarmVille Scales - The Follow-up</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several readers had follow-up questions in response toHow FarmVille Scales to
Harvest 75 Million Players a Month. Here are Luke's response to those
questions (and a few of mine).How does social networking makes things easier
or harder?The primary interesting aspect of social networking games is how you
wind up with a graph of connected users who need to be access each other's
data on a frequent basis. This makes the overall dataset difficult if not
impossible to partition.What are examples of the Facebook calls you try to
avoid and how they impact game play?We can make a call for facebook friend
data to retrieve information about your friends playing the game. Normally, we
show a friend ladder at the bottom of the game that shows friend information,
including name and facebook photo. Can you say where your cache is, what form
it takes, and how much cached there is? Do you have a peering relationship
with Facebook, as one might expect at that bandwidth?We use memcache as our

<p>Introduction: Solve only 80% of a problem. That's usually good enough and you'll not only
get done faster, you'll actually have a chance of getting done at all.This
strategy is given by Amix inHOW TWITTER (AND FACEBOOK) SOLVE PROBLEMS
PARTIALLY. The idea is solving 100% of a complex problem can be so hard and so
expensive that you'll end up wasting all your bullets on a problem that could
have been satisfactoraly solved in a much simpler way.The example given is for
Twitter's real-time search. Real-time search almost by definition is focussed
on recent events. So in the design should you be able to search historically
back from the beginning of time or should you just be able to search for
recent time periods? A complete historical search is the 100% solution. The
recent data only search is the 80% solution. Which should you choose?breakThe
100% solution is dramatically more difficult to solve. It requires searching
disk in real-time which is a killer. So it makes more sense to work on the 80%

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the Stack Overflow Architecture.
Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack
Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up
and out in the last few years.Stack Overflow has grown up by more then
doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page
views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  Stack Overflow has
grown out by expanding into theStack Exchange Network, which includes Stack
Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different
sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.What hasn't changed is
Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted
this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been
handling their growth: Stack Exchange's Architecture in Bullet Points, Stack

<p>Introduction: The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the
hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming
reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality
augmentation, live crab (fresh and local), and live event publishing. One of
the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video
broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a broadcaster and a
consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you
can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a
time shift war. The resources and the engineering needed to make this happened
must be substantial. How do you do that?To find out I talked to Kyle Vogt,
Justin.tv Founder and VP of Engineering. Justin.tv certainly has the numbers.
Their 30 million unique monthly visitors even outshine YouTube in the video
upload game, reportedly uploading nearly 30 hours per minute of video compared
to YouTub</p><p>5 0.16684473 <a title="1131-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-15-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Justin.Tv%27s_Live_Video_Broadcasting_Architecture.html">1359 high scalability-2012-11-15-Gone Fishin': Justin.Tv's Live Video Broadcasting Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In Don't panic! Here's how to quickly scale your mobile apps Mike
Maelzerpaints a wonderful picture of howAvocado, a mobile app for connecting
couples, evolved to handle 30x traffic within a few weeks. If you are just
getting started then this is a great example to learn from.What I liked: it's
well written, packing a lot of useful information in a little space; it's
failure driven, showing the process of incremental change driven by purposeful
testing and production experience; it shows awareness of what's important, in
their case, user signup; a replica setup was used for testing, a nice cloud
benefit. Their Biggest lesson learned is a good one:It would have been great
to start the scaling process much earlier. Due to time pressure we had to make
compromises -like dropping four of our media resizer boxes. While throwing
more hardware at some scaling problems does work, it's less than ideal.Here's

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg, the first paid employee at reddit, teaches us a lot about how
to create a successful social site in a really good talk he gave at the RAMP
conference. Watch it here at Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion-
Pitfalls and Lessons.Jeremy uses a virtue and sin approach. Examples of the
mistakes made in scaling reddit are shared and it turns out they did a lot of
good stuff too. Somewhat of a shocker is that Jeremy is now a Reliability
Architect at Netflix, so we get a little Netflix perspective thrown in for
free.Some of the lessons that stood out most for me: Think of SSDs as cheap
RAM, not expensive disk. When reddit moved from spinning disks to SSDs for the
database the number of servers was reduced from 12 to 1 with a ton of
headroom. SSDs are 4x more expensive but you get 16x the performance. Worth
the cost. Give users a little bit of power, see what they do with it, and turn
the good stuff into features. One of the biggest revelations for me was how

Istanbul.I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together
with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I
contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.Those were the days
our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and
applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot
of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we
can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml
descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to
use the curse called "XDoclet".On the other side, our company grew steadily,
our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and
ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew
considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of
money.

<p>Introduction: We've had a few articles on theStackOverlflow Architecture and Stack Overflow
Architecture Update - Now at 95 Million Page Views a Month. Time for another
update. This time from a podcast. Every week or so Jeff, Joel and guests sit
around and converse. The result is a podcast. In a recent podcast they talked
about some of their recent architecture issues, problems, and updates. And
since I wrote this article before my vacation, they've also published a new
architecture update article:The Stack Exchange Architecture - 2011 Edition,
Episode 1.My overall impression is they are in a comfortable place, adding new
sites, adding new features, making a house a home.Notable for their scale-up
architecture, you might expect with their growth that they would slam into a
wall. Not so. They've been able to scale-up the power of individual servers by
adding more CPU and RAM. SSD has been added in some cases. Even their flagship
StackOverflow product runs on a single server.

<p>Introduction: Dr. Daniel Abadi, author of theDBMS Musings blog and Cofounder ofHadapt, which
offers a product improving Hadoop performance by 50x on relational data, is
now taking his talents to graph data in Hadoop's tremendous inefficiency on
graph data management (and how to avoid it), which shares the secrets of
getting Hadoop to perform 1000x better on graph data.TL;DR:Analysing graph
data is at the heart ofimportant data mining problems.Hadoop is the tool of
choice for many of these problems.Hadoop style MapReduce works best on
KeyValue processing, not graph processing, and can be well over a factor of
1000 less efficient than it needs to be.Hadoop inefficiency has consequences
in real world. Inefficiencies on graph data problems like improving power
utilization, minimizing carbon emissions, and improving product designs, leads
to a lot value being left on the table in the form of negative environmental
consequences, increased server costs, increased data center space, and
increased energy cos</p><p>6 0.94498074 <a title="1131-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-22-Paper%3A_The_Case_for_RAMClouds%3A_Scalable_High-Performance_Storage_Entirely_in_DRAM_.html">726 high scalability-2009-10-22-Paper: The Case for RAMClouds: Scalable High-Performance Storage Entirely in DRAM </a></p>

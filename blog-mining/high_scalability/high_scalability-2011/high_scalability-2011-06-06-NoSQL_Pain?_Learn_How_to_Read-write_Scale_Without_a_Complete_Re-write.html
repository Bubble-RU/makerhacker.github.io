<p>Introduction: Guest post by  Asya Kamsky , Principal Solutions Architect at MongoDB. 
 
This post outlines ten things you need to know for operating MongoDB at scale based on my experience working with MongoDB customers and open source users:
  
  MongoDB requires DevOps, too.  MongoDB is a database. Like any other data store, it requires capacity planning, tuning, monitoring, and maintenance. Just because it's easy to install and get started and it fits the developer paradigm more naturally than a relational database, don't assume that MongoDB doesn't need proper care and feeding.  And just because it performs super-fast on a small sample dataset in development doesn't mean you can get away without having a good schema and indexing strategy, as well as the right hardware resources in production! But if you prepare well and understand the best practices, operating large MongoDB clusters can be boring instead of nerve-wracking. 
  Successful MongoDB users monitor everything and prepare for growth.</p><p>3 0.14605077 <a title="1054-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_29%2C_2011.html">1089 high scalability-2011-07-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 29, 2011</a></p>

Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it’s true that the marketing wave of NoSQL has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that’s been around for quite a while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all, everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very p</p><p>5 0.13360089 <a title="1054-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-09-10_NoSQL_Systems_Reviewed.html">739 high scalability-2009-11-09-10 NoSQL Systems Reviewed</a></p>

A very thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of approaches to not being a relational database.

<p>Introduction: So much good stuff this week...
  
 Adrian Cockcroft  Compares NoSQL Availability Models .  Let's risk feeding the CAP trolls, and try to get some insight into the differences between the many NoSQL contenders . Adrian asks how each NoSQL product will add a movie to its favorites list, read it back, and how this works across availability zones. Much trickier than it sounds with multiple writers. Cassandra and MongoDB answer back.

<p>Introduction: In the "should I or shouldn't I" debate around deploying SSD, it always helps to have real-world data. Fiesta! with a  live-blog    summary of a presentation by Kenny Gorman on  Shutterfly on MongoDB Performance Tuning .
  

What if you still need more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs. Shutterfly uses  Facebook’s flashcache : kernel module to cache data on SSD. Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O. Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can delay sharding: less complexity.

  
The whole  series of posts  has a lot of great information and is worth a longer look, especially if you are considering using MongoDB.

Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it’s true that the marketing wave of NoSQL has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that’s been around for quite a while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all, everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very p</p><p>6 0.7623437 <a title="1054-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-05-A_Yes_for_a_NoSQL_Taxonomy.html">737 high scalability-2009-11-05-A Yes for a NoSQL Taxonomy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Nothing shows how much software architectures have changed than the intelligent scheduling of computation over differently priced compute resources. This isn't just a false economy either. Vimeo saves up to 50% on their video transcoding bill by intelligently playing the spot, reserved, and on-demand markets. If you are ready for some advanced reindeer games then take a look at   Vimeo EC2 transcoding  where they explain their thinking. Even if you don't like their rules, it's the strategy that matters. This presentation was from 2011, so it would be interesting to see if the new reserved instance market has made a difference in their strategy. 
 
Here's Vimeo's approach for minimizing costs using spot, reserved, and on-demand instances:
  
 Never bid more than threshold. It is currently set to 80% of on-demand price. 
 Not more than 10 open spot requests at any time. 
 Bid 10% more than the average price over last hour 
 Buy reserve instance capacity to meet non-peak hour loads.

<p>Introduction: Professor Lance Fortnow, in his blog post  Drowning in Data , says complexity has taught him this lesson:  When storage is expensive, it is cheaper to recompute what you've already computed. And that's the world we now live in: Storage is pretty cheap but data acquisition and computation are even cheaper. 
 
Jouni, one of the commenters, thinks the opposite is true:  storage is cheap, but computation is expensive. When you are dealing with massive data, the size of the data set is very often determined by the amount of computing power available for a certain price .  With such data, a linear-time algorithm takes O(1) seconds to finish, while a quadratic-time algorithm requires O(n) seconds. But as computing power increases exponentially over time, the quadratic algorithm gets exponentially slower .
 
For me it's not a matter of which is true, both positions can be true, but what's interesting is to think that storage and computation are in some cases fungible.

Learn How to Read-write Scale Without a Complete Re-write</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lately I've been reading more cases were different people have started to realize the limitations of the NoSQL promise to database scalability. Note the references below:
     
  Why does Quora use MySQL as the data store instead of NoSQLs such as Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB etc?  
  Why did Diaspora abandon MongoDB for MySQL?  
  How scalable is CouchDB in practice, not just in theory?  
   

Take MongoDB for example. It's damn fast, but it doesn't really know how to save data reliably to disk. I've had it set up in a replica pair to mitigate that risk. Guess what - both servers in the pair failed and corrupted their data files at the same day.

  
It appears that for many, the switch to NoSQL can be rather painful. IMO that doesn't necessarily mean that NoSQL is wrong in general, but it's a combination of 1) lack of maturity 2) not the right tool for the job.
 
That brings the question of what's the alternative solution?

<p>Introduction: Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies (Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers . The benefit of this approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA loadbalancing on the perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users). Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has MySQL support. What we also liked about this approach was that it had no dependency on a distributed or networked filesystem, so less chance of corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches capacity, we just off load users to a less used server. If any server goes offline, it only affects the fraction of users</p><p>6 0.8865844 <a title="1054-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-08-Yahoo%21%27s_PNUTS_Database%3A_Too_Hot%2C_Too_Cold_or_Just_Right%3F.html">676 high scalability-2009-08-08-Yahoo!'s PNUTS Database: Too Hot, Too Cold or Just Right?</a></p>

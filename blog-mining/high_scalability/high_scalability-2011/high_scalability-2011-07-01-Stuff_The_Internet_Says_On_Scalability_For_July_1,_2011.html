<p>Introduction: This is the intriguing quote by Bill Venners in an interview with Twitter's Alex Payne on Twitter's heretical switch from a pure Ruby stack to a Ruby on Rails stack on the front-end and JVM/Scala on the back-end:      So performance was also one of the problems with JRuby, which I [Bill Venners] think helps explain better why they'd [Twitter] prefer Scala over Ruby or JRuby for some things.  I have often heard Rubyists say that although Ruby is slower than Java, for many things it is plenty fast enough, and they are right. The logic goes further, saying that servers are cheap, and programmers expensive, so it makes sense to tradeoff some runtime performance for programmer productivity. And I think that's very often true too, but not always.  If you have enough traffic, at some point the cost of servers outweighs the cost of programmers . I'm not sure whether Twitter is past that point, but they get a lot of traffic. And frankly this isn't an intrinsic tradeoff.

  Watson  uses 10,000's of watts, the computer between the ears uses 20. With only 200 million pages and 2TB of data, Watson is BigInsights, not BigData. 
 That Google is pretty big:  1 billion unique monthly visitors  
  tweetimages : We peaked at 22m avatars yesterday. Bandwidth peaked at 9GB of @twitter avatars in a single hour. 
  Foursquare Surpasses 10 Million Users   
  Reddit Hits 1.2B Monthly Pageviews, More Than Doubles Its Engineering Staff  
  Twitter : 185 million tweets are posted daily;  1.6 billion search queries daily; indexing latency is less than 10 seconds.

 Quotable Quotes:                        
 
  @hackofalltrades : When positive change is only viewed through its scalability, bad things happen. 
  @faizanj : Is it time for #Netflix to move to a hybrid cloud architecture similar to Zynga zCloud? 
  @adrianco : we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy lifting 
  @qui_oui : "scalability": a word that makes me think of how likely you are to have the ability to grow scales. 
  @Ninad_M : The question is, is #antifragile conceptually opposite of #bigdata 
  @pbailis : Batch your disk/network IO, kernel interrupts, customer package shipments -> delay arrival but increase efficiency 
  @Carnage4Life : One lesson that is hard for people to learn. Knowing that something occurred is different from knowing why it occurred

<p>Introduction: CloudCamp   is an interesting unconference where early adapters of Cloud Computing technologies exchange ideas. With the rapid change occurring in the industry, we need a place we can meet to share our experiences, challenges and solutions. At CloudCamp, you are encouraged you to share your thoughts in several open discussions, as we strive for the advancement of Cloud Computing. End users, IT professionals and vendors are all encouraged to participate.      CloudCamp Silicon Valley 08   is scheduled for Tuesday, September 30, 2008 from 06:00 PM - 10:00 PM in Sun Microsystems' EBC Briefing Center   15 Network Circle   Menlo Park, CA 94025     CloudCamp follows an interactive, unscripted unconference format. You can propose your own session or you can attend a session proposed by someone else. Either way, you are encouraged to engage in the discussion and “Vote with your feet”, which means … “find another session if you don’t find the session helpful”.

<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously how Netflix used  Chaos Monkey , a tool to test failover handling by continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this approach in this very interesting post:  The Netflix Simian Army .
 
I know what you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down lately.  Dmuino addressed  this potential embarrassment, putting all fears of cloud inferiority to rest:
  

Unfortunately we're not running 100% on the cloud today. We're working on it, and we could use more help.

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.   
 
As I was writing  an article  on the architecture of the  Storm Botnet , I couldn't help but notice the deep similarity of how Storm works and changes we're seeing in the evolution of political systems. In particular, the rise of the  virtual-state . As crazy as this may sound, I think this is also the direction applications will need follow to survive in a complex world of billions of compute devices.
 
You may have already heard of  virtual corporations .  Virtual corporations are companies with limited office space, a distributed workforce, and production facilities located wherever it is profitable to locate them. The idea is to stay lean and compete using the  rapid development and introduction of new products into high value-added markets .

<p>Introduction: Partitioning is what differentiates scaling-out from scaling-up, isn't it? I
thought so too until I readPat Helland's blog post on Hyder, a research
database at Microsoft, in whichthe database is the log, no partitioning is
required, and the database is multi-versioned. Not much is available on Hyder.
There's the excellent summary post from Mr. Helland and these documents:
Scaling Out without Partitioning andScaling Out without Partitioning  \- Hyder
Update by Phil Bernstein and Colin Reid of Microsoft.The idea behind Hyder as
summarized by Pat Helland (see his blog for the full post):Hyder is a software
stack for transactional record management. It can offer full database
functionality and is designed to take advantage of flash in a novel way. Most
approaches to scale-out use partitioning and spread the data across multiple
machines leaving the application responsible for consistency. In Hyder, the
database is the log, no partitioning is required, and the database is multi-
versioned.</p><p>3 0.13485931 <a title="1158-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-eBay_Architecture.html">331 high scalability-2008-05-27-eBay Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:EBay's Randy Shoup spills the secrets of how to service hundreds of
millions of users and over two billion page views a day in ScalabilityBest
Practices: Lessons from eBayon InfoQ. The practices: Partition by Function,
Split Horizontally, Avoid Distributed Transactions, Decouple Functions
Asynchronously, Move Processing To Asynchronous Flows, Virtualize At All
Levels, Cache Appropriately.Update:eBay Serves 5 Billion API Calls Each Month.
Aren't we seeing more and more traffic driven by mashups composed on top of
open APIs? APIs are no longer a bolt on, they are your application.
Architecturally that argues for implementing your own application around the
same APIs developers and users employ.Who hasn't wondered how eBay does their
business? As one of the largest most loaded websites in the world, it can't be
easy. And the subtitle of the presentation hints at how creating such a
monster system requires true engineering: Striking a balance between site

<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>5 0.123273 <a title="1158-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

vision of a future. Not everyone agrees, but I guess we'll see..."But it is
not complicated. [There's] just a lot of it." \--Richard Feynmanon how the

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>2 0.93958509 <a title="1158-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_17%2C_2012.html">1195 high scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 17, 2012</a></p>

fixed it.Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their

at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I
thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with
Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:3.5 billion pages in the search
index.Over several thousand servers.35 million searches a day.Several data
centers around Russia.Two-layer architecture.The database is split in pieces
and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database

<p>Introduction: In It's Time for Low Latency  Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's
time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency
datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for
programarchitectures will be revolutionary.  Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished
Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer
resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are
interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter
into single computer. Abstract from the paper:The operating systems community
has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays
in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs
round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will
be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation
delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it
will be up to us to ﬁnish the job and see</p><p>5 0.92580557 <a title="1158-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-13-Google_Reveals_New_MapReduce_Stats.html">211 high scalability-2008-01-13-Google Reveals New MapReduce Stats</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Google Operating System blog has aninteresting poston Google's scale based
on an updated version of Google's paper about MapReduce.The input data for
some of the MapReduce jobs run in September 2007 was 403,152 TB (terabytes),
the average number of machines allocated for a MapReduce job was 394, while
the average completion time was 6 minutes and a half. The paper mentions that
Google's indexing system processes more than 20 TB of raw data.breakNiall
Kennedy calculates that the average MapReduce job runs across a $1 million
hardware infrastructure, assuming that Google still uses the same cluster
configurations from 2004: two 2 GHz Intel Xeon processors with Hyper-Threading
enabled, 4 GB of memory, two 160 GB IDE hard drives and a gigabit Ethernet
link.Greg Linden notices that Google's infrastructure is an important
competitive advantage. "Anyone at Google can process terabytes of data. And
they can get their results back in about 10 minutes, so they can iterate on it

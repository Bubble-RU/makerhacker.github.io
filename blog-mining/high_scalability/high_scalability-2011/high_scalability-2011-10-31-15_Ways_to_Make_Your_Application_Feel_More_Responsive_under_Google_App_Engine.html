<p>Introduction: In the post Using memcache might be free, but it's costing you money with
instance pricing! Use instance caches if possible made on the Google App
Engine group, Santiago Lema brings up an oldie but a goody of an idea that was
once used to improve performance, but now it's used to save money:Santiago's
GAE application went from about $9 to about $177 per month. Memcache is slow
enough that under higher loads extra instances are created by the scheduler to
handle the load.For static or semi-static data, a way around the cost of the
extra instances, is to keep a cache in the instance so requests can be served
out of local memory rather than going to memcache or the database. A simple
hashtable makes a good in-memory cache.This solution made his app affordable
again by reducing the number of instances back to 1 (sometimes 2).Where have
we seen this before?This is a variant of the old Sticky Session idea where web
sessions are stored in RAM in an application server and all further

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the

<p>Introduction: With theGoogle IO Developer Conferencecompleted there aredozens and dozensof
information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty
free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos
available so quickly after the conference. Let's say you don't want to watch
all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen
scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:App
Engine Backends by Justin Haugh, Greg Darke. One of this biggest complaints
about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new
Backend node.Scaling App Engine Applicationsby Justin Haugh, Guido van Rossum.
Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make
it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000
queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good
discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides when to spawn
instances;</p><p>3 0.71696973 <a title="1135-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-18-Numbers_Everyone_Should_Know.html">514 high scalability-2009-02-18-Numbers Everyone Should Know</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good
SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and
make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was
written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in A day in the life of a slow page
at Stack Overflow, where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was
possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for
other pages the improvement was 100x.Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of
his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the
tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:Using theirmini-
profiler it was shown that abadge detail pagewas taking 630.3 ms to load,
298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL

<p>Introduction: Update 3: ReadWriteWeb saysGoogle App Engine Announces New Pricing Plans,
APIs, Open Access. Pricing is specified but I'm not sure what to make of it
yet. An image manipulation library is added (thus the need to pay for more CPU
:-) and memcached support has been added. Memcached will help resolve the
can't write for every read problem that pops up when keeping counters.Update
2: onGWT.com threw a GAE load party and a lot of people came. The results
atLoad test : Google App Engine = 1, Community = 0. GAE handled a peak of 35
requests/second and a sustained 10 requests/second. Some think performance was
good, others not so good. My GMT watch broke and I was late to arrive. Maybe
next time. Also added a few new design rules from the post.Update: Added a few
new rules gleaned from theGAE Meetup: Design By Explicit Cost Model and Puts
are Precious.How do you structure your database using a distributed hash table

<p>Introduction: Small Imrovements, makers of a hosted, lightweight feedback platform, have
written an excellent article on Performance issues on GAE, and how we resolved
them. They show how they trimmed most of their requests to between 300ms and
800ms, some still take 2 seconds when memcache is stale, and others clock in
at 150ms. Notzippy overall, but acceptable, especially if you really like
GAE's PaaS promise.What's tricky with PaaS is if your performance is poor,
there's often not a lot you can do about it. But the folks at Small
Improvements have been clever and diligent, giving many specific details and
timings. Though their advice is specifically for GAE, it will apply to a lot
of different situations as well.Here are the 15 ways they made small
performance improvements: Understand App Engine has bad days. App Engine can
have bad days where performance can degrade. Your design needs to take this
potential for high latency variability into account. Don't always assume the
best case.Always prefe</p><p>2 0.93662745 <a title="1135-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-08-Lessons_from_Pownce_-_The_Early_Years.html">116 high scalability-2007-10-08-Lessons from Pownce - The Early Years</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pownce is a new social messaging application competing micromessage to
micromessage with the likes of Twitter and Jaiku. Still in closed beta, Pownce
has generously shared some of what they've learned so far. Like going to a
barrel tasting of a young wine and then tasting the same wine after some
aging, I think what will be really interesting is to follow Pownce and compare
the Pownce of today with the Pownce of tomorrow, after a few years spent in
the barrel. What lessons lie in wait for Pownce as they grow?Site:

<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a newSocial Inbox
integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-
all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store
all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer
inThe Underlying Technology of Messages:HBase. HBase beat out MySQL,
Cassandra, and a few others.Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it
was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's
eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time
Messages product. Facebook also has an extensiveMySQL infrastructure, but they
found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could
have built their own, but they chose HBase.HBase is ascaleout table store
supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data.
Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system. HBase is also a column based

<p>Introduction: A user named Apathyon how Reddit scales some of their features, shares some
advice he learned while working at Google and other major companies.To be
fair, I [Apathy] was working at Google at the time, and every job I held
between 1995 and 2005 involved at least one of the largest websites on the
planet. I didn't come up with any of these ideas, just watched other smart
people I worked with who knew what they were doing and found (or wrote) tools
that did the same things. But the theme is always the same:Cache everything
you can and store the rest in some sort of database (not necessarily
relational and not necessarily centralized).Cache everything that doesn't
change rapidly. Most of the time you don't have to hit the database for
anything other than checking whether the users' new message count has
transitioned from 0 to (1 or more).Cache everything--templates, user message
status, the front page components--and hit the database once a minute or so to
update the front page, forums, e</p><p>5 0.92607409 <a title="1135-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-19-Product%3A_Redis_-_Not_Just_Another_Key-Value_Store.html">545 high scalability-2009-03-19-Product: Redis - Not Just Another Key-Value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the introduction ofRedisyour options in the key-value space just grew and
your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about
it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.Redis (REmote DIctionary Server)
-a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not
volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists
and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.The key points are: open
source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs,
per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in
memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.The
home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-
post-longer. For a good overview of Redis take a look at Antonio Cangiano's
article:Introducing Redis: a fast key-value database.If you are looking at a
way to understand how Redis is different than something like Tokyo

<p>Introduction: The world has changed. And some things that should not have been forgotten,
were lost. I found these words from the Lord of the Rings echoing in my head
as I listened to a fascinating presentation by Luiz Andre Barroso,
Distinguished Engineer at Google, concerning Google's legendary past, golden
present, and apocryphal future. His talk, Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering
the Teenage Decade, was given at theFederated Computing Research Conference.
Luiz clearly knows his stuff and was early at Google, so he has a deep and
penetrating perspective on the technology. There's much to learn from, think
about, and build.Lord of the Rings applies at two levels. At the change level,
Middle Earth went throughthree ages. While listening to Luiz talk, it seems so
has Google: Batch (indexes calculated every month), Warehouse (the datacenter
is the computer), and Instant (make it all real-time). At the "what was
forgot" level, in the Instant Age section of the talk,  a common theme was the

<p>Introduction: Likewise the current belief that, in the case of artificial machines the very

Thus, for example, a small obelisk or column or other solid figure can
certainly be laid down or set up without danger of breaking, while the large
ones will go to pieces under the slightest provocation, and that purely on

they were naively scaled up. Interestingly, Google noticed a similar pattern
when building larger software systems using the same techniques used to build
smaller systems. Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished Engineer at Google, talks
about this fundamental property of scaling systems in his fascinating talk,

info from Steve Souder,Greg Linden, andMarissa Mayer. Speed [is] an
undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web.Update 7:How do you know when
you need more memcache servers?. Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache
not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed

<p>Introduction: Update:Streamy Explains CAP and HBase's Approach to CAP.We plan to employ
inter-cluster replication, with each cluster located in a single DC. Remote
replication will introduce some eventual consistency into the system, but each
cluster will continue to be strongly consistent.Ryan Barrett, Google App
Engine datastore lead, gave this talkTransactions Across Datacenters (and
Other Weekend Projects)at the Google I/O 2009 conference.While the talk
doesn't necessarily break new technical ground, Ryan does an excellent job
explaining and evaluating the different options you have when architecting a
system to work across multiple datacenters. This is calledmultihoming,
operating from multiple datacenters simultaneously.As multihoming is one of
the most challenging tasks in all computing, Ryan's clear and thoughtful style
comfortably leads you through the various options. On the trip you learn:The
differentmulti-homing optionsare: Backups, Master-Slave, Multi-Master, 2PC,
and Paxos.

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg gave a talk on Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion-
Pitfalls and Lessons andone of the issuesthey had was that they:Did not
account for increased latency after moving to EC2. In the datacenter they had
submillisecond access between machines so it was possible to make a 1000 calls
to memache for one page load. Not so on EC2. Memcache access times increased
10x to a millisecond which made their old approach unusable. Fix was to batch
calls to memcache so a large number of gets are in one request.Dave Pacheco
had aninteresting questionabout batching requests and its impact on latency:I
was confused about the memcached problem after moving to the cloud. I
understand why network latency may have gone from submillisecond to
milliseconds, but how could you improve latency by batching requests?
Shouldn't that improve efficiency, not latency, at the possible expense of
latency (since some requests will wait on the client as they get batched)?
Jeremy cleared it up by saying:</p><p>5 0.68126267 <a title="1116-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Think_of_Latency_as_a_Pseudo-permanent_Network_Partition.html">879 high scalability-2010-08-12-Think of Latency as a Pseudo-permanent Network Partition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of this post is a quote from Ilya Grigorik's post Weak Consistency
and CAP Implications. Besides the article being excellent, I thought this idea
had something to add to the great NoSQL versus RDBMS debate, whereMike
Stonebraker makes the argument that network partitions are rare so designing
eventually consistent systems for such rare occurrence is not worth losing
ACID semantics over. Even if network partitions are rare, latency between
datacenters is not rare, so the game is still on.The rare-partition argument
seems to flow from a centralized-distributed view of systems. Such systems are
scale-out in that they grow by adding distributed nodes, but the nodes
generally do not cross datacenter boundaries. The assumption is the network is
fast enough that distributed operations are roughly homogenous between
nodes.In a fully-distributed system the nodes can be dispersed across
datacenters, which gives operations a widely variable performance profile.

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.8834818 <a title="1116-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-15-Paper%3A_It%27s_Time_for_Low_Latency_-_Inventing_the_1_Microsecond_Datacenter.html">1116 high scalability-2011-09-15-Paper: It's Time for Low Latency - Inventing the 1 Microsecond Datacenter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In It's Time for Low Latency  Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's
time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency
datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for
programarchitectures will be revolutionary.  Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished
Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer
resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are
interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter
into single computer. Abstract from the paper:The operating systems community
has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays
in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs
round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will
be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation
delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it
will be up to us to ﬁnish the job and see</p><p>3 0.86989367 <a title="1116-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-17-Steve_Ballmer_Says_Microsoft_has_Over_1_Million_Servers_-_What_Does_that_Really_Mean%3F.html">1493 high scalability-2013-07-17-Steve Ballmer Says Microsoft has Over 1 Million Servers - What Does that Really Mean?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:Anatomy of a crash in a new part of Yandex written in Django. Writing
to a magic session variable caused an unexpected write into an InnoDB database
on every request. Writes took 6-7 seconds because of index rebuilding. Lots of
useful details on the sizing of their system, what went wrong, and how they
fixed it.Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their
search index. We only know a few fun facts about how they do things, nothing
at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I
thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with
Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:3.5 billion pages in the search
index.Over several thousand servers.35 million searches a day.Several data
centers around Russia.Two-layer architecture.The database is split in pieces
and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database
servers and brings it together for the user.Languages used: c++, perl, some

<p>Introduction: With the success ofNeo4jas a graph database in the NoSQL revolution, it's
interesting to see another graph database,HyperGraphDB, in the mix. Their
quick blurb on HyperGraphDB says it is a:general purpose, extensible,
portable, distributed, embeddable, open-source data storage mechanism. It is a
graph database designed specifically for artificial intelligence and semantic
web projects, it can also be used as an embedded object-oriented database for
projects of all sizes.From theNoSQL Archivethe summary on HyperGraphDB is:
API:Java(and Java Langs), Written in:Java,  Query Method:Javaor P2P,
Replication:P2P, Concurrency:STM, Misc: Open-Source, Especially for AI and
Semantic Web.So it has some interesting features, like software transactional
memory andP2P  for data distribution, but I found that my first and most
obvious question was not answered: what the heck is ahypergraphand why do I
care? Buried in the tutorial was:A HyperGraphDB database is a generalized
graph of entities. The gene</p><p>6 0.82622403 <a title="1116-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_17%2C_2012.html">1195 high scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 17, 2012</a></p>

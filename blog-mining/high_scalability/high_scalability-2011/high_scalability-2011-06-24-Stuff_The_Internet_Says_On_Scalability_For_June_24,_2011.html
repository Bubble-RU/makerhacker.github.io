<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>3 0.15654013 <a title="1067-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_29%2C_2011.html">1089 high scalability-2011-07-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 29, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at
giving a wide range o</p><p>5 0.13526575 <a title="1067-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

Paul Yang describes the greatest westward expansion since the land bridge

over populated datacenter to the wide open spaces of a new continent. Unlike
the early settlers, Facebook did not move the boxes over, that would disrupt

<p>Introduction: Jumping around the social mediasphere, it's not uncommon to feel the heat
generated in praise of a favorite this or that over all the clearly inferior
alternatives. Whilst human nature may never cool, I think Old Will had some
insight worth considering the next time a flame threatens to flicker forth:My
mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130)My mistress' eyes are
nothing like the sun;Coral is far more red than her lips' red ;If snow be
white, why then her breasts are dun;If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her
head.I have seen roses damask, red and white,But no such roses see I in her
cheeks;And in some perfumes is there more delightThan in the breath that from
my mistress reeks.I love to hear her speak, yet well I knowThat music hath a
far more pleasing sound;I grant I never saw a goddess go;My mistress, when she
walks, treads on the ground:And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rareAs any
she belied with false compare.-William Shakespeare</p><p>2 0.93141645 <a title="1067-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-20-VMware_to_bridge_a_DMZ.__.html">686 high scalability-2009-08-20-VMware to bridge a DMZ.  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey guys,There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy
vmware...everywhere.I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when
it comes to resources.What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of
using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.Today we get lots
of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well. 40x HP blades,
apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's. (20
servers in 2 datacentres).The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including
the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our
internal networks. This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have
ever lived by while working on the inet. No airgaps from the unknown to the
known!I am interested in feedback on this scenario.From a resource
perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time
due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.Do
you think this is change for ch</p><p>3 0.92801309 <a title="1067-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_31%2C_2012.html">1315 high scalability-2012-08-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 31, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Michael Stonebraker sure knows how to stir up a storm. Unlike for others, that
doesn't make him a troll in my mind, he'sway too accomplishedin the field to
be that, but he does have a bit of Barnum & Bailey in him, which serves to get
the discussion flowing, and that's a good thing. A lot of previously hidden
wisdom and passion unlocks, which we'll try to capture here.This disturbance
in the force is over OldSQL vs NoSQL vsNewSQL. Warning, these are not crisp
categories, there's leakage all over the place, watch your step:OldSQL
(Oracle, MySQL, etc) refers to what some want to term as legacy relational
database like MySQL, that don't scale out horizontally with aplomb.NoSQL
(CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, Riak, Neo4j, etc) refers to, well,
a collection of technologies that aren't OldSQL, these often are designed to
scale out horizontally, aren't on ACID, and use schemaless non-relational
datamodels.NewSQL  (Xeround, Clustrix, NimbusDB, GenieDB, ScaleBase, VoltDB)
are databa</p><p>3 0.13123015 <a title="1025-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-23-Product%3A_dbShards_-_Share_Nothing._Shard_Everything..html">847 high scalability-2010-06-23-Product: dbShards - Share Nothing. Shard Everything.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I met the CodeFutures folks, makers ofdbShards, atGluecon. They occupy an
interesting niche in the database space, somewhere betweenNoSQL, which
jettisons everything SQL, and high end analytics platformsthat completely
rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.High concept: I think of
dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from HSCALE
(partitioning) +MySQL Proxy (transparent intermediate layer) +Memcached
(client side sharding) +Gigaspaces(parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).You
may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out
writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would
prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about
dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult
questions (not really).Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was
dbShards created to solve?I'm Cory Isaacson, CEO/CTO of CodeFutures

<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey, founder ofNuoDB, in thisthread on the Cloud Computing group,
delivers a masterful post on why he thinks the relational model is the best
overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself
from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave
new lock free world....I'll[Jim Starkey]go into more detail later in the post
for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency
is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human
facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips
between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads
inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage
this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together
related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make
sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the server and
using i</p><p>5 0.11788496 <a title="1025-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.11510958 <a title="1025-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-13-DbShards_Part_Deux_-_The_Internals.html">857 high scalability-2010-07-13-DbShards Part Deux - The Internals</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Morgan Tocker has an awesome article and comment thread in theMySQL
Performance BlogaboutWhen should you store serialized objects in the
database?Before the NoSQL age is was very common to simulate schemalessness by
storing blobs in MySQL. Sharding was implemented by running multiple MySQL
instances and spreading writes across them. While not ideal for the purpose,
developers felt comfortable with MySQL. They knew how to install it, back it
up, replicate it, in short:  they knew how to make it work. Yet they also
needed to store objects without the penalty of joins. Searches and aggregate
queries were handled by indexes kept in separate tables, this offloaded the
fast path to objects.This all made perfect sense. Usually we just want stuff
to work and going with what you know is often the best path to that goal. And
what we have known is MySQL. All the different pros and cons of this approach
are covered wonderfully in the post.But the world has changed. With the same
goals in mind I do</p><p>3 0.7980336 <a title="1025-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL%3A_An_Overview_of_the_Various_Query_Semantics_in_the_Post_Only-SQL_World.html">867 high scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL: An Overview of the Various Query Semantics in the Post Only-SQL World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of many of the
scalability issues that we face today with traditional database approach.I
think that the main reason so many people have come to see SQL as the source
of all evil is the fact that, traditionally, the query language was burned
into the database implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to
the traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.This view has brought on a
flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a different aspect
that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach, such as a document
model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as Key/Value query.Most of
the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject, and tend to use
query semantics and architecture interchangeably. InPart Iof this post i tried
to provide quick overview of what each query term stands for in the context of
the NoSQL world .Part II illustrates those ideas using  code examples from</p><p>4 0.78489292 <a title="1025-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-23-Building_a_Scalable_Key-Value_Database%3A_Project_Hydracus.html">885 high scalability-2010-08-23-Building a Scalable Key-Value Database: Project Hydracus</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The world of NoSQL and alternative database implementations (i.e. non-
relational) is deeply fascinating to me. I can't help but be swept up in the
whirl of planet-scale web development scalability techniques and the evolution
of how developers think about building their applications knowing that with
success comes the inevitable need to scale to levels almost unimaginable just
five or ten years ago.I'm going to make a prediction: Developers will be
expected to understand the fundamentals of how different database systems can
be applied within a singular application; their strengths and weaknesses, and
when it is appropriate to leverage them.There's a lot out there about scaling
relational databases. Partitioning your data over application-managed shards
is a topic that has seen its fair share of attention. But I think there's a
whole slew over NoSQL databases that have been built and designed by some very
smart people that are new enough that their internals aren't well understood

<p>Introduction: The last six months have been exciting for Digg's engineering team. We're
working on a soup-to-nuts rewrite. Not only are we rewriting all our
application code, but we're also rolling out a new client and server
architecture. And if that doesn't sound like a big enough challenge, we're
replacing most of our infrastructure components and moving away from
LAMP.Perhaps our most significant infrastructure change is abandoning MySQL in
favor of a NoSQL alternative. To someone like me who's been building systems
almost exclusively on relational databases for almost 20 years, this feels
like a bold move.What's Wrong with MySQL?Our primary motivation for moving
away from MySQL is the increasing difficulty of building a high performance,
write intensive, application on a data set that is growing quickly, with no
end in sight. This growth has forced us into horizontal and vertical
partitioning strategies that have eliminated most of the value of a relational
database, while still incurring all t</p><p>6 0.77512592 <a title="1025-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-It_Must_be_Crap_on_Relational_Dabases_Week_.html">648 high scalability-2009-07-02-It Must be Crap on Relational Dabases Week </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Inspired by axkcd comic,Peter Norvig,Director of Research at Google and all
around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving
a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful
systems profiled on HighScalability.The original code is atxkcd 1313: Regex
Golf, which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the
winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is
readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but
soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find
regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's
deliberate strategy for finding a regex.The post demonstrating the iterated
improvement of the program is atxkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite
Problems). As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the
program Peter recommends the following steps: Profiling: Figure out where the
program spends its time. Speed</p><p>2 0.96171069 <a title="1025-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed_content_system_with_bandwidth_balancing.html">605 high scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed content system with bandwidth balancing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>3 0.95421231 <a title="1025-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-07-Six_Lessons_Learned_Deploying_a_Large-scale_Infrastructure_in_Amazon_EC2_.html">559 high scalability-2009-04-07-Six Lessons Learned Deploying a Large-scale Infrastructure in Amazon EC2 </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread
pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is
tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal
variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user
id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the
code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to
pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought isclass ReferenceIdGenerator
{public static setReferenceId(String login) {threadLocal.set(login +
System.currentMillis());}public static String getReferenceId() {return
threadLocal.get();}private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =new
ThreadLocal();}class MySevlet {void service(.....) {HttpSession session =
request.getSession(false);String userId =
session.get("userId");ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId);try
{doSomething();}finally {ReferenceIdGenerator.remove();}}This method is also</p><p>5 0.94690073 <a title="1025-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-15-Sun_Customer_Ready_HPC_Cluster%3A_Reference_Configurations_with_Sun_Fire_X2200_M2_and_X2100_M2_Servers.html">418 high scalability-2008-10-15-Sun Customer Ready HPC Cluster: Reference Configurations with Sun Fire X2200 M2 and X2100 M2 Servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

Personal Cloud Using BitTorrent Sync, Owncloud, and Raspberry Pi. BitTorrent
Sync is used to copy large files around. Raspberry Pi is a cheap low power

cloud that provides a web interface for file access files from anywhere.This

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this beautiful morning:  Group Decision
Making in Honey Bee Swarms. In distributed computing systems nodes reach
aquorum when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum
logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:
A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act
and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow
the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether
they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating
the swarm's move to this site.Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.
Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being
a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.Fire! Fire!
Brent Chapman shows how to put that IT fire out in Incident Command for IT:

<p>Introduction: From their website:Condoris a specialized workload management system for
compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor
provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme,
resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial or
parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and
where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress,
and ultimately informs the user upon completion.While providing functionality
similar to that of a more traditional batch queueing system, Condor's novel
architecture allows it to succeed in areas where traditional scheduling
systems fail. Condor can be used to manage a cluster of dedicated compute
nodes (such as a "Beowulf" cluster). In addition, unique mechanisms enable
Condor to effectively harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop
workstations. For instance, Condor can be configured to only use desktop
machines where the keyboard and mo</p><p>4 0.80474669 <a title="1045-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-16-Reducing_Your_Website%27s_Bandwidth_Usage_-_how_to.html">494 high scalability-2009-01-16-Reducing Your Website's Bandwidth Usage - how to</a></p>

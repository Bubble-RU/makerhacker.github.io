<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the Stack Overflow Architecture.
Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack
Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up
and out in the last few years.Stack Overflow has grown up by more then
doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page
views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  Stack Overflow has
grown out by expanding into theStack Exchange Network, which includes Stack
Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different
sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.What hasn't changed is
Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted
this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been
handling their growth: Stack Exchange's Architecture in Bullet Points, Stack
Overflow's New York Data Center, Designing For Scalability of Management and
Fault Tolera</p><p>5 0.16538271 <a title="1032-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-10-24-StackExchange_Architecture_Updates_-_Running_Smoothly%2C_Amazon_4x_More_Expensive.html">1131 high scalability-2011-10-24-StackExchange Architecture Updates - Running Smoothly, Amazon 4x More Expensive</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've had a few articles on theStackOverlflow Architecture and Stack Overflow
Architecture Update - Now at 95 Million Page Views a Month. Time for another
update. This time from a podcast. Every week or so Jeff, Joel and guests sit
around and converse. The result is a podcast. In a recent podcast they talked
about some of their recent architecture issues, problems, and updates. And
since I wrote this article before my vacation, they've also published a new
architecture update article:The Stack Exchange Architecture - 2011 Edition,
Episode 1.My overall impression is they are in a comfortable place, adding new
sites, adding new features, making a house a home.Notable for their scale-up
architecture, you might expect with their growth that they would slam into a
wall. Not so. They've been able to scale-up the power of individual servers by
adding more CPU and RAM. SSD has been added in some cases. Even their flagship
StackOverflow product runs on a single server.

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation
from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?
Mike Stonebraker, the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world,
hopes you get something like his new database,VoltDB: a pure SQL, pure ACID,
pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory
DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a
second. VoltDBclaims to be100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster
thanCassandra, and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.Will
VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of
ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product
with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component
in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...I first heard the
details about VoltDB at Gluecon, where Mr. Stonebraker presented his highly

<p>Introduction: I recently came across a TPC-C benchmark results held on MySQL based RDS
databases. You can see ithere. I think the results may bring light to many
questions concerning MySQL scalability in general and RDS scalability in
particular. (For disclosure, I'm working forScaleBasewhere we run an internal
scale out TPC-C benchmark these days, and will publish results soon).TPC-
CTPC-C is a standard database benchmark, used to measure databases. The
database vendors invest big bucks in running this test, and showing off which
database is faster, and can scale better.It is a write intensive test, so it
doesn't necessarily reflect the behavior of the database in your application.
But it does give some very important insights on what you can expect from your
database under heavy load.The Benchmark ProcessFirst of all, I have some
comments for the benchmark method itself.Generally - the benchmarks were held
in an orderly fashion and in a rather methodological way - which increases the

<p>Introduction: Small Imrovements, makers of a hosted, lightweight feedback platform, have
written an excellent article on Performance issues on GAE, and how we resolved
them. They show how they trimmed most of their requests to between 300ms and
800ms, some still take 2 seconds when memcache is stale, and others clock in
at 150ms. Notzippy overall, but acceptable, especially if you really like
GAE's PaaS promise.What's tricky with PaaS is if your performance is poor,
there's often not a lot you can do about it. But the folks at Small
Improvements have been clever and diligent, giving many specific details and
timings. Though their advice is specifically for GAE, it will apply to a lot
of different situations as well.Here are the 15 ways they made small
performance improvements: Understand App Engine has bad days. App Engine can
have bad days where performance can degrade. Your design needs to take this
potential for high latency variability into account. Don't always assume the
best case.Always prefe</p><p>5 0.70674425 <a title="1032-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-16-The_Mother_of_All_Database_Normalization_Debates_on_Coding_Horror.html">351 high scalability-2008-07-16-The Mother of All Database Normalization Debates on Coding Horror</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Atwood started a barn burner of a conversation inMaybe Normalizing Isn't
Normalon how to create a fast scalable tagging system. Jeff eventually asks
that terrible question:which is better -- a normalized database, or a
denormalized database?And all hell breaks loose. I know, it's hard to imagine
database debates becoming contentious, but it does happen :-) It's lucky
developers don't have temporal power or rivers of blood would flow.Here are a
few of the pithier points (summarized):breakNormalization is not magical fairy
dust you sprinkle over your database to cure all ills; it often creates as
many problems as it solves. (Jeff)Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until
it works. (Jeff)Use materialized views which are tables created and maintained
by your RDBMS. So a materialized view will act exactly like a de-normalized
table would - except you keep you original normalized structure and any change
to original data will propagate to the view automatically. (Goran)According to

Distributed Computing Concepts, Sensor Networks, Overlays and DHTs, Cloud
Programming, Cloud Scheduling, Key-Value Stores, Storage, Sensor Net Routing,
Geo-Distribution, P2P Apps, In-network processing, Epidemics, Probabilistic
Membership Protocols, Distributed Monitoring and  Management, Publish-

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across
data centers, then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so
there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What
isChironFSand how does it work?Adapted from the ChironFS website:The Chiron
Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of
failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using
replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not
FILESYSTEMS.Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it
is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other
server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many
servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become
a real nightmare!</p><p>4 0.96034455 <a title="1032-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:My
recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget
with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid
expiration headers) is employ areverse proxyas mentioned in this article.In
the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a
single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a
single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max
server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.It's trivial to implement for
anyone interested...</p><p>5 0.95903087 <a title="1032-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-03-100_Node_Hazelcast_cluster_on_Amazon_EC2.html">820 high scalability-2010-05-03-100 Node Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Deploying, running and monitoring application on a big cluster is a
challenging task. RecentlyHazelcastteam deployed a demo application on Amazon
EC2 platform to show how Hazelcast p2p cluster scales and screen recorded the
entire process from deployment to monitoring.Hazelcast is open source (Apache
License), transactional, distributed caching solution for Java. It is a little
more than a cache though as it provides distributed implementation of map,
multimap, queue, topic, lock and executor service. Details of running 100 node
Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2 can befound here. Make sure towatch the
screencast!</p><p>6 0.94346309 <a title="1032-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-27-Product%3A_Sequoia_Database_Clustering_Technology.html">102 high scalability-2007-09-27-Product: Sequoia Database Clustering Technology</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at
giving a wide range o</p><p>6 0.14424872 <a title="1137-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I found the discussion of the available bandwidth of tree vs higher
dimensional virtual networks topologies quite, to quote Spock,fascinating:A
mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developersof
Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that
theGnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,
theNapster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network
isseverely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a
millionpeers. In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have
overlooked theintrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the
Gnutella network:a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the
definition).Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher
dimensionaltopologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of
interconnectiontopologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware
implementations(see, e.g., Culler et al. 1996; Buyya 1999</p><p>2 0.91925114 <a title="1137-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-29-Paper%3A_Spamalytics%3A_An_Empirical_Analysisof_Spam_Marketing_Conversion.html">478 high scalability-2008-12-29-Paper: Spamalytics: An Empirical Analysisof Spam Marketing Conversion</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy thatthe best method to analyse spam is to become a
spammer, this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely
researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part
Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that
their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they
figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales
they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.Two different spam campaigns were
run on aStormbotnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-
peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide
computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit
new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to
download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the
executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon. The
downloaded compone</p><p>3 0.88814789 <a title="1137-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-23-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_23%2C_2011.html">1163 high scalability-2011-12-23-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 23, 2011</a></p>

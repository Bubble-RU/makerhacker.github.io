<p>Introduction: Web Analytics: An Hour A Day is the first book by an in-the-trenches
practitioner of web analytics. It provides a unique insider’s perspective of
the challenges and opportunities that web analytics presents to each person
who touches the Web in your organization. Rather than spamming you with
metrics and definitions, Web Analytics: An Hour A Day will enhance your
mindset and teach you how to fish for yourself.Avinash Kaushik is a expert in
web analytics and author of the top-rated blog Occam’s Razor
(http://www.kaushik.net/avinash). In this book, he goes beyond web analytics
concepts and definitions to provide a step-by-step guide to implementing a
successful web analytics strategy. His revolutionary approach to web analytics
challenges prevalent thinking about the field and guides readers to a solution
that will provide truly informed and actionable insights.</p><p>3 0.25601077 <a title="1081-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-15-Blog%3A_Occam%E2%80%99s_Razor_by_Avinash_Kaushik.html">9 high scalability-2007-07-15-Blog: Occam’s Razor by Avinash Kaushik</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Facebook did it again. They've built another system capable of doing something
useful with ginormous streams of realtime data. Last time we saw Facebook
release their New Real-Time Messaging System: HBase To Store 135+ Billion
Messages A Month. This time it's a realtime analytics system handlingover 20
billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30
seconds. Alex Himel, Engineering Manager at Facebook, explains what they've
built (video) and the scale required:Social plugins have become an important
and growing source of traffic for millions of websites over the past year. We
released a new version of Insights for Websites last week to give site owners
better analytics on how people interact with their content and to help them
optimize their websites in real time. To accomplish this, we had to engineer a
system that could process over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per
second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds. Alex does an excellent job with

<p>Introduction: This post about using Hive and Hadoop for analytics comes straight from
Facebook engineers.Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the
functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-
engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis and business intelligence applications
used by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook products are also
based on analytics.These products range from simple reporting applications
like Insights for the Facebook Ad Network, to more advanced kind such as
Facebook's Lexicon product.As a result a flexible infrastructure that caters
to the needs of these diverse applications and users and that also scales up
in a cost effective manner with the ever increasing amounts of data being
generated on Facebook, is critical. Hive and Hadoop are the technologies that
we have used to address these requirements at Facebook.Read the rest of the

<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great
presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: "High Performance at
Massive Scale -  Lessons learned at Facebook". The abstract for the talk
is:Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today
serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes
engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging
proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data
that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core
architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to
address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies
that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web
architectures.There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into
later, but I thought you might want a head start on learning how Facebook
handles 30K+ machines, 300 million</p><p>5 0.74249583 <a title="1081-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-14-Who_Has_the_Most_Web_Servers%3F.html">599 high scalability-2009-05-14-Who Has the Most Web Servers?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Recently, I was reading Todd Hoff's write-up on FaceBook real time analytics
system. As usual, Todd did an excellent job in summarizing this video from
Engineering Manager at Facebook Alex Himel.Inthe first post, I'd like to
summarize the case study, and consider some things that weren't mentioned in
the summaries. This will lead to an architecture for building your own
Realtime Time Analytics for Big-Data that might be easier to implement, using
Facebook's experience as a starting point and guide as well as the experience
gathered through a recent work with few of GigaSpaces customers. Thesecond
postprovide a summary of that new approach as well as a pattern and a demo for
building your own Real Time Analytics system..ReferencesReal Time analytics

<p>Introduction: From their website:SystemImageris software that makes the installation of
Linux to masses of similar machines relatively easy. It makes software
distribution, configuration, and operating system updates easy, and can also
be used for content distribution.SystemImager makes it easy to do automated
installs (clones), software distribution, content or data distribution,
configuration changes, and operating system updates to your network of Linux
machines. You can even update from one Linux release version to
another!breakIt can also be used to ensure safe production deployments. By
saving your current production image before updating to your new production
image, you have a highly reliable contingency mechanism. If the new production
enviroment is found to be flawed, simply roll-back to the last production
image with a simple update command!Some typical environments include: Internet

and corporate desktop envir</p><p>3 0.79308271 <a title="1081-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-24-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_February_24%2C_2010.html">783 high scalability-2010-02-24-Hot Scalability Links for February 24, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading
retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent
applications. Furthermore, over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are
more likely to make a purchase after "liking" a brand they find online.

they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex
relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:the architectural
considerations behind their solutionwhy they chose memory over diskhow they
partitioned the data to gain scalabilitywhy they chose to execute code with
the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution frameworkhow they integrated
with Facebookwhy they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-
memory caching and scaleIn this post I tried to summarize the main takeaway

<p>Introduction: I follow a certain philosophy when developing system architectures. I assume
that very few systems will ever exist in a consistent form for more than a
short period of time. What constitutes a “short period of time” differs
depending on the specifics of each system, but in an effort to quantify it, I
generally find that it falls somewhere between a week and a month.The driving
forces behind the need for an ever changing architecture are largely business
requirement based. This is a side effect of the reality that software
development, in most cases, is used as a supporting role within the business
unit it serves. As business requirements (i.e. additional features, new
products, etc.) pour forth, it is the developer’s job to evolve their software
system to accommodate these requirements and provide a software based solution
to whatever problems lay ahead.Given that many businesses can be identified as
having the above characteristics, I can now begin to explain why I believe

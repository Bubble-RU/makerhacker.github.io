</p><p>4 Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports. [sent-9, score-0.408]
</p><p>5 For smaller datacenters a stackable can work, this assumes that because you have a lower cost you would also have a lower SLA and can absorb a few outages. [sent-21, score-0.552]
</p><p>6 The EX has 5 meter cables that can run between the switches for a 128 Gbps bus between the switches, which is good for the money. [sent-23, score-0.341]
</p><p>7 This is a nice design that scales out well for a low cost data center. [sent-24, score-0.215]
</p><p>8 The best way to manage maintenance costs is to buy it up front. [sent-25, score-0.354]

</p><p>10 For every $1000 of equipment you buy over five years you would expect to pay the same in maintenance. [sent-28, score-0.332]
</p><p>11 By buying it all upfront in one lump sum you can get significant maintenance discounts. [sent-29, score-0.41]
</p><p>12 You are still going to have to buy a maintenance contract. [sent-31, score-0.354]
</p><p>13 When a model gets near its end-of-life you'll probably get a refurbished replacement from previously broken devices that had been returned and fixed. [sent-35, score-0.39]
</p><p>14 You'll assume more of the cost because you'll have to trouble shoot the problem to get a replacement. [sent-37, score-0.318]
</p><p>15 With support you could save that six hours of time letting support diagnose the problem. [sent-38, score-0.282]
</p><p>16 Best cost savings move you can make is to followPML or SDLC life cycle. [sent-45, score-0.312]
</p><p>17 Focus on the requirements instead of device features to save costs. [sent-49, score-0.259]
</p><p>18 A problem with using newer companies in what you gain in cost savings or with new features, you may lose on support. [sent-55, score-0.312]

efficient IPS/IDS solution which would not introduce much of latency. I'm more
familiar with Cisco ASA and also familiar with Juniper, Foundry and others. I
also came across snort but haven't used it before. I'm more of looking for an
appliance (for the ease of configuration,support etc...)Could any one share
their thoughts on performane of IPS/IDS from this vendors?Thanks!Janakan

<p>Introduction: Wired has awonderful interview with Clayton Christensen, author of the tech
ninja's bible, Innovator's Dilemma. Innovation is the name of the game in
Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this
article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained
with compelling examples by the man himself.Just as every empire has fallen,
every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become
comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of
mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the
disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.He also talks
about his new book,The Capitalist's Dilemma, which addresses this puzzle: if
corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?If someone can
help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a
fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here's a

<p>Introduction: Hi...I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am
building it! So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking,
architecture planning, everything. I haven't even gotten into the legal
aspects yet.......It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to
handle that end of the operation. I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at
Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best. I'd like to FIND that very best
person available, to handle the technical aspects. For worse or better, I
don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.I've posted a bazillion ads
on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses. I've put out feelers
among my own network, same result. Not sure what else I can do. Shoestring
budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning. That can actually be a plus, as
it forces people to focus.Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the
right person?ThanksJason</p><p>5 0.77824038 <a title="1027-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-16-What_if_Cars_Were_Rented_Like_We_Hire_Programmers%3F.html">1388 high scalability-2013-01-16-What if Cars Were Rented Like We Hire Programmers?</a></p>

hired at many software companies...Agency: So sorry you had to wait in the
reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally
found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you
may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our
manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so
I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?Applicant: I
drive a 2008 Subaru.Agency: That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent
you.Applicant: That's OK. Any car will do.Agency: No, we can only take on
clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way.
There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take
a chance.Applicant: I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been

<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers Show 41 episode was to reveal and
ruminate over the horrors of a successfulattack on RSA, which puts the whole
world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there
was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost
datacenter.Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile
back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by
summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal: Look at
Arista and Juniper. JuniperHas a range of stackable switches, which includes
some 10 gig.If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on
their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric
solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric.
Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.
Thinks Juniper would make a good deal in order to get a few reference sites

<p>Introduction: Teams fromPrincetonand CMU areworking togetherto solve one of the most
difficult problems in the repertoire: scalable geo-distributed data stores.
Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple
datacenter database functionality for some time, but there's still a general
lack of available systems that work for complex data scenarios.The ideas in
this paper--Don't Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-
Area Storage with COPS--are different. It's not another eventually consistent
system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based
system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally
consistent system that achievesALPSsystem properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL,
etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete
successfully), Low-latency (operations complete quickly (single digit
milliseconds)), Partition-tolerant (operates with a partition), and Scalable

<p>Introduction: I've been using GWT for an application and I get the same feeling using it
that I first got using html. I've always sucked at building UIs. Starting with
programming HP terminals, moving on to the Apple Lisa, then X Windows, and
Microsoft Windows, I just never had IT, whatever IT is. On the Beauty and the
Geek scale my interfaces are definitely horned-rimmed and pocket protector
friendly. Html helped free me from all that to just build stuff that worked,
but didn't have to look all that great. Expectations were pretty low and I
eagerly fulfilled them. With Ajax expectations have risen again and I find
myself once more easily identifiable as a styless geek. Using GWT I have some
hopes I can suck a little less.In working with GWT I was so focussed on its
tasty easily digestible Ajaxy goodness, I didn't stop to think about the topic
of this site: scalability. When I finally brought my distracted mind around to
consider the scalability of the single page webs site I was building, I became</p><p>5 0.86531889 <a title="1027-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-06-Building_a_Unique_Data_Warehouse.html">716 high scalability-2009-10-06-Building a Unique Data Warehouse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are many reasons to roll your own data storage solution on top of
existing technologies. We've seen stories on HighScalability about custom
databases for very large sets of individual data(like Twitter) and large
amounts of binary data (like Facebook pictures). However, I recently ran into
a unique type of problem. I was tasked with recording and storing bandwidth
information for more than 20,000 servers and their associated networking
equipment. This data needed to be accessed in real-time, with less than a 5
minute delay between the data being recorded and the datashowing up on
customer bandwidth graphs on our customer portal.After numerous false starts
with off the shelf components and existing database clustering technology, we
decided we must roll our own system. The real key to our problem (literally)
was the ratio of the size of the key to the size of the actual data. Because
the tracked metric was so small (a 64-bit counter) compared to the unique
identifier (32-bit netwo</p><p>6 0.86139202 <a title="1027-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-05-Strategy%3A_Planning_for_a_Power_Outage_Google_Style.html">789 high scalability-2010-03-05-Strategy: Planning for a Power Outage Google Style</a></p>

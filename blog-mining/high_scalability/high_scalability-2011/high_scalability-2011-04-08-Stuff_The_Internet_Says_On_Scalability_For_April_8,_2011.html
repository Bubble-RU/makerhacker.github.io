<p>Introduction: I remember the excitement of when Twitter first opened up their firehose.  As an early adopter of the Twitter API I could easily imagine some of the cool things you could do with all that data. I also remember the disappointment of learning that in the land of BigData, data has a price, and that price would be too high for little fish like me. It was like learning for the first time there would be no BigData Santa Clause.
 
For a while though I had the pleasure of pondering just how I would handle all that data. It's a fascinating problem. You have to be able to reliably consume it, normalize it, merge it with other data, apply functions on it, store it, query it, distribute it, and oh yah, monetize it. Most of that in realish-time. And if you are trying to create a platform for allowing the entire Internet do to the same thing to the firehose, the challenge is exponentially harder.
 
DataSift is in the exciting position of creating just such a firehose eating, data chomping machine.

<p>Introduction: OK, this  interview is with me  on Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there’s no blame on them :-)   The interview went an interesting direction, but there’s more I’d like add and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have popped out at me:
    Java – It’s the platform stupid .  Java the language isn’t the big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM, libraries, and toolsets.      Java – It’s the community stupid . A lot of creativity is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.  The fecundity of the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our multi-core future.

  Group Decision Making in Honey Bee Swarms . In distributed computing systems nodes reach a  quorum  when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:   A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating the swarm's move to this site.  Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.   Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.

 Quotable Quotes:                            
 
  @GammaCounter : "There are 400 billion trees in the Amazon River basin, close to the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy."  
  @rbranson : Virtualization has near-zero overhead, unless the VM spends most of it's time copying between RAM and network… like memcached or haproxy. 
  @HackerNewsOnion : Programming is 1% inspiration, 99% trying to get your environment working. 
  @aneel : "roundtrips, not bandwidth, is now often the bottleneck for most applications" 
  @jamesurquhart : Not to mention the fact that auto-scaling should happen above IaaS layer. Think multi-cloud. 
  Sheref Mansy : A machine keeps sort of chugging away, without worrying about its environment. But a living system has to.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jeff Su  from Factual. 
 
 
  What is Varnish?  
 Varnish  is an open source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for both static and dynamic content.
 
One great thing about Varnish is that it can improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.  If you haven’t heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven’t used it), please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive, but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish’s more advanced features, you’ll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.
 
Some of the high profile companies using Varnish include:  Twitter ,  Facebook ,  Heroku  and  LinkedIn .
  Our Use Case

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are hired at many software companies...   Agency  : So sorry you had to wait in the reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?  Applicant  : I drive a 2008 Subaru.  Agency  : That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent you.  Applicant  : That's OK. Any car will do.  Agency  : No, we can only take on clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way. There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take a chance.  Applicant  : I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.91198587 <a title="1019-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_8%2C_2011.html">1019 high scalability-2011-04-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 8, 2011</a></p>

 Now we really know why vampires feed on blood...they are elastically acquiring more compute power.  Your Next Computer May Be Made of...Blood!  It's those  memristors  again. Ancient vamps are really just giant super computers.

<p>Introduction: This is an email interview with   Viktor Klang   , Director of Engineering at    Typesafe   , on the    Scala Futures    model &    Akka,    both topics on which is he is immensely passionate and knowledgeable.  
 
How do you structure your application? That’s the question I explored in the article  Beyond Threads And Callbacks . An option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.
   To remedy my oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe’s Viktor Klang, long time Scala hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He’s a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about. 
   I’ve implemented several Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO, service orchestration, failover, etc, so I’m innately skeptical about frameworks that remove control from the programmer at</p><p>5 0.90430802 <a title="1019-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-12-Google%2B_is_Built_Using_Tools_You_Can_Use_Too%3A_Closure%2C_Java_Servlets%2C_JavaScript%2C_BigTable%2C_Colossus%2C_Quick_Turnaround.html">1078 high scalability-2011-07-12-Google+ is Built Using Tools You Can Use Too: Closure, Java Servlets, JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his picture), in  I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything , reveals the stack used for building Google+:
  Our stack is pretty standard fare for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily most people don't run</p><p>6 0.90047652 <a title="1019-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-18-The_Clever_Ways_Chrome_Hides_Latency_by_Anticipating_Your_Every_Need.html">1267 high scalability-2012-06-18-The Clever Ways Chrome Hides Latency by Anticipating Your Every Need</a></p>

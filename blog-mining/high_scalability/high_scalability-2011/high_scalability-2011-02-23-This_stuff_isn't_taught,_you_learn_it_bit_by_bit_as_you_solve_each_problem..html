<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>4 0.12499249 <a title="994-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-26-Scaling_DISQUS_to_75_Million_Comments_and_17%2C000_RPS.html">928 high scalability-2010-10-26-Scaling DISQUS to 75 Million Comments and 17,000 RPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thispresentation andvideoby Jason Yan and David Cramer discusses how they
scaled DISQUS, a comments as a service service for easily adding comments to
your site and connecting communities. The presentation is very good, so here
are just a few highlights: Traffic: 17,000 requests/second peak; 450,000
websites; 15 million profiles; 75 million comments; 250 million visitors; 40
million monthly users / developer.Forces: unpredictable traffic patterns
because of celebrity gossip and events like disasters; discussion never expire
which means they can't fit in memory; must always be up.Machines: 100 servers;
30% web servers (Appache + mod_wsgi); 10% databases (PostgreSQL); 25% cache
servers (memcached); 20% load balancing / high availability (HAProxy +
heartbeat); 15% Utility servers (Python scripts).Architecture: Requests are
load balanced across an Apache cluster. Apache talks to memcached,
HAProxy/pgbouncer to handle connection pooling to the database, and a central
queue service.

<p>Introduction: In Don't panic! Here's how to quickly scale your mobile apps Mike
Maelzerpaints a wonderful picture of howAvocado, a mobile app for connecting
couples, evolved to handle 30x traffic within a few weeks. If you are just
getting started then this is a great example to learn from.What I liked: it's
well written, packing a lot of useful information in a little space; it's
failure driven, showing the process of incremental change driven by purposeful
testing and production experience; it shows awareness of what's important, in
their case, user signup; a replica setup was used for testing, a nice cloud
benefit. Their Biggest lesson learned is a good one:It would have been great
to start the scaling process much earlier. Due to time pressure we had to make
compromises -like dropping four of our media resizer boxes. While throwing
more hardware at some scaling problems does work, it's less than ideal.Here's

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Zawodny, while performing data alchemy in the dungeons of Craigslist,
stored1,250,000,000 Key/Value Pairs in Redis on a 32GB Machine.Data sorting
world record: 1 terabyte, 1 minute. The system has 52 computer nodes, each
node is a commodity server with two quad-core processors, 24 gigabytes (GB)
memory and sixteen 500 GB disks. It's not just hardware though, they also
built a software that utilized all their CPU and RAM.Tweets of Gold:wm: I am

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg, the first paid employee at reddit, teaches us a lot about how
to create a successful social site in a really good talk he gave at the RAMP
conference. Watch it here at Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion-
Pitfalls and Lessons.Jeremy uses a virtue and sin approach. Examples of the
mistakes made in scaling reddit are shared and it turns out they did a lot of
good stuff too. Somewhat of a shocker is that Jeremy is now a Reliability
Architect at Netflix, so we get a little Netflix perspective thrown in for
free.Some of the lessons that stood out most for me: Think of SSDs as cheap
RAM, not expensive disk. When reddit moved from spinning disks to SSDs for the
database the number of servers was reduced from 12 to 1 with a ton of
headroom. SSDs are 4x more expensive but you get 16x the performance. Worth
the cost. Give users a little bit of power, see what they do with it, and turn
the good stuff into features. One of the biggest revelations for me was how

<p>Introduction: Unlike Theo Schlossnagle, author ofScalable Internet Architectures, I am not a
stickler for semantics because I have an unswerving faith in the ultimate
unknowability of the world as experienced by others. That's why it is Theo who
bravely tackles the differences in his informative blog postPartitioning vs.
Federation vs. Sharding. Royans Tharakan also talks about it on hisblog.Is
there a difference and does it really matter to all our intrepid scalable
website builders?breakGenerally whatever Theo says is probably close to the
truth. Yet, in my mind I think of partitioning as abasic level categoryand
federation and sharding as more specific (subordinate) instances of
partitioning. And partitioning is a more specific instance of the more more
general (superordinate) category divide-and-conquer. Which isn't a useful way
to think about the topic at all.So, let's say federation is like Star Trek.

<p>Introduction: This is a hilarious presentation byJosh Berkus, calledScale Fail, given at
O'Reilly MySQL CE 2011. Josh is entertaining, well spoken, and cleverly hides
insight inside chaos. And he makes some dang good points along the way.Josh
has a problem, you see Josh has learned how to make sites that are both
scalable and reliable. So he's puzzled why companies "whose downtime
interfaces (Twitter) are more well known than their uptime interfaces" get all
the attention, respect, and money for being failures. Just doing your job
doesn't make you a hero.  You need these self-inflicted wounds in-order to
have the war stories to share at conferences. They get the attention. Just
doing your job is boring. This is so unfair in that way life can be. So if you
want to turn the tables and take the low road to fame and fortune, here's
Josh's program for learning how not to scale:Be trendy. Use the tool that has
the most buzz: NoSQL, Cloud, MapReduce, Rails, RabbitMQ. It helps you not

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.This blog post will tell you exactly how to build
a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-
terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays,
actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.You need to
know:Which SSDs workWhich chassis workHow to configure your RAID cardsIntel's
SATA solutions - combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell
R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized
database likeAerospike, enables high throughput and low latency.In a wide
configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can
cost-effectively serve at high throughput with 16T at $2.50 per GB with the
s3700, or $1.25 with the s3500. Other SSD offerings - from Crucial (Micron)

<p>Introduction: "For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing
them." -- AristotleA really nice Internet moment happened in the HackerNews
thread Disqus: Scaling the World's Largest Django Application, when David
Kitchen crafted an awesome responseto a questionabout how you learn to build
scalable systems. It's so good I thought I would reproduce it
here.Question:asked by grovulent:Not like this is a problem I have to worry
about. But where on earth does one learn this stuff? The talk is useful - as
an overview of what they use - but I know nothing of how to implement a single
step.Answer: answered by David Kitchenofburo9:It's called experience. Which
perhaps sounds rude, but it's not meant to be.This stuff isn't taught per se,
you learn it bit by bit as you solve each problem that you face.I learned
about HAProxy when my site load exceeded that which a single web server could
manage.I learned about heartbeat when I had to update my HAProxy and it

<p>Introduction: Sean Hullwith two helpful posts:5 Things That are Toxic to Scalability:Object
Relational Mappers.Create complex queries that hard to optimize and
tweak.Synchronous, Serial, Coupled or Locking Processes.Locks are like stop
signs, traffic circles keep the traffic flowing. Row level locking is better
than table level locking. Use async replication. Use eventual consistency for
clusters.One Copy of Your Database.A single database server is a choke point.
Create parallel databases and let a driver select between them.Having No
Metrics.Visualize what's happening to your system using one of the many
monitoring packages.Lack of Feature Flags.Be able to turn off features via a
flag so when a spike hits features can be turned off to reduce load.3 Ways to
Boost Cloud Scalability:Use Auto-scaling.Spin-up new instances when a
threshold is passed and back down again when traffic drops.Horizontally Scale

<p>Introduction: Harish Ganesan CTO of8KMiles has a very helpful blog, Cloud, Big Data and
Mobile, where he shows a nice analytical bent which leads to a lot of
practical advice and cost saving tips:Use SQS Batch Requests to reduce the
number of requests hitting SQS which saves costs. Sending 10 messages in a
single batch request which in the example save $30/month.Use SQS Long Polling
to reduce extra polling requests, cutting down empty receives, which in the
example saves ~$600 in empty receive leakage costs.Choose the right search
technology choice to save costs in AWS by matching your activity pattern to
the technology. For a small application with constant load or a heavily
utilized search tier or seasonal loads Amazon Cloud Search looks like the cost
efficient play. Use Amazon CloudFront Price Class to minimize costs by
selecting the right Price Class for your audience to potentially reduce
delivery costs by excluding Amazon CloudFront's more expensive edge
locations.Optimize ElastiCache Cluster</p><p>5 0.86949438 <a title="994-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-23-Ask_HighScalability%3A_How_Do_I_Build_My_MegaUpload_%2B_Itunes_%2B_YouTube_Startup%3F.html">1288 high scalability-2012-07-23-Ask HighScalability: How Do I Build My MegaUpload + Itunes + YouTube Startup?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This question was sent in by Val, who asking for a little help in creating the
next big thing. Any ideas?I'm planning to run my own, first startup website
and have been surfing the webs for relevant info to plan the technology I will
use for it (the frontend and the backend, including the software and the
hardware). The website will be something like a combination of:MegaUpload
(users will upload their files)iTunes (users will be paid for their
uploads)and YouTube (in the future I'm planning to let users watch/listen to
the content online, without downloading).I don't have any investors yet, nor
the budget - I'm still preparing the idea and I'm going to create first
implementation (an "alpha version") before I show it to potential investors.
Hence the initial technologies have to be extremely cheap *but* also highly
scalable in the future so that I don't have to redo anything when the website
grows.Unfortunately I don't have much experience in running big wesites but,

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>4 0.21211916 <a title="1008-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-18-Building_your_own_Facebook_Realtime_Analytics_System__.html">1081 high scalability-2011-07-18-Building your own Facebook Realtime Analytics System  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently, I was reading Todd Hoff's write-up on FaceBook real time analytics
system. As usual, Todd did an excellent job in summarizing this video from
Engineering Manager at Facebook Alex Himel.Inthe first post, I'd like to
summarize the case study, and consider some things that weren't mentioned in
the summaries. This will lead to an architecture for building your own
Realtime Time Analytics for Big-Data that might be easier to implement, using
Facebook's experience as a starting point and guide as well as the experience
gathered through a recent work with few of GigaSpaces customers. Thesecond
postprovide a summary of that new approach as well as a pattern and a demo for
building your own Real Time Analytics system..ReferencesReal Time analytics

<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things).
That's why scaling Facebook is hardsays Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of
Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and
Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why
would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional
web sites? Let's find out.Traditional websites are easier to scale than social
networking sites for two reasons:They usually access only their own data and
common cached data.Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one
time.Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your
profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the
website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around
single records usingdistributed hashing schemes. And since only a few percent
of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little RAM cache

<p>Introduction: Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, gave an excellent Scale
at Facebooktalk that covers their architecture, but the talk is really more
about how to scale an organization by preserving the best parts of its
culture. The key take home of the talk is: You can get the code right, you can
get the products right, but you need to get the culture right first. If you
don't get the culture right then your company won't scale.This leads into the
four meta secrets of scaling at Facebook:Scaling takes IterationDon't Over
DesignChoose the right tool for the job, but realize that your choice comes
with overhead.Get the culture right. Move Fast \- break things. Huge Impact \-
small teams. Be bold \- innovate.Some Background Facebook is big: 400 million
active users; users spend an average of 20 minutes a day; 5 billion pieces of
content (status updates, comments, likes, photo uploads, video uploads, chat
messages, inbox messages, group events, fan pages, friend connections) are

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>6 0.74534774 <a title="1008-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-28-How_Next_Big_Sound_Tracks_Over_a_Trillion_Song_Plays%2C_Likes%2C_and_More_Using_a_Version_Control_System_for_Hadoop_Data.html">1586 high scalability-2014-01-28-How Next Big Sound Tracks Over a Trillion Song Plays, Likes, and More Using a Version Control System for Hadoop Data</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Facebook did it again. They've built another system capable of doing something
useful with ginormous streams of realtime data. Last time we saw Facebook
release their New Real-Time Messaging System: HBase To Store 135+ Billion
Messages A Month. This time it's a realtime analytics system handlingover 20
billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30
seconds. Alex Himel, Engineering Manager at Facebook, explains what they've
built (video) and the scale required:Social plugins have become an important
and growing source of traffic for millions of websites over the past year. We
released a new version of Insights for Websites last week to give site owners
better analytics on how people interact with their content and to help them
optimize their websites in real time. To accomplish this, we had to engineer a
system that could process over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per
second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds. Alex does an excellent job with

<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300
thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially
experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems
and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each
day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly
visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a
very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale
meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?Site:

<p>Introduction: This is an interview withMemSQLcofounder'sEric FrenkielandNikita Shamgunov, in
which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their
technology.MemSQL ruffled a few feathers with their claim of being the fastest
database in the world. According to their benchmarks MemSQL can execute 200K
TPS on an EC2QuadrupleExtra Largeand on a 64 core machine they can push 1.2
million transactions a second.Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of
them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects
looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using
a combination of technologies likeMVCC, code generation,lock-free data
structures,skip lists, andin-memory execution. Familiar as in SQL and nothing
but SQL. The only interface to MemSQL is SQL.It's right to point out MemSQL
gets a boost by being a first release. Only a limited subset of SQL is
supported, neither replication or sharding are implemented yet, and writes

Harris. Digital Chocolate is following the Zynga strategy of moving games into
higher performing datacenter infrastructure once it becomes popular enough in
the cloud to justify the primo stuff. We talked about this strategy inZynga's

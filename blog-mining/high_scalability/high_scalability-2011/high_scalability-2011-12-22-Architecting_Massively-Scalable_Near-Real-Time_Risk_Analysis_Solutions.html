</p><p>5 volumes in this domain are massive and ever-increasing, together with an ever-increasing demand to reduce response time. [sent-7, score-0.073]
</p><p>6 These trends are aggravated by global financial regulatory reforms set following the late-2000s financial crisis, which mandate reducing exposure to risk by shortening risk settlement cycles. [sent-8, score-1.452]
</p><p>7 Traditional architectures were based on overnight batch processing using compute grids and relational databases. [sent-9, score-0.125]
</p><p>8 But can the traditional architecture meet the new demand for near-real-time processing? [sent-10, score-0.247]
</p><p>9 Constructing a massively-scalable near-realtime risk analysis solution requires a new architectural approach. [sent-12, score-0.72]
</p><p>10 it's important to realize that the intraday data changes very frequently but is of limited volume, whereas historical data changes much less frequently but is of much higher volumes. [sent-14, score-0.862]
</p><p>11 Good architecture should accomodate for these inherent differences, employing a multi-tiered architecture with in-memory data grid for intraday data and NoSQL database for historical data, and a processing layer to unify the two datastores, making them look as one for querying purposes.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: An unstated assumption is that clouds are scalable. But are they? Stick
thousands upon thousands of machines together and there are a lot of potential
bottlenecks just waiting to choke off your scalability supply. And if the
cloud is scalable what are the chances that your application is really
linearly scalable? At 10 machines all may be well. Even at 50 machines the
seas look calm. But at 100, 200, or 500 machines all hell might break loose.
How do you know?You know through real life testing. These kinds of tests are
brutally hard and complicated. who wants to do all the incredibly precise and
difficult work of producing cloud scalability tests?GridDynamicshas stepped up
to the challenge and has just released theirCloud Performance Reports.The
report is quite detailed so I'll just cover what I found most interesting.

<p>Introduction: Making Hadoop Run FasterOne of the challenges in processing data is that the
speed at which we can input data is quite often much faster than the speed at
which we can process it. This problem becomes even more pronounced in the
context of Big Data, where the volume of data keeps on growing, along with a
corresponding need for more insights, and thus the need for more complex
processing also increases.Batch Processing to the RescueHadoop was designed to
deal with this challenge in the following ways:1. Use a distributed file
system: This enables us to spread the load and grow our system as needed.2.
Optimize for write speed: To enable fast writes the Hadoop architecture was
designed so that writes are first logged, and then processed. This enables
fairly fast write speeds.3. Use batch processing (Map/Reduce) to balance the
speed for the data feeds with the processing speed.Batch Processing
ChallengesThe challenge with batch-processing is that it assumes that the
feeds come in bursts. I</p><p>5 0.11956386 <a title="1161-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-21-In_Memory_Data_Grid_Technologies.html">1160 high scalability-2011-12-21-In Memory Data Grid Technologies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After winning a CSC Leading Edge Forum (LEF) research grant, I (Paul Colmer)
wanted to publish some of the highlights of my research to share with the
wider technology community.What is an In Memory Data Grid?It is not an in-
memory relational database, a NOSQL database or a relational database.  It is
a different breed of software datastore.In summary an IMDG is an 'off the
shelf' software product that exhibits the following characteristics:The data
model is distributed across many servers in a single location or across
multiple locations.  This distribution is known as a data fabric.  This
distributed model is known as a 'shared nothing' architecture.All servers can
be active in each site.All data is stored in the RAM of the servers.Servers
can be added or removed non-disruptively, to increase the amount of RAM
available.The data model is non-relational and is object-based. Distributed
applications written on the .NET and Java application platforms are
supported.The data fabric is re</p><p>6 0.11591016 <a title="1161-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's time to think of the architecture and application platforms surrounding
"Big Data" databases. Big Data is often centered  around new database
technologies mostly from the emerging NoSQL world.  The main challenge that
these databases solve is how to handle massive amount of data at a reasonable
cost and without poor performanc - distributed databases emerged to address
this challenge and today we're seeing high adoption rate and quite impressive
success stories such as the Netflix use of Cassandra/DataStax solution.  All
that indicate the speed in which this market evolves.The need for a Big Data
Application PlatformApplication platforms provide a framework for making the
development of applications simpler. They do this by carving out the generic
parts of applications such as security, scalability, and reliability (which
are attributes of a 'good' application) from the parts of the applications
that are specific to our business domain.Most of the existing application
platforms su</p><p>3 0.80325639 <a title="1161-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-01-Paper%3A_Nanocubes%3A_Nanocubes_for_Real-Time_Exploration_of_Spatiotemporal_Datasets.html">1570 high scalability-2014-01-01-Paper: Nanocubes: Nanocubes for Real-Time Exploration of Spatiotemporal Datasets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you turn Big Data into fast, useful, and interesting visualizations?
UsingRand technology calledNanocubes. The visualizations are stunning and
amazingly reactive. Almost as interesting as the technologies behind
them.David Smith wrote agreat articleexplaining the technology and showing a
demo by Simon Urbanek of a visualization that uses 32Tb of Twitter data. It
runs smoothly and interactively on a single machine with 16Gb of RAM.  For
more information and demos go tonanocubes.net.David Smith sums it up
nicely:Despite the massive number of data points and the beauty and complexity
of the real-time data visualization, it runs impressively quickly. The
underlying data structure is based on Nanocubes, a fast datastructure for in-
memory data cubes. The basic idea is that nanocubes aggregate data
hierarchically, so that as you zoom in and out of the interactive application,
one pixel on the screen is mapped to just one data point, aggregated from the

community where software engineers come to grow.In response to a recent post
from MongoHQ entitled "You don't have big data," I would generally agree with
many of the author's points.However, regardless of whether you call it big
data, small data, hot data or cold data - we are all in a position to admit
that *more* data is here to stay - and that's due to many different
factors.Perhaps primarily, as the article mentions, this is due to the
decreasing cost of storage over time. Other factors include access to open
APIs, the sheer volume of ever-increasing consumer activity online, as well as
a plethora of other incentives that are developing (mostly) behind the scenes
as companies "share" data with each other. (You know they do this, right?)But
one of the most important things I've learned over the past couple of years is
that it's crucial for forward thinking companies to start to design more
robust data pipeli</p><p>5 0.7798245 <a title="1161-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-27-Big_Data_In_the_Cloud_Using_Cloudify.html">1216 high scalability-2012-03-27-Big Data In the Cloud Using Cloudify</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill wrote an interesting article on O'Reilly Radar covering the
current solutions for running Big Data in the CloudBig data and cloud
technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing,
which clouds can readily provide.Big PaaSEdd touched briefly on the role of
PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloudBeyond IaaS, several
cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes
referred to as managed solutions, or platform as a service (PaaS), these
services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce,
reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers
can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass
those savings on to the customer.To put it simply, managing data clusters is
one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we
need to think about when we're dealing with application platforms, as I noted
in one of my earlier</p><p>6 0.77830726 <a title="1161-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-21-In_Memory_Data_Grid_Technologies.html">1160 high scalability-2011-12-21-In Memory Data Grid Technologies</a></p>

<p>Introduction: nginx is a high performance smtp/pop/imap proxy that lets you do custom
authorization and lookups and is very scalable. (just add nodes)Nginx by
default is a reverse proxy and this is what it is doing here for pop/imap
connections. It is also an excellelent reverse proxy for web
servers.Advantage: You dont have to have a speacial database or ldap schema.
Just an url to do auth and lookup with.A url that may be accessed by a unix or
a tcp socket. Write your own auth handler - according to your own policy.For
example:A user called atif tries to login with the pass testxyz.You pass this
infomation to a URL such assocket:/var/tmp/xyz.sockorhttp://auth.corp.mailserv

<p>Introduction: Constructing a scalablerisk analysis solution is a fascinating architectural
challenge. If you come from Financial Services you are sure to appreciate
that. But even architects from other domains are bound to find the challenges
fascinating, and the architectural patterns of my suggested solution highly
useful in other domains.Recently I held an interesting webinar around
architecting solutions for scalable and near-real-time risk analysis solutions
based on experience gathered with Financial Services customers. Seeing the
vast interest in the webinar, I would like to share the highlights with you
here.From an architectural point of view, risk analysis is a data-intensive
and a compute-intensive process, which also has an elaborate orchestration
logic. volumes in this domain are massive and ever-increasing, together with
an ever-increasing demand to reduce response time. These trends are aggravated
by global financial regulatory reforms set following the late-2000s financial
crisis, wh</p><p>4 0.88680917 <a title="1161-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-23-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_23%2C_2011.html">1122 high scalability-2011-09-23-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 23, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pomegranateis a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular
storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at
increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support
applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high
concurrency, high throughput, and low latency. Their tests seem to indicate it
works:We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well
for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observedlinearly
increased more than100,000aggregate read and write requests served per second
(RPS). Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V
store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system
API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use.
Every application could use it out of the box.The features of Pomegranate
are:It handles billions of small files efficiently, even in one directory;It

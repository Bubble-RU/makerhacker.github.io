<p>Introduction: Gartner published recently an interesting paper: Productivity vs. Control:
Cloud Application Platforms Must Split to Win. (The paper requires
registration.)The paper does a pretty good job covering the evolution that is
taking place in the PaaS market toward a more open platform and compares
between the two main categories: aPaaS (essentially a PaaS running as a
service) and CEAP (Cloud Enabled Application Platform) which is the  *P* out
of PaaS that gives you the platform to build your own PaaS in private or
public cloud.While I was reading through the paper I felt that something
continued to bother me with this definition, even though I tend to agree with
the overall observation. If I follow the logic of this paper than I have to
give away productivity to gain control, hmmâ&euro;Ś  that's a hard choice.The issue

<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill wrote an interesting article on O'Reilly Radar covering the
current solutions for running Big Data in the CloudBig data and cloud
technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing,
which clouds can readily provide.Big PaaSEdd touched briefly on the role of
PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloudBeyond IaaS, several
cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes
referred to as managed solutions, or platform as a service (PaaS), these
services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce,
reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers
can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass
those savings on to the customer.To put it simply, managing data clusters is
one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we
need to think about when we're dealing with application platforms, as I noted

<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a meetup Wednesday onOpenStack,
whose tag line isthe open source, open standards cloud. I was shocked at the
large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of
them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free
t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are
really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud
doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from
Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems
to be. The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:OpenStack allows any organization
to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software
running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically
creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack
Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage using
clusters o</p><p>5 0.10880607 <a title="1031-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: How many times have you been called in the middle of the night by your
operation guys telling you that your application throws some odd red alerts?
How many times did you found out that when those issues happens you don't have
enough information to analyze this incident? have you tried to increase the
log level just to find out that your problem became even worse - now your
application throws tons of information in a continues basis most of which is
complete garbage...The current separation between the way we implement our
application and the way we manage it leads to many of this ridicules
situations. Cloud makes those things even worse.Inthis posti suggest an
alternative approach. Why don't we run our application the way we run our
business? I refer to this approach as the "interactive cloud" where our
application behaves just like our project team and the operations just like
our managers. As with our business our application would need to take more
responsibility to the way it runs</p><p>4 0.6646021 <a title="1031-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Are_we_seeing_the_renaissance_of_enterprises_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1354 high scalability-2012-11-05-Are we seeing the renaissance of enterprises in the cloud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is
indeed the case:Research conducted by HPfound that the majority of businesses
in the EMEA region are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the
cloud. Of the 940 respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-
critical apps at some point over the next two to five years.A more
recentsurvey, by research firm MeriTalkand sponsored by VMware and EMC
(NYSE:EMC), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to move some
mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within two years,
the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their mission-critical apps
to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of their mission-
critical apps to run in the cloud.The Challenge - How to Bring Hundreds of
Enterprise Apps to the CloudThe reality is that cloud economics only start
making sense when there are true workloads that utilize the cloud

cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes
referred to as managed solutions, or platform as a service (PaaS), these
services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce,
reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers
can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass
those savings on to the customer.To put it simply, managing data clusters is
one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we
need to think about when we're dealing with application platforms, as I noted

<p>Introduction: Yesterday, I had a session during the OpenStack Summit where I tried to
present a more general view on how we should be thinking about PaaS in the
context of OpenStack.The key takeaway :The main goal of PaaS is to drive
productivity into the process by which we can deliver new applications.Most of
the existing PaaS solutions take a fairly extreme approach with their
abstraction of the underlying infrastructure and therefore fit a fairly small
number of extremely simple applications and thus miss the real promise of
PaaS.Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk took a more bottom up approach giving us
better set of tradeoffs between the abstraction and control which makes it
more broadly applicable to a larger set of applications.The fact that
OpenStack is opensource allows us to think differently on the things we can do
at the platform layer. We can create a tighter integration between the PaaS
and IaaS layers and thus come up with better set of tradeoffs into the way we
drive productivity without g</p><p>2 0.94518119 <a title="1031-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-10-Paper%3A_Paxos_Made_Moderately_Complex.html">1243 high scalability-2012-05-10-Paper: Paxos Made Moderately Complex</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are a normal human being and find thePaxos protocolconfusing, then this
paper, Paxos Made Moderately Complex, is a great find. Robbert van Renesse
from Cornell University has written a clear and well written paper with
excellent explanations.The Abstract:For anybody who has ever tried to
implement it, Paxos is by no means a simple protocol, even though it is based
on relatively simple invariants. This paper provides imperative pseudo-code
for the full Paxos (or Multi-Paxos) protocol without shying away from
discussing various implementation details. The initial description avoids
optimizations that complicate comprehension. Next we discuss liveness, and
list various optimizations that make the protocol practical.Related

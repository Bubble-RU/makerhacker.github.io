Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple

this paper--Don't Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-
Area Storage with COPS--are different. It's not another eventually consistent
system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based
system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally
consistent system that achievesALPSsystem properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL,
etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete

</p><p>4 In atalk on COPS, Wyatt Lloyd, defines consistency as arestriction on the ordering and timing of operations. [sent-14, score-0.404]
</p><p>5 We want the strongest consistency guarantees possible because it makes the programmer's life a lot easier. [sent-15, score-0.393]
</p><p>6 This is called linearizability and is impossible to achieve strong consistency with ALPS properties. [sent-17, score-0.43]

</p><p>8 Sequential consistency and low latency are impossible to achieve on a WAN. [sent-20, score-0.43]
</p><p>9 There's a general idea if you want an always-on scalable datastore that you have to sacrifice consistency and settle for eventual consistency. [sent-22, score-0.532]
</p><p>10 There's another form of consistency,causal consistency, that sits between eventual consistency and the stronger forms of consistency. [sent-23, score-0.454]
</p><p>11 Causal consistency gives apartial order over operations so the clients see operations in order governed by causality. [sent-24, score-0.657]
</p><p>12 Theoretically causal consistency is a stronger consistency guarantee, that is also scalable, and maintains ALPS properties. [sent-25, score-1.176]
</p><p>13 A key property of causal consistency to keep in mind is that it guarantees you will be working on consistent values, but it doesn't guarantee you will be working on the most recent values. [sent-27, score-1.153]
</p><p>14 Here's amoney quote describing causal consistency in more detail:The central approach in COPS involves explicitly tracking and enforcing causal dependencies between updates. [sent-34, score-1.424]
</p><p>15 This approach differs from traditional causal systems that exchange update logs between replicas. [sent-38, score-0.583]

</p><p>18 This sounds a lot like eventual consistency to me. [sent-68, score-0.405]
</p><p>19 They call this causal consistency + convergent conflict handling as causal+ consistency. [sent-69, score-0.829]

<p>Introduction: Here are a few updates on the articlePaper: Don't Settle For Eventual:
Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS from Mike Freedman
and Wyatt Lloyd.Q: How software architectures could change in response to
casual+ consistency?A: I don't really think they would much. Somebody would
still run a two-tier architecture in their datacenter:  a front-tier of
webservers running both (say) PHP and our client library, and a back tier of
storage nodes running COPS.  (I'm not sure if it was obvious given the
discussion of our "thick" client -- you should think of the COPS client
dropping in where a memcache client library does...albeit ours has per-session
state.) Q: Why not just use vector clocks?A: The problem with vector clocks
and scalability has always been that the size of vector clocks in O(N), where
N is the number of nodes.  So if we want to scale to a datacenter with 10K
nodes, each piece of metadata must have size O(10K).  And in fact, vector
clocks alone only allow yo</p><p>3 0.26011196 <a title="1146-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-24-How_Google_Serves_Data_from_Multiple_Datacenters.html">687 high scalability-2009-08-24-How Google Serves Data from Multiple Datacenters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Streamy Explains CAP and HBase's Approach to CAP.We plan to employ
inter-cluster replication, with each cluster located in a single DC. Remote
replication will introduce some eventual consistency into the system, but each
cluster will continue to be strongly consistent.Ryan Barrett, Google App
Engine datastore lead, gave this talkTransactions Across Datacenters (and
Other Weekend Projects)at the Google I/O 2009 conference.While the talk
doesn't necessarily break new technical ground, Ryan does an excellent job
explaining and evaluating the different options you have when architecting a
system to work across multiple datacenters. This is calledmultihoming,
operating from multiple datacenters simultaneously.As multihoming is one of
the most challenging tasks in all computing, Ryan's clear and thoughtful style
comfortably leads you through the various options. On the trip you learn:The
differentmulti-homing optionsare: Backups, Master-Slave, Multi-Master, 2PC,
and Paxos. You'll als</p><p>4 0.19493389 <a title="1146-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Think_of_Latency_as_a_Pseudo-permanent_Network_Partition.html">879 high scalability-2010-08-12-Think of Latency as a Pseudo-permanent Network Partition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The title of this post is a quote from Ilya Grigorik's post Weak Consistency
and CAP Implications. Besides the article being excellent, I thought this idea
had something to add to the great NoSQL versus RDBMS debate, whereMike
Stonebraker makes the argument that network partitions are rare so designing
eventually consistent systems for such rare occurrence is not worth losing
ACID semantics over. Even if network partitions are rare, latency between
datacenters is not rare, so the game is still on.The rare-partition argument
seems to flow from a centralized-distributed view of systems. Such systems are
scale-out in that they grow by adding distributed nodes, but the nodes
generally do not cross datacenter boundaries. The assumption is the network is
fast enough that distributed operations are roughly homogenous between
nodes.In a fully-distributed system the nodes can be dispersed across
datacenters, which gives operations a widely variable performance profile.

<p>Introduction: Georeplication is one of the standard techniques for dealing when bad things--
failure and latency--happen to good systems. The problem is always: how do you
do that? Murat Demirbas, Associate Professor at SUNY Buffalo, has a couple of
really good posts that can help:MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency andMaking
Geo-Replicated Systems Fast as Possible, Consistent when Necessary. In MDCC:
Multi-Data Center Consistency Murat discusses a paper that says synchronous
wide-area replication can be feasible. There's a quick and clear explanation
of Paxos and various optimizations that is worth the price of admission. We
find that strong consistency doesn't have to be lost across a WAN:The good
thing about using Paxos over the WAN is you /almost/ get the full CAP  (all
three properties: consistency, availability, and partition-freedom). As we
discussed earlier (Paxos taught), Paxos is CP, that is, in the presence of a
partition, Paxos keeps consistency over availability. But, Paxos can still

datacenters is not rare, so the game is still on.The rare-partition argument
seems to flow from a centralized-distributed view of systems. Such systems are
scale-out in that they grow by adding distributed nodes, but the nodes
generally do not cross datacenter boundaries. The assumption is the network is
fast enough that distributed operations are roughly homogenous between
nodes.In a fully-distributed system the nodes can be dispersed across
datacenters, which gives operations a widely variable performance profile.

<p>Introduction: Teams fromPrincetonand CMU areworking togetherto solve one of the most
difficult problems in the repertoire: scalable geo-distributed data stores.
Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple
datacenter database functionality for some time, but there's still a general
lack of available systems that work for complex data scenarios.The ideas in
this paper--Don't Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-
Area Storage with COPS--are different. It's not another eventually consistent
system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based
system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally
consistent system that achievesALPSsystem properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL,
etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete
successfully), Low-latency (operations complete quickly (single digit
milliseconds)), Partition-tolerant (operates with a partition), and Scalable

<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers Show 41 episode was to reveal and
ruminate over the horrors of a successfulattack on RSA, which puts the whole
world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there
was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost
datacenter.Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile
back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by
summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal: Look at
Arista and Juniper. JuniperHas a range of stackable switches, which includes
some 10 gig.If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on
their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric
solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric.
Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.
Thinks Juniper would make a good deal in order to get a few reference sites

<p>Introduction: I've been using GWT for an application and I get the same feeling using it
that I first got using html. I've always sucked at building UIs. Starting with
programming HP terminals, moving on to the Apple Lisa, then X Windows, and
Microsoft Windows, I just never had IT, whatever IT is. On the Beauty and the
Geek scale my interfaces are definitely horned-rimmed and pocket protector
friendly. Html helped free me from all that to just build stuff that worked,
but didn't have to look all that great. Expectations were pretty low and I
eagerly fulfilled them. With Ajax expectations have risen again and I find
myself once more easily identifiable as a styless geek. Using GWT I have some
hopes I can suck a little less.In working with GWT I was so focussed on its
tasty easily digestible Ajaxy goodness, I didn't stop to think about the topic
of this site: scalability. When I finally brought my distracted mind around to
consider the scalability of the single page webs site I was building, I became</p><p>5 0.83974046 <a title="1146-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-08-Update_on_Scalable_Causal_Consistency_For_Wide-Area_Storage_With_COPS.html">1153 high scalability-2011-12-08-Update on Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are a few updates on the articlePaper: Don't Settle For Eventual:
Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS from Mike Freedman
and Wyatt Lloyd.Q: How software architectures could change in response to
casual+ consistency?A: I don't really think they would much. Somebody would
still run a two-tier architecture in their datacenter:  a front-tier of
webservers running both (say) PHP and our client library, and a back tier of
storage nodes running COPS.  (I'm not sure if it was obvious given the
discussion of our "thick" client -- you should think of the COPS client
dropping in where a memcache client library does...albeit ours has per-session
state.) Q: Why not just use vector clocks?A: The problem with vector clocks
and scalability has always been that the size of vector clocks in O(N), where
N is the number of nodes.  So if we want to scale to a datacenter with 10K
nodes, each piece of metadata must have size O(10K).  And in fact, vector
clocks alone only allow yo</p><p>6 0.83023673 <a title="1146-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_30%2C_2013.html">1509 high scalability-2013-08-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 30, 2013</a></p>

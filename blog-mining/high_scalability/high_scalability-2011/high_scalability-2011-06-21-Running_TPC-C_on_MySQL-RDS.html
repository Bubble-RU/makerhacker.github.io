<p>Introduction: I've been getting asked about this a lot lately so I figured I'd just blog
about it. Products like WebSphere eXtreme Scale work by taking a dataset,
partitioning it using a key and then assigning those partitions to a number of
JVMs. Each partition usually has a primary and a replica. These 'shards' are
assigned to JVMs. A transactional application typically interacts with the
data on a single partition at a time. This means the transaction is executed
in a single JVM. A server box will be able to do M of those transactions per
second and it scales because N boxes does MN (M multiplied by N) transactions
per second. Increase N, you get more transactions per second. Availability is
very good because a transaction only depends on 1 of the N servers that are
currently online. Any of the other (N-1) servers can go down or fail with no
impact on the transaction. So, single partition transactions can scale
indefinitely from a throughput point of view, offer very consistent response
times and</p><p>5 0.15186086 <a title="1065-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-08-F1_and_Spanner_Holistically_Compared.html">1529 high scalability-2013-10-08-F1 and Spanner Holistically Compared</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an interview withMemSQLcofounder'sEric FrenkielandNikita Shamgunov, in
which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their
technology.MemSQL ruffled a few feathers with their claim of being the fastest
database in the world. According to their benchmarks MemSQL can execute 200K
TPS on an EC2QuadrupleExtra Largeand on a 64 core machine they can push 1.2
million transactions a second.Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of
them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects
looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using
a combination of technologies likeMVCC, code generation,lock-free data
structures,skip lists, andin-memory execution. Familiar as in SQL and nothing
but SQL. The only interface to MemSQL is SQL.It's right to point out MemSQL
gets a boost by being a first release. Only a limited subset of SQL is
supported, neither replication or sharding are implemented yet, and writes

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation
from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?
Mike Stonebraker, the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world,
hopes you get something like his new database,VoltDB: a pure SQL, pure ACID,
pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory
DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a
second. VoltDBclaims to be100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster
thanCassandra, and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.Will
VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of
ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product
with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component
in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...I first heard the

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post (part 2,part 3) by Greg Lindahl, CTO of blekko, the spam
free search engine that had over 3.5 million unique visitors in March. Greg
Lindahl was Founder and Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was
the architect of the InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build
tightly-coupled supercomputing clusters.Imagine that you're crazy enough to
think about building a search engine.  It's a huge task: the minimum index
size needed to answer most queries is a few billion webpages. Crawling and
indexing a few billion webpages requires a cluster with several petabytes of
usable disk -- that's several thousand 1 terabyte disks -- and produces an
index that's about 100 terabytes in size.Serving query results quickly
involves having most of the index in RAM or on solid state (flash) disk. If
you can buy a server with 100 gigabytes of RAM for about $3,000, that's 1,000
servers at a capital cost of $3 million, plus about $1 million per year of

<p>Introduction: For years a war has been fought in the software architecture trenches between
the ideal of decentralized services and the power and practicality of
centralized services. Centralized architectures, at least at themanagement and
control planelevel, are winning. And Google not only agrees, they are
enthusiastic adopters of this model, even in places you don't think it should
work.Here's an excerpt from Google Lifts Veil On "Andromeda" Virtual
Networking, an excellent article by Timothy Morgan, that includes a money
quote fromAmin Vahdat, distinguished engineer and technical lead for
networking at Google:Like many of the massive services that Google has
created, the Andromeda network has centralized control. By the way, so did the
Google File System and the MapReduce scheduler that gave rise to Hadoop when
it was mimicked, so did the BigTable NoSQL data store that has spawned a
number of quasi-clones, and even the B4 WAN and the Spanner distributed file
system that have yet to be cloned. "</p><p>3 0.96105456 <a title="1065-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad_Architecture.html">68 high scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says the best
way to avoid failure is to fail constantly. In the cloud it's expected
instances can fail at any time, so you always have to be prepared. In the real
world we prepare by running drills. Remember all those exciting fire drills?
It's not just fire drills of course. The military, football teams, fire
fighters, beach rescue, virtually any entity that must react quickly and
efficiently to disaster hones their responsiveness by running drills.Netflix
aggressively moves this strategy into the cloud by randomly failing servers
using a tool they built called Chaos Monkey. The idea is:If we aren't
constantly testing our ability to succeed despite failure, then it isn't
likely to work when it matters most - in the event of an unexpected
outage.They respond to failures bydegrading service, but they always
respond:If the recommendations system is down they'll show popular titles
instead.If the search system is slow then th</p><p>same-blog 5 0.95631593 <a title="1065-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-21-Running_TPC-C_on_MySQL-RDS.html">1065 high scalability-2011-06-21-Running TPC-C on MySQL-RDS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently came across a TPC-C benchmark results held on MySQL based RDS
databases. You can see ithere. I think the results may bring light to many
questions concerning MySQL scalability in general and RDS scalability in
particular. (For disclosure, I'm working forScaleBasewhere we run an internal
scale out TPC-C benchmark these days, and will publish results soon).TPC-
CTPC-C is a standard database benchmark, used to measure databases. The
database vendors invest big bucks in running this test, and showing off which
database is faster, and can scale better.It is a write intensive test, so it
doesn't necessarily reflect the behavior of the database in your application.
But it does give some very important insights on what you can expect from your
database under heavy load.The Benchmark ProcessFirst of all, I have some
comments for the benchmark method itself.Generally - the benchmarks were held
in an orderly fashion and in a rather methodological way - which increases the

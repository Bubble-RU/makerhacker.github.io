<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems
to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly
increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly
using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and
gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous
information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and
ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only
SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it's true that the marketing wave of NoSQL
has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that's been around for quite a
while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all,
everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend
of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very profitable
either.So, what'</p><p>3 0.11852562 <a title="1018-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-20-35%2B_Use_Cases_for_Choosing_Your_Next_NoSQL_Database.html">1064 high scalability-2011-06-20-35+ Use Cases for Choosing Your Next NoSQL Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've asked What The Heck Are You Actually Using NoSQL For?. We've asked 101
Questions To Ask When Considering A NoSQL Database. We've even had a webinar
What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for Scalable Web
Applications.Now we get to the point of considering use cases and which
systems might be appropriate for those use cases.What are your options?First,
let's cover what are the various data models. These have been adapted fromEmil
EifremandNoSQL databases. Document DatabasesLineage: Inspired by Lotus
Notes.Data model: Collections of documents, which contain key-value
collections.Example: CouchDB, MongoDB Good at: Natural data modeling.

<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of many of the

the traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.This view has brought on a
flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a different aspect
that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach, such as a document

the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject, and tend to use

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at

<p>Introduction: Inthis posti wrote my view on the anti SQL database movement and where the
alternative approach fits in:- SQL databases are not going away anytime soon.-
The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.- There
is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions
alongside traditional SQL databases.In addition to the options that was
mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative
approach and how that fits into the puzzle. I used a real life scenario:

approach was the only option they could scale and meet their application

<p>Introduction: Update: Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was
wrong about what he meant. His real point:The meaning of the statement was
that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a
standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a
high priority task for them.At the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto, an audience
member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really
interesting:NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.The
idea being that NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance,
etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its
name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships.
With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to
implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed
usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it's not
about data.My</p><p>5 0.77664971 <a title="1018-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Let's play a quick game of truth or sacrilage: are SQL and NoSQL are really
just two sides of the same coin? That's what Erik Meijerand Gavin Bierman
would have us believe in their "we can all get along and make a lot of money"
article in the Communications of the ACM,A Co-Relational Model of Data for
Large Shared Data Banks. You don't believe it? It's math, so it must be true
:-) Some key points:In this article we present a mathematical data model for
the most common noSQL databases--namely, key/value relationships--and
demonstrate that this data model is the mathematical dual of SQL's relational
data model of foreign-/primary-key relationships...we believe that our
categorical data-model formalization and monadic query language will allow the
same economic growth to occur for coSQL key-value stores....In contrast to
common belief, the question of big versus small data is orthogonal to the
question of SQL versus coSQL. While the coSQL model naturally supports extreme
sharding, the fac</p><p>2 0.77623224 <a title="1018-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Deploying_MySQL_Database_in_Solaris_Cluster_Environments.html">454 high scalability-2008-12-01-Deploying MySQL Database in Solaris Cluster Environments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: MySQL™ database, an open source database, delivers high performance and
reliability while keeping costs low by eliminating licensing fees. The
Solaris™ Cluster product is an integrated hardware and software environment
that can be used to create highly-available data services. This article
explains how to deploy the MySQL database in a Solaris Cluster environment.
The article addresses the following topics:* "Advantages of Deploying MySQL
Database with Solaris Cluster" on page 1 discusses the benefits provided by a
Solaris Cluster deployment of the MySQL database.* "Overview of Solaris
Cluster" on page 2 provides a high-level description of the hardware and
software components of the Solaris Cluster.* "Installation and Configuration"
on page 8 explains the procedure for deploying the MySQL database on a Solaris
Cluster.This article assumes that readers have a basic understanding of
Solaris Cluster and MySQL database installation and administration.</p><p>3 0.77276754 <a title="1018-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-26-Google_Pro_Tip%3A_Use_Back-of-the-envelope-calculations_to_Choose_the_Best_Design.html">978 high scalability-2011-01-26-Google Pro Tip: Use Back-of-the-envelope-calculations to Choose the Best Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you know which is the "best" design for a given problem? If, for
example, you were given the problem of generating an image search results page
of 30 thumbnails, would you load images sequentially? In parallel? Would you
cache? How would you decide?If you could harness thepower of the multiverseyou
could try every possible option in the design space and see which worked best.
But that's crazy impractical, isn't it?Another option is to consider theorder
of various algorithm alternatives. As a prophet for the Golden Age
ofComputational Thinking, Google would definitely do this, but what else might
Google do?Use Back-of-the-envelope Calculations to Evaluate Different
DesignsJeff Dean, Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry--
instrumental in many of Google's key systems: ad serving, BigTable; search,
MapReduce, ProtocolBuffers--advocates evaluating different designs usingback-
of-the-envelope calculations. He gives the full story in this Stanford video

<p>Introduction: With so many database options available these days, like for the rest of life,
it's natural to wonder how it allfits together. Amazon complicated, or rather
expanded the available options by introducing RDS, theirrelational database
service. RDS is MySQL safely cocooned as a manageable cloud element, resting
boldly within an energy providing elasticCPU pool, supported by a
virtuallyinfinite supplyof verycapable virtualized storage.MySQL in AWS isnow
easyto start, stop, monitor, backup, snapshot, expand, and effortlessly move
up and down the instance hierarchy. What it's not, contrary to what you might
expect, is a scale-out solution, it's a scale-up solution. You get more by
buying a bigger instance, not by horizontally adding more instances. There's
alimit. Admittedly a larger limit now with Amazon's newhigh memory
instances.That's OK, well maybe not for people who helped grow Amazon's
ecosystem by offering a similar product, but so many projects use MySQL that
this is a big win for a</p><p>5 0.72603846 <a title="1018-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-01-Google_Paper%3A_Large-scale_Incremental_Processing_Using_Distributed_Transactions_and_Notifications.html">912 high scalability-2010-10-01-Google Paper: Large-scale Incremental Processing Using Distributed Transactions and Notifications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This paper, Large-scale Incremental Processing Using Distributed Transactions
and Notifications by Daniel Peng and Frank Dabek, is Google's much anticipated
description of Percolator, their new real-time indexing system.The
abstract:Updating an index of the web as documents are crawled requires
continuously transforming a large repository of existing documents as new
documents arrive. This task is one example of a class of data processing tasks
that transform a large repository of data via small, independent mutations.
These tasks lie in a gap between the capabilities of existing infrastructure.
Databases do not meet the storage or throughput requirements of these tasks:
Google's indexing system stores tens of petabytes of data and processes
billions of updates per day on thousands of machines. MapReduce and other
batch-processing systems cannot process small updates individually as they
rely on creating large batches for efďŹ ciency. We have built Percolator, a

<p>Introduction: When you're looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium ecosystem,
one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular breed of fish is
amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are not, which means if you
put them together in a confined space, they're going to fight. Viciously. To
the death. Responsible aquarists try to avoid such situations, so careful
attention to theconspecificityof animals is a must.Now, while in many respects
the data center ecosystem correlates well to an aquarium ecosystem, in this
case it does not. It's what you usually get, today, but its not actually the
best model. That's because what you want in the data center ecosystem -
particularly when it extends to include publiccloud computingresources - is
conspecificity in infrastructure.This desire and practice is being seen both
in enterprise data center decision making as well as in startups suddenly
dealing with massive growth and increasingly encountering performance
bottlenecks over w</p><p>3 0.23651128 <a title="1044-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-28-Zynga_Needs_a_Server-side_Systems_Engineer.html">755 high scalability-2009-12-28-Zynga Needs a Server-side Systems Engineer</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact
socially with friends usingPlayfishgames on social platforms like The
Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the
fastest growing segment of the game industry:social gaming, which is the love
child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early
adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud
servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by
why EA bought them for$300 millionand they think a$1 billion gameis possible):
building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile
gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve
systems, agile development and deployment, andselling virtual goodas a
business model.How can a small company make all this happen? To explain the

<p>Introduction: "Everything in war is simple, but theďťż simplest thing is difficult." -- Carl
von ClausewitzGames are proving grounds for software architecture. They
combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost
sensitivity, and the need for profit. And when games have in-game currency,
like EVE Online has, there's money at play, so you can't just get away with a
c'est la vie attitude. Engineering must be applied. InPlanning for war: how

<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson: Game
Industry Legends: Rob Pardo, where the future of gaming is discussed, there
was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot
of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:Q. If the
game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that
can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to
overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of
those technical issues? Rob Pardo: I certainly think there's a lot of
potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of
hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these
servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any
less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with
the infrastructure that can have all those games up there. Another issue the

<p>Introduction: Update:As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to
dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change.
What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's
link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better
yesterday and a better tomorrow.CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make
CAPTCHA work (Spammers Choose GMail). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't
really work because CAPTCHA solving markets (Inside India's CAPTCHA solving
economy) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken
CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game
over :-)Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the
CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is
with humans.Using Games to Get Humans to Do Work (like CAPTCHA) for FreeHow do

<p>Introduction: Garry Tan, cofounder of Posterous, lists 12 lessons for scaling that apply to
more than just Rails.Use cloud storage for static files.Use HTTP Cache Control
to tell the browser what it can cache.Use Sphinx for text search.Use InnoDB
for more crash resistant and faster writes.Don't use textbook Rails
ActiveRecord objects. Use New Relic to find exactly what is slow in your
system.Use memcache later so you find your database bottlenecks now.Use
mongrel proctitle to find your slow queries. You are only as fast as your
slowest queries.Use asynchronous job queuing to do work in parallel.Use
monitoring so you'll know when your site went down and why.Learn by reading
the source code, fixing problems, and submitting them back to the
community.Use new plugins. Old plugins can't be trusted.Use new information.
Old information can't be trusted.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.82189018 <a title="1044-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-19-Zynga%27s_Z_Cloud_-_Scale_Fast_or_Fail_Fast_by_Merging_Private_and_Public_Clouds.html">1044 high scalability-2011-05-19-Zynga's Z Cloud - Scale Fast or Fail Fast by Merging Private and Public Clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Release early and often. A/B testing. Creating a landing page and buying ads
on AdSense. All are ways of providing quick feedback in order to validate an
idea. If you are like Zynga, with 250 million active users a month, how do you
cost effectively prove out a game that could flop or get 90 million users
(like CityVille) in an instant?Zynga handles this problem inlle an innovative
way, by inverting the typical cloud burst scenario that has excess traffic
flowing from a datacenter to a cloud, to having a game start in the cloud and
then moving to the datacenter once the game has proved popular enough to
keep.This process is nicely described by Charles Babcock in Lessons From
FarmVille: How Zynga Uses The Cloud, in an interview with Allan Leinwand, CTO
of infrastructure engineering at Zynga.When paired down to its essence,
Zynga's strategy goes something like this:Games are risky.  Even with all
their experience, Zynga can't know how many people will play a game or how
fast the adoption</p><p>3 0.80694091 <a title="1044-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad_Architecture.html">68 high scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TypePad is considered the largest paid blogging service in the world. After
experience problems because of their meteoric growth, they eventually
transitioned to an architecture patterned after their sister company,
LiveJournal.Site: http://www.typepad.com/The

250mbps of traffic using multiple network pipes for 3TB of traffic a day. They
were growing by 10-20% each month. I was unable to find more recent
statistics.The ArchitectureOriginal Architecture:- Single server running
Linux, Apache, Postgres, Perl, mod_perl- Storage was NFS on a filer.A

data across all RAID disks.- The database was corrupted and the backups were

<p>Introduction: This paper is a great overview of different lightweight web servers. A lot of
websites use lightweight web servers to serve images and static content.
YouTube is one example:YouTube Architecture.breakSo if you need to improve
performance consider changing over a different web server for some types of
content.Overview:Recent years have enjoyed a florescence of interesting
implementations of Web servers, including lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel,
among others. These Web servers boast different combinations of performance,
ease of administration, portability, security, and related values. The
following engineering study surveys the field of lightweight Web servers to
help you find one likely to meet the technical requirements of your next
project."Lightweight" Web servers like lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel can
offer dramatic benefits for your projects. This article surveys the
possibilities and shows how they apply to you.Important dimensions for
evaluation of a Web server include:Per</p><p>5 0.80049038 <a title="1044-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-25-How_do_you_explain_cloud_computing_to_your_grandma%3F.html">325 high scalability-2008-05-25-How do you explain cloud computing to your grandma?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Nice introductory New York Time's articleCloud Computing: So You
Don’t Have to Stand Still. Good example of how Animoto used RightScale and
Amazon to meet a Facebook driven demand of 25,000 test drives an hour.Update:
Peter Laird inUnderstanding the Cloud Computing/SaaS/PaaS markets: a Map of
the Players in the Industrypaints a very cool visual map of all the cloud
service players. It's a larger industry than you might think.Once upon a time
I worked at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch startup. Over a
delicious Christmas punch my grandma asked me what I did for a living that I
could afford such extravagantly inexpensive gifts. Always so subtle. I
explained I worked on an ATM switch. Mistake. She sniffed, said that's nice,
and asked me why the Automated Teller Machine ate her bank card that morning.
No matter how hard I tried I couldn't convince her I didn't work on bank ATMs.
To all future job interrogations I waxed off, protesting I do boring software

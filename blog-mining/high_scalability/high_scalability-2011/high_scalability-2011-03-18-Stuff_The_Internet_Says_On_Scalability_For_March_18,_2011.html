<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg   , the first paid employee at reddit, teaches us a lot about how to create a successful social site in a really good talk he gave at the RAMP conference. Watch it here at  Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion–Pitfalls and Lessons .  
 
 Jeremy uses a virtue and sin approach. Examples of the mistakes made in scaling reddit are shared and it turns out they did a lot of good stuff too. Somewhat of a shocker is that   Jeremy is now a Reliability Architect at Netflix, so we get a little Netflix perspective thrown in for free. 
 
 Some of the lessons that stood out most for me:  
  
  Think of SSDs as cheap RAM, not expensive disk . When reddit moved from spinning disks to SSDs for the database the number of servers was reduced from 12 to 1 with a ton of headroom. SSDs are 4x more expensive but you get 16x the performance. Worth the cost.  
  Give users a little bit of power, see what they do with it, and turn the good stuff into features .

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors, attended the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto  NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid, InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came from the audience, which was refreshing. 
 
Overall a genial evening with some good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at giving a wide ra</p><p>4 0.12985922 <a title="1007-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.
 
Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to sol</p><p>5 0.11505212 <a title="1007-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-05-How_will_memristors_change_everything%3F_.html">823 high scalability-2010-05-05-How will memristors change everything? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: A non-random sample of my tech friends shows that not many have heard of  memristors  (though I do suspect vote tampering). I'd read a little about memristors in  2008  when the initial hubbub about the existence of memristors was raised. I, however,  immediately filed them into that comforting conceptual bucket of potentially revolutionary technologies I didn't have to worry about because like most wondertech, nothing would ever come of it. Wrong. After watching  Finding the   Missing  Memristor  by R. Stanley Williams I've had to change my mind. Memristors have gone from "maybe never" to holy cow this could happen soon and it could change everything.
 
Let's assume for the sake of dreaming memristors do prove out. How will we design systems when we have access to a new material that is two orders of magnitude more efficient from a power perspective than traditional transistor technologies, contains multiple petabits (1 petabit = 128TB) of persistent storage, and can be reconfigured t</p><p>6 0.1109927 <a title="1007-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-01-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_1%2C_2011.html">1015 high scalability-2011-04-01-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 1, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are hired at many software companies...   Agency  : So sorry you had to wait in the reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?  Applicant  : I drive a 2008 Subaru.  Agency  : That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent you.  Applicant  : That's OK. Any car will do.  Agency  : No, we can only take on clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way. There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take a chance.  Applicant  : I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.87925631 <a title="1007-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_18%2C_2011.html">1007 high scalability-2011-03-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 18, 2011</a></p>

 The cloud is falling. Or at least shared networked storage as Reddit has a couple of long periods of downtime.  Good write up at Why reddit was down for 6 of the last 24 hours.  Upshot: Reddit is moving off EBS to local disks.

<p>Introduction: This is an email interview with   Viktor Klang   , Director of Engineering at    Typesafe   , on the    Scala Futures    model &    Akka,    both topics on which is he is immensely passionate and knowledgeable.  
 
How do you structure your application? That’s the question I explored in the article  Beyond Threads And Callbacks . An option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.
   To remedy my oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe’s Viktor Klang, long time Scala hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He’s a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about. 
   I’ve implemented several Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO, service orchestration, failover, etc, so I’m innately skeptical about frameworks that remove control from the programmer at</p><p>4 0.85054904 <a title="1007-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-31-Read_HighScalability_on_Your_Mobile_Phone_Using_WidSets_Widgets.html">293 high scalability-2008-03-31-Read HighScalability on Your Mobile Phone Using WidSets Widgets</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his picture), in  I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything , reveals the stack used for building Google+:
  Our stack is pretty standard fare for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily most people don't run</p><p>6 0.81574667 <a title="1007-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-28-A_Practical_Guide_to_Varnish_-_Why_Varnish_Matters.html">996 high scalability-2011-02-28-A Practical Guide to Varnish - Why Varnish Matters</a></p>

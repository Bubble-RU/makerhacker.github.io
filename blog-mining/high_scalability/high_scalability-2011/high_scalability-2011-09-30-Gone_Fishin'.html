<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

you, please write something.My connectivity in Italy will probably be good, so
I will check in and approve articles on a regular basis. Ciao...</p><p>3 0.70979428 <a title="1128-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-23-Gone_Fishin%27_2014.html">1653 high scalability-2014-05-23-Gone Fishin' 2014</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Well, not exactly Fishin', but I'll be on a month long vacation starting
today.I won't be posting new content, so we'll all have a break.
Disappointing, I know.If you've ever wanted to write an article for
HighScalability this would be a great time :-) I'd be very interested in your
experiences with containers vs VMs if you have some thoughts on the subject.So
if the spirit moves you, please write something.See you on down the road...</p><p>4 0.62691712 <a title="1128-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-30-Paper%3A_GargantuanComputing%E2%80%94GRIDs_and_P2P.html">374 high scalability-2008-08-30-Paper: GargantuanComputing—GRIDs and P2P</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found the discussion of the available bandwidth of tree vs higher
dimensional virtual networks topologies quite, to quote Spock,fascinating:A
mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developersof
Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that
theGnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,
theNapster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network
isseverely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a
millionpeers. In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have
overlooked theintrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the
Gnutella network:a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the
definition).Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher
dimensionaltopologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of
interconnectiontopologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware
implementations(see, e.g., Culler et al. 1996; Buyya 1999</p><p>5 0.53387582 <a title="1128-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-05-5_Ways_to_Make_Cloud_Failure_Not_an_Option.html">1367 high scalability-2012-12-05-5 Ways to Make Cloud Failure Not an Option</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With cloud SLAs generally being worth what you don't pay for them, what can
you do to protect yourself? Sean Hull inAirBNB didn't have to fail  has some
solid advice on how to deal with outages:Use Redundancy. Make database and
webserver tiers redundant using multi-az or alternately read-replicas. Have a
browsing only mode. Give users a read-only version of your site. Users may not
even notice failures as they will only see problems when they need to perform
a write operation.Web Applications need Feature Flags. Build in the ability to
turn off and on major parts of your site and flip the switch when problems
arise.Consider Netflix's Simian. By randomly causing outages in your
application you can continually test your failover and redundancy
infrastructure.Use multiple clouds. Use Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Clouds
as a way of surviving outages in any one particular cloud.None of these are
easy and it's worth considering that your application may not need them at
all.

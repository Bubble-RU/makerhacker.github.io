<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: So much good stuff this week...Adrian Cockcroft Compares NoSQL Availability
Models. Let's risk feeding the CAP trolls, and try to get some insight into
the differences between the many NoSQL contenders. Adrian asks how each NoSQL
product will add a movie to its favorites list, read it back, and how this
works across availability zones. Much trickier than it sounds with multiple
writers. Cassandra and MongoDB answer back.Stuff the Internet Says:@jerng:
Reading up on scalability. WHY THE HELL FOR? Because I want to know the
future.@freerangedata: The #nosql options are the micro brews/craft beers of
data stores. So many good ones, so little time to try them
all.@edward_ribeiro: Soon, Darwinism will start to play its role on #NoSQL
systems. You know, only the fittest will survive.@connectionreq: I'm always
wowed when I hear how Facebook abuses their MySQL databases in crazy
ways@louismrose: This is the kind of scalability we should be working on...

<p>Introduction: SmugMug's CEO & Chief Geek Don MacAskill smugly (hard to resist) gushes over
finally finding, after a long and arduous quest, their "best bang-for-the-buck
storage array." It's theDell MD300. His in-depth explanation of why he prefers
the MD3000 should help anyone with their own painful storage deliberations.
His key points are:breakThe price is right; DAS via SAS, 15 spindles at 15K
rpm each, 512MB of mirrored battery-backed write cache; You can disable read
caching; You can disable read-ahead prefetching; The stripe sizes are
configurable up to 512KB; The controller ignores host-based flush commands by
default; They support an ‘Enhanced JBOD’ mode.His reasoning for the
desirability each option is astute and he even gives you the configuration
options for carrying out the configuration. This is not your average CEO.Don
also speculates that a three tier system using flash (system RAM + flash
storage + RAID disks) is a possible future direction. Unfortunately, flash may
not be the dream</p><p>3 0.86090523 <a title="1036-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-10-Paper%3A_Consensus_Protocols%3A_Paxos___.html">529 high scalability-2009-03-10-Paper: Consensus Protocols: Paxos   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Barbara Liskov's Turing Award, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance.Henry
Robinson has created an excellent series of articles on consensus protocols.
We already covered his2 Phase Commitarticle and he also has a3 Phase
Commitarticle showing how to handle 2PC under single node failures.But that is
not enough! 3PC works well under node failures, but fails for network
failures. So another consensus mechanism is needed that handles both network
and node failures. And that'sPaxos.Paxos correctly handles both types of
failures, but it does this by becoming inaccessible if too many components
fail. This is the "liveness" property of protocols. Paxos waits until the
faults are fixed. Read queries can be handled, but updates will be blocked
until the protocol thinks it can make forward progress.The liveness of Paxos
is primarily dependent on network stability. In a distributed heterogeneous
environment you are at risk of losing the ability to make updates. Users hate
that.breakSo when compani</p><p>4 0.85741687 <a title="1036-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_18%2C_2013.html">1389 high scalability-2013-01-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 18, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Mark Travis, Founder ofInfiniSQL.InfiniSQL is the
specific "Infinitely Scalable RDBMS" to which the title refers. It is free
software, and instructions for getting, building, running and testing it are
available in theguide.Benchmarkingshows that an InfiniSQL cluster can handle
over 500,000 complex transactions per second with over 100,000 simultaneous
connections, all on twelve small servers. The methods used to test are
documented, and the code is all available so that any practitioner can achieve
similar results. There are two main characteristics which make InfiniSQL
extraordinary:It performs transactions with records on multiple nodes better
than any clustered/distributed RDBMSIt is free, open source. Not just a teaser
"community" version with the good stuff proprietary. The community version of
InfiniSQL will also be the enterprise version, when it is ready.InfiniSQL is
still in early stages of development--it already has many capabilities, but

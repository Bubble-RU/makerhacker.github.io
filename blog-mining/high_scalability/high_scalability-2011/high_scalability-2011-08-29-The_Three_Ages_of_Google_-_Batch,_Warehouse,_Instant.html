 Abstract from the paper:
  

The operating systems community has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it will be up to us to ﬁnish</p><p>3 0.27109984 <a title="1107-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-12-Google%3A_Taming_the_Long_Latency_Tail_-_When_More_Machines_Equals_Worse_Results.html">1207 high scalability-2012-03-12-Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail - When More Machines Equals Worse Results</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Likewise the current belief that, in the case of artificial machines the very large and the very small are equally feasible and lasting is a manifest error. Thus, for example, a small obelisk or column or other solid figure can certainly be laid down or set up without danger of breaking, while the large ones will go to pieces under the slightest provocation, and that purely on account of their own weight. -- Galileo  
Galileo observed how things broke if they were naively scaled up. Interestingly, Google noticed a similar pattern when building larger software systems using the same techniques used to build smaller systems. 
 
 Luiz André Barroso , Distinguished Engineer at Google, talks about this fundamental property of scaling systems in his fascinating talk,  Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering the Teenage Decade . Google found the larger the scale the greater the impact of latency variability.

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking  The Datacenter as a Computer  book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!
 
John Fries in a  G+ comment  has what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the book:
  

It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter anymore

  
It's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware; datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key challenge</p><p>5 0.15484616 <a title="1107-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a  People of ACM  interview with  Sanjay Ghemawat , a Google Fellow in the Systems Infrastructure Group (MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, GFS, etc), talks about a few interesting aspects of Google's culture.
  What Made Google Google  
Progress is a modern idea. The conviction that future can be changed for the better through individual advancement and action has over hundreds of years driven an exponential growth in the technome.
 
What drives progress? Challenges. Individuals finding and defeating a challenge. There's usually something someone wants to do so badly that they put in the effort, the thought, and the money into solving all the problems. The results are often something new and amazing.
 
And so it was for Google:
  

The main motivation behind the development of much of Google's infrastructure was the challenge of keeping up with ever-growing data sets.

  Our stack is pretty standard fare for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily most people don't run</p><p>6 0.76645339 <a title="1107-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-30-Strategy%3A_Use_Your_Quantum_Computer_Lab_to_Tell_Intentional_Blinks_from_Involuntary_Blinks.html">1540 high scalability-2013-10-30-Strategy: Use Your Quantum Computer Lab to Tell Intentional Blinks from Involuntary Blinks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since  The Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  was published we've a had few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their  Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East Region . Netlix shared their  Lessons Learned from the AWS Outage  as did Heroku ( How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage ), Smug Mug ( How SmugMug survived the Amazonpocalypse ), and SimpleGeo ( How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS Downtime ). 
 
The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to talk about the event itself.
 
 Lesson for crisis handlers : deep dive post-mortems that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention.</p><p>2 0.90811127 <a title="1107-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-25-The_Big_List_of_Articles_on_the_Amazon_Outage.html">1029 high scalability-2011-04-25-The Big List of Articles on the Amazon Outage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Please see  The Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  for a new improved list. 
 
So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage. Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change remains...cloudy.
 
I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's a resource you think should be added, just let me know.

<p>Introduction: The world has changed. And some things that should not have been forgotten, were lost.  I found these words from the Lord of the Rings echoing in my head as I listened to a fascinating presentation by  Luiz André Barroso , Distinguished Engineer at Google, concerning Google's legendary past, golden present, and apocryphal future. His talk,  Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering the Teenage Decade , was given at the  Federated Computing Research Conference . Luiz clearly knows his stuff and was early at Google, so he has a deep and penetrating perspective on the technology. There's much to learn from, think about, and build.
 
Lord of the Rings applies at two levels. At the change level, Middle Earth went through  three ages . While listening to Luiz talk, it seems so has Google: Batch (indexes calculated every month), Warehouse (the datacenter is the computer), and Instant (make it all real-time). At the "what was forgot" level, in the Instant Age section of the talk,  a common theme was</p><p>4 0.88306695 <a title="1107-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-29-Strategy%3A_Sample_to_Reduce_Data_Set.html">311 high scalability-2008-04-29-Strategy: Sample to Reduce Data Set</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Arjen  links to video  Supporting Scalable Online Statistical Processing  which shows "rather than doing complete aggregates, use statistical sampling to provide a reasonable estimate (unbiased guess) of the result."  When you have a lot of data,  sampling  allows you to draw conclusions from a much smaller amount of data. That's why sampling is a scalability solution. If you don't have to process all your data to get the information you need then you've made the problem smaller and you'll need fewer resources and you'll get more timely results.
   
 Sampling is not useful when you need a complete list that matches a specific criteria. If you need to know the exact set of people who bought a car in the last week then sampling won't help.  But, if you want to know many people bought a car then you could take a sample and then create estimate of the full data-set. The difference is you won't really know the exact car count. You'll have a confidence interval saying how confident</p><p>5 0.88055325 <a title="1107-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-21-Hot_Holiday_Scalability_Links_for_2009.html">753 high scalability-2009-12-21-Hot Holiday Scalability Links for 2009</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud .  The only independent platform most of us will have access to capable of hosting planet-scale applications is the Ambient Cloud. It forms a sort of digital potluck where everyone contributes memory, network, and other compute resources from whatever they happen to have available.   
  Top 10 Internet Startup Scalability Killers . Strategies taken from  The Art of Scalability .  1. Thinking Scalability Is Just About Technology; 2. Overuse of Synchronous Calls; 3. Failure to Weed or Seed Soon Enough; 4. Inappropriate Use of Databases; 5. Cesspools Instead of Swim Lanes; 6. Reliance on Vertical Scale; 7. Failure to Learn from History; 8. Changing Development Methodologies to Fix Problems; 9. Too Little Caching, Too Late; 10. Overreliance on Third Parties to Scale.

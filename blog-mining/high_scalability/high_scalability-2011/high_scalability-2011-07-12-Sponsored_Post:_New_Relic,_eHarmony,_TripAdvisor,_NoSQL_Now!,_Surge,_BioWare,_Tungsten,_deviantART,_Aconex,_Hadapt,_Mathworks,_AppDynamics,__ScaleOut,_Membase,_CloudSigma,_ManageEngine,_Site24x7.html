<p>Introduction: This website has been a great resource for helping me to understand the
successful (and failed) scalable network designs from organizations that have
actually done it, but I haven't seen any explicite explanations about secure
remote administration of these systems.I understand that the *nix people love
to SSH, and the windows gang has their RDP, but how does one go about creating
a network architecture that both allows one to manage their systems and does
its best to avoid hacker interest? As I imagine, no big website will have the
SSH/RDP/FTP ports open on the web server, so how is it that they go about
remotely administering their geographically diverse groups of servers
securely?</p><p>2 0.93513209 <a title="1079-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-28-Sponsored_Post%3A_Surge%2C_BioWare%2C_Tungsten%2C_deviantART%2C_Aconex%2C_Hadapt%2C_Mathworks%2C_AppDynamics%2C__ScaleOut%2C_Membase%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1069 high scalability-2011-06-28-Sponsored Post: Surge, BioWare, Tungsten, deviantART, Aconex, Hadapt, Mathworks, AppDynamics,  ScaleOut, Membase, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

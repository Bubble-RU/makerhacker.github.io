<p>Introduction: Jonathan Ellis reviews in theNoSQL Ecosystem the origin of the NoSQL movement
and 10 different NoSQL products and how their 1) support for multiple
datacenters,  2) the ability to add new machines to a live cluster
transparently to the your applications, 3) Data Model, 4) Query API, 5)
Persistence Design. The 10 systems reviewed are: Cassandra, CouchDB, HBase,
MongoDB, Neo4J, Redis, Riak, Scalaris, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort.A very
thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the
article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of
approaches to not being a relational database.Related ArticlesNOSQL = Not Only

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Read/WriteWeb has a good article talking about the scalability
issues of relational databases and how Dynamo solves them:Amazon Dynamo: The
Next Generation Of Virtual Distributed Storage. But since Dynamo is just
another frustrating walled garden protected by barbed wire and guard dogs, its
relevance is somewhat overstated.Update:Greg Lindenhas a take on the paper
where he questions some of Amazon's design choices: emphasizing write
availability over fast reads, a lack of indexing support, use of random
distribution for load balancing, and punting on some scalability issues.Werner
Vogels, Amazon's avuncular CTO, just announced a newpaperon the internal
database technology Amazon uses to handle tens of millions customers. I'll
dive into more details later, but I thought you'd want to read it hot off the
blog. The bad news is it won't be a service. They are keeping this tech not so
secret, but very safe. Happily, it's another real-life example to learn from.

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>3 0.78598201 <a title="1022-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-03-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_March_3%2C_2010.html">787 high scalability-2010-03-03-Hot Scalability Links for March 3, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source.
There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity:
from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-
value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there's Riak, Tokyo Cabinet,
Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL
products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft
Windows. I'm going to outline what's available now and briefly touch on some
opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.You

<p>Introduction: Christof Strauch, from Stuttgart Media University, has written an incredible
120+ page paper titledNoSQL Databases as an introduction and overview to NoSQL
databases . The paper was written between 2010-06 and 2011-02, so it may be a
bit out of date, but if you are looking to take in the NoSQL world in one big
gulp, this is your chance. I asked Christof to give us a  short taste of what
he was trying to accomplish in his paper:The paper aims at giving a systematic
and thorough introduction and overview of the NoSQL field by assembling
information dispersed among blogs, wikis and scientific papers. It firstly
discusses reasons, rationales and motives for the development and usage of
nonrelational database systems. These can be summarized by the need for high
scalability, the processing of large amounts of data, the ability to
distribute data among many (often commodity) servers, consequently a
distribution-aware design of DBMSs.The paper then introduces fundamental
concepts, techniques</p><p>2 0.82501304 <a title="1022-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-25-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_25%2C_2013.html">1394 high scalability-2013-01-25-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 25, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>4 0.79021406 <a title="1022-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-15-How_Google%27s_Instant_Previews_Reduces_HTTP_Requests.html">941 high scalability-2010-11-15-How Google's Instant Previews Reduces HTTP Requests</a></p>

Strategy: Biggest Performance Impact Is To Reduce The Number Of HTTP Requests
and one of the major ideas behind the design Instant Previews is to reduce the
number of HTTP requests through a few well chosen tricks. Cosmic!Some of what
Google does to reduce HTTP requests:Data URIs, which are are base64 encodings
of image data, are used instead of static images that are served from the
server. This means the whole preview can be pieced together from image slices
in one request as both the data and the image are returned in the same
request. Google found thateven though base64 encoding adds about 33% to the
size of the image, tests showed that gzip-compressed data URIs are comparable
in size to the o</p><p>5 0.71416432 <a title="1022-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-09-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_9%2C_2010.html">854 high scalability-2010-07-09-Hot Scalability Links for July 9, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>3 0.11660098 <a title="1097-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-05-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_November_5th%2C_2010.html">935 high scalability-2010-11-05-Hot Scalability Links For November 5th, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With over 15 billion page views a month Tumblr has become an insanely popular
blogging platform. Users may like Tumblr for its simplicity, its beauty, its
strong focus on user experience, or its friendly and engaged community, but
like it they do.Growing at over 30% a month has not been without challenges.
Some reliability problems among them. It helps to realize that Tumblr operates
at surprisingly huge scales: 500 million page views a day, a peak rate of ~40k
requests per second, ~3TB of new data to store a day, all running on 1000+
servers.One of the common patterns across successful startups is the perilous
chasm crossing from startup to wildly successful startup. Finding people,
evolving infrastructures, servicing old infrastructures, while handling huge
month over month increases in traffic, all with only four engineers, means you
have to make difficult choices about what to work on. This was Tumblr's
situation. Now with twenty engineers there's enough energy to work on issues

Garlapati has some great strategies for going even faster: Avoid synchronous
code; Turn off socket pooling;  Don't use Node.js for static assets; Render on

<p>Introduction: Erasure codesare one of those seemingly magical mathematical creations that
with the developments described in the paper XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure
Codes for Big Data, are set to replace triple replication as the data storage
protection mechanism of choice.The result says Robin Harris (StorageMojo) in
an excellent article, Facebook's advanced erasure codes: "WebCos will be able
to store massive amounts of data more efficiently than ever before. Bad news:
so will anyone else."Robin says with cheap disks triple replication made sense
and was economical. With ever bigger BigData the overhead has become costly.
But erasure codes have always suffered from unacceptably long time to repair
times. This paper describes new Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) that are
efficiently repairable in disk I/O and bandwidth requirements:These systems
are now designed to survive the loss of up to four storage elements - disks,
servers, nodes or even entire data centers - without losing any data. What is</p><p>5 0.8561883 <a title="1097-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Product%3A_NetApp_MetroCluster_Software.html">28 high scalability-2007-07-25-Product: NetApp MetroCluster Software</a></p>
<p>Introduction: NetApp MetroCluster SoftwareCost-effective is an integrated high-availability
storage cluster and site failover capability.NetApp MetroCluster is an
integrated high-availability and disaster recovery solution that can reduce
system complexity and simplify management while ensuring greater return on
investment. MetroCluster uses clustered server technology to replicate data
synchronously between sites located miles apart, eliminating data loss in case
of a disruption. Simple and powerful recovery process minimizes downtime, with
little or no user action required.At one company I worked at they used the
NetApp snap mirror feature to replicate data across long distances to multiple
datacenters. They had a very fast backbone and it worked well. The issue with
NetApp is always one of cost, but if you can afford it, it's a good option.</p><p>6 0.80709529 <a title="1097-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_11%2C_2011.html">1141 high scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 11, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere

<p>Introduction: Khan Academyis a non profit company started bySalman Khanwith the Big Hairy
Audacious Goal of providing a free, world class education to anyone, anywhere,
anytime. That's a lot of knowledge. Having long been inspired and captivated
by the Khan Academy, I was really curious to know how they plan to do it.Ben
Kamens, lead developer at Khan Academy, gives the somewhat surprising answer
in an interview:How to Scale your Startup to Millions of Users.Theshort
answer: develop a strong team, focus on features, letGoogle App Enginedo the
heavy lifting.Some people seem to be turned off by all the GAE love in the
interview. Part of it is that the interviewer is Fred Sauer, Developer
Advocate for Google App Engine, so there's a level of familiarity between the
two. But the biggest part is simply that they really like GAE, for all the
reasons your are supposed to like GAE. And that's OK. In this day and age you
are free to love whichever platform you choose.Biggest surprise:A profile on

<p>Introduction: With the Chapultepec aqueduct, also namedthe great aqueduct, theAztecsbuilt a
novel uninterruptible water supply for providing fresh water to Tenochtitlan,
their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still
around today: It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built
with high availability in mind. We findengineers being engineers, no matter
the age:It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of
compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the
bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466
AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to
mitigate its thirst.The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of
Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of
the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got
dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe while the dirty pipe was
cleaned</p><p>2 0.93533915 <a title="1106-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_29%2C_2012_-_The_Velocity_Edition.html">1274 high scalability-2012-06-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 29, 2012 - The Velocity Edition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Judging from the tweet flow, Velocitylooked like a riotous good time. In this
video on themain themes at Velocity, after a little microphone enhanced
violence, John Allspaw and Steve Souders identifyresilienceandautomationas two
of the big ideas behind building a faster and stronger web.John says
resiliency is the idea that we we don't live in a perfect world so trying to
build perfect systems is counter productive. We have to accept failure as a
baseline and think in terms of degrees of availability. All abstraction layers
leak so every part of a system must be monitorable and open to introspection.A
focus on resilience means the web is growing up. Resilience has long been a
requirement for "real" systems, it's great to see the web thinking in terms of
the complex systems they've always been. For the Alpha and Omega on resilience
you'll want to watchDr. Richard Cook'sinspiring talk on How Complex Systems
Fail. Here are some of the most enjoyable Quotable Quotes from

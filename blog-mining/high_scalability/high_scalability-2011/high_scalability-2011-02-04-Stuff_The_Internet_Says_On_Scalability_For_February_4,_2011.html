<p>Introduction: Algorithms are moving out of the Platonic realm and are becoming dynamic first
class players in real life. We've seen corporations become people. Algorithms
will likely also follow that path to agency.Kevin Slavin in his intriguing TED
talk: How Algorithms Shape Our World, gives many and varied examples of how
algorithms have penetrated RL. One of his most interesting examples is from a
highly technical paper on Relativistic statistical arbitrage, which says to
make money on markets you have to be where the people are, the red dots (on
the diagram below), which means you have to put servers where the blue dots
are, many of which are in the ocean. Here's the diagram from the paper:Mr.
Slavin neatly sums this up by saying:And it's not the money that's so
interesting actually. It's what the money motivates, thatwe're actually
terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency. And in
that light, you go back and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs, and you

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this beautiful morning:  Group Decision
Making in Honey Bee Swarms. In distributed computing systems nodes reach
aquorum when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum
logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:
A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act
and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow
the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether
they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating
the swarm's move to this site.Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.
Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being
a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.Fire! Fire!
Brent Chapman shows how to put that IT fire out in Incident Command for IT:

<p>Introduction: The Future of the Parallelism and its ChallengesResearch and education in
Parallel computing technologies is more important than ever. Here I present a
perspective on the past contributions, current status, and future direction of
the parallelism technologies.While machine power will grow impressively,
increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be driving force in
computing in the foreseeable future. This ongoing shift toward parallel
architectural paradigms is one of the greatest challenges for the
microprocessor and software industries. In 2005, Justin Ratter, chief
technology officer of Intel Corporation, said â€˜We are at the cusp of a
transition to multicore, multithreaded architectures, and we still have not
demonstrated the ease of programming the move will requireâ€¦â€™Key points:A

<p>Introduction: Oh, you don't have a Quantum Computer Lab staffed with researchers? Well,
Google does. Here they areon G+. To learn what they are up to the Verge hasA
first look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab. The lab is partnership
between NASA, Google, and a 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum computer.  One result
from the lab is:The first practical application has been on Google Glass, as
engineers put the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it
to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks. For
engineering reasons, the quantum processor can never be installed in Glass,
but together with Google's conventional server centers, it can point the way
to a better blink-detecting algorithm. That would allow the Glass processor to
detect blinks with better accuracy and using significantly less power. If
successful, it could be an important breakthrough for wink-triggered apps,
which have struggled with the task so far.Google thinksquantum computing has a

<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle, infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made areally interesting
statementabout the economics of scale in the datacenter:We've shown that when
you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared
to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a
factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.My
first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm
crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using
technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency
requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly
automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a
simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper
to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>6 0.76751637 <a title="984-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-10-Webcast%3A_Advanced_Database_High_Availability_and_Scalability_Solutions.html">4 high scalability-2007-07-10-Webcast: Advanced Database High Availability and Scalability Solutions</a></p>

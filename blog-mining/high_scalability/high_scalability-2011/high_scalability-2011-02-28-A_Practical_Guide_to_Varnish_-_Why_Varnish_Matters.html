  What is Varnish?  
 Varnish  is an open source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for both static and dynamic content.
 
One great thing about Varnish is that it can improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.  If you haven’t heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven’t used it), please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive, but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish’s more advanced features, you’ll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block , CTO at  RockThePost.com , a crowdfunding company, has  written a nice set of tips  for smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a small two person development team. 
 
Their service has a typical small scale structure:
  
 PHP's Zend Framework 2 
 Two m1.medium for web servers 
 ELB to split the load 
 master/slave MySQL database 
 Siege for load testing 
  
The very sensible tips that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: 
  
  Use PHP's APC feature . APC is opcode cache that is " really a requirement in order for a website to have a chance at performing well."  
  Put everything that's not a .php request on a CDN . Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused them to serve directly from S3. 
  Don't make connections to other servers in your PHP code . Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down processing. Use the APC k</p><p>4 0.14424789 <a title="996-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-28-6_Strategies_for_Scaling_BBC_iPlayer.html">908 high scalability-2010-09-28-6 Strategies for Scaling BBC iPlayer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The BBC's iPlayer site averages 8 million page views a day for 1.3 million users. Technical Architect Simon Frost describes how they scaled their site in   Scaling the BBC iPlayer to handle demand :
  
  Use frameworks . Frameworks support component based development which makes it convenient for team development, but can introduce delays that have to be minimized. Zend/PHP is used because it supports components and is easy to recruit for.Â  MySQL is used for program metadata. CouchDB is used for key-value access for fast read/write of user-focused data. 
  Prove architecture before building it . Eliminate guesswork by coming up with alternate architectures and create prototypes to determine which option works best. Balance performance with factors like ease of development.  
  Cache a lot . Data is cached in memcached for a few seconds to minutes. Short cache invalidation periods keep the data up to date for the users, but even these short periods make a huge difference in performance.</p><p>5 0.13764232 <a title="996-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-13-What%27s_your_scalability_plan%3F.html">248 high scalability-2008-02-13-What's your scalability plan?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you plan to scale your system as you reach predictable milestones? This topic came up in another venue and it reminded me about a great comment an Anonymous wrote a while ago and I wanted to make sure that comment didn't get lost.      The Anonymous scaling plan was relatively simple and direct:    My two cents on what I'm using to start a website from scratch using a single server for now. Later, I'll scale out horizontally when the need arises.   Phase 1            Single Server, Dual Quad-Core 2.66, 8gb RAM, 500gb Disk Raid 10   OS: Fedora 8. You could go with pretty much any Linux though. I like Fedora 8 best for servers.   Proxy Cache: Varnish - it is way faster than Squid per my own benchmarks. Squid chokes bigtime.   Web Server: Lighttpd - faster than Apache 2 and easier to configure for me.   Object Cache: Memcached. Very scalable.   PHP Cache: APC. Easy to configure and seems to work fine.   Language: PHP 5 - no bloated frameworks, waste of time for me.

<p>Introduction: Performance guru  Steve Souders  gave his keynote presentation,  Cache is King!  ( slides ), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results on what gave the best web site performance improvements.
 
In his base line test, page loads took 7.65 seconds (median of three runs). What change--Fast Network, No Javascript, or Primed Cache--would make the biggest performance improvement? It was Primed Cache.
  
 Fast Network - Using a fast FIOS network the load time was 4.13 seconds. Steve was surprised how big a difference this made, given how much work must happen in the browser.  
 No JavaScript - 4.74 seconds after disabling JavaScript. Both reduces transfers and skips parsing by the browser. Steve thought the effect would have been larger.

<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites to  cache everything ? Caching, if not the  secret sauce  of many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But not so fast says Peter Zaitsev in  Beyond great cache hit ratio . The point Peter makes is that we read about websites like  Amazon  and  Facebook  that can literally make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all those requests takes time. The solution is to  remove requests all together . You do this by  caching larger blocks  so you have to make fewer requests. 
 
The post has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>5 0.67533118 <a title="996-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-26-Strategy%3A_Caching_404s_Saved_the_Onion_66%25_on_Server_Time.html">800 high scalability-2010-03-26-Strategy: Caching 404s Saved the Onion 66% on Server Time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the article  The  Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us , a lot of interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5  second procedure; capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem; memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10 minutes; videos, ar</p><p>6 0.66966277 <a title="996-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-27-Handle_700_Percent_More_Requests_Using_Squid_and_APC_Cache.html">662 high scalability-2009-07-27-Handle 700 Percent More Requests Using Squid and APC Cache</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jeff Su  from Factual. 
 
 
  What is Varnish?  
 Varnish  is an open source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for both static and dynamic content.
 
One great thing about Varnish is that it can improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.  If you haven’t heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven’t used it), please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive, but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish’s more advanced features, you’ll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.
 
Some of the high profile companies using Varnish include:  Twitter ,  Facebook ,  Heroku  and  LinkedIn .
  Our Use Case  
One of Factual’s first high profile projects was  Newsweek’s “America’s Best High Schools: The List” .

<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source. There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity: from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there’s Riak, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft Windows. I’m going to outline what’s available now and briefly touch on some opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are hired at many software companies...   Agency  : So sorry you had to wait in the reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?  Applicant  : I drive a 2008 Subaru.  Agency  : That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent you.  Applicant  : That's OK. Any car will do.  Agency  : No, we can only take on clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way. There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take a chance.  Applicant  : I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt.</p><p>4 0.68183166 <a title="996-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-18-The_Clever_Ways_Chrome_Hides_Latency_by_Anticipating_Your_Every_Need.html">1267 high scalability-2012-06-18-The Clever Ways Chrome Hides Latency by Anticipating Your Every Need</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ilya Grigorik has written another wonderful article lavishly detailing the extraordinary tactics Chrome employs to hide network latency from users:  Chrome Networking: DNS Prefetch & TCP Preconnect . Ilya springs some surpising factoids on us, revealing how the web has slowed and super sized:
  
 The size of an average page has grown to 1059kB and is now composed of over  80 subresource requests . 
 An average DNS lookup takes between 60 and 120ms. This creates a 100-200ms of latency before a request can be sent because of th full round-trip (RTT) to perform the TCP handshake. 
 Slow mobile experiences are largely due to the much higher RTT's (200-1000ms) on wireless networks. Reducing the number of outbound connections and the total byte size of your pages is the single best optimization you can make for mobile today.  
  
Chrome reduces apparent latency using a host of clever anticipatory mechanisms:
  
 Learns the network topology as you use it via a Predictor object that anticipate</p><p>5 0.67995119 <a title="996-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-31-Read_HighScalability_on_Your_Mobile_Phone_Using_WidSets_Widgets.html">293 high scalability-2008-03-31-Read HighScalability on Your Mobile Phone Using WidSets Widgets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jean-Paul de Vooght of our Switzerland contingent created a nifty little WidSets widget that lets you better read HighScalability from your mobile phone. I thought untethered readers might like to give it a try. Thanks to Jean-Paul for making it available!     WidSets is:   a simple service that brings you information normally accessed via the Internet by sending it directly to your mobile phone . Using mini-applications called widgets, it sends you the latest updates to your favorite websites. The system uses RSS feeds to push information from these websites directly to your mobile phone the minute theyâ&euro;&trade;re updated  .</p><p>6 0.67168182 <a title="996-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-08-Typesafe_Interview%3A_Scala_%2B_Akka_is_an_IaaS_for_Your_Process_Architecture.html">1454 high scalability-2013-05-08-Typesafe Interview: Scala + Akka is an IaaS for Your Process Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.   It's 2008: C</p><p>4 0.13932586 <a title="1015-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors, attended the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto  NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid, InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came from the audience, which was refreshing. 
 
Overall a genial evening with some good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at giving a wide ra</p><p>5 0.13789856 <a title="1015-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-12-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_12%2C_2013.html">1439 high scalability-2013-04-12-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 12, 2013</a></p>

 Quotable quotes:             
 
  @karmafile : "Scalability" is a much more evil word than we make it out to be 
  @ostaquet : More hardware won't solve #SQL resp. time issues; proper indexing does. 
  @datachick : All computing technology is the rearrangement of data. Data is the center of the universe 
 ‏ @jamesurquhart : "Complexity is a characteristic of the system, not of the parts in it." 
 
 
 Data is the star of the cat walk, looking fierce in Ilya Katsov's impeccably constructed post on  NoSQL Data Modeling Techniques : In this article I provide a short comparison of NoSQL system families from the data modeling point of view and digest several common modeling techniques.  
 Peter Burns  talks computer nanosecond time scales  as a human might experience them. Your memory == computer registers , L1 cache == papers kept close by, L2 cache == books, RAM == the library down the street, and going to disk is a 3 year odessy for data.

<p>Introduction: Func  is used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It  targets easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you know what a total nightmare that can be.  Some example commands:
   Using the command line: func "*.example.org" call yumcmd update  Using the Pthon API: import func.overlord.client as fc client = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com") client.yumcmd.update() client.service.start("acme-server") print client.hardware.info()  
  Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than one</p><p>2 0.92892033 <a title="1015-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-02-How_Will_DIDO_Wireless_Networking_Change_Everything%3F.html">1091 high scalability-2011-08-02-How Will DIDO Wireless Networking Change Everything?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A conjunction of a few new technologies may trigger disruptive changes in the future. This observation was prompted by a talk  Steve Perlman  gave at the Columbia Engineering School:  Benjamin Button, Cloud Everything and Why Shannon's Law Isn't . In it he covers a set of technologies that at first may seem unrelated, but turn out to be deeply related after all, culminating in a realization of the long talked about vision of an application utility, where all applications are hosted and run out of the cloud. 
 
First Perlman talks about the realistic human rendering technology developed at Rearden, his research incubator company. This technology was developed over many years and is the secret behind the wonderful effects found in movies like  Benjamin Button . It is now being used in many other films, and promises to revolutionize film making, possibly even replacing actors with computers, in real-time.
 
The next invention at Rearden is  OnLive , a cloud based gaming technology for pla</p><p>3 0.91420257 <a title="1015-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson_from_Airbnb%3A_Give_Yourself_Permission_to_Experiment_with_Non-scalable_Changes.html">1458 high scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson from Airbnb: Give Yourself Permission to Experiment with Non-scalable Changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are stuck drowning in too much data and too many options and are dazzled by all the possibilities of code, here's a helpful bit of advice from Airbnb's rags to riches  origin story :  it's okay to do things that don’t scale . 
 
A corollary is the idea of paying attention to and learning from what your users are actually doing and let that lead you without out that annoying voice in your head second guessing you, yelling but that will never scale! Worry about building something good, then worry about making it scale.
 
In Airbnb's case they noticed people weren't booking rooms because the pictures sucked. So they flew to New York and shot some beautiful images. This is a very non-scalable and non-technical solution. Yet it was the turning point for Airbnb and sparked their climb out of the "trough of sorrow." Previously they had been limited by the Silicon Valley idea that every feature had to be scalable. Not every solution can be found behind a computer screen.

 Quotable Quotes:       
 
  @zateriosystems : thinking about scalability?, are you OK to double your capacity in one week?, a startup should be ready...ready to jump. 
  @sklacy : Maybe what I should have said is "Design for scalability, deploy without it." 
  @MikeHale : Scalability is customer 2000 having the same experience as customer 1 #sqlsat67 
  @LusciousPear : The meaning of #NoSQL is shut up 
  @deobrat : The biggest bottleneck to scalability are ignorant developers. Most don't even try saving extra CPU cycles or memory bytes :( 
  @w_westendorp : . @ijansch : Cloud computing is like outsourcing your scalability problems 
  @edyavno : Billy Newport essentially just affirmed the theme I've been propagating: "Distributed Caching is the enterprise NoSQL" #strangeloop #nosql 
  @monkchips : HP CEO Leo Apotheker says "relational databases are becoming less and less relevant to the future stack"

<p>Introduction: Kevin Clark, director of IT operations for Lucasfilm, discusses how their data center works:   * Linux-based platform, SUSE (looking to change), and a lot of proprietary open source applications for content creation.   * 4,500-processor render farm in the datacenter. Workstations are used off hours.    * Developed their own proprietary scheduler to schedule their 5,500 available processors.   * Render nodes, the blade racks (from Verari), run dual-core dual Opteron chips with 32GB of memory on board, but are expanding those to quad-core. Are an AMD shop.   * 400TB of storage online for production.   * Every night they write out 10-20TB of new data on a render. A project will use up to a hundred-plus terabytes of storage.   * Incremental backups are a challenge because the data changes up to 50 percent over a week.   * NetApps used for storage. They like the global namespace in the virtual file system.   * Foundry Networks architecture shop.

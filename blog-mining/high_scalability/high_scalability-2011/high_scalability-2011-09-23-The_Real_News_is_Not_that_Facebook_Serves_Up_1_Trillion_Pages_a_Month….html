<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things).
That's why scaling Facebook is hardsays Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of
Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and
Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why
would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional
web sites? Let's find out.Traditional websites are easier to scale than social
networking sites for two reasons:They usually access only their own data and
common cached data.Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one
time.Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your
profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the
website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around
single records usingdistributed hashing schemes. And since only a few percent
of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little RAM cache
to handle a</p><p>4 0.22204192 <a title="1123-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Hive_-_A_Petabyte_Scale_Data_Warehouse_using_Hadoop.html">624 high scalability-2009-06-10-Hive - A Petabyte Scale Data Warehouse using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post about using Hive and Hadoop for analytics comes straight from
Facebook engineers.Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the
functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-
engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis and business intelligence applications
used by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook products are also
based on analytics.These products range from simple reporting applications
like Insights for the Facebook Ad Network, to more advanced kind such as
Facebook's Lexicon product.As a result a flexible infrastructure that caters
to the needs of these diverse applications and users and that also scales up
in a cost effective manner with the ever increasing amounts of data being
generated on Facebook, is critical. Hive and Hadoop are the technologies that
we have used to address these requirements at Facebook.Read the rest of the

<p>Introduction: Robert Johnson, a director of engineering at Facebook, celebrated Facebook's
monumental achievement of reaching 500 million users by sharing thescaling
principles that helped reach that milestone. In case you weren't suitably
impressed by the 500 million user number, Robert ratchets up the numbers game
with these impressive figures:1 million users per engineer500 million active
users100 billion hits per day50 billion photos2 trillion objects cached, with
hundreds of millions of requests per second130TB of logs every dayHow did
Facebook get to this point?People Matter Most. It's people who build and run
systems. The best tools for scaling are an engineering and operations teams
that can handle anything.Scale Horizontally. Handling exponentially growing
traffic requires spreading load arbitrarily across many machines. Using
different databases for tables like accounts and profiles only doubles
capacity. This approach hurts efficiency, but efficiency is a separate effort

<p>Introduction: Snabb Switch \- a toolkit for solving novel problems in networking. If you are
building a new packet-processing network appliance then you can use Snabb
Switch to get the job done more quickly.Here's a great impassioned overview
from erichocean:Or, you could just avoid the OS
altogether:https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitchOur current engineering
target is 1 million writes/sec and > 10 million reads/sec on top of an
architecture similar to that, on a single box, to our fully transactional,
MVCC database (write do not block reads, and vice versa) that runs in the same
process (a la SQLite), which we've also merged with our application code and
our caching tier, so we're down to--literally--a single process for what would
have been at least three separate tiers in a traditional setup.The result is

<p>Introduction: How does Facebook handle the massive New Year's Eve traffic spike? Thanks to
Mike Swift, in Facebook gets ready for New Year's Eve, we get a little insight
as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still
interesting.Problem SetupFacebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be
shared on New Year's eve.Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the
world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average
of 130 friends.Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a
homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those
requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then
rendered.Different events put different stresses on different parts of
Facebook. Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of
capacity News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve
Jobs drive user status updatesCoping StrategiesTry to predictthe surge in

<p>Introduction: This post is byHasan Ceylan, an Open Source software enthusiast from
Istanbul.I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together
with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I
contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.Those were the days
our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and
applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot
of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we
can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml
descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to
use the curse called "XDoclet".On the other side, our company grew steadily,
our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and
ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew
considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of
money. The challenge we h</p><p>2 0.96478772 <a title="1123-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-27-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_27%2C_2012.html">1182 high scalability-2012-01-27-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 27, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There's some amount of debate whether Facebookreallycrossed over the one
trillion page view per month threshold. While one report says it did,another
respected firm says it did not; that its monthly page views are a mere 467
billion per month.In the big scheme of things, the discrepancy is somewhat
irrelevant, as neither show thetrueload on Facebook's infrastructure - which
is far more impressive a set of numbers than its externally measured "page
view" metric.  Mashable reported in "Facebook Surpasses 1 Trillion Pageviews
per Month" that the social networking giant saw "approximately 870 million
unique visitors in June and 860 million in July" and followed up with some per
visitor statistics, indicating "each visitor averaged approximately 1,160 page
views in July and 40 per visit -- enormous by any standard. Time spent on the
site was around 25 minutes per user."From an architectural standpoint it's
notjustabout the page views. It's about requests and responses, many of which

<p>Introduction: Web Log Stormingis an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows.
The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any
other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down
to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and
how it fits into your desired scenario.Web Log Storming does far more than
just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with
interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of
activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.In
other words, analyze your web logs like never before!It's easy to track
sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to
each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and
keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the
top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed. You

<p>Introduction: Stanford Info Lab is taking pains to document a direction we've been moving
for a while now, using RAM not just as a cache, but as the primary storage
medium. Manyquality products have built on this model. Even if the vision
isn't radical, the paper does produce a lot of data backing up the transition,
which is in itself helpful. From the The Abstract:Disk-oriented approaches to
online storage are becoming increasingly problematic: they do not scale grace-
fully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications, and improvements in
disk capacity have far out-stripped improvements in access latency and
bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called
RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems
are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity
servers. We believe that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage
with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access
latency. T</p><p>6 0.94124383 <a title="1123-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-09-Paper%3A_Hyder_-_Scaling_Out_without_Partitioning_.html">937 high scalability-2010-11-09-Paper: Hyder - Scaling Out without Partitioning </a></p>

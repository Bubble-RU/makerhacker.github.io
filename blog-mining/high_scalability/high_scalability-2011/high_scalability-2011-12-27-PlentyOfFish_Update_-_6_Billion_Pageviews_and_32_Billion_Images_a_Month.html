Impressive November statistics:
  
 6 billion pageviews served 
 32 billion images served 
 6 million logins i n one day  
 IM servers handle about 30 billion pageviews 
 11 webservers (5 of which could be dropped) 
 Hired first  DBA in July . They currently have a  handful of employees . 
 All hosting/cdn costs  combined are under $70k/month. 
  
 Lesson : small organization, simple architecture, on raw hardware is still plenty profitable for PlentyOfFish.

<p>Introduction: Plenty of Fish  CEO Markus Frind, famous nerd hero for making over $10 million a year from Google ads on a free dating site he made and ran all by himself, now  sees a problem with the free model :
   The problem with free is that every time you double the size of your database the cost of maintaining the site grows 6 fold.  I really underestimated how much resources it would take,  I have one database table now that exceeds  3 billion records.  The bigger you get as a free site the less money you make per visit and the more it costs to service a visit...There is really no money in being free and we have to start  experimenting with other models now or we won’t be able to compete in 3 or 4 years.  
As one commenter succinctly put it: the  “golden time” of AdSense is over . Time to look at costs. The POF architecture is to run scarily huge tables on single machines. They also buy and maintain their own SAN. So it seems scaling up is what is increasing costs and decreasing profits.

<p>Introduction: Memcached  is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.  Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com, a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers. memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the databases on a memcache miss.</p><p>6 0.56313646 <a title="1164-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets_to_Fotolog%27s_Scaling_Success.html">106 high scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This article is a primer, intended to shine some much needed light on the logical, process oriented implementations of database scalability strategies in the form of a broad introduction. More specifically, the intent is to elaborate on the majority of these implementations by example.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.81611568 <a title="1164-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-27-PlentyOfFish_Update_-_6_Billion_Pageviews_and_32_Billion_Images_a_Month.html">1164 high scalability-2011-12-27-PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews and 32 Billion Images a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Markus has a short  update  on their  PlentyOfFish Architecture . Impressive November statistics:
  
 6 billion pageviews served 
 32 billion images served 
 6 million logins i n one day  
 IM servers handle about 30 billion pageviews 
 11 webservers (5 of which could be dropped) 
 Hired first  DBA in July . They currently have a  handful of employees . 
 All hosting/cdn costs  combined are under $70k/month. 
  
 Lesson : small organization, simple architecture, on raw hardware is still plenty profitable for PlentyOfFish.

<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:   My recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid expiration headers) is employ a    reverse proxy    as mentioned in this article.   In the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.  It's trivial to implement for anyone interested...</p><p>4 0.603387 <a title="1164-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>

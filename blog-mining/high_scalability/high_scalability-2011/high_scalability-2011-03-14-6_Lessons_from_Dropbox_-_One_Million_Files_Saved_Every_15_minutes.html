<p>Introduction: If you started out building a dating site and instead ended up  building a
video sharing site (YouTube) that handles 4 billion views a day, then it's
just possible you learned something along the way. And indeed, Mike Solomon,
one of the original engineers at YouTube, did learn a lot and he has given a
talk about it atPyCon:Scalability at YouTube.This isn't an architecture driven
talk where we are led through a description of how a lot of boxes connect to
each other. Mike could give that sort of talk. He has worked on building
YouTube's servlet infrastructure, video indexing feature, video transcoding
system, their full text search, a CDN, and much more. But instead, he's taken
a step back, took a long look around at what time has wrought, and shared some
deep lessons, obviously hard won from experience.The key takeaway away of the
talk for me was doinga lot with really simple tools. While many teams are
moving on to more complex ecosystems, YouTube really does keep it simple. They

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's

<p>Introduction: Most every programmer who gets sucked into deep performance analysis for long
running processes eventually realizes memory allocation is the heart of evil
at the center of many of their problems. So you replace malloc with something
less worse. Or you tune your garbage collector like a fine ukulele. But
there's a smarter approach brought to you from the folks atRAMCloud, a
Stanford University production, which is a large scale, distributed, in-memory
key-value database.What they've found is that typical memory management
approaches don't work and using a log structured approach yields massive
benefits:Performance measurements of log-structured memory in RAMCloud show
that it enables high client through- put at 80-90% memory utilization, even
with artificially stressful workloads. In the most stressful workload, a
single RAMCloud server can support 270,000-410,000 durable 100-byte writes per
second at 90% memory utilization. The two-level approach to cleaning improves
performance by up</p><p>5 0.14628683 <a title="1003-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-19-Big_Iron_Returns_with_BigMemory.html">1118 high scalability-2011-09-19-Big Iron Returns with BigMemory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,EhcacheTerracotta Inc.Note:
this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are
still generally valid and useful.The legendary Moore's Law, which states that
the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every two years, has held true since 1965. It
follows that integrated circuits will continue to get smaller, with chip
fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm process (1). Users of big iron
hardware, or servers that are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity,
benefit from this trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful
over time. At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum
mechanics will preclude further density increases.At the same time, low-cost
commodity hardware influences enterprise architects to scale their
applications horizontally, where processing is spread across clusters of low-
cost commodity serv</p><p>6 0.13486408 <a title="1003-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-15-The_Role_of_Memory_within_Web_2.0_Architectures_and_Deployments.html">92 high scalability-2007-09-15-The Role of Memory within Web 2.0 Architectures and Deployments</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Nettyis a high-performance NIO(New IO) client server framework for Java that
Twitter uses internally as a protocol agonostic RPC system. Twitterfound some
problemswith Netty 3's memory management for buffer allocations beacause it
generated a lot of garbage during operation. When you send as many messages as
Twitter it creates a lot of GC pressure and the simple act of zero filling
newly allocated buffers consumed 50% of memory bandwidth. Netty 4 fixes this
situation with:Short-lived event objects, methods on long-lived channel
objects are used to handle I/O events.Secialized buffer allocator that uses
pool which implementsbuddy memory allocationandslab allocation.The result:5
times less frequent GC pauses: 45.5 vs. 9.2 times/min5 times less garbage
production: 207.11 vs 41.81 MiB/sThe buffer pool is much faster than JVM as
the size of the buffer increases. Some problems with smaller buffers.Given how

<p>Introduction: Stardog makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can
be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a recent article
StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable,
improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now
handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It
can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. What did they do
that you can also do?Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data
structures. For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue.Use
ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid
synchronization.Batch LRU evictions in a single thread. Triggered by several
LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by
additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times.Move to
SHA1 for hashing URIs, bnodes, and literal values. Making hash collisions
nearly impossible enable significant s</p><p>4 0.77402472 <a title="1003-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-02-12_Ways_to_Increase_Throughput_by_32X_and_Reduce_Latency_by__20X.html">1237 high scalability-2012-05-02-12 Ways to Increase Throughput by 32X and Reduce Latency by  20X</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Martin Thompson, a high-performance technology geek, has written an awesome
post,Fun with my-Channels Nirvana and Azul Zing. In it Martin shows the
process and techniques he used to take an existing messaging product, written
in Java, and increase throughput by 32X and reduce latency by  20X. The
article is very well written with lots of interesting details that make it
well worth reading.The TechniquesThe techniques are a good mix of Java
independent approaches, things you may have heard of before, things you
probably haven't heard of  before, and Java specific heroics. The obvious
winning technique is to create a lock free flow through the system. This
shouldn't be surprising as Martin teaches what sounds like a really goodlock-
free concurrency course.Do not use locks in the main transaction flow because
they cause context switches, and therefore latency and unpredictable
jitter.Never have more threads that need to run than you have cores
available.Set affinity of threads to cores,</p><p>5 0.77371162 <a title="1003-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-06-Paper%3A_Memory_Barriers%3A_a_Hardware_View_for_Software_Hackers.html">1471 high scalability-2013-06-06-Paper: Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's not often you get so enthusiastic a recommendation for a paper as Sergio
Bossa gives Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers: If you only
want to read one piece about CPUs architecture, cache coherency and memory
barriers, make it this one.It is a clear and well written article. It even has
a quiz. What's it about?So what possessed CPU designers to cause them to
inﬂict memory barriers on poor unsuspecting SMP software designers?In short,
because reordering memory references allows much better performance, and so
memory barriers are needed to force ordering in things like synchronization
primitives whose correct operation depends on ordered memory
references.Getting a more detailed answer to this question requires a good
understanding of how CPU caches work, and especially what is required to make
caches really work well. The following sections:present the structure of a
cache,describe how cache-coherency protocols ensure that CPUs agree on the
value of each location</p><p>6 0.76297987 <a title="1003-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-20-Paper%3A_Log-structured_Memory_for_DRAM-based_Storage_-_High_Memory_Utilization_Plus_High_Performance.html">1616 high scalability-2014-03-20-Paper: Log-structured Memory for DRAM-based Storage - High Memory Utilization Plus High Performance</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use

<p>Introduction: CTLis aflexible distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to
break management processes into reusable control modules and execute them in
distributed fashion over the network.From their website:CTL is a flexible
distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to break management
processes into reusable control modules and execute them in distributed
fashion over the network.What does CTL do?CTL helps you leverage your current
scripts and tools to easily automate any kind of distributed systems
management or application provisioning task. Its good for simplifiying large-
scale scripting efforts or as another tool in your toolbox that helps you
speed through your daily mix of ad-hoc administration tasks.What are CTL's
features?CTL has many features, but the general highlights are:* Execute
sophisticated procedures in distributed environments - Aren't you tired of
writing and then endlessly modifying scripts that loop over nodes and invoke
remote actions?

<p>Introduction: Dropboxsaves one million files every 15 minutes,  more tweets than even
Twitterers tweet. That mind blowing statistic was revealed by Rian Hunter, a
Dropbox Engineer, in his presentation How Dropbox Did It and How Python Helped
at PyCon 2011.The first part of the presentation is some Dropbox lore, origin
stories and other foundational myths. We learn thatDropbox is a startup
company located in San Francisco that has probably one of the most popular
file synchronization and sharing tools in the world, shipping Python on the
desktop and supporting millions of users and growing every day. About half way
through the talk turns technical. Not a lot of info on how Dropbox handles
this massive scale was dropped, but there were a number of good lessons to
ponder:Use Python99.9 % of their code is in Python. Used on the server
backend; desktop client, website controller logic, API backend, and
analytics.Can't use Python on the Android due to memory constraints.Runs on a

<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for
"CloudAPIportability," which implies a series of misconceptions.If we break
away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud
portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly
simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without
settling on a common CloudAPI.In this post i'll be covering five common
misconceptions people haveWRTto cloud portability.Cloud portability = Cloud
API portability. API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.The
main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in.Cloud
portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-
in.Cloud portability isn't for startups. Every startup that is expecting rapid
growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability
rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared
to do so.Cloud portability = Compromising on t</p><p>5 0.93797511 <a title="1003-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-19-LinkedIn%3A_Creating_a_Low_Latency_Change_Data_Capture_System_with_Databus.html">1211 high scalability-2012-03-19-LinkedIn: Creating a Low Latency Change Data Capture System with Databus</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post bySiddharth Anand, a senior member of LinkedIn's
Distributed Data Systems team.Over the past 3 years, I've had the good fortune
to work with many emerging NoSQL products in the context of supporting the
needs of a high-traffic, customer facing web site.In 2010, I helped Netflix to
successfullytransition its web scale use-cases from Oracle to SimpleDB, AWS'
hosted database service. On completion of that migration, we started a second
migration, this time from SimpleDB to Cassandra. The first transition was key
to our move from our own data center to AWS' cloud. The second was key to our
expansion from one AWS Region to multiple geographically-distributed Regions
-- today Netflix serves traffic out of two AWS Regions, one in Virginia, the
other in Ireland (F1). Both of these transitions have been successful, but
have involved integration pain points such as the creation of database
replication technology.In December 2011, I moved to LinkedIn's Distributed

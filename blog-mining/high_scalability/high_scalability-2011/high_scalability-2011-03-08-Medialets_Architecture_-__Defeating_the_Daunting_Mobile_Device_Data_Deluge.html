<p>Introduction: Facebook did it again. They've built another system capable of doing something
useful with ginormous streams of realtime data. Last time we saw Facebook
release their New Real-Time Messaging System: HBase To Store 135+ Billion
Messages A Month. This time it's a realtime analytics system handlingover 20
billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30
seconds. Alex Himel, Engineering Manager at Facebook, explains what they've
built (video) and the scale required:Social plugins have become an important
and growing source of traffic for millions of websites over the past year. We
released a new version of Insights for Websites last week to give site owners
better analytics on how people interact with their content and to help them
optimize their websites in real time. To accomplish this, we had to engineer a
system that could process over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per
second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds. Alex does an excellent job with

<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a newSocial Inbox
integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-
all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store
all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer
inThe Underlying Technology of Messages:HBase. HBase beat out MySQL,
Cassandra, and a few others.Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it
was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's
eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time
Messages product. Facebook also has an extensiveMySQL infrastructure, but they
found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could
have built their own, but they chose HBase.HBase is ascaleout table store
supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data.
Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system. HBase is also a column based

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.19355612 <a title="1000-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-22-Google_Architecture.html">448 high scalability-2008-11-22-Google Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Eric Czech, Chief Architect at Next Big Sound, talks
about some unique approaches taken to solving scalability challenges in music
analytics.Tracking online activity is hardly a new idea, but doing it for the
entire music industry isn't easy. Half a billion music video streams, track
downloads, and artist page likes occur each day and measuring all of this
activity across platforms such as Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, Facebook, and
more, poses some interesting scalability challenges. Next Big Sound collects
this type of data from over a hundred sources, standardizes everything, and
offers that information to record labels, band managers, and artists through a
web-based analytics platform.While many of our applications use open-source
systems like Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Mongo, RabbitMQ, and MySQL, our usage
is fairly standard, but there is one aspect of what we do that is pretty
unique. We collect or receive information from 100+ sources and we struggled

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJon Vlachogiannis. Jon is the founder and CTO
ofBugSense.BugSense, is an error-reporting and quality metrics service that
tracks thousand of apps every day. When mobile apps crash, BugSense helps
developers pinpoint and fix the problem. The startup delivers first-class
service to its customers, which include VMWare, Samsung, Skype and thousands
of independent app developers. Tracking more than 200M devices requires fast,
fault tolerant and cheap infrastructure.The last six months, we've decided to
use our BigData infrastructure, to provide the users with metrics about their
apps performance and stability and let them know how the errors affect their
user base and revenues.We knew that our solution should be scalable from day
one, because more than 4% of the smartphones out there, will start DDOSing us
with data.We wanted to be able to:Abstract the application logic and feed

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>5 0.83356047 <a title="1000-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-12-Peregrine_-_A_Map_Reduce_Framework_for_Iterative_and_Pipelined_Jobs.html">1173 high scalability-2012-01-12-Peregrine - A Map Reduce Framework for Iterative and Pipelined Jobs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Peregrine falcon is a bird of prey, famous for itshigh speed
divingattacks, feeding primarily on much slower Hadoops. Wait, sorry, it is
Kevin Burton of Spinn3r's newPeregrine project--anew FAST modern map reduce
framework optimized for iterative and pipelined map reduce jobs--that feeds on
Hadoops.If you don't know Kevin, he does a lot of excellent technical work
that he's kind enough to share it onhis blog. Only he hasn't been blogging
much lately, he's been heads down working on Peregrine. Now that Peregrine has
been released, here's a short email interview with Kevin on why you might want
to take upfalconry, the ancient sport of MapReduce.What does Spinn3r do that
Peregrine is important to you?Ideally it was designed to execute pagerank but
many iterative applications that we deploy and WANT to deploy (k-means) would
be horribly inefficient under Hadoop as it doesn't have any support for
merging and joining IO between tasks.  It also doesn't support pipeline jobs

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>2 0.9699083 <a title="1000-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-21-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_21st%2C_2014.html">1600 high scalability-2014-02-21-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 21st, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the Stack Overflow Architecture.
Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack
Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up
and out in the last few years.Stack Overflow has grown up by more then
doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page
views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  Stack Overflow has
grown out by expanding into theStack Exchange Network, which includes Stack
Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different
sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.What hasn't changed is
Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted
this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been
handling their growth: Stack Exchange's Architecture in Bullet Points, Stack
Overflow's New York Data Center, Designing For Scalability of Management and

Applications.Explore the common principles behind the major NOSQL alternatives
and how they compared with traditional database approach in terms of
consistency, transaction and query semantics. We will also explore how we can

MonthUpdate:Startup - ASP.NETMVC, Cloud Scale & Deploymentshows an interesting
alternative approach for a Windows stack using ServerPath/GoGrid for a

written by two guys nobody has ever heard of before. Well, not exactly. The
site was created by top programmer and blog starsJeff AtwoodandJoel Spolsky.
In that sense Stack Overflow is like a celebrity owned restaurant, only it
should be around for a while. Joel estimates 1/3 of all the programmers in the
world have used the site so they must be serving up something good.I fell in
deep like with Stack Overflow for purely selfish reasons, it helped me solve a
few difficult problems that were jabbing my eyes out with pain. I also

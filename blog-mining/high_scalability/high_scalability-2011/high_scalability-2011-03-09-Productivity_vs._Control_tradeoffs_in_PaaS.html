<p>Introduction: Yesterday, I had a session during the OpenStack Summit where I tried to
present a more general view on how we should be thinking about PaaS in the
context of OpenStack.The key takeaway :The main goal of PaaS is to drive
productivity into the process by which we can deliver new applications.Most of
the existing PaaS solutions take a fairly extreme approach with their
abstraction of the underlying infrastructure and therefore fit a fairly small
number of extremely simple applications and thus miss the real promise of
PaaS.Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk took a more bottom up approach giving us
better set of tradeoffs between the abstraction and control which makes it
more broadly applicable to a larger set of applications.The fact that
OpenStack is opensource allows us to think differently on the things we can do
at the platform layer. We can create a tighter integration between the PaaS
and IaaS layers and thus come up with better set of tradeoffs into the way we
drive productivity without g</p><p>3 0.26114249 <a title="1002-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-27-Big_Data_In_the_Cloud_Using_Cloudify.html">1216 high scalability-2012-03-27-Big Data In the Cloud Using Cloudify</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill wrote an interesting article on O'Reilly Radar covering the
current solutions for running Big Data in the CloudBig data and cloud
technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing,
which clouds can readily provide.Big PaaSEdd touched briefly on the role of
PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloudBeyond IaaS, several
cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes
referred to as managed solutions, or platform as a service (PaaS), these
services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce,
reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers
can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass
those savings on to the customer.To put it simply, managing data clusters is
one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we
need to think about when we're dealing with application platforms, as I noted
in one of my earlier</p><p>4 0.14679042 <a title="1002-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-24-Scalability_Perspectives_%233%3A_Marc_Andreessen_%E2%80%93_Internet_Platforms.html">450 high scalability-2008-11-24-Scalability Perspectives #3: Marc Andreessen – Internet Platforms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though - the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Marc AndreessenMarc Andreessen is known as an internet pioneer,
entrepreneur, investor, startup coach, blogger, and a multi-millionaire
software engineer best known as co-author of Mosaic, the first widely-used web
browser, and founder of Netscape Communications Corporation. He was the chair
of Opsware, a software company he founded originally as Loudcloud, when it was
acquired by Hewlett-Packard. He is also a co-founder of Ning, a company which
provides a platform for social-networking websites. He has recently joined the
Board of Directors of Facebook and eBay.Marc is an investor in several

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: Data centers are reshaping themselves by taking ideas from public cloud
providers, such as Amazon and Google. The idea is to make the data center more
cost-effective by enabling on-demand utility-based computing rather than
dedicated machines. At the same time, it is clear that to make IT operations
more effective, it doesn't make sense to run all the applications that are
currently hosted in a company's data center in the private cloud. This calls
for an integration between private and public cloud. In this post i discuss
some of the challenges involved in making that happen:1. How do we design
applications to be cloud-agnostic?2. How do we enable seamless fail-over to a
public cloud?3. Future-proofing: There are many cases in which we can't make a
clear decision as to where our application should be running at the time of
writing or developing the application. We would like to be in a position to
change the decision as to where our application will be running even after our
applicati</p><p>4 0.65969461 <a title="1002-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Are_we_seeing_the_renaissance_of_enterprises_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1354 high scalability-2012-11-05-Are we seeing the renaissance of enterprises in the cloud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is
indeed the case:Research conducted by HPfound that the majority of businesses
in the EMEA region are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the
cloud. Of the 940 respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-
critical apps at some point over the next two to five years.A more
recentsurvey, by research firm MeriTalkand sponsored by VMware and EMC
(NYSE:EMC), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to move some
mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within two years,
the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their mission-critical apps
to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of their mission-
critical apps to run in the cloud.The Challenge - How to Bring Hundreds of
Enterprise Apps to the CloudThe reality is that cloud economics only start
making sense when there are true workloads that utilize the cloud
infrastructure.If the large majority of</p><p>5 0.65628344 <a title="1002-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-Google_App_Engine_-_what_about_existing_applications%3F.html">305 high scalability-2008-04-21-Google App Engine - what about existing applications?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently, Google announced Google App Engine, another announcement in the
rapidly growing world of cloud computing. This brings up some very serious
questions:1. If we want to take advantage of one of the clouds, are we doomed
to be locked-in for life?2. Must we re-write our existing applications to use
the cloud?3. Do we need to learn a brand new technology or language for the
cloud?This post presents a pattern that will enable us to abstract our
application code from the underlying cloud provider infrastructure. This will
enable us to easily migrate our EXISTING applications to cloud based
environment thus avoiding the need for a complete re-write.</p><p>6 0.64709306 <a title="1002-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-21-The_Conspecific_Hybrid_Cloud.html">1212 high scalability-2012-03-21-The Conspecific Hybrid Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Gartner published recently an interesting paper: Productivity vs. Control:
Cloud Application Platforms Must Split to Win. (The paper requires
registration.)The paper does a pretty good job covering the evolution that is
taking place in the PaaS market toward a more open platform and compares
between the two main categories: aPaaS (essentially a PaaS running as a
service) and CEAP (Cloud Enabled Application Platform) which is the  *P* out
of PaaS that gives you the platform to build your own PaaS in private or
public cloud.While I was reading through the paper I felt that something
continued to bother me with this definition, even though I tend to agree with
the overall observation. If I follow the logic of this paper than I have to
give away productivity to gain control, hmmâ&euro;Ś  that's a hard choice.The issue
seem to be with the way we define productivity. Read the full detaileshere</p><p>2 0.9470163 <a title="1002-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-10-Shard_servers_--_go_big_or_small%3F.html">383 high scalability-2008-09-10-Shard servers -- go big or small?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello everyone,I'm designing a website/widget that my business partner and I
expect to serve millions of hits daily. As such we must shard our database
(and we're designing with shards in mind right from the beginning). However,
the one thing I haven't been able to figure out from Googling is the best
hardware to go with for shards. I'm using exclusively InnoDB tables.We'll
(eventually) be running 3 groups of database servers:a) Session servers for
php sessions. These will have a very high write volume.b) ID servers. These
will match a couple primary indices (such as user ID) to a given shard. These
will have an intense read load, plus a moderate amount of writes.c) Shard
servers. These will hold the bulk of the data. These will have a high read
load and a lowish write load.Group A is done as a database instead of using
memcached so users aren't logged out if a memcached server goes down. As the
write load is high, a pair of high performance master-master servers seems
obvious. What's</p><p>3 0.94424361 <a title="1002-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-23-State_of_the_CDN%3A_More_Traffic%2C_Stable_Prices%2C_More_Products%2C_Profits_-_Not_So_Much.html">1289 high scalability-2012-07-23-State of the CDN: More Traffic, Stable Prices, More Products, Profits - Not So Much</a></p>
<p>Introduction: CDNs (content delivery networks) are the secret shadow super powers behind the
web and Dan Rayburn atstreamingmedia.comis the go to investigative reporter
for quality information on CDNs. Every year Dan has a Content Delivery Summit
on all things CDN and those videos arenow available. Dan also gives a kind
ofstate of the industry talkwhere he does something wonderful, he gives real
numbers and prices. Dan really knows his stuff and is an excellent speaker, so
watch the video, but here's my gloss on the state of the CDN so far this
year:Massive growth. Large customers are expecting 126% growth in video
traffic over last year; medium size customers are seeing 48% traffic growth,
small sized customer are seeing 73.3% traffic growth.More traffic != More
profit. Traffic growth doesn't lead to more profit because the traffic growth
is concentrated in larger customers that can make the best deals.Video takes
up the largest amount of traffic on a CDNs network but gives the least amount

<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create
a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll
have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own
forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each
group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to
start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups
(this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that
having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that
some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day,
let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active
though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate
which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if
having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>5 0.93655342 <a title="1002-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-16-Do_you_have_any_questions_for_the_Elastra_CEO%3F.html">277 high scalability-2008-03-16-Do you have any questions for the Elastra CEO?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It looks like in the near future I'll have a chance to interview the Elastra
CEO. Elastra provides standarddatabases--MySQL, EnterpriseDB and PostgreSQL--
on top of EC2 and S3. They are selling aggressive pricing, expandable and
contactable database resource usage in response to demand, and a simple
management and operations interface to well known databases deployed in a
cloud. Elastra could be an important option for developers looking for a more
traditional cloudy database.I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions
for questions you would like answered? What would you like to know about their
service? What are you looking for in a cloudy database? What would stop you
from adopting it or what would make you decide to adopt it? Any ideas you have
would help a lot and will probably be better than anything I have.</p><p>6 0.9355638 <a title="1002-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting_and_CDN_for_startup_video_sharing_site.html">181 high scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting and CDN for startup video sharing site</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Memcached is one of the most common In-Memory cache implementation.  It was
originally developed by Danga Interactive for LiveJournal, but is now used by
many other sites as a side cache to speed up read mostly operations. It gained
popularity in the non-Java world, too, especially since it's a language-
neutral side cache for which few alternatives existed.  As a side-cache,
Memcache clients relies on the database as the system of record, The database
is still used for write,update and complex query operations.  Since the
memcached specification includes no query operations, memcached is not a
database alternative, unlike most of the NoSQL offerings. It also exclude
memcache from being a real solution for write scalability. As a result of that
many of the heavy sites started to move away from Memcache and replace it with
other NoSQL alternatives as noted in a recent highscalability post MySQL And
Memcached: End Of An Era?The transition away from memcached to NoSQL could

<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days - you only needed one, but then came along the
AS400's and soon you had ten - but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh
sh%# - now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and
datacenter operations!Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path?As a
technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other
CIO's on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context
to how they can leverage SpringCM' s easy, fast and affordable cloud
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done
in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a
combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those
services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be
outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud
services.What options do I have?In a recent conversation with a CIO

<p>Introduction: Recently, Google announced Google App Engine, another announcement in the
rapidly growing world of cloud computing. This brings up some very serious
questions:1. If we want to take advantage of one of the clouds, are we doomed
to be locked-in for life?2. Must we re-write our existing applications to use
the cloud?3. Do we need to learn a brand new technology or language for the
cloud?This post presents a pattern that will enable us to abstract our
application code from the underlying cloud provider infrastructure. This will
enable us to easily migrate our EXISTING applications to cloud based
environment thus avoiding the need for a complete re-write.</p><p>6 0.75608963 <a title="1144-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Are_we_seeing_the_renaissance_of_enterprises_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1354 high scalability-2012-11-05-Are we seeing the renaissance of enterprises in the cloud?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,I saw an year ago that Netapp sold netcache to blu-coat, my site is a heavy
NetCache user and we cached 83% of our site. We tested with Blue-coat and F5
WA and we are not getting same performce as NetCache.Any of you guys have the
same issue? or somebody knows another product can handle much
traffic?ThanksRodrigo</p><p>same-blog 2 0.8545804 <a title="1144-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-17-Five_Misconceptions_on_Cloud_Portability.html">1144 high scalability-2011-11-17-Five Misconceptions on Cloud Portability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for
"CloudAPIportability," which implies a series of misconceptions.If we break
away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud
portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly
simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without
settling on a common CloudAPI.In this post i'll be covering five common
misconceptions people haveWRTto cloud portability.Cloud portability = Cloud
API portability. API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.The
main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in.Cloud
portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-
in.Cloud portability isn't for startups. Every startup that is expecting rapid
growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability
rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared
to do so.Cloud portability = Compromising on t</p><p>3 0.83331847 <a title="1144-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce_With_Ruby_Using_Hadoop.html">968 high scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce With Ruby Using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use
Cloudera’sWhirr script, which</p><p>4 0.79056871 <a title="1144-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-29-CTL_-_Distributed_Control_Dispatching_Framework_.html">433 high scalability-2008-10-29-CTL - Distributed Control Dispatching Framework </a></p>
<p>Introduction: CTLis aflexible distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to
break management processes into reusable control modules and execute them in
distributed fashion over the network.From their website:CTL is a flexible
distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to break management
processes into reusable control modules and execute them in distributed
fashion over the network.What does CTL do?CTL helps you leverage your current
scripts and tools to easily automate any kind of distributed systems
management or application provisioning task. Its good for simplifiying large-
scale scripting efforts or as another tool in your toolbox that helps you
speed through your daily mix of ad-hoc administration tasks.What are CTL's
features?CTL has many features, but the general highlights are:* Execute
sophisticated procedures in distributed environments - Aren't you tired of
writing and then endlessly modifying scripts that loop over nodes and invoke
remote actions?

<p>Introduction: Srinath Perera has put together astrong list of architecture patternsbased on
three meta patterns:  distribution, caching, and asynchronous processing. He
contends these three are the primal patterns and the following patterns are
but different combinations:LB (Load Balancers) + Shared nothing Units. Units
that do not share anything with each other fronted with a load balancer that
routes incoming messages to a unit based on some criteria.LB + Stateless Nodes
+ Scalable Storage. Several stateless nodes talking to a scalable storage, and
a load balancer distributes load among the nodes.Peer to Peer Architectures
(Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Content Addressable Networks (CAN)).
Algorithm for scaling up logarithmically.Distributed Queues. Queue
implementation (FIFO delivery) implemented as a network
service.Publish/Subscribe Paradigm. Network publish subscribe brokers that
route messages to each other.Gossip and Nature-inspired Architectures. Each
node randomly pick and exchange info</p><p>6 0.76424253 <a title="1144-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-28-Need_for_change_in_your_IT_infrastructure_.html">731 high scalability-2009-10-28-Need for change in your IT infrastructure </a></p>

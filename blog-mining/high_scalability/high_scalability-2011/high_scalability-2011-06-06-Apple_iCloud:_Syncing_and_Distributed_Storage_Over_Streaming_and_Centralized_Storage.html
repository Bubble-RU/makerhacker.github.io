<p>Introduction: A conjunction of a few new technologies may trigger disruptive changes in the
future. This observation was prompted by a talkSteve Perlmangave at the
Columbia Engineering School: Benjamin Button, Cloud Everything and Why
Shannon's Law Isn't. In it he covers a set of technologies that at first may
seem unrelated, but turn out to be deeply related after all, culminating in a
realization of the long talked about vision of an application utility, where
all applications are hosted and run out of the cloud. First Perlman talks
about the realistic human rendering technology developed at Rearden, his
research incubator company. This technology was developed over many years and
is the secret behind the wonderful effects found in movies likeBenjamin
Button. It is now being used in many other films, and promises to
revolutionize film making, possibly even replacing actors with computers, in
real-time.The next invention at Rearden isOnLive, a cloud based gaming

<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,
we analyze latencies measured</p><p>3 0.94821304 <a title="1053-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Breakthrough_Web-Tier_Solutions_with_Record-Breaking_Performance.html">453 high scalability-2008-12-01-Breakthrough Web-Tier Solutions with Record-Breaking Performance</a></p>

Architect, gives thispresentationon how eBay scales, for free. Randy has done
a fabulous job in this presentation and in other talks listed at the end of
this post getting at the heart of the principles behind scalability. It's more
about ideas of how things work and fit together than a focusing on a
particular technology stack.Impressive StatsIn case you weren't sure, eBay is

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

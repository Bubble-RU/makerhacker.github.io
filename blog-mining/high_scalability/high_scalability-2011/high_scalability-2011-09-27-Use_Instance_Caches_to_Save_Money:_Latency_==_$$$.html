runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his

continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per

<p>Introduction: Hi,Every application server has its own session management implementations for
supporting high scalability. But an application architect/developer has to
design and implement the application to make the best use of it.What are the
guiding principles and pattern for session state management?Websphere System
management red book mentions that "Session management performance is optimum
when session data per user is around 2Kb. It degrades if session data is more
than that".I have following questions.1. How do you measure session data per
user?2. It is generally recommended that you should keep all the session state
in database and keep only the keys in HttpSession object. Then everytime a web
request is processed, session data is fetched from the database. This way all
the data remains in memory only till the request is processed and actual data
in HttpSession is very less. (Only few keys).What is the general practice?At
what point you should be switching from keeping data in HttpSession t</p><p>5 0.15750401 <a title="1126-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-10-31-15_Ways_to_Make_Your_Application_Feel_More_Responsive_under_Google_App_Engine.html">1135 high scalability-2011-10-31-15 Ways to Make Your Application Feel More Responsive under Google App Engine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Small Imrovements, makers of a hosted, lightweight feedback platform, have
written an excellent article on Performance issues on GAE, and how we resolved
them. They show how they trimmed most of their requests to between 300ms and
800ms, some still take 2 seconds when memcache is stale, and others clock in
at 150ms. Notzippy overall, but acceptable, especially if you really like
GAE's PaaS promise.What's tricky with PaaS is if your performance is poor,
there's often not a lot you can do about it. But the folks at Small
Improvements have been clever and diligent, giving many specific details and
timings. Though their advice is specifically for GAE, it will apply to a lot
of different situations as well.Here are the 15 ways they made small
performance improvements: Understand App Engine has bad days. App Engine can
have bad days where performance can degrade. Your design needs to take this
potential for high latency variability into account. Don't always assume the
best case.Always prefe</p><p>6 0.15197022 <a title="1126-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy%3A_Order_Two_Mediums_Instead_of_Two_Smalls_and_the_EC2_Buffet.html">812 high scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy: Order Two Mediums Instead of Two Smalls and the EC2 Buffet</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Using this strategy, Valyala, a commenter onAre Long VM Instance Spin-Up Times
In The Cloud Costing You Money?, was able to reduce their GAE application
start-up times from 15 seconds down to to 1.5 seconds:Spin-up time for newly
added Google AppEngine instances can be reduced using initial state caching.
Usually the majority of spin-up time for the newly created GAE instance is
spent in the pre-populating of the initial state, which is created from many
data pieces loaded from slow data sources such as GAE's datastore. If the
initial state is identical among GAE instances, then the entire state can be
serialized and stored in a shared memory (either in the memcache or in the
datastore) by the first created instance, so newly created instances could
load and quickly unserialize the state from a single blob loaded from shared
memory instead of spending a lot of time for creation of the state from
multiple data pieces loaded from the datastore.I reduced spin-up time for new
instances of</p><p>3 0.74850464 <a title="1126-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-07-What_Google_App_Engine_Price_Changes_Say_About_the_Future_of_Web_Architecture.html">1112 high scalability-2011-09-07-What Google App Engine Price Changes Say About the Future of Web Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a paper delivered at HotCloud '12 by a group from CMU and Intel Labs,
Saving Cash by Using Less Cache (slides,  pdf), they show it may be possible
to use less DRAM under low load conditions to save on operational costs. There
are some issues with this idea, but in a give me more cache era, it could be
an interesting source of cost savings for your product. Caching is used
to:Reduce load on the database.Reduce latency.Problem:RAM in the cloud is
quite expensive. A third of costs can come from the caching tier.Solution:
Shrink your cache when the load is lower. Their work shows when the load drops
below a certain point you can throw away 50% of your cache while still
maintaining performance.A few popular items often account for most of your
hits, implying can remove the cache for the long tail. Use two tiers of
servers, the Retiring Group, which is the group of servers you want to get rid
of. The Primary Group is the group of servers you are keeping. A cache request
goes to both serve</p><p>5 0.6851325 <a title="1126-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-25-Not_All_Regions_are_Created_Equal_-_South_America_Es_Bueno.html">1347 high scalability-2012-10-25-Not All Regions are Created Equal - South America Es Bueno</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rodrigo Camposshared some interesting benchmark resultsfor AWS instances in
the South America Region (Sao Paulo) and US East Region (North Virginia). He
summarized the results in this thread on theGuerrilla Capacity
Planninglist:The same instance type shows a different behavior depending on
the region that it is running, this is particularly critical if you depend on
multiple regions for disaster recovery or geographical load balancingGenerally
speaking performance is better and more consistent in the South America region
when compared to Virginia, this is probably due to the fact that SA region was
the latest to be deployed. Maybe the SA datacenter uses new server models or
it is just underutilized, but this is a wild guessWrite performance for the
medium instance type in Virginia abruptly decays, dropping from almost 400
call/s to something around 300 calls/s, this is not very clear in the scatter

<p>Introduction: If you are stuck drowning in too much data and too many options and are
dazzled by all the possibilities of code, here's a helpful bit of advice from
Airbnb's rags to richesorigin story:it's okay to do things that don't scale. A
corollary is the idea of paying attention to and learning from what your users
are actually doing and let that lead you without out that annoying voice in
your head second guessing you, yelling but that will never scale! Worry about
building something good, then worry about making it scale.In Airbnb's case
they noticed people weren't booking rooms because the pictures sucked. So they
flew to New York and shot some beautiful images. This is a very non-scalable
and non-technical solution. Yet it was the turning point for Airbnb and
sparked their climb out of the "trough of sorrow." Previously they had been
limited by the Silicon Valley idea that every feature had to be scalable. Not
every solution can be found behind a computer screen.For the full story please

<p>Introduction: In the post Using memcache might be free, but it's costing you money with
instance pricing! Use instance caches if possible made on the Google App
Engine group, Santiago Lema brings up an oldie but a goody of an idea that was
once used to improve performance, but now it's used to save money:Santiago's
GAE application went from about $9 to about $177 per month. Memcache is slow
enough that under higher loads extra instances are created by the scheduler to
handle the load.For static or semi-static data, a way around the cost of the
extra instances, is to keep a cache in the instance so requests can be served
out of local memory rather than going to memcache or the database. A simple
hashtable makes a good in-memory cache.This solution made his app affordable
again by reducing the number of instances back to 1 (sometimes 2).Where have
we seen this before?This is a variant of the old Sticky Session idea where web
sessions are stored in RAM in an application server and all further

<p>Introduction: Queuing work forprocessing in the backgroundis a time testedscalability
strategy. Queuing also happens to be one of those much needed tools where it
easy enough to forge for your own that we see a lot of different versions
made.Resque is GitHub'stake on a job queue and they've used it to process
million and millions of jobs so far.What is Resque?Redis-backedlibrary for
creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and
processing them later. Background jobs can be any Ruby class or module that
responds to perform. Your existing classes can easily be converted to
background jobs or you can create new classes specifically to do work. Or, you
can do both.GitHub tried and considered many other systems: SQS, Starling,
ActiveMessaging, BackgroundJob, DelayedJob, beanstalkd, AMQP,  and Kestrel,
but found them all wanting in one way are another. The latency for SQS was too
high. Others didn't make full use of Ruby. Others still had a lot of overhead.

<p>Introduction: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic
is written by UC Berkeley's Joseph Hellersteinfor a keynote speech he gave at
PODS. The video version of the talk is here. You may have heard about Mr.
Hellerstein through theBerkeley Orders Of Magnitude project (BOOM), whose
purpose is to help people build systems that are OOM (orders of magnitude)
bigger than are building today, with OOM less effort than traditional
programming methodologies. A noble goal which may be why BOOM was rated as a
top 10 emerging technology for 2010 byMIT Technology Review. Quite an
honor.The motivation for the talk is a familiar one: it's a dark period for
computer programming and if we don't learn how to write parallel programs the
children of Moore's law will destroy us all. We have more and more processors,
yet we are stuck on figuring out how the average programmer can exploit them.
The BOOM solution is the Bloom language which is based onDedalus: Dedalus is a

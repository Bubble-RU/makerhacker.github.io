<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean: can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something useful? 
 
Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often do very little to help front-line developers succeed. 
 
How many ideas break out of academia into industry in computer science?

<p>Introduction: You program in a dynamic language, that runs on a JVM, that runs on a OS designed  40 years ago  for a completely different purpose, that runs on virtualized hardware. Does this make sense? We've talked about this idea before in  Machine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting The Cloud From Scratch , where the vision is to treat  cloud virtual hardware as a compiler target, and converting high-level language source code directly into kernels that run on it. 
 
As new technologies evolve the friction created by our old tool chains and architecture models becomes ever more obvious. Take, for example, what a  team  at  UCSD  is releasing: a  phase-change memory prototype   -  a   solid state storage device that provides performance thousands of times faster than a conventional hard drive and up to seven times faster than current state-of-the-art solid-state drives (SSDs).  However, PCM has access latencies several times slower than DRAM.

<p>Introduction: The RAD Lab (Reliable Adaptive Distributed Systems Laboratory) wants to leapfrog the Big Switch and create The Next Big Switch, skipping the cloud/utility evolutionary stage altogether. This hyper-evolutionary niche buster develops technology so advanced the cloud disperses and you can go back to building your own personal datacenters again. Where Google took years to create their datacenters, using a prefab Datacenter Operating System you might create your own in a long holiday weekend. Not St. Patrick's of course.     Their vision:   Enable one person to invent and run the next revolutionary IT service, operationally expressing a new business idea as a multi-million-user service over the course of a long weekend. By doing so we hope to enable an Internet "Fortune 1 million".        How? By wizardry in the form of a “datacenter operating system” created from a pinch of "statistical machine learning (SML)" and a tincture of "recent insights from networking and distributed systems."

<p>Introduction: In  It's Time for Low Latency   Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for program  architectures will be revolutionary .   Luiz André Barroso , Distinguished Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter into single computer.
 
 Abstract from the paper:
  

The operating systems community has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it will be up to us to ﬁnish</p><p>6 0.098215744 <a title="1039-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-12-Google_TechTalk%3A_Amdahl%27s_Law_in_the_Multicore_Era.html">534 high scalability-2009-03-12-Google TechTalk: Amdahl's Law in the Multicore Era</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are interested in future foward OS designs then you might find  Akaros  worth a look. It's an operating system designed for many-core architectures and large-scale SMP systems, with the goals of:
  
 Providing better support for parallel and high-performance applications 
 Scaling the operating system to a large number of cores  
  
A more indepth explanation of the motiviation behind Akaros can be found in  Improving Per-Node Efﬁciency in the Datacenter with NewOS Abstractions  by Barret Rhoden, Kevin Klues, David Zhu, and Eric Brewer.
 
The abstract:
  We believe datacenters can beneﬁt from more focus on per-node efﬁciency, performance, and predictability, versus the more common focus so far on scalability to a large number of nodes. Improving per-node efﬁciency decreases costs and fault recovery because fewer nodes are required for the same amount of work. We believe that the use of complex, general-purpose operating systems is a key contributing factor to these inefﬁciencies</p><p>3 0.71907419 <a title="1039-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-12-Google_TechTalk%3A_Amdahl%27s_Law_in_the_Multicore_Era.html">534 high scalability-2009-03-12-Google TechTalk: Amdahl's Law in the Multicore Era</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be squashed.     To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer 2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtai</p><p>4 0.71089834 <a title="1039-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-19-Is_it_time_to_get_rid_of_the_Linux_OS_model_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1177 high scalability-2012-01-19-Is it time to get rid of the Linux OS model in the cloud?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper:  Pursue robust indefinite scalability , wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural networks, starting from scratch.
 
What is this strange thing called  indefinite scalability ? They sound like words that don't really go together:
  

Indefinite scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-engineered.

<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:   My recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid expiration headers) is employ a    reverse proxy    as mentioned in this article.   In the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.  It's trivial to implement for anyone interested...</p><p>2 0.96896636 <a title="1039-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research  is a paper presented at  HotOS XIII , the place where researchers talk about making potential futures happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by Matt Welsh:  Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa .
 
In the VM/cloud age I question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but one possible future.
 
Introduction:
  For too long, operating systems researchers and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished out.

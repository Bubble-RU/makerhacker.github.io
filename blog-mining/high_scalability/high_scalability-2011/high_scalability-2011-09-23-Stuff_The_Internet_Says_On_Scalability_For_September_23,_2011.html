<p>Introduction: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as
a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. --
CorinthiansWith this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs.I
like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them
just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.-- Sylvain onGoogle GroupsThe
dream is dead. Google App Engine's boldpay for what you usedream dies as it
leaves childish things behind and becomes areal product.Pricing will change.
Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will
change. But Google App Engine will survive. Google isshutting downmany of
itsprojects. GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank
for it surving the more wood behindmore deadly arrows push? Without a radical
and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.1357588 <a title="1122-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-14-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_14th%2C_2014.html">1596 high scalability-2014-02-14-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 14th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:MapReduce and PageRank Notes from Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau's Fall 2008
class. Collects interesting facts about MapReduce and PageRank. For example,
the history of the solution to searching for the term "flu" is traced through
multiple generations of technology.With Google entering the cloud space
withGoogle AppEngineand a maturingHadoopproduct, the MapReduce scaling
approach might finally become a standard programmer practice. This is the best
paper on the subject and is an excellent primer on a content-addressable
memory future.Some interesting stats from the paper: Google executes 100k
MapReduce jobs each day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day;
more than 10k MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual
processor with gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.One common criticism ex-
Googlers have is that it takes months to get up and be productive in the
Google environment. Hopefully a way will be found to lower the learning curve
and make programmers</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91971755 <a title="1122-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-23-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_23%2C_2011.html">1122 high scalability-2011-09-23-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 23, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: nginx is a high performance smtp/pop/imap proxy that lets you do custom
authorization and lookups and is very scalable. (just add nodes)Nginx by
default is a reverse proxy and this is what it is doing here for pop/imap
connections. It is also an excellelent reverse proxy for web
servers.Advantage: You dont have to have a speacial database or ldap schema.
Just an url to do auth and lookup with.A url that may be accessed by a unix or
a tcp socket. Write your own auth handler - according to your own policy.For
example:A user called atif tries to login with the pass testxyz.You pass this
infomation to a URL such assocket:/var/tmp/xyz.sockorhttp://auth.corp.mailserv
er.net:someport/someurlThe auth server replies with either a FAILURE such
asAuth-Status: Invalid Login or passwordor with a success such asAuth-Status:

<p>Introduction: Constructing a scalablerisk analysis solution is a fascinating architectural
challenge. If you come from Financial Services you are sure to appreciate
that. But even architects from other domains are bound to find the challenges
fascinating, and the architectural patterns of my suggested solution highly
useful in other domains.Recently I held an interesting webinar around
architecting solutions for scalable and near-real-time risk analysis solutions
based on experience gathered with Financial Services customers. Seeing the
vast interest in the webinar, I would like to share the highlights with you
here.From an architectural point of view, risk analysis is a data-intensive
and a compute-intensive process, which also has an elaborate orchestration
logic. volumes in this domain are massive and ever-increasing, together with
an ever-increasing demand to reduce response time. These trends are aggravated
by global financial regulatory reforms set following the late-2000s financial
crisis, wh</p><p>6 0.88680553 <a title="1122-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-29-Strategy%3A_Let_Google_and_Yahoo_Host_Your_Ajax_Library_-_For_Free.html">665 high scalability-2009-07-29-Strategy: Let Google and Yahoo Host Your Ajax Library - For Free</a></p>

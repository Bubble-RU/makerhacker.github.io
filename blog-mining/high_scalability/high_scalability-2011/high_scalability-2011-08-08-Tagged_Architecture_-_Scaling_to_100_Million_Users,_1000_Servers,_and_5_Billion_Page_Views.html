</p><p>4 V2: Cached PHPwebapp, 1m users, 20 servers, 2005Even at eight servers Tagged had more web traffic than most of us had known. [sent-11, score-0.153]
</p><p>5 Fortunately, memcached brought dual advantages, removing over 90% of database reads, and ensuing that social networking pages packed with diverse information would render quickly. [sent-12, score-0.428]
</p><p>6 Our site continued to evolve in complexity beyond standard social networking features (friends, profiles, messages) with the addition of search and social discovery functions. [sent-15, score-0.702]
</p><p>7 I was relieved when we learned to run it well, and my reluctance born of early experiences with JDK 1. [sent-17, score-0.176]
</p><p>8 We scrambled to release one caching or SQL tuning optimization after the other, but the CPU our servers would time and again trend towards the 100% mark. [sent-21, score-0.178]
</p><p>9 The idea of scaling up offered a quick fix, but the multi-socket server hardware could cost millions, so we opted for Oracle RAC, which let us use standard networking to hook up lots of several commodity Linux hosts to build one big database. [sent-22, score-0.222]
</p><p>10 When joined with the advantages of the latest CPUs, Oracle RAC delivered a crucial 20-fold capacity increase over our first database server, and allowed application developers to stay focused on building new features. [sent-23, score-0.165]
</p><p>11 V4: Database sharding, 50m users, 500 servers, 2007Sharding the database was without a doubt the most challenging, but also the most rewarding episode in scaling Tagged. [sent-25, score-0.158]
</p><p>12 By splitting up users among multiple databases we finally had a design that at all places allowed us to scale just by adding hardware. [sent-26, score-0.252]
</p><p>13 Writing migration software to generate SQL, we exported, transformed, and reloaded hundreds of millions of rows, using triggers to track changes on source system and updating targets incrementally so that the final sync involved an outage of less than 30 minutes. [sent-31, score-0.153]
</p><p>14 With the crux database scalability problems solved, we found it straightforward to support expansion by adding hardware. [sent-36, score-0.164]
</p><p>15 PHP and memcached continued to serve us well, supporting rapid feature development. [sent-37, score-0.172]
</p><p>16 During this time, scalability considerations shifted towards mitigating failures, addressing the threat of an increasing number of breakable parts. [sent-38, score-0.329]
</p><p>17 Protecting the web layer from problems at its dependencies was achieved through load balancer health checks and automatic shutdown of unresponsive services. [sent-39, score-0.151]
</p><p>18 Java achieved a much more prominent role, in part due to increasing acceptance and expertise, but also because of increasing challenges. [sent-43, score-0.325]
</p><p>19 Social games also benefited from the performance and concurrency control of Java, but there has been a cost in complexity; we now need to manage many more distinct pools of applications than before. [sent-45, score-0.142]

<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

socially with friends usingPlayfishgames on social platforms like The
Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the
fastest growing segment of the game industry:social gaming, which is the love
child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early
adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud
servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by
why EA bought them for$300 millionand they think a$1 billion gameis possible):
building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile
gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve
systems, agile development and deployment, andselling virtual goodas a

<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300
thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially
experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems
and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each
day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly
visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a
very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale
meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?Site:

<p>Introduction: ThePort Network's Director of Engineering, TJ Muehleman was kind of enough to
share some of the architectural details for their white label social media
system. It currently runs about 50 social networks varying in size from less
than 1000 members to more than 300,000 members, all on a Microsoft stack. In
addition to their social networking platform, they offer Javascript APIs and
web service APIs (both REST and SOAP) which account for a significant
percentage of overall system usage.ThePort is an excellent example of a real
world in-the-trenches product offering real value to customers. One of the
most interesting problems they have to solve is multi-tenancy. How do you
provide good performance, complete customization, support, develop new
features, and provide individual search indexes for each customer? It's not an
easy problem to solve.How did they solve their problems and build a successful
system? Site: http://theport.comPlatformMicrosoft.NET 3.5C# / VB.NETSQL Server

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO ofMocoSpace, describing
the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely
architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very
large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their
system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile
Web; their multi-tiered, read/write, local/distributed caching system;
selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.MocoSpace is
a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a
month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the
US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser,
ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web.
Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging,
music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs. The monetization
strategy is focused on advert</p><p>5 0.75246125 <a title="1094-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-09-The_Etsy_Saga%3A_From_Silos_to_Happy_to_Billions_of_Pageviews_a_Month.html">1171 high scalability-2012-01-09-The Etsy Saga: From Silos to Happy to Billions of Pageviews a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Seldom do we get to hear stories of the bumps and bruses earned by a popular
website during its formative years. Ross Snyder, a Sr. Software Engineer at
Etsy, changes that with an engaging talk he gave at Surge 2011:Scaling Etsy:
What Went Wrong, What Went Right.Ross gives a detailed and honest account of
how Etsy went from a raw startup in 2005, to a startup struggling with their
success in 2007, to the mean, handmade, super scaling, ops driven machine
they've become in 2011.There's lots to learn from this illuminating story of
transformation:Origin StoryEtsyis a market for handmade goods. They connect
buyers and sellers, similar to eBay, they don't handle goods.Started: June
2005,3 guys in an apartment.Today: 250 employees, billions of pageviews a

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

<p>Introduction: It's called "east-west" networking, which when compared to its predecessor,
"north-south" networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane winds and
tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation between the
transformative shift this change in networking patterns has on the data center
with that of El Ni単o's transformative power upon the weather patterns across
the globe.Traditionally, data center networks have focused on North-South
network traffic. The assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly
communicate with servers at the core, rather than across the network to other
clients.But server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual
appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical
infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with workloads
moving to different physical locations on the network as virtual servers are
migrated (in the case of data center networks) and clients move about the

<p>Introduction: Every time a technological innovation has spurred automation - since the time
of Henry Ford right up to a minute ago - someone has claimed that machines
will displace human beings. But the rainbow and unicorn dream attributed to
business stakeholders everywhere, i.e. the elimination of IT, is just that - a
dream. It isn't realistic and in fact it's downright silly to think that
systems that only a few years ago were unable to automatically scale up and
scale down will suddenly be able to perform the complex analysis required of
IT to keep the business running.The rare reports of the elimination of IT
staff due tocloud computingand automation are highlighted in the news because
they evoke visceral reactions in technologists everywhere and, to be honest,
they get the click counts rising. But thejury remains out on this oneand in
fact many postulate that it is not a reduction in staff that will occur, but
atransformationof staff, which may eliminate some old timey positions (think

snapshots on how Tagged scaled to more than 1,000 serversSince 2004,Taggedhas
grown from a tiny social experiment to one of the largest social networks,
delivering five billion pages per month to many millions of members who visit
to meet and socialize with new people. One step at a time, this evolution
forced us to evolve our architecture, eventually arriving at an enormously
capable platform.V1: PHP webapp, 100k users, 15 servers, 2004Tagged was born
in the rapid-prototyping culture of an incubator that usually launched two new
concepts each year in search of the big winner. LAMP was the natural choice
for this style of work, which emphasized flexibility and quick turnaround at a
time when Java development was mostly oriented towards development at large
enterprises, Python attracted too few programmers, and Perl brought the wrong
sort. Also, we knew that Yahoo was a big proponent of PHP, so it would be

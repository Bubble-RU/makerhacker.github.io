<p>Introduction: "I'll never need to scale so why bother? We aren't Twitter or Facebook or
Google after all." This is the most common email I get, a question in the form
of a thinly disguised rationalization for not having to worry about scaling.
And in these days of giant transformer-like machines they are probably right.
But what if there areBarry Bonds enhancing type forces at work that argue for
the chances of your needing to scale being higher than you think?And if that
happens, how will you cross the scalability chasm? Will you want to completely
change your architecture or evolve it from a tool-chain that was meant to
scale from the start? Architecturally, that's the question you have to answer.
Today's tool-chains are making it possible to grow a system from small to
large without needing to implement complete architectural phase changes at
various scale inflection points, but that's a different topic. We're trying to
think about why you may actually need to scale, that is the question.Tumblr i</p><p>4 0.1162662 <a title="1046-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: From their website:DRBDis a block device which is designed to build high
availability clusters. This is done by mirroring a whole block device via (a
dedicated) network. You could see it as a network raid-1.DRBD takes over the
data, writes it to the local disk and sends it to the other host. On the other
host, it takes it to the disk there.breakThe other components needed are a
cluster membership service, which is supposed to be heartbeat, and some kind
of application that works on top of a block device.Examples:A filesystem &
fsck.A journaling FS.A database with recovery capabilities.Each device (DRBD
provides more than one of these devices) has a state, which can be 'primary'
or 'secondary'. On the node with the primary device the application is
supposed to run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to
the local 'lower level block device' and to the node with the device in
'secondary' state. The secondary device simply writes the data to its lower
level block devi</p><p>6 0.11338483 <a title="1046-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-03-Snooze_-_Open-source%2C_Scalable%2C_Autonomic%2C_and_Energy-efficient_VM_Management_for_Private_Clouds.html">1238 high scalability-2012-05-03-Snooze - Open-source, Scalable, Autonomic, and Energy-efficient VM Management for Private Clouds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the

<p>Introduction: This article is from an interview withZuhaib Siddique, a production engineer
atHipChat, makers ofgroup chat and IM for teams.HipChat started in an unusual
space, one you might not think would have much promise, enterprise group
messaging, but as we are learning there is gold in them thereenterprise hills.
Which is why Atlassian, makers of well thought of tools like JIRA and
Confluence,acquired HipChat in 2012.And in a tale not often heard, the
resources and connections of a larger parent have actually helped HipChat
enter anexponential growth cycle. Having reached the 1.2 billion message
storage mark they are now doubling the number of messages sent, stored, and
indexed every few months.That kind of growth puts a lot of pressure on a once
adequate infrastructure. HipChat exhibited a common scaling pattern. Start
simple, experience traffic spikes, and then think what do we do now? Using
bigger computers is usually the first and best answer. And they did that. That

<p>Introduction: This is a question everyone must struggle with when building out their
datacenter. Storage choices are always the ones I have the least confidence
in. David Marks in his blogYou Can Change It Later!asks the questionShould I
get a SAN to scale my site architecture?and answers no. A better solution is
to use commodity hardware, directly attach storage on servers, and partition
across servers to scale and for greater availability.David's reasoning is
interesting:A SAN creates a SPOF (single point of failure) that is dependent
on a vendor to fly and fix when there's a problem. This can lead to long down
times during this outage you have no access to your data at all.Using easily
available commodity hardware minimizes risks to your company, it's not just
about saving money. Zooming over to Fry's to buy emergency equipment provides
the kind of agility startups need in order to respond quickly to ever changing
situations.It's hard to beat the power and flexibility (backups, easy to add

<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAli Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead atPlanForCloud. The
original article was publishedon their site. With 29 cloud price reductions I
thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change
compared to an articlewe published last year. The result is surprisingly
little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances havenot dropped
as fastas for other other instances types.Over the last year and a half,we
counted 29 price reductionsin cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute
Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct
effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is
that effect on the bottom line?Last year I wrote aboutcloud cost forecasts for
TripAdvisor and Pinterest.TripAdvisor was experimenting with AWSand attempted
to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of its live site,
andPinterest was growing massively on AWS. In the wake of the cloud providers'

<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirmingCuriosity landing on
Mars, then this paper,High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for
Main-Memory Databases, has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an
excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead
on in-memory datastructures:A database system optimized for in-memory storage
can support much higher transaction rates than current systems. However,
standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to the high
transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two
efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory
databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from
updates but differ in how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is
pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions never block
during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure
correct serializatio</p><p>6 0.95367783 <a title="1046-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-10-1_Master%2C_N_Slaves.html">178 high scalability-2007-12-10-1 Master, N Slaves</a></p>

<p>Introduction: "I'll never need to scale so why bother? We aren't Twitter or Facebook or Google after all." This is the most common email I get, a question in the form of a thinly disguised rationalization for not having to worry about scaling. And in these days of giant transformer-like machines they are probably right. But what if there are  Barry Bonds  enhancing type forces at work that argue for the chances of your needing to scale being higher than you think?
 
And if that happens, how will you cross the scalability chasm? Will you want to completely change your architecture or evolve it from a tool-chain that was meant to scale from the start? Architecturally, that's the question you have to answer. Today's tool-chains are making it possible to grow a system from small to large without needing to implement complete architectural phase changes at various scale inflection points, but that's a different topic. We're trying to think about why you may actually need to scale, that is the question.</p><p>4 0.1162662 <a title="1046-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>5 0.11436145 <a title="1046-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-08-Product%3A_DRBD_-_Distributed_Replicated_Block_Device.html">271 high scalability-2008-03-08-Product: DRBD - Distributed Replicated Block Device</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From their website:   DRBD  is a block device which is designed to build high availability clusters. This is done by mirroring a whole block device via (a dedicated) network. You could see it as a network raid-1.  DRBD takes over the data, writes it to the local disk and sends it to the other host. On the other host, it takes it to the disk there.  
   
  The other components needed are a cluster membership service, which is supposed to be heartbeat, and some kind of application that works on top of a block device.  Examples: A filesystem & fsck. A journaling FS. A database with recovery capabilities.  Each device (DRBD provides more than one of these devices) has a state, which can be 'primary' or 'secondary'. On the node with the primary device the application is supposed to run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to the local 'lower level block device' and to the node with the device in 'secondary' state. The secondary device simply writes the data to its lowe</p><p>6 0.11338483 <a title="1046-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-03-Snooze_-_Open-source%2C_Scalable%2C_Autonomic%2C_and_Energy-efficient_VM_Management_for_Private_Clouds.html">1238 high scalability-2012-05-03-Snooze - Open-source, Scalable, Autonomic, and Energy-efficient VM Management for Private Clouds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:  Flickr hits  2 Billion photos  served. That's a lot of hamburgers.   Flickr is both my favorite  bird  and the web's leading photo sharing site. Flickr has an amazing challenge, they must handle a vast sea of ever expanding new content, ever increasing legions of  users, and a constant stream of new features, all while providing excellent performance.  How do they do it?

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the

<p>Introduction: This article is from an interview with    Zuhaib Siddique   , a production engineer at    HipChat   , makers of     group chat and IM for teams.  
   HipChat started in an unusual space, one you might not think would have much promise, enterprise group messaging, but as we are learning there is gold in them there    enterprise hills   . Which is why Atlassian, makers of well thought of tools like JIRA and Confluence,    acquired HipChat in 2012   . 
   And in a tale not often heard, the resources and connections of a larger parent have actually helped HipChat enter an    exponential growth cycle   . Having reached the 1.2 billion message storage mark they are now doubling the number of messages sent, stored, and indexed every few months. 
   That kind of growth puts a lot of pressure on a once adequate infrastructure. HipChat exhibited a common scaling pattern. Start simple, experience traffic spikes, and then think what do we do now? Using bigger computers is usually the first and bes</p><p>6 0.71416563 <a title="1046-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-21-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_21%2C_2013.html">1479 high scalability-2013-06-21-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 21, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a question everyone must struggle with when building out their datacenter. Storage choices are always the ones I have the least confidence in.  David Marks in his blog  You Can Change It Later!  asks the question   Should I get a SAN to scale my site architecture?   and answers no. A better solution is to use commodity hardware, directly attach storage on servers, and partition across servers to scale and for greater availability.  David's reasoning is interesting:
  A SAN creates a SPOF (single point of failure) that is dependent on a vendor to fly and fix when there's a problem. This can lead to long down times during this outage you have no access to your data at all.   Using easily available commodity hardware minimizes risks to your company, it's not just about saving money. Zooming over to Fry's to buy emergency equipment provides the kind of agility startups need in order to respond quickly to ever changing situations.

<p>Introduction: ArchCamp: Scalable Databasess (NoSQL) 
 
The ArchCamp unconference was held this past Friday at HackerDojo in Mountain View, CA.  There was plenty of pizza, beer, and great conversation.  This session started out free-form, but shaped up pretty quickly into a discussion of the popular open source scalable NoSQL databases and the architectural categories in which they belong.</p><p>3 0.96574146 <a title="1046-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-22-It%27s_the_Fraking_IOPS_-_1_SSD_is_44%2C000_IOPS%2C_Hard_Drive_is_180.html">1066 high scalability-2011-06-22-It's the Fraking IOPS - 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS, Hard Drive is 180</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future? Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's  Artur Bergman  wants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the math already.
 
Here's Artur's logic:
  
 Wikia is all SSD in production. The new Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential, 6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past, you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs. 
 SSDs are cheaper than drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives. 
 With 8 million files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based). 
 4 GB/sec random read average latency 1 msec. 
 2.2 GB/sec random write average latency 1 msec. 
 50TBs of SSDs in one machine for $80,000.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ali Khajeh-Hosseini , Technical Lead at  PlanForCloud . The original article was published  on their site . With 29 cloud price reductions I thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change compared to an article  we published last year . The result is surprisingly little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances have  not dropped as fast  as for other other instances types. 
 
Over the last year and a half,  we counted 29 price reductions  in cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is that effect on the bottom line?
 
Last year I wrote about  cloud cost forecasts for TripAdvisor and Pinterest .  TripAdvisor was experimenting with AWS  and attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of its live site, and  Pinterest was growing massively on AWS .

<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirming  Curiosity landing on Mars , then this paper,  High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for Main-Memory Databases , has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead on in-memory datastructures:
  A database system optimized for in-memory storage can support  much higher transaction rates than current systems.  However,  standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to  the high transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from updates but differ in  how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions  never block  during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure corr</p><p>6 0.95367783 <a title="1046-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-10-1_Master%2C_N_Slaves.html">178 high scalability-2007-12-10-1 Master, N Slaves</a></p>

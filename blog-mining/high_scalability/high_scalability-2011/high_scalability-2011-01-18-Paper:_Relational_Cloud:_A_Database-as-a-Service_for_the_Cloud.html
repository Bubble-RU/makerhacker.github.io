<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at
giving a wide range o</p><p>3 0.11600111 <a title="974-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-26-End-To-End_Performance_Study_of_Cloud_Services.html">831 high scalability-2010-05-26-End-To-End Performance Study of Cloud Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cloud computing promises a number of advantages for the deployment of data-
intensive applications. Most prominently, these include reducing cost with a
pay-as-you-go pricing model and (virtually) unlimited throughput by adding
servers if the workload increases. At theSystems Group, ETH Zurich, we did an
extensiveend-to-end performance studyto compare the major cloud offerings
regarding their ability to fulfill these promises and their implied cost.The
focus of the work is on transaction processing (i.e., read and update work-
loads), rather than analytics workloads. We used theTPC-W, a standardized
benchmark simulating a Web-shop, as the baseline for our comparison. The TPC-W
defines that users are simulated through emulated browsers (EB) and issue page
requests, called web-interactions (WI), against the system. As a major
modification to the benchmark, we constantly increase the load from 1 to 9000
simultaneous users to measure the scalability and cost variance of the system.

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: The Relational Cloud Project is an effort by a group of researchers at MIT to
investigate technologies and challenges related to Database-as-a-Service
within cloud-computing. They are trying to figure out how the advantages of

like OLAP and NoSQL, can be applied to relational databases. The DaaS
advantages as they see them are: 1) predictable costs, proportional to the

to a unified and simplified service access interface, and 3) virtually
infinite resources ready at hand. An interesting description of their approach

<p>Introduction: When you're looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium ecosystem,
one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular breed of fish is
amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are not, which means if you
put them together in a confined space, they're going to fight. Viciously. To
the death. Responsible aquarists try to avoid such situations, so careful
attention to theconspecificityof animals is a must.Now, while in many respects
the data center ecosystem correlates well to an aquarium ecosystem, in this
case it does not. It's what you usually get, today, but its not actually the
best model. That's because what you want in the data center ecosystem -
particularly when it extends to include publiccloud computingresources - is
conspecificity in infrastructure.This desire and practice is being seen both
in enterprise data center decision making as well as in startups suddenly

alternative approach fits in:- SQL databases are not going away anytime soon.-
The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.- There
is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions
alongside traditional SQL databases.In addition to the options that was
mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative
approach and how that fits into the puzzle. I used a real life scenario:

<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of many of the
scalability issues that we face today with traditional database approach.I
think that the main reason so many people have come to see SQL as the source
of all evil is the fact that, traditionally, the query language was burned
into the database implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to
the traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.This view has brought on a
flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a different aspect
that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach, such as a document
model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as Key/Value query.Most of
the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject, and tend to use
query semantics and architecture interchangeably. InPart Iof this post i tried
to provide quick overview of what each query term stands for in the context of
the NoSQL world .Part II illustrates those ideas using  code examples from</p><p>5 0.71294481 <a title="974-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-12-QCon_London_2009%3A_Database_projects_to_watch_closely.html">537 high scalability-2009-03-12-QCon London 2009: Database projects to watch closely</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Geir Magnusson from 10gen presented a talk titled Cloud Data Persistence or
‘We’re in a database reneaissance - pay attention” today at QCon London 2009.
The main message of his talk was that “physical limitations of today’s
technology combined with the computational complexity of conventional
relational databases are driving databases into new exciting spaces”, or to
put it simpler the database landscape is changing and we should keep our eyes
on that.</p><p>6 0.70482635 <a title="974-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-24-The_State_of_NoSQL_in_2012.html">1180 high scalability-2012-01-24-The State of NoSQL in 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The Relational Cloud Project is an effort by a group of researchers at MIT to
investigate technologies and challenges related to Database-as-a-Service
within cloud-computing. They are trying to figure out how the advantages of
the DaaS (Database-as-a-Service) model, that we've seen arise in other areas
like OLAP and NoSQL, can be applied to relational databases. The DaaS
advantages as they see them are: 1) predictable costs, proportional to the
quality of service and actual workloads, 2) lower technical complexity, thanks
to a unified and simplified service access interface, and 3) virtually
infinite resources ready at hand. An interesting description of their approach
is explained in the paper Relational Cloud: A Database-as-a-Service for the
Cloud. From the abstract:This paper introduces a new transactional "database-
as-a-service" (DBaaS) called Relational Cloud. A DBaaS promises to move much
of the operational burden of provisioning, conﬁguration, scaling, performance
tuning, backu</p><p>4 0.90000582 <a title="974-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-18-How_to_deal_with_an_I-O_bottleneck_to_disk%3F.html">251 high scalability-2008-02-18-How to deal with an I-O bottleneck to disk?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.They're using a static server to
deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that
the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on
serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.I'm curious how other
people have dealt with this situation.Seperating into two different servers
would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the
premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created
in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>5 0.89208269 <a title="974-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-16-A_Short_on_the_Pinterest_Stack_for_Handling_3%2B_Million_Users.html">1193 high scalability-2012-02-16-A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling 3+ Million Users</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Replication Under Scalable Hashing: A Family of Algorithms for Scalable Decentralized Data Distribution 
 
From the abstract:  Typical algorithms for decentralized data distribution work best in a system that is fully built before it first used; adding or removing components results in either extensive reorganization of data or load imbalance in the system. We have developed a family of decentralized algorithms, RUSH (Replication Under Scalable Hashing), that maps replicated objects to a scalable collection of storage servers or disks. RUSH algorithms distribute objects to servers according to user-specified server weighting. While all RUSH variants support addition of servers to the system, different variants have different characteristics with respect to lookup time in petabyte-scale systems, performance with mirroring (as opposed to redundancy codes), and storage server removal. All RUSH variants redistribute as few objects as possible when new servers are added or existing servers</p><p>3 0.16691561 <a title="973-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability_vs_Performance_vs_Availability_vs_Reliability.._Also_scale_up_vs_scale_out_%3F%3F%3F.html">224 high scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability vs Performance vs Availability vs Reliability..

<p>Introduction: Where do you draw the line between scalability vs Performance vs High Availability vs Reliability?     I guess at the end of the day, we all want to be highly available, great performance and always reliable. So is it safe to say that scalability is the answer ?

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw materials like iron. Then isn’t it  ironic , in the  Alanis Morissette  sense,  that in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles of stuff?  It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.
 
The piles of stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff. Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags, friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a valu</p><p>5 0.1502125 <a title="973-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j_-_a_Graph_Database_that_Kicks_Buttox.html">628 high scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j - a Graph Database that Kicks Buttox</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Social networks in the database: using a graph database . A nice post on representing, traversing, and performing other common social network operations using a graph database.  If you are  Digg  or  LinkedIn  you can build your own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network relationships. For those of more modest means  Neo4j , a graph database, is a good alternative.  A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges (relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs) on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for relationships."  A graph looks something like:    For more lovely examples take a look at the  Graph Image Gal</p><p>6 0.14629671 <a title="973-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Paper%3A_Graph_Databases_and_the_Future_of_Large-Scale_Knowledge_Management.html">626 high scalability-2009-06-10-Paper: Graph Databases and the Future of Large-Scale Knowledge Management</a></p>

  Scalability, Availability & Stability Patterns . Jonas Boner has 197 slides covering a very wide range of scalability topics. One stop scalability shopping. 
  Horizontal Scalability via Transient, Shardable, and Share-Nothing Resources . Heroku's Adam Wiggins shares what they've learned about scaling based on their experiences building a cloud platform and the hundreds of apps running on it. He describes the next generation architecture he thinks all software should follow in the future. 
  Scalability of the Hadoop Distributed File System . Konstantin V. Shvachko writes a great post analyzing if the  limitations imposed on a distributed file system by the single-node namespace server architecture  can support 100,000 clients and petabytes of files. 
  Cassandra by Example . Eric Evans created a nice Cassandra tutorial using building a Twitter clone as an example. Many people want to see more data modeling examples. Here you are.

<p>Introduction: With the success of  Neo4j  as a graph database in the NoSQL revolution, it's interesting to see another graph database,   HyperGraphDB , in the mix. Their quick blurb on HyperGraphDB says it is a:   general purpose, extensible, portable, distributed, embeddable, open-source data storage mechanism. It is a graph database designed specifically for artificial intelligence and semantic web projects, it can also be used as an embedded object-oriented database for projects of all sizes. 
 
From the  NoSQL Archive  the summary on HyperGraphDB is: API:  Java  (and Java Langs), Written in: Java ,  Query Method:  Java  or P2P, Replication:  P2P , Concurrency:  STM , Misc: Open-Source, Especially for AI and Semantic Web.
 
So it has some interesting features, like software transactional memory and     P2P   for data distribution  , but I found that my first and most obvious question was not answered: what the heck is a  hypergraph  and why do I care? Buried in the tutorial was:

<p>Introduction: Hi everyone, I'm researching on Scalability for a college paper, and found this site great, but it has too many tips, articles and the like, but I can't see a hierarchical organization of subjects, I would need something like a checklist of things or fields, or technologies to take into account when assesing scalability.     So far I've identified these:     - Hardware scalability:    - scale out    - scale up     - Cache    What types of cache are there? app-level, os-level, network-level, I/O-level?   - Load Balancing   - DB Clustering     Am I missing something important? (I'm sure I am)   I don't expect you to give a lecture here, but maybe point some things out, give me some useful links...   Thanks!</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89154863 <a title="973-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-14-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_14%2C_2011.html">973 high scalability-2011-01-14-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 14, 2011</a></p>

 Marko Rodriguez in  Memoirs of a Graph Addict: Despair to Redemption  tells a stirring tale of how graph programming saved the world from certain destruction by realizing Aritstotle's dream of an eudaimonia-driven society. Could a relational database do that? The tools of the revolution can be found at  tinkerprop.com , which describes a databases agnostic stack for working with property graphs, they include Blueprints - a property graph model interface; Pipes - a dataflow netowork using process grapphs; Gremlin - a graph based programming language; Rexster - a RESTful graph shell.

<p>Introduction: Update 3: InfoQ's  Big Architecture Up Front - A Case of Premature Scalaculation?  twines several different threads on the topic together into a fine noose.     Update 2: Kevin says the  biggest problems he sees with startups is they need to scale  their backend (no, the other one).     Update: My bad.  It's hard to sell scalability  so just forget it.       The premise of   Startups and The Problem Of Premature Scalaculation   and   Donâ&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Mart   is that you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?     If I ever believed this I certainly don't believe it anymore.

<p>Introduction: Hi. I'm looking for a way to share files between EC2 nodes. Currently we are using glusterfs to do this. It has been reliable recently, but in the past it has crashed under high load and we've had trouble starting it up again. We've only been able to restart it by removing the files, restarting the cluster, and filing it up again with our files from backup. This takes ages, and will take even longer the more files we get.     What worries me is that it seems to make each node a point of failure for the entire system. One node crashes and soon the entire cluster has crashed. The other problem is adding another node. It seems like you have to take down the whole thing, reconfigure to include the new node, and restart. This kind of defeats the horizontal scaling strategy.      We are using 2 EC2 instances as web servers, 1 as a DB master, and 1 as a slave. GlusterFS is installed on the web server machines as well as the DB slave machine (we backup files to s3 from this machine). The files</p><p>5 0.84768975 <a title="973-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution_of_queries_per_second.html">622 high scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution of queries per second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We need to measure the number of queries-per-second our site gets for capacity planning purposes.  Obviously, we need to provision the site based on the peak QPS, not average QPS. There will always be some spikes in traffic, though, where for one particular second we get a really huge number of queries. It's ok if site performance slightly degrades during that time. So what I'd really like to do is estimate the *near* peak QPS based on average or median QPS. Near peak might be defined as the QPS that I get at the 95th percentile of the busiest seconds during the day.  My guess is that this is similar to what ISPs do when they measure your bandwidth usage and then charge for usage over the 95th percentile.  What we've done is analyzed our logs, counted the queries executed during each second during the day, sorted from the busiest seconds to the least busy ones, and graphed it. What you get is a histogram that  steeply declines and flattens out near zero.  Does anyone know if there is a</p><p>6 0.84719861 <a title="973-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-27-Windows_and_SQL_Server_%3A_Receive_so_much_negativity_in_terms_of_the_Highly_Available%2C_Scalable_Platform...html">225 high scalability-2008-01-27-Windows and SQL Server : Receive so much negativity in terms of the Highly Available, Scalable Platform..</a></p>

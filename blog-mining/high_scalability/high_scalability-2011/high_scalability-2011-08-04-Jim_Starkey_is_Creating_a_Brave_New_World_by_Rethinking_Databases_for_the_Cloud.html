</p><p>4 The other is storing fine granularity data on the server and using intelligence on the server to aggregate data to be returned to the client. [sent-10, score-0.491]
</p><p>5 One is that the parallel nature of scalable implementations make maintaining consistent relationship among data elements problematic at best. [sent-12, score-0.17]
</p><p>6 SQL databases support ACID transactions that makes consistent fine granularity data possible, but also requires server side intelligence to manage the aggregation. [sent-17, score-0.413]
</p><p>7 Stored procedures using any sort of data manipulation language also works. [sent-19, score-0.172]

</p><p>11 The other was the CODASYL (aka network) data model where individual records "owned" chains of other records. [sent-31, score-0.34]
</p><p>12 Both the hierarchical and network models required data manipulation languages that an orc's mother couldn't love. [sent-33, score-0.25]
</p><p>13 Codd's relational model, once stripped of the unnecessary mathematical trappings, was a very happy compromise between simple regular tables and ad hoc joins for inter-table relationships. [sent-34, score-0.374]
</p><p>14 The OO data model (encapsulated objects and pointer) pops up and dies with great regularity, as does its close relative, object/relational mapping. [sent-37, score-0.249]
</p><p>15 Over the years I've had a professional affiliations with the amorphous data model (Model 204), hierachical (Datacomputer), CODASYL (DBMS-11), and relational (Rdb/ELN, Interbase, Firebird, MySQL, and NimbusDB). [sent-39, score-0.474]

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: Michael Stonebraker sure knows how to stir up a storm. Unlike for others, that
doesn't make him a troll in my mind, he'sway too accomplishedin the field to
be that, but he does have a bit of Barnum & Bailey in him, which serves to get
the discussion flowing, and that's a good thing. A lot of previously hidden
wisdom and passion unlocks, which we'll try to capture here.This disturbance
in the force is over OldSQL vs NoSQL vsNewSQL. Warning, these are not crisp
categories, there's leakage all over the place, watch your step:OldSQL
(Oracle, MySQL, etc) refers to what some want to term as legacy relational
database like MySQL, that don't scale out horizontally with aplomb.NoSQL
(CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, Riak, Neo4j, etc) refers to, well,
a collection of technologies that aren't OldSQL, these often are designed to
scale out horizontally, aren't on ACID, and use schemaless non-relational
datamodels.NewSQL  (Xeround, Clustrix, NimbusDB, GenieDB, ScaleBase, VoltDB)
are databa</p><p>5 0.14424236 <a title="1092-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.12943996 <a title="1092-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-05-Drop_ACID_and_Think_About_Data.html">589 high scalability-2009-05-05-Drop ACID and Think About Data</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation
from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?
Mike Stonebraker, the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world,
hopes you get something like his new database,VoltDB: a pure SQL, pure ACID,
pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory
DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a
second. VoltDBclaims to be100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster
thanCassandra, and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.Will
VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of
ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product
with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component
in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...I first heard the
details about VoltDB at Gluecon, where Mr. Stonebraker presented his highly

<p>Introduction: This excellent survey of the field waswritten by Ian Thomas Varleyas part of
his Master of Science in Engineering program.The aim of this paper is to
explore the conceptual design space of non-relational databases as compared to
traditional relational databases. It is clear that the design needs of the two
paradigms are different, but how fundamental are the differences, and what
strategies can we use to transition our conceptual designs from one to the
other?There are a few things to like about this paper. A running a example is
used to show the different ways to model data depending on which type of
solution you are targeting, especially covering how many-to-many relationships
are modeled, data integrity, and how to support optional attributes. There's
also a brief survey of some of the major systems.The most interesting section

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.84377491 <a title="1092-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-06-Netflix%3A_Run_Consistency_Checkers_All_the_time_to_Fixup_Transactions.html">1017 high scalability-2011-04-06-Netflix: Run Consistency Checkers All the time to Fixup Transactions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joel Spolsky and JeffAtwood areraising VC moneyforStackOverflow.This is
interesting for three reasons: 1) Joel has always seemed like a keep it small
and grow organically type of guy, so this is a big step in a different
direction. 2) It means they think there's a very big market in the Q&A; space
and they mean to capture as much as the market as possible. 3) Most
importantly for this blog, Joel gives some good advice on when to stay fresh
and local and when it's time to jump for the brass ring, scale up your
ambition, and go for VC money. Please seeJoel's blogpost for the details, but
here's when to go VC:There's a land grab going on.There is a provable concept
that's repeatable.The business itself could benefit from the publicity.The
investor will add substantial value to the business.The business can
potentially have a big exit or become a large, publically traded company.The
founders are not in it for their own personal aggrandizement.Joel thinks

<p>Introduction: The idea came up in this Hacker Newsthread, commenting on a 37signals
interview, that having three system administrators is the minimum optimal
number of admins. Everyone wants to lower their costs by having each admin
administer a lot of machines. The problem is when you have fewer than three
admins you can never get a break from the constant corrosive pressure of
always being on call. When every moment of your life you are dreading the next
emergency, it eats at you. Having three admins solves that problem. With three
admins you can:Go on a real vacation. The two remaining admins can switch off
being on call.Not be on call all the time.A larger shop will naturally have
more admins so it's not as big an issue, but at smaller shops trying to
minimize head count, carrying three admins (or people in those roles) might be
something to consider.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.83067787 <a title="1092-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-04-Jim_Starkey_is_Creating_a_Brave_New_World_by_Rethinking_Databases_for_the_Cloud.html">1092 high scalability-2011-08-04-Jim Starkey is Creating a Brave New World by Rethinking Databases for the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey, founder ofNuoDB, in thisthread on the Cloud Computing group,
delivers a masterful post on why he thinks the relational model is the best
overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself
from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave
new lock free world....I'll[Jim Starkey]go into more detail later in the post
for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency
is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human
facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips
between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads
inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage
this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together
related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make
sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the server and
using i</p><p>4 0.76819956 <a title="1092-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-22-Paper%3A_On_Delivering_Embarrassingly_Distributed_Cloud_Services.html">387 high scalability-2008-09-22-Paper: On Delivering Embarrassingly Distributed Cloud Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we scale datacenters? Should we build a few mammoth million machine
datacenters or many smaller micro datacenters? Intuitively we usually go with
a bigger is better economies of scale type argument, but it may not be so.
What works for Walmart may not work for White Box World. Mega datacenters may
actually exhibit diseconomies of scale. It may be better to run applications
over many distributed micro datacenters instead of one large one.This paper by
Ken Church, Albert Greenberg, and James Hamilton, all from Microsoft, takes a
look at the different issues and concludes:Putting it all together, the micro
model offers a design point with attractive performance, reliability, scale
and cost. Given how much the industry is currently investing in the mega
model, the industry would do well to consider the micro alternative. break

<p>Introduction: In the scalability is specialization department here is an interesting paper
presented atHotNets '13on high performance networking: Network Stack
Specialization for Performance.The idea is generalizing a service so it fits
in the kernel comes at a high performance cost. So move TCP into user space.
The result is a web server with ~3.5x the throughput of Nginx "while
experiencing low CPU utilization, linear scaling on multicore systems, and
saturating current NIC hardware."Here's a good description of the paper
publishedon Layer 9:Traditionally, servers and OSes have been built to be
general purpose. However now we have a high degree of specialization. In fact,
in a big web service, you might have thousands of machines dedicated to one
function. Therefore, there's scope for specialization. This paper looks at a
specific opportunity in that space. Network stacks today are good for high
throughput with large transfers, but not small files (which are common in web
browsing).

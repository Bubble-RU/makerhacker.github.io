<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak  (CCIE#1354 Emeritus) is Chief Technology Advisor at  NIL Data Communications ,  author of numerous webinars  and  advanced networking books , and a  prolific blogger . He’s focusing on data center and cloud networking, network virtualization, and scalable application design. 
 
OpenFlow is an interesting emerging networking technology appearing  seemingly out of nowhere with much hype and fanfare  in March 2011. More than a year later, there are two commercial products based on OpenFlow ( NEC’s Programmable Flow  and  Nicira’s Network Virtualization Platform ) and probably less than a dozen production-grade implementations (including  Google’s G-Scale network  and  Indiana University’s campus network ). Is this an expected result for an emerging technology or another case of overhyped technology hitting limits imposed by reality?
 
OpenFlow-based solutions have to overcome numerous problems every emerging technology is facing, in OpenFlow’s case ranging from compatibili</p><p>3 0.12649086 <a title="1147-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_29%2C_2011.html">1089 high scalability-2011-07-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 29, 2011</a></p>

  YouTube : 3 billion videos viewed a day; 48 hours of footage uploaded every minute.  64 core Tilera chip . 
 Google wants to be your CDN. They figure the only way to make the web faster...is to host it.  Page Speed Service - Web Performance, Delivered . An eventually for pay service that caches your website and distributes it around the world. No cost information. Your speed may vary. See the longish list of  limitations . 
 Nobody said anything interesting on scalability this week! A disaster of non-quotable proportions. If I missed something, now is your chance.  
  Moving an Elephant: Large Scale Hadoop Data Migration at Facebook . Paul Yang describes the greatest westward expansion since the land bridge across the Bering Strait.

 Achievements:                 
 
  Watson  uses 10,000's of watts, the computer between the ears uses 20. With only 200 million pages and 2TB of data, Watson is BigInsights, not BigData. 
 That Google is pretty big:  1 billion unique monthly visitors  
  tweetimages : We peaked at 22m avatars yesterday. Bandwidth peaked at 9GB of @twitter avatars in a single hour. 
  Foursquare Surpasses 10 Million Users   
  Reddit Hits 1.2B Monthly Pageviews, More Than Doubles Its Engineering Staff  
  Twitter : 185 million tweets are posted daily;  1.6 billion search queries daily; indexing latency is less than 10 seconds.

  @commonlisp : Ideas from the talk: In Haskell laziness + thunks + garbage collection (GC) impede multicore scalability. Parallel GC is crucial. 
  @Bulldozer0 : Global state is the enemy of scalability; not only in software, but in governance.

 The cloud isn't for closers.  Another gaming startup pulls back from the cloud  by Derrick Harris. Digital Chocolate is following the Zynga strategy of moving games into higher performing datacenter infrastructure once it becomes popular enough in the cloud to justify the primo stuff. We talked about this strategy in  Zynga's Z Cloud - Scale Fast Or Fail Fast By Merging Private And Public Clouds . An architectural approach made all the more sensible with Amazon's new  AWS Direct Connect  service, which enables lower latency and higher bandwidth services by skipping the Internet and connecting directly to the AWS network.

<p>Introduction: Chris Dixon   unearthed a  great quote   from Douglas Adams on the nature of technological adoption that unsurprisingly hits the mark in our ever changing and evolving world:
  
 Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.  
 Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.  
 Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.  
 
We tend to think compute of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of datacenters in the future.
 
Given the diversity of compute resources it's reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API. They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever resources it doe</p><p>5 0.8307848 <a title="1147-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-23-6_Ways_to_Kill_Your_Servers_-__Learning_How_to_Scale_the_Hard_Way.html">884 high scalability-2010-08-23-6 Ways to Kill Your Servers -  Learning How to Scale the Hard Way</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steffen Konerow, author of the    High Performance Blog   .  
 
Learning how to scale isn’t easy without any prior experience. Nowadays you have plenty of websites like  highscalability.com  to get some inspiration, but unfortunately there is no solution that fits all websites and needs. You still have to think on your own to find a concept that works for your requirements. So did I.
 
A few years ago, my bosses came to me and said “We’ve got a new project for you. It’s the relaunch of a website that has already 1 million users a month. You have to build the website and make sure we’ll be able to grow afterwards”. I was already an experienced coder, but not in these dimensions, so I had to start learning how to scale – the hard way.
 
The software behind the website was a PHP content management system, based on Smarty and MySQL. The first task was finding a proper hosting company who had the experience and would also manage the servers for us.

<p>Introduction: After poking around theGoogle Compute Engine(GCE) documentation I had some
trouble creating a mental model of how GCE works. Is it like AWS, GAE,
Rackspace, just what is it? After watchingGoogle I/O 2012 - Introducing Google
Compute EngineandGoogle Compute Engine -- Technical Details, it turns out my
initial impression, that GCE is disarmingly straightforward, turns out to be
the point.The focus of GCE is on the C, which stands for Compute, and that's
what GCE is all about: deploying lots of servers to solve computationally hard
problems. What you get with GCE is a Super Datacenter on Google Steroids.If
you are wondering how you will run the next Instagram on GCE then that would
be missing the point. GAE is targeted at applications. GCE is targeted
at:Delivering a proven, pure, high performance, high scale compute
infrastructure using a utility pricing model, on top of an open, secure,

<p>Introduction: We can all learn from problems. The Google App Engine team has created a
teachable moment through a remarkably honest and forthcomingpost-mortem for
February 24th, 2010 outagepost, chronicling in elaborate detail a power outage
that took down Google App Engine for a few hours.The world is ending! The
cloud is unreliable! Jump ship! Not. This is not evidence that the cloud is a
beautiful, powerful and unsinkable ship that goes down on its maiden voyage.
Stuff happens, no matter how well you prepare. If you think private
datacenters don't go down, well, then I have some rearangeable deck chairs to
sell you. The goal is to keep improving and minimizing those failure windows.
From that perspective there is a lot to learn from the problems the Google App
Engine team encountered and how they plan to fix them.Please read the article
for all the juicy details, but here's what struck me as key:Power fails. Plan
for it. This seems to happen with unexpected frequency for such expensive and

<p>Introduction: In the post Using memcache might be free, but it's costing you money with
instance pricing! Use instance caches if possible made on the Google App
Engine group, Santiago Lema brings up an oldie but a goody of an idea that was
once used to improve performance, but now it's used to save money:Santiago's
GAE application went from about $9 to about $177 per month. Memcache is slow
enough that under higher loads extra instances are created by the scheduler to
handle the load.For static or semi-static data, a way around the cost of the
extra instances, is to keep a cache in the instance so requests can be served
out of local memory rather than going to memcache or the database. A simple
hashtable makes a good in-memory cache.This solution made his app affordable
again by reducing the number of instances back to 1 (sometimes 2).Where have
we seen this before?This is a variant of the old Sticky Session idea where web
sessions are stored in RAM in an application server and all further
interacti</p><p>4 0.66577482 <a title="1023-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-22-How_BuddyPoke_Scales_on_Facebook_Using_Google_App_Engine.html">763 high scalability-2010-01-22-How BuddyPoke Scales on Facebook Using Google App Engine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling
65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate
problemBuddyPokeco-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution
at Wednesday'sFacebook Meetup. Slides for the complete talk arehere. For those
not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets
users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line
avatars.In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application.
It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play
mechanics, viral loops, and creative monetization strategies are all part of
if its everyday conceptualization. It mashes together different technologies,
not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way, but in a smart way that gets the
most bang for the buck. Part of it runs on Facebook servers (free). Part of it
runs on flash in a browser (free). Part of it runs on a storage cloud (higher
cost)</p><p>5 0.65807146 <a title="1023-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff_to_Watch_from_Google_IO_2011.html">1055 high scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff to Watch from Google IO 2011</a></p>

information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty
free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos
available so quickly after the conference. Let's say you don't want to watch
all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen

about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new

Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make
it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000
queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good
discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides when to spawn

<p>Introduction: Inspired by axkcd comic,Peter Norvig,Director of Research at Google and all
around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving
a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful
systems profiled on HighScalability.The original code is atxkcd 1313: Regex
Golf, which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the
winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is
readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but
soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find
regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's
deliberate strategy for finding a regex.The post demonstrating the iterated
improvement of the program is atxkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite
Problems). As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the
program Peter recommends the following steps: Profiling: Figure out where the
program spends its time. Speed</p><p>2 0.96685559 <a title="1023-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-16-Paper%3A_A_Provably_Correct_Scalable_Concurrent_Skip_List.html">1305 high scalability-2012-08-16-Paper: A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InMemSQL Architecture we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to
achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to
efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps
eliminate contention and make writes fast. If this all sounds a little pie-in-
the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it
clearer: A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List.From the abstract:We
propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of
simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization,
searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation
before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before
physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms,
this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which
facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that

<p>Introduction: Hi,In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread
pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is
tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal
variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user
id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the
code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to
pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought isclass ReferenceIdGenerator
{public static setReferenceId(String login) {threadLocal.set(login +
System.currentMillis());}public static String getReferenceId() {return
threadLocal.get();}private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =new
ThreadLocal();}class MySevlet {void service(.....) {HttpSession session =
request.getSession(false);String userId =
session.get("userId");ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId);try
{doSomething();}finally {ReferenceIdGenerator.remove();}}This method is also</p><p>4 0.96199882 <a title="1023-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-05-Big_Data_Counting%3A_How_to_count_a_billion_distinct_objects_using_only_1.5KB_of_Memory.html">1222 high scalability-2012-04-05-Big Data Counting: How to count a billion distinct objects using only 1.5KB of Memory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Matt Abrams (@abramsm), from Clearspring, discussing
how they are able to accurately estimate the cardinality of sets with billions
of distinct elements using surprisingly small data structures. Their servers
receive well over 100 billion events per month.AtClearspringwe like to count
things. Counting the number of distinct elements (the cardinality) of a set is
challenge when the cardinality of the set is large.To better understand the
challenge of determining the cardinality of large sets let's imagine that you
have a 16 character ID and you'd like to count the number of distinct IDs that
you've seen in your logs. Here is an example:4f67bfc603106cb2These 16
characters represent 128 bits. 65K IDs would require 1 megabyte of space. We
receive over 3 billion events per day, and each event has an ID. Those IDs
require 384,000,000,000 bits or 45 gigabytes of storage. And that is just the
space that the ID field requires! To get the cardinality of IDs in our daily

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>same-blog 6 0.93483925 <a title="1023-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-14-Strategy%3A_Cache_Application_Start_State_to_Reduce_Spin-up_Times.html">1023 high scalability-2011-04-14-Strategy: Cache Application Start State to Reduce Spin-up Times</a></p>

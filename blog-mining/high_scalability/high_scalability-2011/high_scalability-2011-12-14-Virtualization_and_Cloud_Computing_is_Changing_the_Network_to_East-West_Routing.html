<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>3 0.16133104 <a title="1157-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-22-Applying_Scalability_Patterns_to_Infrastructure_Architecture.html">906 high scalability-2010-09-22-Applying Scalability Patterns to Infrastructure Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application
delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to
addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application
delivery tier of the data center. By Lori Mac Vittie, F5 Networks The "High
Scalability" blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not
disappoint with a posthighlighting a set of scalability design patternsthat
was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on "6 Ways to
Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way." Credit:Michael
Chow/azcentral.com  This particular post caught my attention primarily because
although I've touched on many of these patterns in the past, I've never
thought to call them what they are: scalability patterns. That's probably a
side-effect of forgetting thatbuilding an architecture of any kind is at its
core computer scienceand thus algorithms and design patterns are applicable to

<p>Introduction: When you're looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium ecosystem,
one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular breed of fish is
amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are not, which means if you
put them together in a confined space, they're going to fight. Viciously. To
the death. Responsible aquarists try to avoid such situations, so careful
attention to theconspecificityof animals is a must.Now, while in many respects
the data center ecosystem correlates well to an aquarium ecosystem, in this
case it does not. It's what you usually get, today, but its not actually the
best model. That's because what you want in the data center ecosystem -
particularly when it extends to include publiccloud computingresources - is
conspecificity in infrastructure.This desire and practice is being seen both
in enterprise data center decision making as well as in startups suddenly
dealing with massive growth and increasingly encountering performance

<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak(CCIE#1354 Emeritus) is Chief Technology Advisor atNIL Data
Communications,author of numerous webinarsandadvanced networking books, and
aprolific blogger. He's focusing on data center and cloud networking, network
virtualization, and scalable application design.OpenFlow is an interesting
emerging networking technology appearingseemingly out of nowhere with much
hype and fanfarein March 2011. More than a year later, there are two
commercial products based on OpenFlow (NEC's Programmable FlowandNicira's
Network Virtualization Platform) and probably less than a dozen production-
grade implementations (includingGoogle's G-Scale networkandIndiana
University's campus network). Is this an expected result for an emerging
technology or another case of overhyped technology hitting limits imposed by
reality?OpenFlow-based solutions have to overcome numerous problems every
emerging technology is facing, in OpenFlow's case ranging from compatibility

<p>Introduction: This and the next post will discuss how virtualization and cloud computing, as
we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today's IT
inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much
simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core
inefficiencies lie. Virtualization principles must be extended to higher
levels of the application stack, to make it easier for all of us to manage,
tune and integrate applications. Otherwise we will continue to spend most of
our time on things that don't provide real value to the business.Read the full

<p>Introduction: Update:VcubeV- an OpenVPN-based solution designed to build and operate a
multisourced infrastructure.True high availability requires a presence in
multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation
like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys
can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers. Cloud
computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling
the playing field. Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk
by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost, Mosso and other
providers.The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk
amongst the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy
Samovskiy in his Linux Journal article titledBuilding aMultisourced

<p>Introduction: It's called "east-west" networking, which when compared to its predecessor,
"north-south" networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane winds and
tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation between the
transformative shift this change in networking patterns has on the data center
with that of El Ni単o's transformative power upon the weather patterns across
the globe.Traditionally, data center networks have focused on North-South
network traffic. The assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly
communicate with servers at the core, rather than across the network to other
clients.But server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual
appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical
infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with workloads
moving to different physical locations on the network as virtual servers are
migrated (in the case of data center networks) and clients move about the
building (in the ca</p><p>4 0.79925227 <a title="1157-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-26-Oculus_Causes_a_Rift%2C_but_the_Facebook_Deal_Will_Avoid_a_Scaling_Crisis_for_Virtual_Reality.html">1619 high scalability-2014-03-26-Oculus Causes a Rift, but the Facebook Deal Will Avoid a Scaling Crisis for Virtual Reality</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

  Our stack is pretty standard fare for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily most people don't run</p><p>3 0.16234069 <a title="1143-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-29-Strategy%3A_Let_Google_and_Yahoo_Host_Your_Ajax_Library_-_For_Free.html">665 high scalability-2009-07-29-Strategy: Let Google and Yahoo Host Your Ajax Library - For Free</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Offloading ALL JS Files To Google . Now you can let Google serve all your javascript files.  This article tells you how to do it (upload to Google Code Project) and why it's a big win (cheap, fast, caching, parallel downloads, save bandwidth).  Don't have a CDN? Why not let Google and Yahoo be your CDN? At least for Ajax libraries.  No charge. Google runs a  content distribution network and loading architecture for the most popular open source JavaScript libraries , which include: jQuery, prototype, script.aculo.us, MooTools, and dojo. The idea is web pages directly include your library of choice from Google's global, fast, and highly available network. Some have found much better performance and others experienced slower performance.  My guess is the performance may be slower if your data center is close to you, but far away users will be much happier. Some negatives: not all libraries are included, you'll load more than you need because all functionality is included.

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Rumor no more.  Google Jumps Head First Into Web Services With Google App Engine . The quick and dirty of it: developers simply upload their Python code to Google, launch the application, and can monitor usage and other metrics via a multi-platform desktop application.  There were 10,000 developer slots open and of course I was too late. More as the cobra strikes.      Update: TechCrunch reports  Google To Launch BigTable As Web Service  next week. It competes with Amazon's SimpleDB. Though it won't be truly comparable until they also release an EC2 and S3 equivalent. An internet hit for each data access is a little painful. As Jimmy says in Goodfellas, "That's the way. You don't take no sh*t from nobody. "      First   Dave Winer   hallucinates a pig on the mean streets of Walnut Creek that told him Google's long foretold cloud offering will be free for bloggers of "modest needs." GigaOM then says a free cloud service is how Google could eat   Amazon's bacon for lunch  .</p><p>6 0.12558573 <a title="1143-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-21-Google_AppEngine_-_A_Second_Look.html">517 high scalability-2009-02-21-Google AppEngine - A Second Look</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John McCutchan ,   after a long career spent working on the Linux kernel and being hired out as a code optimization guru, joined Google's Dart team. A curious hire until you watch  Bringing SIMD to the Web via Dart , where John makes a programmer accessible explanation of why he likes Dart: performance, performance, performance.  
    Dart    is an open-source Web programming language    developed by Google   . The motivation for Dart is twofold: provide a language capable of scaling up to the complex web applications that are becoming the norm. Think Gmail. And provide a single language capable of working on both the client and server. Towards those ends Dart is a complete language, full tool environment, and provides an advanced Web UI framework for building web applications at a high level of abstraction. 
   Why isn't JavaScript good enough? The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause  web app</p><p>6 0.75430721 <a title="1143-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-21-Google%27s_Sanjay_Ghemawat_on_What_Made_Google_Google_and_Great_Big_Data_Career_Advice.html">1535 high scalability-2013-10-21-Google's Sanjay Ghemawat on What Made Google Google and Great Big Data Career Advice</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The story of driving the  golden spike  to symbolize the completion of the  transcontinental railroad  is famous in the US. What is not so well known is the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that possibly be?
  Telegraph as Internet  
First, let's establish the telegraph and cable systems was an early version of an Internet.
 
As railroad tracks were being laid a  transcontental telegraph  system was also being constructed. Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could ride.
 
With the  transalantic cable system  information could quickly span continents in minutes:
  

The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to 12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to 110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870, 40</p><p>2 0.94408131 <a title="1143-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-13-Product%3A_Gearman_-_Open_Source_Message_Queuing_System.html">491 high scalability-2009-01-13-Product: Gearman - Open Source Message Queuing System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   New Gearman Server & Library in C, MySQL UDFs .   Gearman  is an open source  message queuing  system that makes it easy to do distributed job processing using multiple languages.  With Gearman you:  farm out work to other machines, dispatching function calls to machines that are better suited to do work, to do work in parallel, to load balance lots of function calls, to call functions between languages, spread CPU usage around your network .   Gearman is used by companies like LiveJournal, Yahoo!, and Digg. Digg, for example, runs 300,000 jobs a day through Gearman without any issues. Most large sites use something similar. Why would anyone ever even need a message queuing system?
   
 Message queuing is a handy way to move work off your web servers (like image manipulation),  to generate thousands of documents in the background, to run the multiple requests in parallel needed to build a web page, or to perform tasks that can comfortably be run in the background and not part</p><p>same-blog 3 0.93039078 <a title="1143-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-16-Google%2B_Infrastructure_Update_-_the_JavaScript_Story.html">1143 high scalability-2011-11-16-Google+ Infrastructure Update - the JavaScript Story</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  Google+ Is Built Using Tools You Can Use Too: Closure, Java Servlets, JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround  we glimpsed inside Google's technology stack for building Google+. Mark Knichel, an engineer on the Google+ infrastructure team, has helped us look a  little deeper  on how Javascript is handled in Google+.  Here's a quick look:
  
 They love  Closure  for its library, templates, compiler, and strict type checking. Compilation is now required for good performance. I've wondered if GWT will be killed off as have other Google properties, but I've been told GWT is being used heavily inside Google, so thankfully that probably won't happen. 
  Closure templates  are used both Java and JavaScript to render pages server-side and in the browser.  
 Just-in-time JavaScript. Code is split into modules so the minimum amount of JavaScript is loaded asynchronously in the background as necessary. Navigation happens without loading the page.

<p>Introduction: Google runs queries against thousands of in-memory index nodes in parallel and then merges the results. One of the interesting problems with this approach, explains Google's Jeff Dean in this  lecture at Stanford , is the  Query of Death .
 
A query can cause a program to fail because of bugs or various other issues. This means that a single query can take down an entire cluster of machines, which is not good for availability and response times, as it takes quite a while for thousands of machines to recover. Thus the Query of Death. New queries are always coming into the system and when you are always rolling out new software, it's impossible to completely get rid of the problem.
 
Two solutions:
  
  Test against logs . Google replays a month's worth of logs to see if any of those queries kill anything. That helps, but Queries of Death may still happen. 
  Send a canary request . A request is sent to one machine. If the request succeeds then it will probably succeedÂ on all machines, s</p><p>6 0.89803928 <a title="1143-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-08-Google_AppEngine_-_A_First_Look.html">301 high scalability-2008-04-08-Google AppEngine - A First Look</a></p>

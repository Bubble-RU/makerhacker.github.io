</p><p>2 Regular system patches and maintenance fix known exploits and issues, however, sometimes it may be too late and the component has already been breached. [sent-9, score-0.345]
</p><p>3 If the system has already been compromised in a natural environment where patches are applied to existing systems, sometimes the patch may come too late and a Trojan horse or some sort of malicious code has already been injected (as may have been seen in recent cases). [sent-10, score-0.417]
</p><p>4 Example of how ATMCash uses those features for security in the stack:Our stack encompasses three major components: Front end, back end, and database. [sent-12, score-0.355]
</p><p>5 We utilize the static trait to enhance our security and eliminate the risk for infected systems that are being patched after being compromised. [sent-19, score-0.679]
</p><p>6 We have an up to date image of each system component that is not deployed, but is constantly being patched and updated to the latest security risks. [sent-20, score-0.703]
</p><p>7 We then commit any software updates to that image and replace the running image with the newly updated and patched one. [sent-21, score-0.681]
</p><p>8 We replace the virtual machines one by one by taking one machine down while the load balancer directs traffic to the machines that are up and repeat the process until all VMs have been replaced. [sent-23, score-0.437]
</p><p>9 Every CSR station is running a copy of a master VM image that is immutable (cannot be modified and is being reset after every reboot). [sent-31, score-0.364]
</p><p>10 Deploying the stations in that fashion provides a crucial added level of security that protects our system from malicious code that may enter the station. [sent-32, score-0.774]
</p><p>11 Using an immutable image that is rebooted every time you restart provides both an added security and the ability to apply patches and updates system-wide with only updating one image. [sent-37, score-0.984]
</p><p>12 It's true; the cost of deploying your own mini-cloud is much higher than utilizing any existing infrastructure, but the added value for security is priceless. [sent-40, score-0.405]
</p><p>13 $1505/month before the fixed cost of employees to maintain it is slightly high, however, the benefits, specially on the security front should not be missed. [sent-45, score-0.413]
</p><p>14 We perform an immense amount of data processing using batch updates where we commit crucial updates as a delta-update, small incremental updates that eliminate the need to update a whole piece of dataset; you only update the small required changes. [sent-53, score-1.321]
</p><p>15 For example, a withdrawal or a load of funds requires an immediate update throughout the system to reflect on the balance, however, the transaction history is of a lower priority. [sent-54, score-0.465]
</p><p>16 We then would trigger different processes that alert the customer of the transaction, update their interface, and perform security velocity checks (Checks that ensure the security of our customers' cards from being stolen). [sent-57, score-0.995]
</p><p>17 The system handles crucial updates such as delta updates while the majority of data is being processed as batch. [sent-58, score-0.707]
</p><p>18 To ensure integrity of data across the system and to allow for quicker updates we utilize delta-updates for stream-line updates and batch updates that also include more data that is not operation-crucial for data integrity checks. [sent-60, score-1.137]
</p><p>19 With a volume of millions of dollars to-date, we can safely scale up using the delta-updates without affecting stability or performance of the system since bulky batch updates would not clog the system. [sent-61, score-0.467]
</p><p>20 To summarize:If security is an integral part of your business, like it is of our business here at ATMCash, you should utilize virtual machine's added security features. [sent-62, score-0.887]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere

head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAndy Gelfond, VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy
has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the
earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and
operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site.
There's an update for this article atAn Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run
On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment. For TripAdvisor, scalability is woven into
our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture,
development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture
and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a
scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and
deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a
culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and
effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable consumer

receive more than8 million visitors per day.  That's more daily viewers than
Good Morning America or the Today Show on television.  Over a billion page
views are served each month.  AOL.com has been a major internet destination
since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.The architecture
for AOL.com is in it's 5th generation.  It has essentially been rebuilt from
scratch 5 times over two decades.  The current architecture was designed 6
years ago.  Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along
the way, but the overall design remains largely intact.  The code, tools,
development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of
continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very
stable.The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations

as-a-service for cloud hosted applications.  Behind this easy-to-use service
is a large distributed system for collecting and storing metrics and events,
monitoring and alerting on them, analyzing them, and serving up all the
results in a web UI.  Because we ourselves run in the cloud (mostly on AWS),
we spend a lot of time thinking about how to deal with faults in the cloud.
We have developed a framework for thinking about fault mitigation for large,
cloud-hosted systems.  We endearingly call this framework the "Four Hamiltons"
because it is inspired by an article from James Hamilton, the Vice President
and Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services.The article that led to this
framework is called "The Power Failure Seen Around the World".  Hamilton
analyzes the causes of the power outage that affected Super Bowl XLVII in
early 2013.</p><p>4 0.80656391 <a title="1077-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-08-How_UltraDNS_Handles_Hundreds_of_Thousands_of_Zones_and_Tens_of_Millions_of_Records.html">1335 high scalability-2012-10-08-How UltraDNS Handles Hundreds of Thousands of Zones and Tens of Millions of Records</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeffrey Damick, Principal Software Engineer forNeustar.
Jeffrey has overseen the software architecture forUltraDNSfor last two and
half years as it went through substantial revitalization.UltraDNS is one the
top the DNS providers, serving manytop-level domains (TLDs)as well assecond-
level domains (SLDs). This requires handling of several hundreds of thousands
of zones with many containing millions of records each. Even with all of its
success UltraDNS had fallen into a rut several years ago, its release schedule
had become haphazard at best and the team was struggling to keep up with
feature requests in a waterfall development style.DevelopmentRealizing that
something had to be done the team came together and identified the most
important areas to attack first. We began with the code base, stabilizing our
flagship proprietary C++ DNS server, instituting common best practices and
automation. Testing was very manual and not easily reproducible, so we brought

<p>Introduction: At a Cloud Computing Meetup, Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a
merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:Keeping Movies Running
Amid Thunderstorms. While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the
cloud, issues with capacity planning,thundering herds, latency problems,
andsimian armageddon, I found myself most taken with how they handlesoftware
deployment in the cloud.I've worked on half a dozen or more build and
deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large
organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability
that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant
software deployments:the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to
completely run a new release while running the old release at the same
time.The process goes something like: Acanary machineis launched first with
the new software load running real traffic to sanity test the load in a
production environment. If the ca</p><p>6 0.78713638 <a title="1077-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-20-Should_you_build_your_next_website_using_3tera%27s_grid_OS%3F.html">126 high scalability-2007-10-20-Should you build your next website using 3tera's grid OS?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byRan Grushkowsky, Head of Technology at
ATMCash.Virtualization and cloud-based systems are very hype in the industry;
however, most financial companies stray from those solutions. At ATMCash,
we've approached virtualization not for the usual reason of scalability, but
for the usually missed value of security.In this article, I will introduce the
concept of security added value in the utilization of virtualization and why
people should consider deploying mini-clouds for those use-cases. How do
virtual machines help mitigate risk?I am sure most of you have heard of the
recenthacking in the financial sector. Financial companies are under constant
hacking attempts and security is of the utmost importance. One of the bigger
risks in system deployment is a breach in one of the stack components. Regular
system patches and maintenance fix known exploits and issues, however,
sometimes it may be too late and the component has already been breached. If
the system has already</p><p>2 0.985614 <a title="1077-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-13-The_Secret_to_10_Million_Concurrent_Connections_-The_Kernel_is_the_Problem%2C_Not_the_Solution.html">1456 high scalability-2013-05-13-The Secret to 10 Million Concurrent Connections -The Kernel is the Problem, Not the Solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>3 0.98332435 <a title="1077-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-12-Google%3A_Taming_the_Long_Latency_Tail_-_When_More_Machines_Equals_Worse_Results.html">1207 high scalability-2012-03-12-Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail - When More Machines Equals Worse Results</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Likewise the current belief that, in the case of artificial machines the very
large and the very small are equally feasible and lasting is a manifest error.
Thus, for example, a small obelisk or column or other solid figure can
certainly be laid down or set up without danger of breaking, while the large
ones will go to pieces under the slightest provocation, and that purely on
account of their own weight. -- GalileoGalileo observed how things broke if
they were naively scaled up. Interestingly, Google noticed a similar pattern
when building larger software systems using the same techniques used to build
smaller systems. Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished Engineer at Google, talks
about this fundamental property of scaling systems in his fascinating talk,
Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering the Teenage Decade. Google found the
larger the scale the greater the impact of latency variability. When a request
is implemented by work done in parallel, as is common with today's service
oriented</p><p>4 0.98320436 <a title="1077-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-22-Spanner_-_It%27s_About_Programmers_Building_Apps_Using_SQL_Semantics_at_NoSQL_Scale.html">1345 high scalability-2012-10-22-Spanner - It's About Programmers Building Apps Using SQL Semantics at NoSQL Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of people seem to passionately dislike the termNewSQL, or pretty much
any newly coined term for that matter, but after watching Alex Lloyd, Senior
Staff Software Engineer Google, give a great talkon Building Spanner, that's
the term that fits Spanner best.Spanner wraps the SQL + transaction model of
OldSQL around the reworked bones of a globally distributed NoSQL system. That
seems NewSQL to me.As Spanner is a not so distant cousin of BigTable, the
NoSQL component should be no surprise. Spanner is charged with spanning
millions of machines inside any number of geographically distributed
datacenters. What is surprising is how OldSQL has been embraced. In anearlier
2011 talkgiven by Alex at the HotStorage conference, the reason for embracing
OldSQL was the desire to make it easier and faster for programmers to build
applications. The main ideas will seem quite familiar:There's a false
dichotomy between little complicated databases and huge, scalable, simple
ones. We can have featur</p><p>5 0.98303533 <a title="1077-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-25-Latency_is_Everywhere_and_it_Costs_You_Sales_-_How_to_Crush_it.html">661 high scalability-2009-07-25-Latency is Everywhere and it Costs You Sales - How to Crush it</a></p>

undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web.Update 7:How do you know when
you need more memcache servers?. Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache
not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed

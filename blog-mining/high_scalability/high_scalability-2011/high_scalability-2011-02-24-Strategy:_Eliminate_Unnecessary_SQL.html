<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems
to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly
increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly
using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and
gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous
information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and
ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only
SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it's true that the marketing wave of NoSQL
has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that's been around for quite a
while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all,
everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend
of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very profitable
either.So, what'</p><p>4 0.13547845 <a title="995-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-02-Stack_Overflow_Makes_Slow_Pages_100x_Faster_by_Simple_SQL_Tuning.html">1032 high scalability-2011-05-02-Stack Overflow Makes Slow Pages 100x Faster by Simple SQL Tuning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good
SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and
make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was
written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in A day in the life of a slow page
at Stack Overflow, where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was
possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for
other pages the improvement was 100x.Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of
his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the
tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:Using theirmini-
profiler it was shown that abadge detail pagewas taking 630.3 ms to load,
298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL
queries for the page and how long each took.From the historical logs, which
are stored inHAProxy on a month-by-month basis, Sam was able to determine this

<p>Introduction: Hey,I do have a website that I would like to scale. Right now we have 10
servers but this does not scale well.I know how to deal with my apache web
servers but have problems with sql servers.I would like to use the "scale out"
system and add servers when we need. We have over 100Gb of data for mysql and
we tried to have around 20G per server. It works well except that if a server
goes down then 1/5 of the user can't access the website. We could use
replication but we would need to at least double sql servers to replicate each
server. And maybe in the future it's not gonna be enough we would need maybe 3
slaves per master ... well I don't really like this idea.I would prefer to
have 8 servers that all deal with data from the 5 servers we have right now
and then we could add new servers when we need. I looked at NFS but that does
not seem to be a good idea for SQL servers ? Can you confirm?</p><p>6 0.11613886 <a title="995-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-25-Is_NoSQL_a_Premature_Optimization_that%27s_Worse_than_Death%3F_Or_the_Lady_Gaga_of_the_Database_World%3F.html">1085 high scalability-2011-07-25-Is NoSQL a Premature Optimization that's Worse than Death?

<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of many of the
scalability issues that we face today with traditional database approach.I
think that the main reason so many people have come to see SQL as the source
of all evil is the fact that, traditionally, the query language was burned
into the database implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to
the traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.This view has brought on a
flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a different aspect
that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach, such as a document
model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as Key/Value query.Most of
the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject, and tend to use
query semantics and architecture interchangeably. InPart Iof this post i tried
to provide quick overview of what each query term stands for in the context of
the NoSQL world .Part II illustrates those ideas using  code examples from</p><p>6 0.66799968 <a title="995-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-16-The_NewSQL_Market_Breakdown.html">1025 high scalability-2011-04-16-The NewSQL Market Breakdown</a></p>

<p>Introduction: G'day,I noticed the default sort order for the forum is to show the posts with
the most replies first. That seems a bit odd for a forum. Would it not make
sense to show the posts with the most recently replies first?It is possible to
re-sort the forum threads that way by clicking on the "Last post" header
(twice). It would seem like a more sensible default.I've checked and I see the
same behaviour as both a registered (logged in) and anonymous user.Cheers

<p>Introduction: MySQL Expert Ronald Bradford explains how one key way to improve the
scalability of a MySQL server, and undoubtedly nearly every other server, is
toeliminate unnecessary SQL, saying the most efficient way to improve an SQL
statement is to eliminate it:The MySQL kernel can only physically process a
certain number of SQL statements for a given time period (e.g. per second).
Regardless of the type of machine you have, there is a physical limit. If you
eliminate SQL statements that are unwarranted and unnecessary, you
automatically enable more important SQL statements to run. There are numerous
other downstream affects, however this is the simple math. To run more SQL,
reduce the number of SQL you need to run.Ronald shows how to use mk-query-
digest to look at query execution times and determine which ones can be
profitably whacked. Related ArticlesQuora:What are the best methods for

<p>Introduction: A lot of sites hosted in San Francisco are down because of at least 6 back-to-
back power outages power outages. More details atlaughingsquid.breakSites like
SecondLife, Craigstlist, Technorati, Yelp and all Six Apart properties,
TypePad, LiveJournal and Vox are all down. The cause was an underground
explosion in a transformer vault under a manhole at 560 Mission Street. Flames
shot 6 feet out from the manhole cover. Over PG&E; 30,000 customers are without
power.What's perplexing is the UPS backup and diesel generators didn't kick in
to bring the datacenter back on line. I've never toured that datacenter, but
they usually have massive backup systems. It's probably one of those multiple
simultaneous failure situations that you hope never happen in real life, but
too often do. Or maybe the infrastructure wasn't rolled out completely.Update:
the cause was a cascade of failures in a tightly couples system that could
never happen :-) Details atFailure Happens: A summary of the power outage a</p><p>4 0.70241916 <a title="995-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-25-Brian_Aker%27s_Hilarious_NoSQL_Stand_Up_Routine.html">745 high scalability-2009-11-25-Brian Aker's Hilarious NoSQL Stand Up Routine</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Matthew Might, as a first responder to a surprisetraffic surgeon his
inexpensive linode hosted blog, took emergency steps that you might find
useful in a similar situation:Find the bottleneck. Reloading the page in
firebug showed the first page took 24 seconds to load and after that
everything else loaded quickly. In retrospect this burst meant the site was
thread limited as the CPU was idle.Cut image sizes in halfwith a shell script
using ImageMagick's convert. Load time is now 12 seconds.Turn dynamic content
into static content using a static index.html file  copied using the browser's
"view source" feature. Load time is now 6 seconds.Added threadsto the Apache
configuration file. Load time is now 2 seconds. Crises averted.Because of this
quick thinking and quick action the patient survived to serve pages another
day.And in fine post-mortem tradition some of the future changes are: Run a
cron job to trigger an earlier alert. Email when requests exceed a per second

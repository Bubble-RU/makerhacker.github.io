<p>Introduction: If you started out building a dating site and instead ended up  building a
video sharing site (YouTube) that handles 4 billion views a day, then it's
just possible you learned something along the way. And indeed, Mike Solomon,
one of the original engineers at YouTube, did learn a lot and he has given a
talk about it atPyCon:Scalability at YouTube.This isn't an architecture driven
talk where we are led through a description of how a lot of boxes connect to
each other. Mike could give that sort of talk. He has worked on building
YouTube's servlet infrastructure, video indexing feature, video transcoding
system, their full text search, a CDN, and much more. But instead, he's taken
a step back, took a long look around at what time has wrought, and shared some
deep lessons, obviously hard won from experience.The key takeaway away of the
talk for me was doinga lot with really simple tools. While many teams are
moving on to more complex ecosystems, YouTube really does keep it simple. They

Internet.SmugMug estimates 50%of their CPU is spent serving crawler robots.
Having a common meta-data repository wouldn't prevent search engines from
having their own special sauce. Then the problem becomes one of syncing data
between repositories and processing change events. A generous soul could even
offer a shared MapReduce service over the data. Now that wouldspeed up the
internet.Scaling Achievements:YouTube Sees 3 Billion Views per Day;Twitter

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with Gabriel Weinberg, founder of Duck Duck Go and
general all around startup guru, on what DDG's architecture looks like in
2012.Innovative search engine upstart DuckDuckGo had30 million searchesin
February 2012 and averages over 1 million searches a day. It's being
positioned bysuper investor Fred Wilsonas a clean, private, impartial and fast
search engine. After talking with Gabriel I like what Fred Wilson said
earlier, it seems closer to the heart of the matter:We invested in DuckDuckGo
for the Reddit, Hacker News anarchists.                  Choosing DuckDuckGo
can be thought of as not just a technical choice, but a vote for revolution.
In an age when knowing your essence is not about about love or friendship, but
about more effectively selling you to advertisers, DDG is positioning
themselves as thedo not track alternative, keepers of theprivacy flame. You
will still be monetized of course, but in a more civilized and anonymous way.

<p>Introduction: Pre-generating static files is an oldy but a goody, and as Thomas Brox RĂ¸st
says, it's probably an underused strategy today. At one time this was the
dominate technique for structuring a web site. Then the age of dynamic web
sites arrived and we spent all our time worrying how to make the database
faster and add more caching to recover the speed we had lost in the transition
from static to dynamic.Static files have the advantage of being very fast to
serve. Read from disk and display. Simple and fast. Especially when caching
proxies are used. The issue is how do you bulk generate the initial files, how
do you serve the files, and how do you keep the changed files up to date? This
is the process Thomas covers in his excellent articleServing static files with
Django and AWS - going fast on a budget", where he explains how he converted
600K thousand previously dynamic pages to static pages for his
siteEventseer.net, a service for tracking academic events.Eventseer.net was

<p>Introduction: In the articleThe Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us, a lot of
interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from
Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and
work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn
in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting
the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-
in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer
specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed
development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and
reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5 second procedure;
capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git
for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem;
memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10
minutes; videos, articl</p><p>5 0.77203947 <a title="1124-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis_-_Scaling_an_Email-based_App_from_Scratch.html">1269 high scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis - Scaling an Email-based App from Scratch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO ofiDoneThis, which makes status
reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch.iDoneThisis
a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day
to ask, "What'd you get done today?" Just reply with a few lines of what you
got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what
the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and
kickstart another awesome day.Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a
weekend in the most rudimentary way possible. I kid you not, we sent the first
few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox. The upshot

<p>Introduction: InHow to launch in a month and scale to a million users,Joseph Perla, Former
VP of Technology and founding team of Turntable.fm, shares techniques he used
to build and quickly scale his startups. The post is very well written and a
must read. Here are the essentials:Keep it simple.Build API's before making
the website or mobile apps. Keep interfaces small and single-purpose. Get it
right.Build in automated tests from the start. Create function tests, module
level tests, and full integration tests. Run tests on every commit. No new
code written while bugs exist.Don't hide power.UsePebblesto write bug-free
Javascript, a library to create complicated AJAX interactions by writing 0
javascript by adding a few extra HTML tags to code.Use procedure arguments to
provide flexibility in an interface.Pass functions instead of parameters to
support complicated scenarios. For example, a filter function return a
boolean.Leave it to the client.Keep the server simple and move as much

<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word
alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and
the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world
is:the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more
dough for many more cookies. It’s the difference between making enough dough
in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.Hey, pretty close to
the website notion. Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be
tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed
to do (quoted from the article):Be Patient- When making large batches of
cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.Use
Fresh Ingredients- This is always an important thing to keep in mind.Don’t use
as much leavening- When you’re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember
to scale down the amount of baking powder that you use.Watch the spice- As a

<p>Introduction: InfoQueue has thisexcellent talk by Brian Goetzon the new features being added
to Java SE 7 that will allow programmers to fully exploit our massively multi-
processor future. While the talk is about Java it's really more general than
that and there's a lot to learn here for everyone.Brian starts with a short,
coherent, and compelling explanation of why programmers can't expect to be
saved by ever faster CPUs and why we must learn to exploit the strengths of
multiple core computers to make our software go faster.Some techniques for
exploiting multiple cores are given in an equally short, coherent, and
compelling explanation of why divide and conquer as the secret to multi-core
bliss, fork-join, how the Java approach differs from map-reduce, and lots of
other juicy topics.The multi-core "problem" is only going to get worse. Tilera
founder Anant Agarwalestimates by 2017embedded processors could have 4,096
cores, server CPUs might have 512 cores and desktop chips could use 128 cores.

<p>Introduction: Lighttpd(pronounced "lighty") is a web server which is designed to be secure,
fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-
critical environments. Its low memory footprint (compared to other web
servers), light CPU load and its speed goals make lighttpd suitable for
servers that are suffering load problems, or for serving static media
separately from dynamic content. lighttpd is free software / open source, and
is distributed under the BSD license. lighttpd runs on GNU/Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows.Load-balancing FastCGI, SCGI

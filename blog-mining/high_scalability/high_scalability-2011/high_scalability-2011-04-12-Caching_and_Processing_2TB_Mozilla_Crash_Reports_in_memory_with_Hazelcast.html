<p>Introduction: As it is said in the recent article"Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail -
When More Machines Equals Worse Results" , latency variability has greater
impact in larger scale clusters where a typical request is composed of
multiple distributed/parallel requests. The overall response time dramatically
decreases if latency of each request is not consistent and low. In dynamically
scalable partitioned storage systems, whether it is a NoSQL database,
filesystem or in-memory data grid, changes in the cluster (adding or removing
a node) can lead to big data moves in the network to re-balance the cluster.
Re-balancing will be needed for both primary and backup data on those nodes.
If a node crashes for example, dead node's data has to be re-owned (become
primary) by other node(s) and also its backup has to be taken immediately to
be fail-safe again. Shuffling MBs of data around has a negative effect in the
cluster as it consumes your valuable resources such as network, CPU and RAM.

<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a newSocial Inbox
integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-
all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store
all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer
inThe Underlying Technology of Messages:HBase. HBase beat out MySQL,
Cassandra, and a few others.Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it
was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's
eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time
Messages product. Facebook also has an extensiveMySQL infrastructure, but they
found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could
have built their own, but they chose HBase.HBase is ascaleout table store
supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data.
Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system. HBase is also a column based

<p>Introduction: When building a system on top of a set of wildly uncooperative and unruly
computers you have knowledge problems: knowing when other nodes are dead;
knowing when nodes become alive; getting information about other nodes so you
can make local decisions, like knowing which node should handle a request
based on a scheme for assigning nodes to a certain range of users; learning
about new configuration data; agreeing on data values; and so on.How do you
solve these problems? A common centralized approach is to use a database and
all nodes query it for information. Obvious availability and performance
issues for large distributed clusters. Another approach is to use Paxos, a
protocol for solving consensus in a network to maintain strict consistency
requirements for small groups of unreliable processes. Not practical when
larger number of nodes are involved.So what's the super cool decentralized way
to bring order to large clusters?Gossip protocols, which maintain relaxed

<p>Introduction: Mozilla processes TB's of Firefox crash reports daily using HBase, Hadoop,
Python and Thrift protocol. The project is calledSocorro, a system for
collecting, processing, and displaying crash reports from clients. Today the
Socorro application stores about 2.6 million crash reports per day. During
peak traffic, it receives about 2.5K crashes per minute. In this article we
are going to demonstrate a proof of concept showing how Mozilla could
integrate Hazelcast into Socorro and achieve caching and processing 2TB of
crash reports with 50 node Hazelcast cluster. The video for the demo is
availablehere. Currently, Socorro has pythonic collectors, processors, and
middleware that communicate with HBase via the Thrift protocol. One of the
biggest limitations of the current architecture is that it is very sensitive
to latency or outages on the HBase side. If the collectors cannot store an
item in HBase then they will store it on local disk and it will not be
accessible to the processors or midd</p><p>2 0.94824231 <a title="1020-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-08-NuoDB%27s_First_Experience%3A_Google_Compute_Engine_-_1.8_Million_Transactions_Per_Second.html">1437 high scalability-2013-04-08-NuoDB's First Experience: Google Compute Engine - 1.8 Million Transactions Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's Tommy Reilly.  We
atNuoDBwere recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google
Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google
Developer Live Session by clickinghere.  In order to access the capabilities
of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General
Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we
demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our
private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million
transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that
NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don't call it a
cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the
faster the database</p><p>3 0.94155049 <a title="1020-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-08-Lessons_from_Pownce_-_The_Early_Years.html">116 high scalability-2007-10-08-Lessons from Pownce - The Early Years</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pownce is a new social messaging application competing micromessage to
micromessage with the likes of Twitter and Jaiku. Still in closed beta, Pownce
has generously shared some of what they've learned so far. Like going to a
barrel tasting of a young wine and then tasting the same wine after some
aging, I think what will be really interesting is to follow Pownce and compare
the Pownce of today with the Pownce of tomorrow, after a few years spent in
the barrel. What lessons lie in wait for Pownce as they grow?Site:

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:@5h15h: Walmart took 40years to get their data
warehouse at 400 terabytes. Facebookprobably generatesthat every 4 days Should
your database failover automatically or wait for the guiding hands of a
helpful human? Jeremy Zawodny in Handling Database Failover at Craigslist says
Craigslist and Yahoo! handle failovers manually. Knowing when a failure has
happened is so error prone it's better to put in a human breaker in the loop.
Others think this could be a SLA buster as write requests can't be processed
while the decision is being made. Main issue is knowing anything is true in a
distributed system is hard.Review of a paper about scalable things, MPI, and
granularity. If you like to read informed critiques that begin with phrases
like "this is simply not true" or "utter garbage" then you might find this

<p>Introduction: Other thanStackOverflow, PlentyOfFish is perhaps the most spectacular example
of scale-up architectures working for what your average sane person would
consider a large system. It doesn't hurt that it's also a sexy story.Update
5:PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews And 32 Billion Images A
MonthUpdate 4:Jeff Atwoodcosts out Markus' scale up approach against a scale
out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as
interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his
software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive
scale up works better for his needs.Update 3:POF now has 200 million imagesand
serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS
RamSan to handle the load. Also upgraded to a core database machine with 512
GB of RAM, 32 CPU's, SQLServer 2008 and Windows 2008.Update 2: This seems to
be aPOF Peer1 love fest infomercial. It's pretty content free, but the

<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing recent AWS price changes,seldo
mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good
question was asked:How do you even do anything without using EBS?Amazon
certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability
record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This
avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as
AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS
services like RDS or ELB.If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where
to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls gives a great answer:Well,
you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that,
you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual
node failure. I prefer to believe that if you can't roll your entire
infrastructure over to new nodes monthly then you're unprepared for the

<p>Introduction: A bit over a month ago Amazon experienced its infamous AWS outage in the US
East Region. As a cloud evangelist, I was intrigued by the history of the
outage as it occurred. There were great posts during and after the outage from
those who went down. But more interestingly for me as architect were the
detailed posts of those who managed to survive the outage relatively unharmed,
such as SimpleGeo, Netflix,SmugMug, SmugMug's CTO, Twilio, Bizo and
others.Reading through the experience of others, I tried to summarize
thepatterns, principles and best practicesthat emerged from these posts, as I
believe we can learn a lot from them on how to design our business
applications to truly leverage on the benefits that the cloud offers in high
availability and scalability.The main principles, patterns and best practices
are:Design for failureStateless and autonomous servicesRedundant hot copies

<p>Introduction: Amazon has a very will written account of their 8/8/2011 downtime:Summary of
the Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon RDS Service Event in the EU West
Region. Power failed, backup generators failed to kick in, there weren't
enough resources for EBS volumes to recover, API servers where overwhelmed, a
DNS failure caused failovers to alternate availability zones to fail, a double
fault occurred as the power event interrupted the repair of a different bug.
All kind of typical stuff that just seems to happen.Considering the previous
outage, the big question for programmers is: what does this mean? What does it
mean for how systems should be structured? Have we learned something that
can't be unlearned?The Amazon post has lots of good insights into how EBS and
RDS work, plus lessons learned. The short of the problem is large + complex =
high probability of failure. The immediate fixes are adding more resources,
more redundancy, more isolation between components, more automation, reduce

<p>Introduction: SinceThe Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage was published we've a had
few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their
Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East
Region. Netlix shared theirLessons Learned from the AWS Outage as did Heroku
(How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage), Smug Mug (How SmugMug survived the
Amazonpocalypse), and SimpleGeo (How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS
Downtime). The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of
response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been
almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon
was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to
talk about the event itself.Lesson for crisis handlers: deep dive post-mortems
that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective
means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention. Amazon's

<p>Introduction: Please seeThe Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage for a new
improved list.So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage.
Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some
chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and
their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the
cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a
prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change
remains...cloudy.I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes
out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's
a resource you think should be added, just let me know.Amazon's Explanation of

<p>Introduction: Ali Sadat ofMuleSoft gave interesting presentation at Saturday's Talk Cloudy
to Me! event about their experiences movingMule iON, their ESB (enterprise
service bus) product to the cloud.First, a little aboutTalk Cloudy to Me. This
event is the second one day cloud event put on by Sebastian Stadil, founder of
Scalr, as part of the Cloud Computing Meetup group, also created by Sebastian.
Sebastian has become a master at running these mini-conference style events.
Really a quality job by him and his dedicated crew. These events are free,
sponsored by various vendors; they are short, 11-5; the food is good, Thai;
the venue is nice, eBay; they are on topic, with cloud and other speakers
giving 30-45 minute talks.  More on the event when the video comes out. I type
as fast as I can but I can't do much without the video.Back to Ali Sadat.
While he gave a lot of lessons--the integration will your billing system will

</p><p>8 What happened if the spring produced less water than expected? [sent-15, score-0.526]
</p><p>9 One reason their water supply was so important was because of a design requirement I did not mention, the city is located in the middle of lake Texcoco! [sent-18, score-1.206]

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:Almost 1 Billion Users:Facebook; 30,000 connections
across 94 locations:the Olympics Network; 2.5 quintillion:bytes of data
created each day; 80K QPS:MemSQL.In some early results Zencoder foundEC2 was
faster than GCEin their video transcoding tests, saying Google needs larger
instances with faster CPUs. Love howGoogle's jbedasaid they would take a look
at the results. +1 for competition and benchmarks. Something to keep in mind
is forGoogle a core means:  a hyperthread per virtual CPU. So that means that
a n1-standard-8 instance gets 4 physical cores and 8 hyperthreads, not 8
physical cores.Kevin Rose recommendshiring generalists rather than developers
with niche skills; don't give away your company; and thinks advisors should be
investors. Founders should also probably stick around and managers shouldn't
blame developers.IsMemSQLthe world's fastest database? BS meter on high, but
it is created by two former Facebook engineers, who should know their MySQL.

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.As I was writingan
articleon the architecture of theStorm Botnet, I couldn't help but notice the
deep similarity of how Storm works and changes we're seeing in the evolution
of political systems. In particular, the rise of thevirtual-state. As crazy as
this may sound, I think this is also the direction applications will need
follow to survive in a complex world of billions of compute devices.You may
have already heard ofvirtual corporations. Virtual corporations are companies
with limited office space, a distributed workforce, and production facilities
located wherever it is profitable to locate them. The idea is to stay lean and
compete using therapid development and introduction of new products into high
value-added markets. If you spot a market opportunity with a small time
window, building your own factories and hiring and engineering team simply

<p>Introduction: Wired has awonderful interview with Clayton Christensen, author of the tech
ninja's bible, Innovator's Dilemma. Innovation is the name of the game in
Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this
article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained
with compelling examples by the man himself.Just as every empire has fallen,
every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become
comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of
mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the
disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.He also talks
about his new book,The Capitalist's Dilemma, which addresses this puzzle: if
corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?If someone can
help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a
fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here's a

DUGDALE.The concept of road trains--up to eight vehicles zooming down the road
together--has long been considered a faster, safer, and greener way of
traveling long distances by carUpdate 16:The first electric vehicle in the
countrypowered completely by ultracapacitors. The minibus can be fully
recharged in fifteen minutes, unlike battery vehicles, which typically takes
hours to recharge.Update 15:How to Make UAVs Fully Autonomous. The Sense-and-
Avoid system uses a four-megapixel camera on a pan tilt to detect obstacles
from the ground. It puts red boxes around planes and birds, and blue boxes
around movement that it determines is not an obstacle (e.g., dust on the
lens).Update 14:ATNMBL is a concept vehiclefor 2040 that represents the end of

<p>Introduction: Perhaps it is because the whole world feels as if it's riding on the edge of a
jagged knife that the idea ofresilienceis becoming a dominant theme across so
many domains. Resilience in beings first developed when cells evolved a way
ofmaintaining inner orderthrough homeostatic (stability through constancy)
mechanisms. After homeostasis was mastered,allostasis(stability through
change) developed as a way of responding to a dynamic world of challenge. In
economics we have the idea ofTransition Towns, which emphasizes developing
local economies as a way of being resilient to global failures. In agriculture
we have the idea ofpermaculture, building a permanent agriculture by embracing
diversity, sustainability, perennial systems, avoiding monocultures, and
usingedge thinking. There are many more examples, includingpsychological
resilienceand the legendaryresilience of ecosystems.To explore the idea of
resiliency we'll look at a few sources:Collapse Dynamics: Phase Transitions in

<p>Introduction: With the Chapultepec aqueduct, also namedthe great aqueduct, theAztecsbuilt a
novel uninterruptible water supply for providing fresh water to Tenochtitlan,
their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still
around today: It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built
with high availability in mind. We findengineers being engineers, no matter
the age:It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of
compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the
bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466
AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to
mitigate its thirst.The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of
Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of
the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got
dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe while the dirty pipe was
cleaned</p><p>2 0.67922789 <a title="1012-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-MONO_ASP.NET._Will_it_make_the_web%3F%3F%3F.html">206 high scalability-2008-01-10-MONO ASP.NET. Will it make the web???</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Judging from the tweet flow, Velocitylooked like a riotous good time. In this
video on themain themes at Velocity, after a little microphone enhanced
violence, John Allspaw and Steve Souders identifyresilienceandautomationas two
of the big ideas behind building a faster and stronger web.John says
resiliency is the idea that we we don't live in a perfect world so trying to
build perfect systems is counter productive. We have to accept failure as a
baseline and think in terms of degrees of availability. All abstraction layers
leak so every part of a system must be monitorable and open to introspection.A
focus on resilience means the web is growing up. Resilience has long been a
requirement for "real" systems, it's great to see the web thinking in terms of
the complex systems they've always been. For the Alpha and Omega on resilience
you'll want to watchDr. Richard Cook'sinspiring talk on How Complex Systems
Fail. Here are some of the most enjoyable Quotable Quotes from

<p>Introduction: This is a useful post by Frank Mashraqi, Director of Business Operations &
Technical Strategy for a top 50 website that delivers billions of page views
per month.Since scalability is considered a non-functional requirement, it is
often overlooked in the hopes of decreasing time to market. Adding scalability
down the road can decrease the time to market but only after assuming
significant technical debt.Balancing performance and scalability vs. fast
iteration and cost efficiency can be a significant challenge for startups. The
good news is that achieving this balance is not impossible.Read the rest of

<p>Introduction: A thoughtful reader recently suggested creating a series of posts based on
real-life problems people have experienced and the solutions they've created
to slay the little beasties. It's a great idea. Often we learn best from great
trials and tribulations. I'll start off the new "Problem Report"feature with a
diabolical little problem I dubbed the "Mobbing the Least Used Resource
Error." Please post your own. And if you know someone with an interesting
problem report, please tag them too. It could be a lot of fun. Of course, feel
free to scrub your posts of all embarrassing details, but be sure to keep the
heroic parts in :-)The ProblemThere's an unexpected and frequently fatal type
of error that can happen when new resources are added to a horizontally scaled
architecture. Because the new resource has the least of something, load or
connections or whatever, a load balancer configured with a least metric will
instantaneously direct all new traffic to that new resource. And bam! Your

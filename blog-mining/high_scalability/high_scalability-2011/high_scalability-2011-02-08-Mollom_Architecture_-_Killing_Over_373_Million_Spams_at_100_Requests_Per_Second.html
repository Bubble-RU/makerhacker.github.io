<p>Introduction: Update:  As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change. What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better yesterday and a better tomorrow.   CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make CAPTCHA work ( Spammers Choose GMail ). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't really work because CAPTCHA solving markets ( Inside India’s CAPTCHA solving economy ) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game over :-)  Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is with humans.

<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy that  the best method to analyse spam is to become a spammer , this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.   Two different spam campaigns were run on a  Storm  botnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO of  MocoSpace , describing the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile Web; their multi-tiered,  read/write, local/distributed caching system; selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.
 
MocoSpace is a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser, ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web. Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging, music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs.

<p>Introduction: Here's an  Update On Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes Python . 
 
How do you add realtime functionality to a web scale application? That's what  Adam Hitchcock , a Software Engineer at Disqus talks about in an excellent talk:  Making DISQUS Realtime  ( slides ).
 
Disqus had to take their commenting system and add realtime capabilities to it. Not something that's easy to do when at the time of the talk (2013) they had had just hit a billion unique visitors a month.
 
What Disqus developed is a realtime commenting system called “realertime” that was tested to handle 1.5 million concurrently connected users, 45,000 new connections per second, 165,000 messages/second, with less than .2 seconds latency end-to-end.
 
The nature of a commenting system is that it is IO bound and has a high fanout, that is a comment comes in and must be sent out to a lot of readers. It's a problem very similar to what  Twitter must solve . 
 
Disqus' solution was quite interesting as was th</p><p>3 0.82310146 <a title="985-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This article is from an interview with    Zuhaib Siddique   , a production engineer at    HipChat   , makers of     group chat and IM for teams.  
   HipChat started in an unusual space, one you might not think would have much promise, enterprise group messaging, but as we are learning there is gold in them there    enterprise hills   . Which is why Atlassian, makers of well thought of tools like JIRA and Confluence,    acquired HipChat in 2012   . 
   And in a tale not often heard, the resources and connections of a larger parent have actually helped HipChat enter an    exponential growth cycle   . Having reached the 1.2 billion message storage mark they are now doubling the number of messages sent, stored, and indexed every few months. 
   That kind of growth puts a lot of pressure on a once adequate infrastructure. HipChat exhibited a common scaling pattern. Start simple, experience traffic spikes, and then think what do we do now? Using bigger computers is usually the first and bes</p><p>5 0.81208134 <a title="985-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me_Architecture_-_Synchronicity_Kills.html">431 high scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me Architecture - Synchronicity Kills</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What's cool about starting a new project is you finally have a chance to do it right. You of course eventually mess everything up in your own way, but for that one moment the world has a perfect order, a rightness that feels satisfying and good. Arne Claassen, the CTO of notify.me, a brand new real time notification delivery service, is in this honeymoon period now.  Arne has been gracious enough to share with us his philosophy of how to build a notification service. I think you'll find it fascinating because Arne goes into a lot of useful detail about how his system works.    His main design philosophy is to minimize the bottlenecks that form around synchronous access, that is when  some resource is requested and the requestor ties up more resources, waiting for a response. If the requested resource can’t be delivered in a timely manner, more and more requests pile up until the server can’t accept any new ones. Nobody gets what they want and you have an outage.

<p>Introduction: CNBC, like many large web sites, relied  on a CDN for content delivery.  Recently, we started looking  to see if we could improve this model.  Our criteria was:     - improve response time  - have better control over traffic (real time reporting, change management and alerting)  - better utilize internal datacenters and their infrastructure  - shield users from any troubles at the origin infrastructure  - cost out       After researching the market, we turned to two vendors: Dyn (Dynamic Network Services) and  aiScaler . We' have had   about a year worth of experience with  aiScaler  (search for "CNBC" to see my previous post ), but Dyn was a new vendor for us.  We started building our relationship at Velocity conference in the summer of 2009.    Dyn has recently started offering a geo-aware DNS load balancing solution, using Anycast and the distributed nature of their DNS presence to enable a key component of what we were trying to achieve: steer users to geographically closest origin</p><p>2 0.9380908 <a title="985-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Paper%3A_Replication_Under_Scalable_Hashing.html">19 high scalability-2007-07-16-Paper: Replication Under Scalable Hashing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Replication Under Scalable Hashing: A Family of Algorithms for Scalable Decentralized Data Distribution 
 
From the abstract:  Typical algorithms for decentralized data distribution work best in a system that is fully built before it first used; adding or removing components results in either extensive reorganization of data or load imbalance in the system. We have developed a family of decentralized algorithms, RUSH (Replication Under Scalable Hashing), that maps replicated objects to a scalable collection of storage servers or disks. RUSH algorithms distribute objects to servers according to user-specified server weighting. While all RUSH variants support addition of servers to the system, different variants have different characteristics with respect to lookup time in petabyte-scale systems, performance with mirroring (as opposed to redundancy codes), and storage server removal. All RUSH variants redistribute as few objects as possible when new servers are added or existing servers</p><p>3 0.93418598 <a title="985-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-21-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_21%2C_2012.html">1375 high scalability-2012-12-21-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 21, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mollom  is one of those cool SaaS companies every developer dreams of creating when they wrack their brains looking for a viable software-as-a-service startup. Mollom profitably runs a useful service— spam filtering —with a small group of geographically distributed developers. Mollom helps protect nearly 40,000 websites from spam, including  one of mine , which is where I first learned about Mollom. In a desperate attempt to stop spam on a Drupal site, where every other form of CAPTCHA had failed miserably, I installed Mollom in about 10 minutes and it immediately started working. That's the out of the box experience I was looking for.
 
From the time Mollom opened its digital inspection system they've rejected over 373 million spams and in the process they've learned that a stunning 90% of all messages are spam. This spam torrent is handled by only two geographically distributed machines that handle 100 requests/ second, each running a Java application server and Cassandra. So few res</p><p>5 0.91531664 <a title="985-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Cisco_and_Sun_to_Compete_for_Unified_Computing%3F.html">540 high scalability-2009-03-16-Cisco and Sun to Compete for Unified Computing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A recent   InfoWorld article   claims that "With Cisco expected to enter the blade market and Sun expected to offer networking equipment, things could get interesting awfully fast." How does this effect your infrastructure strategy and decisions?     Would you consider to build scalable web applications on the Cisco Unified Computing System? Or would you consider to build a router out of a server with the use of OpenSolaris and Project Crossbow as the article suggests? Will any of these initiatives change the way we build scalable web infrastructure or are these just attempts to sale these systems?     What do you think?</p><p>6 0.91228545 <a title="985-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-22-Paper%3A_Netflix%E2%80%99s_Transition_to_High-Availability_Storage_Systems_.html">925 high scalability-2010-10-22-Paper: Netflix’s Transition to High-Availability Storage Systems </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: Here's thevideo of the talk.Erick Pickup, lead developer at
YouPorn.com, presented their architecture in a talk titledBuilding a Website
To Scalegiven at theConFooconference.  As you might expect, YouPorn is a
beast, streaming three full DVDs of video every second, handing 300K queries
every second, and generating up to 15GBs of log data per hour.Unfortunately,
all we have are the slides of the talk, so this article isn't as technical as
I might like, there's no visibility at all on the video handling for example,
but we do get some interesting details.The most interesting takeway is that
YouPorn is a pretty conventional LAMP stack, with a NoSQL twist as Redis now
replaces MySQL in the live datapath. Reminds me a little ofYouTubein its
simplicity.The second most interesting takeaway was thegreat switchover.
Common wisdom says never rewrite, but in 2011 YouPorn rewrote their entire
site to use PHP + Redis instead of a complex Perl + MySQL based architecture.

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO ofPlaytomic. Playtomic is a game
analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games
played by approximately 20 million people daily.Here's a good summary quote by
Ben Lowry on Hacker News:Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday
700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is
integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just
yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people
operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated
a whole bunch of them very cheaply.Playtomic began with an almost exclusively
Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being
replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire
platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then
spread to second dedicated, then the API server was offloaded to a VPS
provider and 4 - 6 fairl</p><p>6 0.71528322 <a title="1074-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-28-Design_Decisions_for_Scaling_Your_High_Traffic_Feeds.html">1538 high scalability-2013-10-28-Design Decisions for Scaling Your High Traffic Feeds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Data mining and fast queries are always in that bin of hard to do things where
doing something smarter can yield big results. Bloom Filters are one such do
it smarter strategy, compressed bitmap indexes are another. In one application
"FastBit outruns other search indexes by a factor of 10 to 100 and doesn't
require much more room than the original data size." The data size is an
interesting metric. Our old standard b-trees can be two to four times larger
than the original data. In a test searching an Enron email database FastBit
outran MySQL by 10 to 1,000 times.FastBit is a software tool for searching
large read-only datasets. It organizes user data in a column-oriented
structure which is efficient for on-line analytical processing (OLAP), and
utilizes compressed bitmap indices to further speed up query processing.
Analyses have proven the compressed bitmap index used in FastBit to be
theoretically optimal for one-dimensional queries. Compared with other optimal
indexing methods, bit</p><p>same-blog 2 0.92759573 <a title="1074-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-06-11_Common_Web_Use_Cases_Solved_in_Redis.html">1074 high scalability-2011-07-06-11 Common Web Use Cases Solved in Redis</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack Salvatore
'antirez' Sanfilippo shows how to solve some common problems in Redis by
taking advantage of its unique data structure handling capabilities. Common
Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks
programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional
stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these
tasks in your framework?Show latest items listings in your home page. This is
a live in-memory cache and is very fast.LPUSHis used to insert a content ID at
the head of the list stored at a key.LTRIMis used to limit the number of items
in the list to 5000. If the user needs to page beyond this cache only then are
they sent to the database.Deletion and filtering. If a cached article is

<p>Introduction: Nettyis a high-performance NIO(New IO) client server framework for Java that
Twitter uses internally as a protocol agonostic RPC system. Twitterfound some
problemswith Netty 3's memory management for buffer allocations beacause it
generated a lot of garbage during operation. When you send as many messages as
Twitter it creates a lot of GC pressure and the simple act of zero filling
newly allocated buffers consumed 50% of memory bandwidth. Netty 4 fixes this
situation with:Short-lived event objects, methods on long-lived channel
objects are used to handle I/O events.Secialized buffer allocator that uses
pool which implementsbuddy memory allocationandslab allocation.The result:5
times less frequent GC pauses: 45.5 vs. 9.2 times/min5 times less garbage
production: 207.11 vs 41.81 MiB/sThe buffer pool is much faster than JVM as
the size of the buffer increases. Some problems with smaller buffers.Given how
many services use the JVM in their messaging infrastructure and how many

<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a newSocial Inbox
integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-
all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store
all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer
inThe Underlying Technology of Messages:HBase. HBase beat out MySQL,
Cassandra, and a few others.Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it
was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's
eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time
Messages product. Facebook also has an extensiveMySQL infrastructure, but they
found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could
have built their own, but they chose HBase.HBase is ascaleout table store
supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data.

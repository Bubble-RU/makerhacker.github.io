<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill wrote an interesting article on O'Reilly Radar covering the
current solutions for running Big Data in the CloudBig data and cloud
technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing,
which clouds can readily provide.Big PaaSEdd touched briefly on the role of
PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloudBeyond IaaS, several
cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes
referred to as managed solutions, or platform as a service (PaaS), these
services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce,
reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers
can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass
those savings on to the customer.To put it simply, managing data clusters is
one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we
need to think about when we're dealing with application platforms, as I noted

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: Constructing a scalablerisk analysis solution is a fascinating architectural
challenge. If you come from Financial Services you are sure to appreciate
that. But even architects from other domains are bound to find the challenges
fascinating, and the architectural patterns of my suggested solution highly
useful in other domains.Recently I held an interesting webinar around
architecting solutions for scalable and near-real-time risk analysis solutions
based on experience gathered with Financial Services customers. Seeing the
vast interest in the webinar, I would like to share the highlights with you
here.From an architectural point of view, risk analysis is a data-intensive
and a compute-intensive process, which also has an elaborate orchestration
logic. volumes in this domain are massive and ever-increasing, together with
an ever-increasing demand to reduce response time. These trends are aggravated
by global financial regulatory reforms set following the late-2000s financial

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Eric Czech, Chief Architect at Next Big Sound, talks
about some unique approaches taken to solving scalability challenges in music
analytics.Tracking online activity is hardly a new idea, but doing it for the
entire music industry isn't easy. Half a billion music video streams, track
downloads, and artist page likes occur each day and measuring all of this
activity across platforms such as Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, Facebook, and
more, poses some interesting scalability challenges. Next Big Sound collects
this type of data from over a hundred sources, standardizes everything, and
offers that information to record labels, band managers, and artists through a
web-based analytics platform.While many of our applications use open-source
systems like Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Mongo, RabbitMQ, and MySQL, our usage
is fairly standard, but there is one aspect of what we do that is pretty
unique. We collect or receive information from 100+ sources and we struggled

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:Almost 1 Billion Users:Facebook; 30,000 connections
across 94 locations:the Olympics Network; 2.5 quintillion:bytes of data
created each day; 80K QPS:MemSQL.In some early results Zencoder foundEC2 was
faster than GCEin their video transcoding tests, saying Google needs larger
instances with faster CPUs. Love howGoogle's jbedasaid they would take a look
at the results. +1 for competition and benchmarks. Something to keep in mind
is forGoogle a core means:  a hyperthread per virtual CPU. So that means that
a n1-standard-8 instance gets 4 physical cores and 8 hyperthreads, not 8
physical cores.Kevin Rose recommendshiring generalists rather than developers
with niche skills; don't give away your company; and thinks advisors should be
investors. Founders should also probably stick around and managers shouldn't
blame developers.IsMemSQLthe world's fastest database? BS meter on high, but

Architect, gives thispresentationon how eBay scales, for free. Randy has done
a fabulous job in this presentation and in other talks listed at the end of
this post getting at the heart of the principles behind scalability. It's more
about ideas of how things work and fit together than a focusing on a
particular technology stack.Impressive StatsIn case you weren't sure, eBay is

<p>Introduction: It's time to think of the architecture and application platforms surrounding
"Big Data" databases. Big Data is often centered  around new database
technologies mostly from the emerging NoSQL world.  The main challenge that
these databases solve is how to handle massive amount of data at a reasonable
cost and without poor performanc - distributed databases emerged to address
this challenge and today we're seeing high adoption rate and quite impressive
success stories such as the Netflix use of Cassandra/DataStax solution.  All
that indicate the speed in which this market evolves.The need for a Big Data
Application PlatformApplication platforms provide a framework for making the
development of applications simpler. They do this by carving out the generic
parts of applications such as security, scalability, and reliability (which
are attributes of a 'good' application) from the parts of the applications
that are specific to our business domain.Most of the existing application
platforms su</p><p>4 0.94097424 <a title="1110-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Breakthrough_Web-Tier_Solutions_with_Record-Breaking_Performance.html">453 high scalability-2008-12-01-Breakthrough Web-Tier Solutions with Record-Breaking Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the explosive growth of the Internet, increasing complexity of user
requirements, and wide choice of hardware, operating systems, and middleware,
IT executives are facing new challenges in their application infrastructures.
Rapid expansion of the application tier has resulted in significant cost and
complexity, and many organizations are simply running out of datacenter space,
power, and cooling.</p><p>5 0.9333697 <a title="1110-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_5%2C_2011.html">1093 high scalability-2011-08-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 5, 2011</a></p>

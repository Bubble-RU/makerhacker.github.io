<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with their  Provisioned IOPS  for RDS, EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model. You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used. 
 
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?
 
 Rodrigo Campos  put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he describes in  IOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012 .
 
The result?  Yes,   AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and Higher Performance IO :

<p>Introduction: In  Scaling writes in MySQL  ( slides ) Philip Tellis, while working for Yahoo, describes how using time based partitions they were able to increase their write capability from 2100 inserts per second (7 million a day) to a sustained 8500 inserts per second (734 million a day). This was capacity enough to handle the load during Michael Jackson's memorial service. In summary, the secrets to scalable writes are:
  
 Bulk inserts push up insert rate 
 Partitioning lets you insert more records 
 Partition based on incoming data for fast inserts 
  
Partitioning is a standard approach for handling high write loads because it means data can be written to different hard disks in parallel. In this example Phillip created a separate table for each day with each table having it's own database file. Each table is partitioned on time, 12 partitions per day, 2 hours of data per partition. Huge log streams are often handled this way. Other advantages of this approach: 1) fast drop table operations 2</p><p>5 0.11818278 <a title="1099-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling_an_AWS_infrastructure_-_Tools_and_Patterns.html">881 high scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling an AWS infrastructure - Tools and Patterns</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Some of us are not aware of the tremendous job databases perform, particularly their efforts to maintain the Isolation aspect of ACID. For example, some people believe that transactions are only related to data manipulation and not to queries, which is an incorrect assumption. Transaction Isolation is all about queries, and the consistency and completeness of the data retrieved by queries. This is how it works:
 
Isolation gives the querying user the feeling that he owns the database. It does not matter that hundreds or thousands of concurrent users work with the same database and the same schema (or even the same data). These other uses can generate new data, modify existing data or perform any other action. The querying user must be able to get a complete, consistent picture of the data, unaffected by other users’ actions.
 
Let’s take the following scenario, which is based on an Orders table that has 1,000,000 rows, with a disk size of 20 GB:

<p>Introduction: Making the world's knowledge computable  
  Today's Wolfram|Alpha is the first step in an ambitious, long-term project to make all systematic knowledge immediately computable by anyone.  You enter your question or calculation, and Wolfram|Alpha uses its built-in algorithms and growing collection of data to compute the answer. 
  Answer Engine vs Search Engine  
 When  Wolfram|Alpha  launches later today, it will be  one of the most computationally intensive websites on the internet . The  Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine  is an "answer engine" that is able to produce answers to various questions such as
  
 What is the GDP of France? 
 
 Weather is Springfield when David Ortiz was born

 LDL vs. serum potassium 150 smoker male age 40

<p>Introduction: Sean Hall  with some really good  MySQL advice : 
  
  Tune those queries . Biggest bang for your buck. Enable the slow query log and watch it. Once you've found a heavy resource intensive query, optimize it! Tune what receives real-world traffic.  
  Employ Master-Master Replication . Immediately have a read-only slave for your application to hit as well. 
  Use Your Memory . Set innodb_buffer_pool_size, key_buffer_size and other key options. 
  RAID Your Disk I/O . Use RAID 10 mirroring and striping. On EC2 striping across a number of EBS volumes using the Linux md software raid. 
  Tune Key Parameters . speeds up inserts & updates with innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2; create a tablespace and underlying datafile for each table with innodb_file_per_table.

<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are Oprah...     Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast" where traffic peaked at 242Gbps.  A variable bitrate scheme was used so depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as 750Kbps.     Dan Rayburn thinks   The big take away from this webcast is that it shows proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.        To handle more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P</p><p>4 0.82175624 <a title="1099-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Product%3A__Hibernate_Shards.html">24 high scalability-2007-07-24-Product:  Hibernate Shards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.
 
Hibernate Shards is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.   Hibernate Shards  key features:
  
  Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love: SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards. 
  Flexible sharding strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific logic. 
  Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your</p><p>5 0.80065477 <a title="1099-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-30-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_April_30%2C_2010.html">819 high scalability-2010-04-30-Hot Scalability Links for April 30, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I  Want a New Data Store . Jeremy Zawodny of Craigslist wants a new  database, one that can do what it should: perform alter table operations faster, has  efficient queries when most of the data is on disk and not in RAM, and  matches their data that now looks more document oriented than  relational. A lot of people willing to help.

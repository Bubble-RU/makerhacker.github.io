<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a newSocial Inbox
integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-
all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store
all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer
inThe Underlying Technology of Messages:HBase. HBase beat out MySQL,
Cassandra, and a few others.Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it
was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's
eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time
Messages product. Facebook also has an extensiveMySQL infrastructure, but they
found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could
have built their own, but they chose HBase.HBase is ascaleout table store
supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data.
Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system. HBase is also a column based

<p>Introduction: Cosmin Lehene ďťżwrote two excellent articles on Adobe's experiences with
HBase:Why we're using HBase: Part 1andWhy we're using HBase: Part 2. Adobe
needed ageneric,real-time, structured data storage and processing system that
could handle any data volume, with access times under 50ms, with no downtime
andno data loss. The article goes into great detail about their experiences
with HBase and their evaluation process, providing a "well reasoned impartial
use case from a commercial user". It talks about failure handling,
availability, write performance, read performance, random reads, sequential
scans, and consistency. One of the knocks against HBase has been it's
complexity, as it has many parts that need installation and configuration. All
is not lost according to the Adobe team:HBase is more complex than other
systems (you need Hadoop, Zookeeper, cluster machines have multiple roles). We
believe that for HBase, this is not accidental complexity and that the
argument that "HBase is not a</p><p>4 0.15636754 <a title="1109-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-22-Facebook%27s_New_Realtime_Analytics_System%3A_HBase_to_Process_20_Billion_Events_Per_Day.html">1008 high scalability-2011-03-22-Facebook's New Realtime Analytics System: HBase to Process 20 Billion Events Per Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook did it again. They've built another system capable of doing something
useful with ginormous streams of realtime data. Last time we saw Facebook
release their New Real-Time Messaging System: HBase To Store 135+ Billion
Messages A Month. This time it's a realtime analytics system handlingover 20
billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30
seconds. Alex Himel, Engineering Manager at Facebook, explains what they've
built (video) and the scale required:Social plugins have become an important
and growing source of traffic for millions of websites over the past year. We
released a new version of Insights for Websites last week to give site owners
better analytics on how people interact with their content and to help them
optimize their websites in real time. To accomplish this, we had to engineer a
system that could process over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per
second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds. Alex does an excellent job with

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>6 0.15179239 <a title="1109-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-07-Hypertable_Routs_HBase_in_Performance_Test_--_HBase_Overwhelmed_by_Garbage_Collection.html">1189 high scalability-2012-02-07-Hypertable Routs HBase in Performance Test -- HBase Overwhelmed by Garbage Collection</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Cloud-based services for all things digital will either drive - or die by -
bandwidthConsumers, by definition, consume. In the realm of the Internet, they
consume far more than they produce. Or so it's been in the past. Broadband
connectivity across all providers have long offered asymmetric network feeds
because it mirrored reality: an HTTP request is significantly smaller than its
corresponding response, and in general web-based activity is heavily biased
toward fat download and thin upload speeds. The term "broadband" is really a
misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very
narrowband of a typical consumer's upload speed.cloud computing, or to be more
accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the
status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing
all things digital "in the cloud", network providers must consider the impact
on them - and the satisfaction of their customer base with performance over

<p>Introduction: SummaryIn this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing
stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services
application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out
model.BioNati Shalom is the CTO and Founder ofGigaSpacesand responsible for
the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed

The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.- There
is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions

mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative

<p>Introduction: Comet is anactive distributed key-value storebuilt at the University of
Washington. The paper describing Comet is Comet: An active distributed key-
value store, there are also slides, and a MP3 of a presentation given atOSDI
'10. Here's a succinct overview of Comet:Today's cloud storage services, such
as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety
of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes,
fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility
first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption
keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage
service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their
data's behavior inside the storage service.I found this paper quite
interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-
value store, which turns it into what might called a key-code store. This is

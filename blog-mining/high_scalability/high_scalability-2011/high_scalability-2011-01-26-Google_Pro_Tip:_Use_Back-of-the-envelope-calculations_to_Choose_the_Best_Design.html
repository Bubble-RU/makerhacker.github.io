If, for
example, you were given the problem of generating an image search results page
of 30 thumbnails, would you load images sequentially? In parallel? Would you
cache? How would you decide?If you could harness thepower of the multiverseyou
could try every possible option in the design space and see which worked best.
But that's crazy impractical, isn't it?Another option is to consider theorder
of various algorithm alternatives. As a prophet for the Golden Age
ofComputational Thinking, Google would definitely do this, but what else might
Google do?Use Back-of-the-envelope Calculations to Evaluate Different

</p><p>2 If, for example, you were given the problem of generating an image search results page of 30 thumbnails, would you load images sequentially? [sent-2, score-0.344]
</p><p>3 If you could harness thepower of the multiverseyou could try every possible option in the design space and see which worked best. [sent-6, score-0.304]
</p><p>4 Another option is to consider theorder of various algorithm alternatives. [sent-8, score-0.218]
</p><p>5 Back-of-the-envelope calculations are estimates you create using a combination ofthought experimentsand common performance numbers to a get a good feel for which designs will meet your requirements. [sent-12, score-0.628]
</p><p>6 Dean thinks an important skill for every software engineer is the ability to estimate the performance of alternative systems, using back of the envelope calculations, without having to build them. [sent-14, score-0.209]
</p><p>7 Numbers Everyone Should KnowTo evaluate design alternatives you first need a good sense of how long typical operations will take. [sent-18, score-0.429]
</p><p>8 Example: Generate Image Results Page of 30 ThumbnailsThe is the example given in the video. [sent-33, score-0.173]
</p><p>9 Two design alternatives are used as design thought experiments. [sent-34, score-0.416]
</p><p>10 Performance: 10 ms/seek + 256K read / 30 MB/s = 18msThere will be variance from the disk reads, so the more likely time is 30-60msWhich design is best? [sent-39, score-0.156]
</p><p>11 It depends on you requirements, but given the back-of-the-envelope calculations you have a quick way to compare them without building them. [sent-40, score-0.432]
</p><p>12 Now you have a framework for asking yourself other design questions and comparing different design variations:Does it make sense to cache single thumbnail images? [sent-41, score-0.57]
</p><p>13 Should you cache a whole set of images in one entry? [sent-42, score-0.239]
</p><p>14 To make these estimates realistic you'll have to know the performance of your services. [sent-44, score-0.214]
</p><p>15 To know if caching is a good design alternative, for example, you'll have to know how long it takes to write into your cache. [sent-46, score-0.358]
</p><p>16 Lessons LearnedBack-of-the-envelope calculations allow you to take a look at different variations. [sent-47, score-0.332]
</p><p>17 When designing your system, these are the kind of calculations you should be doing over and over in your head. [sent-48, score-0.332]
</p><p>18 Know the back of the envelope numbers for the building blocks of your system. [sent-49, score-0.228]
</p><p>19 It's not good enough to just know the generic performance numbers, you have to know how your subsystems perform. [sent-50, score-0.202]
</p><p>20 You can't make decent back-of-the-envelope calculations if you don't know what's going on. [sent-51, score-0.433]

views per second, 694,444 views per minute, and 41,666,667 views per
hour.Update:YouTube: The Platform. YouTube adds a new rich set of APIs in
order to become your video platform leader--all for free. Upload, edit, watch,
search, and comment on video from your own site without visiting YouTube.
Compose your site internally from APIs because you'll need to expose them
later anyway.YouTube grew incredibly fast, to over 100 million video views per
day, with only a handful of people responsible for scaling the site. How did
they manage to deliver all that video to all those users? And how have they
evolved since being acquired by Google?Information SourcesGoogle

<p>Introduction: Let's play a quick game of truth or sacrilage: are SQL and NoSQL are really
just two sides of the same coin? That's what Erik Meijerand Gavin Bierman
would have us believe in their "we can all get along and make a lot of money"
article in the Communications of the ACM,A Co-Relational Model of Data for
Large Shared Data Banks. You don't believe it? It's math, so it must be true
:-) Some key points:In this article we present a mathematical data model for
the most common noSQL databases--namely, key/value relationships--and
demonstrate that this data model is the mathematical dual of SQL's relational
data model of foreign-/primary-key relationships...we believe that our
categorical data-model formalization and monadic query language will allow the
same economic growth to occur for coSQL key-value stores....In contrast to
common belief, the question of big versus small data is orthogonal to the
question of SQL versus coSQL. While the coSQL model naturally supports extreme
sharding, the fac</p><p>2 0.8498345 <a title="978-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Deploying_MySQL_Database_in_Solaris_Cluster_Environments.html">454 high scalability-2008-12-01-Deploying MySQL Database in Solaris Cluster Environments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: MySQL™ database, an open source database, delivers high performance and
reliability while keeping costs low by eliminating licensing fees. The
Solaris™ Cluster product is an integrated hardware and software environment
that can be used to create highly-available data services. This article
explains how to deploy the MySQL database in a Solaris Cluster environment.
The article addresses the following topics:* "Advantages of Deploying MySQL
Database with Solaris Cluster" on page 1 discusses the benefits provided by a
Solaris Cluster deployment of the MySQL database.* "Overview of Solaris
Cluster" on page 2 provides a high-level description of the hardware and
software components of the Solaris Cluster.* "Installation and Configuration"
on page 8 explains the procedure for deploying the MySQL database on a Solaris
Cluster.This article assumes that readers have a basic understanding of
Solaris Cluster and MySQL database installation and administration.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.84248793 <a title="978-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-26-Google_Pro_Tip%3A_Use_Back-of-the-envelope-calculations_to_Choose_the_Best_Design.html">978 high scalability-2011-01-26-Google Pro Tip: Use Back-of-the-envelope-calculations to Choose the Best Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you know which is the "best" design for a given problem? If, for
example, you were given the problem of generating an image search results page
of 30 thumbnails, would you load images sequentially? In parallel? Would you
cache? How would you decide?If you could harness thepower of the multiverseyou
could try every possible option in the design space and see which worked best.
But that's crazy impractical, isn't it?Another option is to consider theorder
of various algorithm alternatives. As a prophet for the Golden Age
ofComputational Thinking, Google would definitely do this, but what else might
Google do?Use Back-of-the-envelope Calculations to Evaluate Different
DesignsJeff Dean, Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry--
instrumental in many of Google's key systems: ad serving, BigTable; search,
MapReduce, ProtocolBuffers--advocates evaluating different designs usingback-
of-the-envelope calculations. He gives the full story in this Stanford video

<p>Introduction: Looks interesting...Abstract:Today's data centers may contain tens of
thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The
network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching
elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up
the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP
switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate
bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring
tremendous cost. Nonuniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates
application design and limits overall system performance.In this paper, we
show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full
aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements.
Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more
specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and
interconnected commodity s</p><p>5 0.82218212 <a title="978-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-27-.Net2_and_AJAX_scalability%3F.html">135 high scalability-2007-10-27-.Net2 and AJAX scalability?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Am I mad to consider using .Net2 and AJAX for a high-scalability application?
In case you wonder why, it's the legacy of a website built on IIS and .Net
1.1, and we're looking for ways to make the content more attractive and
interactive. In this case, it's a medical image library being shared by a few
Wikis and online coursework for medicalstudents ( < 15K users) and doctors ( <
150K users)But I'm worried about the performance overhead. We already have a
performance problem because of personalising the content for users according
to their type (student or doctor), and for doctors, their grade and

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by     Frédéric Faure      (architect at    Ysance   ), you can follow him on    twitter   .  
 
Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it’s true that the marketing wave of NoSQL has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that’s been around for quite a while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all, everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very p</p><p>4 0.12618494 <a title="1101-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-20-35%2B_Use_Cases_for_Choosing_Your_Next_NoSQL_Database.html">1064 high scalability-2011-06-20-35+ Use Cases for Choosing Your Next NoSQL Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've asked  What The Heck Are You Actually Using NoSQL For? . We've asked  101 Questions To Ask When Considering A NoSQL Database . We've even had a  webinar   What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for Scalable Web Applications .
 
Now we get to the point of considering use cases and which systems might be appropriate for those use cases.
  What are your options?  
First, let's cover what are the various data models. These have been adapted from  Emil Eifrem  and  NoSQL databases . 
 
 Document Databases 
  
 Lineage: Inspired by Lotus Notes. 
 Data model: Collections of documents, which contain key-value collections. 
 Example: CouchDB, MongoDB  
 Good at: Natural data modeling. Programmer friendly. Rapid development. Web friendly, CRUD. 
             Graph Databases    
 
 Lineage: Euler and graph theory. 
 Data model: Nodes & relationships, both which can hold key-value pairs 
 Example: AllegroGraph, InfoGrid, Neo4j 
 Good at:  Rock complicated graph problems. Fast.</p><p>5 0.12145376 <a title="1101-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.   It's 2008: C</p><p>6 0.11712427 <a title="1101-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_29%2C_2011.html">1089 high scalability-2011-07-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 29, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: So much good stuff this week...
  
 Adrian Cockcroft  Compares NoSQL Availability Models .  Let's risk feeding the CAP trolls, and try to get some insight into the differences between the many NoSQL contenders . Adrian asks how each NoSQL product will add a movie to its favorites list, read it back, and how this works across availability zones. Much trickier than it sounds with multiple writers. Cassandra and MongoDB answer back. 
 Stuff the Internet Says:              
 
  @jerng : Reading up on scalability. WHY THE HELL FOR? Because I want to know the future. 
  @freerangedata : The #nosql options are the micro brews/craft beers of data stores. So many good ones, so little time to try them all. 
  @edward_ribeiro : Soon, Darwinism will start to play its role on #NoSQL systems. You know, only the fittest will survive.

  Domas Mituzas  on why  Facebook  may just outlast their MySQL heritage: I feel somewhat sad that I have to put this truism out here: disks are way more cost efficient, and if used properly can be used to facilitate way more long-term products, not just real time data. Think Wikipedia without history, think comments that disappear on old posts, together with old posts, think all 404s you hit on various articles you remember from the past and want to read. Building the web that lasts is completely different task from what academia people imagine building the web is. What happens in real world if one gets 2x efficiency gain? Twice more data can be stored, twice more data intensive products can be launched.

<p>Introduction: Please don't squeeze the HighScalability:
  
 Quotable quotes:             
 
  @karmafile : "Scalability" is a much more evil word than we make it out to be 
  @ostaquet : More hardware won't solve #SQL resp. time issues; proper indexing does. 
  @datachick : All computing technology is the rearrangement of data. Data is the center of the universe 
 ‏ @jamesurquhart : "Complexity is a characteristic of the system, not of the parts in it." 
 
 
 Data is the star of the cat walk, looking fierce in Ilya Katsov's impeccably constructed post on  NoSQL Data Modeling Techniques : In this article I provide a short comparison of NoSQL system families from the data modeling point of view and digest several common modeling techniques.  
 Peter Burns  talks computer nanosecond time scales  as a human might experience them. Your memory == computer registers , L1 cache == papers kept close by, L2 cache == books, RAM == the library down the street, and going to disk is a 3 year odessy for data.

<p>Introduction: I had posted a note the other day about collectl and its ganglia interface but perhaps I wasn't provocative enough to get any responses so let me ask it a different way, specifically how do people monitor their clusters and more importantly how often?  Do you monitor to get a general sense of what the system is doing OR do you monitor with the expectation that when something goes wrong you'll have enough data to diagnose the problem?  Or both?  I suspect both...     Many cluster-based monitoring tools tend to have a data collection daemon running on each target node which periodically sends data to some central management station.  That machine typically writes the data to some database from which it can then extract historical plots.  Some even put up graphics in real-time.     From my experience working with large clusters - and I'm talking either many hundreds or even 1000s of nodes, most have to limit both the amount of data they manage centrally as well as the frequency that they</p><p>4 0.83585674 <a title="1101-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-21-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_21st%2C_2014.html">1600 high scalability-2014-02-21-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 21st, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the  Stack Overflow Architecture . Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up and out in the last few years.
 
Stack Overflow has grown up by more then doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  
 
Stack Overflow has grown out by expanding into the  Stack Exchange Network , which includes Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.
 
What hasn't changed is Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been handling their growth:  Stack Exchange’s Architecture in Bullet Points ,  Stack Overflow’s New York Data Center ,  Designing For Scalability of Manageme</p><p>6 0.83390629 <a title="1101-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-28-How_Next_Big_Sound_Tracks_Over_a_Trillion_Song_Plays%2C_Likes%2C_and_More_Using_a_Version_Control_System_for_Hadoop_Data.html">1586 high scalability-2014-01-28-How Next Big Sound Tracks Over a Trillion Song Plays, Likes, and More Using a Version Control System for Hadoop Data</a></p>

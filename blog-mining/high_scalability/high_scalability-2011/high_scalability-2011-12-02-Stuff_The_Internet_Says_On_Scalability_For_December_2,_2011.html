<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are
hired at many software companies...Agency: So sorry you had to wait in the
reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally
found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you
may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our
manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so
I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?Applicant: I
drive a 2008 Subaru.Agency: That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent
you.Applicant: That's OK. Any car will do.Agency: No, we can only take on
clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way.
There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take
a chance.Applicant: I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been
driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt. Agency: We

<p>Introduction: I've been getting asked about this a lot lately so I figured I'd just blog
about it. Products like WebSphere eXtreme Scale work by taking a dataset,
partitioning it using a key and then assigning those partitions to a number of
JVMs. Each partition usually has a primary and a replica. These 'shards' are
assigned to JVMs. A transactional application typically interacts with the
data on a single partition at a time. This means the transaction is executed
in a single JVM. A server box will be able to do M of those transactions per
second and it scales because N boxes does MN (M multiplied by N) transactions
per second. Increase N, you get more transactions per second. Availability is
very good because a transaction only depends on 1 of the N servers that are
currently online. Any of the other (N-1) servers can go down or fail with no
impact on the transaction. So, single partition transactions can scale
indefinitely from a throughput point of view, offer very consistent response
times and</p><p>6 0.070970438 <a title="1150-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-02-xkcd%3A_How_Standards_Proliferate%3A.html">1571 high scalability-2014-01-02-xkcd: How Standards Proliferate:</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and
there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of
the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet
tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are
Oprah...Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart
Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast"
where traffic peaked at 242Gbps. A variable bitrate scheme was used so
depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as
750Kbps.Dan Rayburn thinksThe big take away from this webcast is that it shows
proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those
who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions
and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.breakTo handle
more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P
streaming, or us</p><p>4 0.52835166 <a title="1150-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-27-Hidden_History%3A_Driving_the_Last_Spike_of_the_Transcontinental_Railroad_was_an_Early_Version_of_the_Internet_of_Things.html">1555 high scalability-2013-11-27-Hidden History: Driving the Last Spike of the Transcontinental Railroad was an Early Version of the Internet of Things</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

<p>Introduction: Cloud-based services for all things digital will either drive - or die by -
bandwidthConsumers, by definition, consume. In the realm of the Internet, they
consume far more than they produce. Or so it's been in the past. Broadband
connectivity across all providers have long offered asymmetric network feeds
because it mirrored reality: an HTTP request is significantly smaller than its
corresponding response, and in general web-based activity is heavily biased
toward fat download and thin upload speeds. The term "broadband" is really a
misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very
narrowband of a typical consumer's upload speed.cloud computing, or to be more
accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the
status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing
all things digital "in the cloud", network providers must consider the impact
on them - and the satisfaction of their customer base with performance over

<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle
traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch
or other very popular websites frontpage).Regular hosting companies
(especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get
crushed under the load in short time.But there is hope. A new breed of hosting
companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability
you need at a fraction of the cost.Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!”
(or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same
thing).Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting
companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of
them).Read the entire article aboutCloud computing, grid computing, utility

<p>Introduction: Google App Engine (GAE) is focused on making development easy, but limits your
options. Amazon Web Services is focused on making development flexible, but
complicates the development process. Real enterprise applications require both
of these paradigms to achieve successâ&euro;Ś What we really want is the flexibility
of AWS and the simplicity of GAE.For the rest of the post see

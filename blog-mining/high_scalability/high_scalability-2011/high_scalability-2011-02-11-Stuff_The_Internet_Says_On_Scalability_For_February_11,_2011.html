<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: Should you pay more in the cloud or pay less for bare metal in the datacenter? This is a crucial decision point facing startups today. Which way should you go? In this  Webpulp.tv interview   , Joe Stump, always a go-to guy when you need a metric ass-ton (a favorite expression of Joe’s) of good advice on cutting edge practices for the modern startup, laughs at conventional wisdom by saying  the cloud is really not more expensive than bare metal. 
 
The argument for a cheaper cloud has a three main points:
  
   Raw Hardware Costs are Close . Buying hardware is cheaper than renting hardware from Amazon, but it’s close when you consider  reserved instances . A reserved instance costs about $250 a year and a new server costs about $1500.  Let’s say Amazon is 30% slower. That means for a cluster of 20 machines you would need a another 7 servers. This takes 10 minutes and 4 button clicks to provision on the cloud (the advantage of a scale-out architecture + automation + cloud aware tools).</p><p>4 0.12265969 <a title="988-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

 How can you resist a story about  Lady Gaga and BigData ? BigData magic helps convert her more than 31 million Twitter followers and over 51 million Facebook followers into sales by creating more intimate communities of little monsters. While Twitter, Google, Apple, and Facebook are all concentrating on eviscerating the middleman, Lady Gaga wants to cut them all out of the action too. Reap and sow. Reap and sow.

<p>Introduction: Judging from the tweet flow,  Velocity  looked like a riotous good time. In this video on the  main themes  at Velocity, after a little microphone enhanced violence, John Allspaw and Steve Souders identify  resilience  and  automation  as two of the big ideas behind building a faster and stronger web.
 
John says resiliency is the idea that we we don't live in a perfect world so trying to build perfect systems is counter productive. We have to accept failure as a baseline and think in terms of degrees of availability. All abstraction layers leak so every part of a system must be monitorable and open to introspection.
 
A focus on resilience means the web is growing up. Resilience has long been a requirement for "real" systems, it's great to see the web thinking in terms of the complex systems they've always been. For the Alpha and Omega on resilience you'll want to watch  Dr. Richard Cook's  inspiring talk on  How Complex Systems Fail .

  Super Bowl Prediction : Pittsburgh 27, Green Bay 24. I'll be rooting for Green Bay, but the Pittsburgh defense will eventually win the day, beating back the fleet footed, quick tossing, and sharp shooting Aaron Rodgers. Roethlisberger will make exactly 3 plays that matter, but they'll be the right 3 plays.

<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are you still the same person?
 
The  Ise Grand Shrine  has been in continuous existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then dismantled.
 
Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that imperative.
 
You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed in each new environment.

<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation  Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation , offers to help us  break free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of autonomous but interconnected machines .  We can do this by  organizing computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.  The abstract from his thesis is : 
  In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected with stateful storage</p><p>3 0.91017169 <a title="988-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-18-Robert_Scoble%27s_Rules_for_Successfully_Scaling_Startups.html">352 high scalability-2008-07-18-Robert Scoble's Rules for Successfully Scaling Startups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignant   FriendFeed thread   commiserating PodTech's unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup. Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with them:       Have a story.   Have everyone on board with that story.   If anyone goes off of that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.   Make sure people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.   Work ONLY for a leader who will make the tough decisions.   Build a place where excellence is expected, allowed, and is enabled.   Fire idiots quickly.   If your engineering team can't give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only things that are measured ever get improved.   When your stars aren't listened to the company is in trouble.

<p>Introduction: Lightcloud is a distributed and persistent   key-value database   from   Plurk.com  . Performance is said to be comparable to memcached. It's different than   memcachedb   because it scales out horizontally by adding new nodes. It's different than memcached because it persists to disk, it's not just a cache. Now you have   one more option   in the never ending quest to ditch the RDBMS.     Their website does a nice job explaining the system:       Built on Tokyo Tyrant. One of the fastest key-value databases [benchmark]. Tokyo Tyrant has been in development for many years and is used in production by Plurk.com, mixi.jp and scribd.com (to name a few)...   Great performance (comparable to memcached!)   Can store millions of keys on very few servers - tested in production   Scale out by just adding nodes   Nodes are replicated via master-master replication.

<p>Introduction: If you are interested in future foward OS designs then you might find  Akaros  worth a look. It's an operating system designed for many-core architectures and large-scale SMP systems, with the goals of:
  
 Providing better support for parallel and high-performance applications 
 Scaling the operating system to a large number of cores  
  
A more indepth explanation of the motiviation behind Akaros can be found in  Improving Per-Node Efﬁciency in the Datacenter with NewOS Abstractions  by Barret Rhoden, Kevin Klues, David Zhu, and Eric Brewer.
 
The abstract:
  We believe datacenters can beneﬁt from more focus on per-node efﬁciency, performance, and predictability, versus the more common focus so far on scalability to a large number of nodes. Improving per-node efﬁciency decreases costs and fault recovery because fewer nodes are required for the same amount of work. We believe that the use of complex, general-purpose operating systems is a key contributing factor to these inefﬁciencies</p><p>same-blog 6 0.86332643 <a title="988-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_11%2C_2011.html">988 high scalability-2011-02-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 11, 2011</a></p>

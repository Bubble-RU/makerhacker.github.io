<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>4 0.14851844 <a title="1080-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-05-Drop_ACID_and_Think_About_Data.html">589 high scalability-2009-05-05-Drop ACID and Think About Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi
Media, Inc:Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS
data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape
of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve
performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom
filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or
document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide
for yourself.Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the
key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database
offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me
after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your
options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)An interesting
observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal to large</p><p>5 0.14408545 <a title="1080-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across
data centers, then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so
there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What
isChironFSand how does it work?Adapted from the ChironFS website:The Chiron
Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of
failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using
replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not
FILESYSTEMS.Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it
is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other
server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many
servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become
a real nightmare!</p><p>2 0.97042888 <a title="1080-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>

challenging task. RecentlyHazelcastteam deployed a demo application on Amazon
EC2 platform to show how Hazelcast p2p cluster scales and screen recorded the
entire process from deployment to monitoring.Hazelcast is open source (Apache
License), transactional, distributed caching solution for Java. It is a little
more than a cache though as it provides distributed implementation of map,
multimap, queue, topic, lock and executor service. Details of running 100 node

<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research is a paper presented
atHotOS XIII, the place where researchers talk about making potential futures
happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by
Matt Welsh: Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa.In the VM/cloud age I
question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly
against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out
the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS
holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the
OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between
legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but
one possible future.Introduction:For too long, operating systems researchers
and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished
out. With occasional exceptions (e.g., virtualization support), architecture</p><p>5 0.95739758 <a title="1080-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-27-Product%3A_Sequoia_Database_Clustering_Technology.html">102 high scalability-2007-09-27-Product: Sequoia Database Clustering Technology</a></p>

balancing and failover services for any database. Sequoia is the continuation
of the C-JDBC project. The database is distributed and replicated among
several nodes and Sequoia balances the queries among these nodes. Sequoia
handles node and network failures with transparent failover. It also provides
support for hot recovery, online maintenance operations and online
upgrades.Features in a nutshellNo modification of existing applications or
databases.Operational with any database providing a JDBC driver.High
availability provided by advanced RAIDb technology.Transparent failover and
recovery capabilities.Performance scalability with unique load balancing and
query result caching features.Integrated JMX-based administration and

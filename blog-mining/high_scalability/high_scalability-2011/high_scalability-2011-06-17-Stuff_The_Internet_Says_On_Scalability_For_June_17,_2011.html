<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,EhcacheTerracotta Inc.Note:
this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are
still generally valid and useful.The legendary Moore's Law, which states that
the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every two years, has held true since 1965. It
follows that integrated circuits will continue to get smaller, with chip
fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm process (1). Users of big iron
hardware, or servers that are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity,
benefit from this trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful
over time. At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum
mechanics will preclude further density increases.At the same time, low-cost
commodity hardware influences enterprise architects to scale their
applications horizontally, where processing is spread across clusters of low-
cost commodity serv</p><p>3 0.12791137 <a title="1063-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word
alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and
the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world
is:the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more
dough for many more cookies. It’s the difference between making enough dough
in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.Hey, pretty close to
the website notion. Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be
tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed
to do (quoted from the article):Be Patient- When making large batches of
cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.Use
Fresh Ingredients- This is always an important thing to keep in mind.Don’t use
as much leavening- When you’re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember
to scale down the amount of baking powder that you use.Watch the spice- As a

<p>Introduction: The ever amazingslime moldis not the only way to solve complex compute
problems without performing calculations. There is another:soap film.
Unfortunately for soap film it isn't nearly as photogenic as slime mold, all
we get are boring looking pictures, but the underlying idea is still
fascinating and ten times less spooky.As a quick introduction we'll lean on
Long Ouyang, who has really straightforward  explanation of how soap film
works inApproaching P=NP: Can Soap Bubbles Solve The Steiner Tree Problem In
Polynomial.It's computers, so playing the role of the motivating graph problem
we have theSteiner tree problem, which Ouyang explains as:Find the minimum
spanning tree for a bunch of vertices, given that you can add additional
points.Soap helps solve this problem because:Soap, in water, acts a
surfactant, which decreases the surface tension in water.This acts to minimize
the surface energy of the liquid.This should minimize surface area (graph
weight), and solve the problem.Dip two</p><p>4 0.89608687 <a title="1063-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-13-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_13%2C_2013.html">1516 high scalability-2013-09-13-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 13, 2013</a></p>

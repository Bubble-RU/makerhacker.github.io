<p>Introduction: If you are aninsect, don't work at TripAdvisor, specialization is out. One of
the most commented on strategies from theTripAdvisor architecture article is
their rather opinionated take on the role of engineers in the
organization.Typically engineers live in a box. They are specialized, they do
database work and not much else, and they just do programming, not much else.
TripAdvisor takes the road less traveled:Engineers work across entire stack-
HTML, CSS, JS, Java, scripting. If you do not know something, you learn it.
The only thing that gets in the way of delivering your project is you, as you
are expected to work at all levels - design, code, test, monitoring, CSS, JS,
Java, SQL, scripting.We do not have "architects."  At TripAdvisor, if you
design something, your code it, and if you code it you test it. Engineers who
do not like to go outside their comfort zone, or who feel certain work is
"beneath" them will simply get in the way.A radical take for an established
organization.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAndy Gelfond, VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy
has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the
earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and
operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site.
There's an update for this article atAn Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run
On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment. For TripAdvisor, scalability is woven into
our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture,
development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture
and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a
scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and
deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a
culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and
effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable consumer

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ali Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead at
PlanForCloud.com.  I read a recent blog post about TripAdvisor's experiment
with AWS where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a
replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on
Pinterest's massive growth on AWS. These blogs highlighted exactly the types
of questions we're interested in, mainly:How much would it cost to deploy
System X on Cloud Y? e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the
AWS US-East cloud?Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y? e.g.
would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances,
different cloud providers...What happens to costs when the system grows? e.g.
Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate
of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?I created a couple
of deployments in PlanForCloud to explore these questions and the results are
very interesting - th</p><p>5 0.17350876 <a title="1059-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-24-Update_on_How_29_Cloud_Price_Drops_Changed_the_Bottom_Line_of_TripAdvisor_and_Pinterest_-_Results_Mixed.html">1480 high scalability-2013-06-24-Update on How 29 Cloud Price Drops Changed the Bottom Line of TripAdvisor and Pinterest - Results Mixed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAli Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead atPlanForCloud. The
original article was publishedon their site. With 29 cloud price reductions I
thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change
compared to an articlewe published last year. The result is surprisingly
little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances havenot dropped
as fastas for other other instances types.Over the last year and a half,we
counted 29 price reductionsin cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute
Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct
effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is
that effect on the bottom line?Last year I wrote aboutcloud cost forecasts for
TripAdvisor and Pinterest.TripAdvisor was experimenting with AWSand attempted
to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of its live site,
andPinterest was growing massively on AWS. In the wake of the cloud providers'

we moved to a cluster of six quad core Xeons with 8GB RAM for webheads that
all boot off a central NFS (Network File System) root, with the capability of
adding more webheads as needed," . They also "added two 16GB eight-core Xeons
and a 6Ă&mdash;73GB RAID-10 array for database files running a MySQL master/slave

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>2 0.86734468 <a title="1059-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex_Architecture.html">258 high scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Anatomy of a crash in a new part of Yandex written in Django. Writing
to a magic session variable caused an unexpected write into an InnoDB database
on every request. Writes took 6-7 seconds because of index rebuilding. Lots of
useful details on the sizing of their system, what went wrong, and how they
fixed it.Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their
search index. We only know a few fun facts about how they do things, nothing
at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I
thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with
Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:3.5 billion pages in the search
index.Over several thousand servers.35 million searches a day.Several data
centers around Russia.Two-layer architecture.The database is split in pieces
and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database
servers and brings it together for the user.Languages used: c++, perl, some

<p>Introduction: In It's Time for Low Latency  Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's
time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency
datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for
programarchitectures will be revolutionary.  Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished
Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer
resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are
interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter
into single computer. Abstract from the paper:The operating systems community
has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays
in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs
round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will
be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation
delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it
will be up to us to ﬁnish the job and see</p><p>same-blog 4 0.83520067 <a title="1059-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-14-A_TripAdvisor_Short.html">1059 high scalability-2011-06-14-A TripAdvisor Short</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes I get article proposals and then there's no follow up. Though these
TripAdvisor data points are from 2010, I thought them worth sharing:Our site
serves in excess of 100M dynamically generated page view a day (all media and
static content goes through CDN), and we do this with about 100 machines, no
single point of failure, supported by distributed service architecture that
that responds to over 2B requests a day, and a data warehouse of over 20TB
that is used to drive email campaigns, SEM, and general reporting. We are a
Linux/Java/Apache/Tomcat/Postgres/Lucene shop, and have built our own
distributed computing architecture. We also maintain duplicate data centers
(one active, one standby) for redundancy and maintenance purposes.Too bad, it
sounds like it would have been a good article.Related Articles A new twist on

<p>Introduction: With the success ofNeo4jas a graph database in the NoSQL revolution, it's
interesting to see another graph database,HyperGraphDB, in the mix. Their
quick blurb on HyperGraphDB says it is a:general purpose, extensible,
portable, distributed, embeddable, open-source data storage mechanism. It is a
graph database designed specifically for artificial intelligence and semantic
web projects, it can also be used as an embedded object-oriented database for
projects of all sizes.From theNoSQL Archivethe summary on HyperGraphDB is:
API:Java(and Java Langs), Written in:Java,  Query Method:Javaor P2P,
Replication:P2P, Concurrency:STM, Misc: Open-Source, Especially for AI and
Semantic Web.So it has some interesting features, like software transactional
memory andP2P  for data distribution, but I found that my first and most
obvious question was not answered: what the heck is ahypergraphand why do I
care? Buried in the tutorial was:A HyperGraphDB database is a generalized

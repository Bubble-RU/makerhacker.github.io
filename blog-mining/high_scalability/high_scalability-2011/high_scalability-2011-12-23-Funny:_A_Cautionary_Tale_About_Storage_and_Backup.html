<p>Introduction: Should you pay more in the cloud or pay less for bare metal in the datacenter?
This is a crucial decision point facing startups today. Which way should you
go? In thisWebpulp.tv interview, Joe Stump, always a go-to guy when you need a
metric ass-ton (a favorite expression of Joe's) of good advice on cutting edge
practices for the modern startup, laughs at conventional wisdom by sayingthe
cloud is really not more expensive than bare metal.The argument for a cheaper
cloud has a three main points:Raw Hardware Costs are Close. Buying hardware is
cheaper than renting hardware from Amazon, but it's close when you
considerreserved instances. A reserved instance costs about $250 a year and a
new server costs about $1500. Let's say Amazon is 30% slower. That means for a
cluster of 20 machines you would need a another 7 servers. This takes 10
minutes and 4 button clicks to provision on the cloud (the advantage of a
scale-out architecture + automation + cloud aware tools). So 7 extra servers

<p>Introduction: Joe Stump, Lead Architect at Digg, gavethis presentationat the Web 2.0 Expo. I
couldn't find the actual presentation, but fortunatelyKris Jordantook some
great notes. That's how key moments in history are accidentally captured
forever. Joe was also kind enough to respond to my email questions with a
phone call.In this first part of the post Joe shares some timeless wisdom that
you may or may not have read before. I of course take some pains to extract
all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules. What
really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDBWill be the biggest new
kid on the block in scaling. MemcacheDB has been around for a little while and
I've never thought of it in that way. Well learn why Joe is so excited by

<p>Introduction: Update: Parascale's CTO on what's different about Parascale.Let's say you have
gigglebytes of data to store and you aren't sure you want to use aCDN.
Amazon'sS3doesn't excite you. And you aren't quite ready to join
thegridnation. You want to keep it all in house. Wouldn't it be nice to have
something like theGoogle File Systemyou could use to create a unified file
system out of all your disks sitting on all your nodes?According to Robin
Harris, a.k.aStorageMojo(a great blog BTW), you can now have your own
GFS:Parascale launches Google-like storage software.Parascalecalls their
softwate a Virtual Storage Network (VSN). It "aggregates disks across
commodity Linux x86 servers to deliver petabyte-scale file storage. With
features such as automated, transparent file replication and file migration,
Parascale eliminates storage hotspots and delivers massive read/write
bandwidth." Why should you care?I don't know about you, but the "storage
problem" is one the most frustrating parts of buildin</p><p>3 0.61375135 <a title="1162-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Sync_data_on_all_servers.html">98 high scalability-2007-09-18-Sync data on all servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have a few apache servers ( arround 11 atm ) serving a small amount of data
( arround 44 gigs right now ).For some time I have been using rsync to keep
all the content equal on all servers, but the amount of data has been growing,
and rsync takes a few too much time to "compare" all data from source to
destination, and create a lot of I/O.I have been taking a look at MogileFS, it
seems a good and reliable option, but as the fuse module is not finished, we
should have to rewrite all our apps, and its not an option atm.Any ideas?I
just want a "real time, non resource-hungry" solution alternative for rsync.
If I get more features on the way, then they are welcome :)Why I prefer to use
a Distributed File System instead of using NAS + NFS?- I need 2 NAS, if I dont
want a point of failure, and NAS hard is expensive.- Non-shared hardware, all
server has their own local disks.- As files are replicated, I can save a lot
of money, RAID is not a MUST.Thnx in advance for your help and sorry for</p><p>4 0.60487592 <a title="1162-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-22-It%27s_the_Fraking_IOPS_-_1_SSD_is_44%2C000_IOPS%2C_Hard_Drive_is_180.html">1066 high scalability-2011-06-22-It's the Fraking IOPS - 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS, Hard Drive is 180</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

<p>Introduction: Storage: everyone wants it, but nobody wants to pay for it. This is one of
those funny cartoons showing the doom of that sort of thinking...pay me now or
cry over lost data later.Loved: Where is my data? I'm kinda big deal after
all! I should have listened to my postdoc, he can build cheaper storage than
you can. I should have went to Newegg.Found viaJoe Landmanand James Cuff. Joe
talks about how RAID isn't backup and has some more wit and wisdom.</p><p>3 0.68660456 <a title="1162-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-07-Help_a_Scoble_out._What_should_Robert_ask_in_his_scalability_interview%3F.html">405 high scalability-2008-10-07-Help a Scoble out. What should Robert ask in his scalability interview?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know
everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this
case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help?
Here's Robert's plight:I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest
interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.It’s on
Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.Look at
who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind
WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of
FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the
“don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million
users on Facebook in about 10 days.What would you ask?</p><p>4 0.63516361 <a title="1162-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-01-Google_Strategy%3A_Tree_Distribution_of_Requests_and_Responses.html">981 high scalability-2011-02-01-Google Strategy: Tree Distribution of Requests and Responses</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node
then that root node can become overwhelmed:The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for
either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal
with the flood of requests.The network interface becomes a bottleneck because
a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then
clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an
undisciplined system.One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.
Jeff Dean, Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this
Stanford video presentation:Tree Distribution of Requests and
Responses.Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat
topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a
number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes.
Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset of
the leaf nodes.With this</p><p>5 0.63423628 <a title="1162-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-13-CloudCamp_London_2%3A_private_clouds_and_standardisation.html">441 high scalability-2008-11-13-CloudCamp London 2: private clouds and standardisation</a></p>

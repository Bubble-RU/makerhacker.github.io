<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>3 0.14713997 <a title="1047-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-04-STRUCTURE_09_IS_BACK%21.html">588 high scalability-2009-05-04-STRUCTURE 09 IS BACK!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The GigaOM Network today announces its second Structure conference after the
runaway success of the 2008 event. The Structure 09 conference returns to San
Francisco, Calif., on June 25th, 2009.Structure 09 (http://structureconf.com)
is a conference designed to explore the next generations of Internet
infrastructure. Over a year ago, The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik saw that
the platforms on which we have done business for over a decade were starting
to provide diminishing returns, and smart money was seeking new options.
Structure 09 looks at the changing needs and rapid growth in the Internet
infrastructure sector, and this year's event will consider the impact of the
global economy. "I cannot remember a time when a new technology had so much
relevance to our industry as cloud computing does in the current economic
climate," said The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik. "We all need to find ways
to leverage what we have and cut costs without compromising future options.

<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application
delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to
addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application
delivery tier of the data center. By Lori Mac Vittie, F5 Networks The "High
Scalability" blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not
disappoint with a posthighlighting a set of scalability design patternsthat
was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on "6 Ways to
Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way." Credit:Michael
Chow/azcentral.com  This particular post caught my attention primarily because
although I've touched on many of these patterns in the past, I've never
thought to call them what they are: scalability patterns. That's probably a
side-effect of forgetting thatbuilding an architecture of any kind is at its
core computer scienceand thus algorithms and design patterns are applicable to

technology, it is a way to apply technology to problems; the faster you can
get the resources into the hands of the people who use it the more money you
save overall; cloud is a cash flow story, not a savings story; services aren't
about servers or storage, they are about applications.Quotable Quotes:Ryan

<p>Introduction: This is a useful post by Frank Mashraqi, Director of Business Operations &
Technical Strategy for a top 50 website that delivers billions of page views
per month.Since scalability is considered a non-functional requirement, it is
often overlooked in the hopes of decreasing time to market. Adding scalability
down the road can decrease the time to market but only after assuming
significant technical debt.Balancing performance and scalability vs. fast
iteration and cost efficiency can be a significant challenge for startups. The
good news is that achieving this balance is not impossible.Read the rest of

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's Tommy Reilly.  We
atNuoDBwere recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google
Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google
Developer Live Session by clickinghere.  In order to access the capabilities
of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General
Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we
demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our
private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million
transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that
NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don't call it a
cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the
faster the database</p><p>4 0.87933207 <a title="1047-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_Symfony_a_Web_Framework.html">31 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: Symfony a Web Framework</a></p>

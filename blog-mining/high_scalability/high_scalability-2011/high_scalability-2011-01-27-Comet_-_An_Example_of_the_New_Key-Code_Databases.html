<p>Introduction: I had a false belief I thought I came here to stay We're all just visiting All just breaking like waves The oceans made me, but who came up with me? Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out .     So true Perl Jam   (Push me Pull me lyrics)  , so true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes. Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.       To pull events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server. This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has changed and makes those changes available to you.  Knowing what has changed can be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state on what I client still needs to see.     Polling is heavy man.</p><p>5 0.084910482 <a title="979-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-10-27-Strategy%3A_Survive_a_Comet_Strike_in_the_East_With_Reserved_Instances_in_the_West.html">1133 high scalability-2011-10-27-Strategy: Survive a Comet Strike in the East With Reserved Instances in the West</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ali Sadat of  MuleSoft  gave interesting presentation at Saturday's  Talk Cloudy to Me!  event about their experiences moving  Mule iON , their ESB (enterprise service bus) product to the cloud.
 
First, a little about  Talk Cloudy to Me . This event is the second one day cloud event put on by Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, as part of the  Cloud Computing Meetup  group, also created by Sebastian. Sebastian has become a master at running these mini-conference style events. Really a quality job by him and his dedicated crew. These events are free, sponsored by various vendors; they are short, 11-5; the food is good, Thai; the venue is nice, eBay; they are on topic, with cloud and other speakers giving 30-45 minute talks.  More on the event when the video comes out. I type as fast as I can but I can't do much without the video.

<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show you how! They have   launched Wuala  , the social online storage service which scales as new nodes join the P2P network.     The goal of   Wua.la   is to provide distributed online storage that is:     large   scalable   reliable   secure     by harnessing the idle resources of participating computers.     This challenge is an old dream of computer science. In fact as   Andrew Tanenbaum   wrote in 1995:    "The design of a world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise for the reader"      After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system, Caleido is ready to unveil the resu</p><p>3 0.70145398 <a title="979-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-08-Riak_-_web-shaped_data_storage_system.html">718 high scalability-2009-10-08-Riak - web-shaped data storage system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Short presentation  NYC by Bryan Fink  demonstrating the riak web-shaped data storage engine
 
 Riak  is another  new and interesting key-value store  entrant. Some of the features it offers are:
  
 Document-oriented 
 Scalable, decentralized key-value store 
 Standard  get ,  put , and  delete  operations.  
 Distributed, fault-tolerant storage solution. 
 Configurable levels of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance 
 Support for Erlang, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Java, Python, HTTP 
   open source  and NoSQL 
 Pluggable backends 
 Eventing system 
 Monitoring 
 Inter-cluster replication 
 Links between records that can be traversed. 
 Map/Reduce. Functions are executed on the data node. One interesting difference is that a list keys are required to specify which values are operated on as apposed to running calculations on all values.

<p>Introduction: Neil Conway  from Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk at  a meetup today  in San Francisco on a new paper:  Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming  - extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. 
 
The description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the paper:
  Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability. Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of strong consistency can be very challenging.

 


In this talk, I'll discuss work from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a broader range of</p><p>5 0.66203856 <a title="979-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-15-Paper%3A_SwiftCloud%3A_Fault-Tolerant_Geo-Replication_Integrated_all_the_Way_to_the_Client_Machine.html">1648 high scalability-2014-05-15-Paper: SwiftCloud: Fault-Tolerant Geo-Replication Integrated all the Way to the Client Machine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: So how do you knit multiple datacenters and many thousands of phones and other clients into a single cooperating system?
 
Usually you don't. It's too hard. We see nascent attempts in services like Firebase and Parse. 
 
 SwiftCloud , as described in  SwiftCloud: Fault-Tolerant Geo-Replication Integrated all the Way to the Client Machine , goes two steps further, by leveraging Conflict free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), which means "data can be replicated at multiple sites and be updated independently with the guarantee that all replicas converge to the same value. In a cloud environment, this allows a user to access the data center closer to the user, thus optimizing the latency for all users."
 
While we don't see these kind of systems just yet, they are a strong candidate for how things will work in the future, efficiently using resources at every level while supporting huge numbers of cooperating users.

<p>Introduction: Summary    In this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out model.

<p>Introduction: Varnish  is a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered by these operating systems.  Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.  Varnish is reported to be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>3 0.88420981 <a title="979-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-03-Building_a_Data_Intensive_Web_Application_with_Cloudera%2C_Hadoop%2C_Hive%2C_Pig%2C_and_EC2.html">669 high scalability-2009-08-03-Building a Data Intensive Web Application with Cloudera, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, and EC2</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Comet is an  active distributed key-value store  built at the University of Washington. The paper describing Comet is  Comet: An active distributed key-value store , there are also  slides , and a  MP3  of a presentation given at  OSDI '10 . Here's a succinct  overview of Comet :
  

Today's cloud storage services, such as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes, fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their data's behavior inside the storage service.

  
I found this paper quite interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-value store, which turns it into what might called a  key-code</p><p>5 0.85444242 <a title="979-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-25-The_Cloud_and_The_Consumer%3A_The_Impact_on_Bandwidth_and_Broadband.html">1105 high scalability-2011-08-25-The Cloud and The Consumer: The Impact on Bandwidth and Broadband</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cloud-based services for all things digital will either drive – or die by – bandwidth
 
   Consumers, by definition, consume. In the realm of the Internet, they consume far more than they produce. Or so it’s been in the past. Broadband connectivity across all providers have long offered asymmetric network feeds because it mirrored reality: an HTTP request is significantly smaller than its corresponding response, and in general web-based activity is heavily biased toward fat download and thin upload speeds. The term “broadband” is really a misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very narrowband of a typical consumer’s upload speed.
 
 cloud computing  , or to be more accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing all things digital “in the cloud”, network providers must consider the impact on them – and the satisfaction of their customer base with performa</p><p>6 0.83854538 <a title="979-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-09-No_to_SQL%3F_Anti-database_movement_gains_steam_%E2%80%93_My_Take.html">654 high scalability-2009-07-09-No to SQL?

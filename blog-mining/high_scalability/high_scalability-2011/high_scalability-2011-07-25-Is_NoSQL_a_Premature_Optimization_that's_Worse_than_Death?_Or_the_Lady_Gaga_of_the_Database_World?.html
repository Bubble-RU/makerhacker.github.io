<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>3 0.21090342 <a title="1085-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation
from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?
Mike Stonebraker, the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world,
hopes you get something like his new database,VoltDB: a pure SQL, pure ACID,
pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory
DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a
second. VoltDBclaims to be100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster
thanCassandra, and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.Will
VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of
ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product
with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component
in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...I first heard the
details about VoltDB at Gluecon, where Mr. Stonebraker presented his highly

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems
to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly
increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly
using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and
gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous
information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and
ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only
SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it's true that the marketing wave of NoSQL
has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that's been around for quite a
while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all,
everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend
of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very profitable
either.So, what'</p><p>6 0.18055332 <a title="1085-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-09-10_NoSQL_Systems_Reviewed.html">739 high scalability-2009-11-09-10 NoSQL Systems Reviewed</a></p>

<p>Introduction: So much good stuff this week...Adrian Cockcroft Compares NoSQL Availability
Models. Let's risk feeding the CAP trolls, and try to get some insight into
the differences between the many NoSQL contenders. Adrian asks how each NoSQL
product will add a movie to its favorites list, read it back, and how this
works across availability zones. Much trickier than it sounds with multiple
writers. Cassandra and MongoDB answer back.Stuff the Internet Says:@jerng:
Reading up on scalability. WHY THE HELL FOR? Because I want to know the
future.@freerangedata: The #nosql options are the micro brews/craft beers of
data stores. So many good ones, so little time to try them
all.@edward_ribeiro: Soon, Darwinism will start to play its role on #NoSQL

<p>Introduction: Morgan Tocker has an awesome article and comment thread in theMySQL
Performance BlogaboutWhen should you store serialized objects in the
database?Before the NoSQL age is was very common to simulate schemalessness by
storing blobs in MySQL. Sharding was implemented by running multiple MySQL
instances and spreading writes across them. While not ideal for the purpose,
developers felt comfortable with MySQL. They knew how to install it, back it
up, replicate it, in short:  they knew how to make it work. Yet they also
needed to store objects without the penalty of joins. Searches and aggregate
queries were handled by indexes kept in separate tables, this offloaded the
fast path to objects.This all made perfect sense. Usually we just want stuff
to work and going with what you know is often the best path to that goal. And
what we have known is MySQL. All the different pros and cons of this approach
are covered wonderfully in the post.But the world has changed. With the same
goals in mind I do</p><p>4 0.75596583 <a title="1085-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-05-Anti-RDBMS%3A_A_list_of_distributed_key-value_stores.html">670 high scalability-2009-08-05-Anti-RDBMS: A list of distributed key-value stores</a></p>

lays down the law on which databases are scalable: Tokyo - NO, Redis - NO,
Voldemort - YES, MongoDB - Not Yet, Cassandra - Probably, Amazon S3 - YES * 2,
MySQL - NO.The real thing to point out is that if you are being held back from
making something super awesome because you can't choose a database, you are
doing it wrong.Update 5:Exciting stuff happening in Japan at this Key-Value
Storage meeting in Tokyo. Presentations on Groonga, Senna, Lux IO, Tokyo-
Cabinet, Tx, repcached, Kai, Cagra, kumofs, ROMA, and Flare.Update 4:NoSQL and
the Relational Model: don't throw the baby out with the bathwaterby Matthew
Willson.So my key point is, this kind of modelling is WORTH DOING, regardless
of which database tool you end up using for physical storage.Update 3:Choosing
a non-relational database; why we migrated from MySQL to MongoDB. An

<p>Introduction: Matt Aslett from the 451 group created a term called"NewSQL". On the
definition of NewSQL, Aslett writes:"NewSQL" is our shorthand for the various
new scalable/high performance SQL database vendors. We have previously
referred to these products as 'ScalableSQL' to differentiate them from the
incumbent relational database products. Since this implies horizontal
scalability, which is not necessarily a feature of all the products, we
adopted the term 'NewSQL' in the new report.And to clarify, like NoSQL, NewSQL
is not to be taken too literally: the new thing about the NewSQL vendors is
the vendor, not the SQL.As with NoSQL, under the NewSQL umbrella you can see
various providers, with various solutions.I think these can be divided into
several sub-types:New MySQL storage engines. These give MySQL users the same
programming interface, but scale very well. You can Xeround or Akiban in this
field. The good part is that you still use MySQL, but on the downside it's not
supporting other databa</p><p>6 0.75580269 <a title="1085-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>

Caching Platforms, Q2 2010where they listed GigaSpaces, IBM, Oracle, and

you. I'll start with a definition of Elastic Data Grid (Elastic Caching), how
it is different then other caching and NoSQL alternatives, and more

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>same-blog 4 0.87603468 <a title="1085-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-25-Is_NoSQL_a_Premature_Optimization_that%27s_Worse_than_Death%3F_Or_the_Lady_Gaga_of_the_Database_World%3F.html">1085 high scalability-2011-07-25-Is NoSQL a Premature Optimization that's Worse than Death?

<p>Introduction: Michael Stonebraker sure knows how to stir up a storm. Unlike for others, that
doesn't make him a troll in my mind, he'sway too accomplishedin the field to
be that, but he does have a bit of Barnum & Bailey in him, which serves to get
the discussion flowing, and that's a good thing. A lot of previously hidden
wisdom and passion unlocks, which we'll try to capture here.This disturbance
in the force is over OldSQL vs NoSQL vsNewSQL. Warning, these are not crisp
categories, there's leakage all over the place, watch your step:OldSQL
(Oracle, MySQL, etc) refers to what some want to term as legacy relational
database like MySQL, that don't scale out horizontally with aplomb.NoSQL
(CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, Riak, Neo4j, etc) refers to, well,
a collection of technologies that aren't OldSQL, these often are designed to
scale out horizontally, aren't on ACID, and use schemaless non-relational
datamodels.NewSQL  (Xeround, Clustrix, NimbusDB, GenieDB, ScaleBase, VoltDB)

<p>Introduction: In many posts, such as: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges I
mentioned that synchronization the access to the shared resource is the major
challenge to write parallel code.The synchronization and coordination take
long time from the overall execution time, which reduce the benefits of the
parallelism; the synchronization and coordination also reduce the
scalability.There are many forms of synchronization and coordination, such
as:Create Task object in frameworks such as: Microsoft TPL, Intel TDD, and
Parallel Runtime Library. Create and enqueue task objects require
synchronization that it's takes long time especially if we create it into
recursive work such as: Quick Sort algorithm.Synchronization the access to
shared data.But there are a few techniques to avoid these issues, such as:
Shared-Nothing, Actor Model, and Hyper Object (A.K.A. Combinable Object).
Simply if we reduce the shared data by re-architect our code this will gives
us a huge benefits in performance and s</p><p>6 0.84795237 <a title="1085-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere_Commerce_High_Availability_and_Performance_Configurations.html">321 high scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere Commerce High Availability and Performance Configurations</a></p>

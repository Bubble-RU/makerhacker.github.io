<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: Update 4: Heroku versus GAE & GAE/JUpdate 3:Heroku has gone live!.
Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the
relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment
and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.Update 2:Heroku
Architecture. A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests
flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a
Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based
routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your
application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors. Dynos
themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware,
Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as
an application caching layer.Update: Aaron WorshamInterview with James
Lindenbaum, CEO of Heroku. Aaron nicely sums up their goal: Heroku is looking

<p>Introduction: This is one of my favorite posts for a couple of reasons. I think it gives a
lot of useful information in an interesting space. And Kyle Vogt was just a
real pleasure to talk to. He was very helpful and forthcoming, which makes the
whole experience better for everyone.The future is live. The future is real-
time. The future is now. That's the hype anyway. And as it has a habit of
doing, the hype is slowly becoming reality. We are seeing live searches, live
tweets, live location, live reality augmentation, live crab (fresh and local),
and live event publishing. One of the most challenging of all live
technologies is that of live video broadcasting. Imagine a world in which
everyone becomes a broadcaster and a consumer of video streams, all in real-
time (< 250 msec latency), all so you can talk and interact directly without
feeling like you are in the middle of a time shift war. The resources and the
engineering needed to make this happened must be substantial. How do you do
that?To fin</p><p>6 0.14229786 <a title="1052-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-16-Justin.tv%27s_Live_Video_Broadcasting_Architecture.html">796 high scalability-2010-03-16-Justin.tv's Live Video Broadcasting Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a
firm schema. I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the
overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding. The data is
essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song. This
lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and
Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together. This will be in
a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by
artist album or song. By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song
I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by. The problem is
that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to
shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what
are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it? Should I go
with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table? Perhaps it might be
best</p><p>4 0.92369992 <a title="1052-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-05-Paper%3A_A_Study_of_Practical_Deduplication.html">1035 high scalability-2011-05-05-Paper: A Study of Practical Deduplication</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With BigData comes BigStorage costs. One way to store less is simplynot to
store the same data twice. That's the radically simple and powerful notion
behind data deduplication. If you are one of those who got a good laugh out of
the idea of eliminating SQL queries as a rather obvious scalability strategy,
you'll love this one, but it is a powerful feature and one I don't hear talked
about outside the enterprise. A parallel idea in programming is the once-and-
only-once principle of never duplicating code.Using deduplication technology,
for some upfront CPU usage, which is a plentiful resource in many systems that
are IO bound anyway, it's possible to reduce storage requirements by upto
20:1, depending on your data, which saves both money and disk write overhead.
This comes up because of really good article Robin Harris of StorageMojo
wrote, All de-dup works, on a paper,  A Study of Practical Deduplication by
Dutch Meyer and William Bolosky, For a great explanation of deduplication we

<p>Introduction: Hi all,I'm a big fan of http://highscalability.com/ and have been looking in
my current development to decompose my application along functional boundaries
as a route to being able to scale out the server side, specifically the
database layer. The problem comes when there are links between the data in
different components, ie one component holds all the user data, but another
component needs to reference a user as being an owner of some piece of data.
I'm currently doing this by holding the primary key information for each side
of the the link (as you would if they all lived in a single database), but
this link table needs to exist in both components to allow lookups to be done
in either direction, ie 'get the things a specific user owns' and 'get the
owners of this specific thing' would each use different components. The
alternative to this would be to store the link data in only one of the
components, but then the reverse lookups would require 2 calls instead of just
one.My question</p><p>6 0.91973799 <a title="1052-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-20-what_is_j2ee_stack.html">162 high scalability-2007-11-20-what is j2ee stack</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A giant step into the fully distributed future has been taken by the Google
App Engine team with the release of theirHigh Replication Datastore. The HRD
is targeted at mission critical applications that require data replicated to
at least three datacenters, full ACID semantics forentity groups, and lower
consistency guarantees across entity groups.This is a major accomplishment.
Few organizations can implement a true multi-datacenter datastore. Other than
SimpleDB, how many other publicly accessible database services can operate out
of multiple datacenters? Now that capability can be had by anyone. But there
is a price, literally and otherwise. Because the HRD uses three times the
resources as Google App Engine's Master/Slave datastatore, it will cost three
times as much. And because it is a distributed database, with all that implies
in the CAP sense, developers will have to be very careful in how they
architect their applications because as costs increased, reliability
increased, com</p><p>3 0.15682703 <a title="992-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-05-Paper%3A_A_Study_of_Practical_Deduplication.html">1035 high scalability-2011-05-05-Paper: A Study of Practical Deduplication</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With BigData comes BigStorage costs. One way to store less is simplynot to
store the same data twice. That's the radically simple and powerful notion
behind data deduplication. If you are one of those who got a good laugh out of
the idea of eliminating SQL queries as a rather obvious scalability strategy,
you'll love this one, but it is a powerful feature and one I don't hear talked
about outside the enterprise. A parallel idea in programming is the once-and-
only-once principle of never duplicating code.Using deduplication technology,
for some upfront CPU usage, which is a plentiful resource in many systems that
are IO bound anyway, it's possible to reduce storage requirements by upto
20:1, depending on your data, which saves both money and disk write overhead.
This comes up because of really good article Robin Harris of StorageMojo
wrote, All de-dup works, on a paper,  A Study of Practical Deduplication by
Dutch Meyer and William Bolosky, For a great explanation of deduplication we

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>5 0.11086788 <a title="992-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

School for Communication & Journalismestimates:  in 2007, humankind was able
to store 2.9 × 1020 optimally compressed bytes, communicate almost 2 × 1021
bytes, and carry out 6.4 × 1018 instructions per second on general-purpose
computers.Hadoop has hit a scalability limit at a whopping 4,000 machines and
are looking to create thenext generation architecture. Their target is
clusters of 10,000 machines and 200,000 cores.The fundamental idea of the re-
architecture is to divide the two major functions of the Job Tracker, resource
management and job scheduling/monitoring, into separate components. If you

<p>Introduction: Shanti Braforddetails how his Ruby on Railsbased website survived a 24 hour
550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup
details, so there's not much I can add.Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web
server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR,
nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved
performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of
the performance boost.Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a
very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>3 0.87758631 <a title="992-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-07-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_7th%2C_2014.html">1607 high scalability-2014-03-07-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 7th, 2014</a></p>

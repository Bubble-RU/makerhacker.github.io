<p>Introduction: I met the CodeFutures folks, makers ofdbShards, atGluecon. They occupy an
interesting niche in the database space, somewhere betweenNoSQL, which
jettisons everything SQL, and high end analytics platformsthat completely
rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.High concept: I think of
dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from HSCALE
(partitioning) +MySQL Proxy (transparent intermediate layer) +Memcached
(client side sharding) +Gigaspaces(parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).You
may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out
writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would
prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about
dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult
questions (not really).Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was
dbShards created to solve?I'm Cory Isaacson, CEO/CTO of CodeFutures
Corporation, the makers of dbShards. dbSha</p><p>3 0.22123566 <a title="999-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-13-DbShards_Part_Deux_-_The_Internals.html">857 high scalability-2010-07-13-DbShards Part Deux - The Internals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a follow up article byCory Isaacson to the first article on DbShards,
Product: dbShards - Share Nothing. Shard Everything, describing some of the
details about how DbShards works on the inside.The dbShards architecture is a
true "shared nothing" implementation of Database Sharding. The high-level view
of dbShards is shown here:The above diagram shows how dbShards works for
achieving massive database scalability across multiple database servers, using
native DBMS engines and our dbShards components. The important components
are:dbS/Client: A design goal of dbShards is to make database sharding as
seamless as possible to an application, so that application developers can
write the same type of code they always have. A key component to making this
possible is the dbShards Client. The dbShards Client is our intelligent driver
that is an exact API emulation of a given vendor's database driver. For
example, with MySQL we have full support for JDBC, and the the MySQL C driver

<p>Introduction: Hi...I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am
building it! So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking,
architecture planning, everything. I haven't even gotten into the legal
aspects yet.......It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to
handle that end of the operation. I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at
Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best. I'd like to FIND that very best
person available, to handle the technical aspects. For worse or better, I
don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.I've posted a bazillion ads
on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses. I've put out feelers
among my own network, same result. Not sure what else I can do. Shoestring
budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning. That can actually be a plus, as
it forces people to focus.Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the
right person?ThanksJason</p><p>2 0.90776336 <a title="999-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Hypertable_is_a_New_BigTable_Clone_that_Runs_on_HDFS_or_KFS.html">647 high scalability-2009-07-02-Hypertable is a New BigTable Clone that Runs on HDFS or KFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3: Presentation from theNoSQL conference:slides,video 1,video 2.Update
2: The folks at Hypertable would like you to know that Hypertable is now
officiallysponsored by Baidu, China's Leading Search Engine.As a sponsor of
Hypertable, Baidu has committed an industrious team of engineers, numerous
servers, and support resources to improve the quality and development of the
open source technology.Update: InfoQ interview onHypertable Lead Discusses
Hadoop and Distributed Databases. Hypertable differs from HBase in that it is
a higher performance implementation of Bigtable.Skrentabloggives the heads up
onHypertable,Zvents'open-source BigTable clone. It's written in C++ and can
run on top of either HDFS or KFS. Performance looks encouraging at28M rows of

<p>Introduction: This is aguest repost bySriram Devadas, Engineer at Vistaprint, Web platform
group. A fun and well written analogy of how to scale web applications using a
familiar coffee shop as an example. No coffee was harmed during the making of
this post.I own a small coffee shop.My expense is proportional to resources100
square feet of built up area with utilities, 1 barista, 1 cup coffee maker.My
shop's capacityServes 1 customer at a time, takes 3 minutes to brew a cup of
coffee, a total of 5 minutes to serve a customer.Since my barista works
without breaks and the German made coffee maker never breaks down,my shop's
maximum throughput = 12 customers per hour. Web serverCustomers walk away
during peak hours. We only serve one customer at a time. There is no space to
wait.I upgrade shop. My new setup is better!ExpensesSame area and utilities, 3

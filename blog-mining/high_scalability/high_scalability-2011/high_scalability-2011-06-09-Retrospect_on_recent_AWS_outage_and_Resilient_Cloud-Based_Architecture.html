few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their
Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East

(How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage), Smug Mug (How SmugMug survived the

Downtime). The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of
response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been
almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon
was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to

<p>Introduction: Please seeThe Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage for a new
improved list.So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage.
Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some
chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and
their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the
cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a
prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change
remains...cloudy.I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes
out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's
a resource you think should be added, just let me know.Amazon's Explanation of

<p>Introduction: Forrester released their new wave report:  The Forrester Waveâ&bdquo;˘: Elastic
Caching Platforms, Q2 2010where they listed GigaSpaces, IBM, Oracle, and
Terracotta as leading vendors in the field. In this post I'd like to take some
time to explain what some of these terms mean, and why they're important to
you. I'll start with a definition of Elastic Data Grid (Elastic Caching), how
it is different then other caching and NoSQL alternatives, and more
importantly -- I'll illustrate how it works through some real code
examples.You can read the full storyhere.</p><p>5 0.16272381 <a title="1056-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-28-Elasticity_for_the_Enterprise_--_Ensuring_Continuous_High_Availability_in_a_Disaster_Failure_Scenario.html">816 high scalability-2010-04-28-Elasticity for the Enterprise -- Ensuring Continuous High Availability in a Disaster Failure Scenario</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many enterprises' high-availability architecture is based on the assumption
that you can prevent failure from happening by putting all your critical data
in a centralized database, back it up with expensive storage, and replicate it
somehow between the sites. As I argued in one of my previous posts (Why
Existing Databases (RAC) are So Breakable!) many of those assumptions are
broken at their core, as storage is doomed to failure just like any other
device, expensive hardware doesn't make things any better and database
replication is often not enough.One of the main lessons that we can take from
the likes of Amazon and Google is that the right way to ensure continuous high
availability is by designing our system to cope with failure. We need to
assume that what we tend to think of as unthinkable will probably happen, as
that's the nature of failure. So rather than trying to prevent failures, we
need to build a system that will tolerate them.As we can learn from a recent

<p>Introduction: A bit over a month ago Amazon experienced its infamous AWS outage in the US
East Region. As a cloud evangelist, I was intrigued by the history of the
outage as it occurred. There were great posts during and after the outage from
those who went down. But more interestingly for me as architect were the
detailed posts of those who managed to survive the outage relatively unharmed,
such as SimpleGeo, Netflix,SmugMug, SmugMug's CTO, Twilio, Bizo and
others.Reading through the experience of others, I tried to summarize
thepatterns, principles and best practicesthat emerged from these posts, as I
believe we can learn a lot from them on how to design our business
applications to truly leverage on the benefits that the cloud offers in high
availability and scalability.The main principles, patterns and best practices
are:Design for failureStateless and autonomous servicesRedundant hot copies

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned

an open mind.Marc AndreessenMarc Andreessen is known as an internet pioneer,
entrepreneur, investor, startup coach, blogger, and a multi-millionaire
software engineer best known as co-author of Mosaic, the first widely-used web

of Opsware, a software company he founded originally as Loudcloud, when it was
acquired by Hewlett-Packard. He is also a co-founder of Ning, a company which

<p>Introduction: Adrian Cockcroft on the future ofCloud, Open Source, SaaS and the End of
Enterprise Computing:Most big enterprise companies are actively working on
their AWS rollout now. Most of them are also trying to get an in-house cloud
to work, with varying amounts of success, but even the best private clouds are
still years behind the feature set of public clouds, which is has a big impact
on the agility and speed of product developmentWhile theSnowden
revelationshave tattered the thin veil of trust secreting Big Brother from We
the People, they may also be driving a fascinating new tension in architecture
choices between Cloud Native (scale-out, IaaS), Amazon Native (rich service
dependencies), and Enterprise Native (raw hardware, scale-up).This tension
became evident in a recentHipChat interviewwhere HipChat, makers of an AWS
based SaaS chat product, were busy creating an on-premises version of their
product that could operate behind the firewall in enterprise datacenters. This
is consistent w</p><p>4 0.94620758 <a title="1056-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-27-Big_Data_In_the_Cloud_Using_Cloudify.html">1216 high scalability-2012-03-27-Big Data In the Cloud Using Cloudify</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill wrote an interesting article on O'Reilly Radar covering the
current solutions for running Big Data in the CloudBig data and cloud
technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing,
which clouds can readily provide.Big PaaSEdd touched briefly on the role of
PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloudBeyond IaaS, several
cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes
referred to as managed solutions, or platform as a service (PaaS), these
services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce,
reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers
can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass
those savings on to the customer.To put it simply, managing data clusters is
one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we
need to think about when we're dealing with application platforms, as I noted

<p>Introduction: Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub Cofounder, wroteTen Lessons from GitHub's First
Year in 2008. Though the lessons are still relevant, and the war stories
behind each lesson are great, I can't help but wonder what a 2013 version
would look like?Start Early - GitHub created a market that didn't exist. By
building early "on top of a nascent technology, we were able to construct a
startup with basically no overhead, no competition, and in our free
time."Adapt to Your Customers - "Don't give your customers what they ask for;
give them what they want."Have Fun -"You have to goof off a lot in order to
balance things out. Burnout is a real and dangerous phenomenon. "Pay attention
to Twitter -"Twitter [is] an extremely valuable resource for instant
feedback."Deploy at Will! -"The first year of a web offering is a magical one.
Your customers are most likely early adopters and love to see new features
roll out every few weeks. If this results in a little bit of downtime, they'll
easily forgive you, as</p><p>6 0.94319022 <a title="1056-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability_vs_Performance_vs_Availability_vs_Reliability.._Also_scale_up_vs_scale_out_%3F%3F%3F.html">224 high scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability vs Performance vs Availability vs Reliability..

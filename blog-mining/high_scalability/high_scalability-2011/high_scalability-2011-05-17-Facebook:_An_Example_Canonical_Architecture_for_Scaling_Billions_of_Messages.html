<p>Introduction: A consequence of Service Oriented Architectures is the burning need to provide
services at scale. The architecture that has evolved to satisfy these
requirements is a little known technique called the Cell Architecture.A Cell
Architecture is based on the idea that massive scale requires parallelization
and parallelization requires components be isolated from each other. These
islands of isolation are called cells. A cell is a self-contained installation
that can satisfy all the operations for a shard. A shard is a subset of a much
larger dataset, typically a range of users, for example. Cell Architectures
have several advantages:Cells provide a unit of parallelization that can be
adjusted to any size as the user base grows.Cell are added in an incremental
fashion as more capacity is required.Cells isolate failures. One cell failure
does not impact other cells.Cells provide isolation as the storage and

<p>Introduction: Lukas Biewald shares a fascinatingslam by slam recountof how
hisFaceStat(upload your picture and be judged by the masses) site was battered
by a link on Yahoo's main page that caused an almost instantaneous 650,000
page view jump on their site. Yahoo spends considerable effort making sure its
own properties can handle the truly massive flow from the main page. Turning
theGreat Eyeof the Internet towards an unsuspecting newborn site must be quite
the diaper ready experience. Theo Schlossnagle eerily prophesized about such
events inThe Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture:
massive, unexpected and sudden traffic spikes will become more common as a
fickle internet seeks ever for new entertainments (my summary). Exactly
FaceStat's situation.This is also one of our first exposures to an application
written on Merb, a popular Ruby on Rails competitor. For those who think Ruby
is the problem, their architecture now serves 100 times the original load.How

<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To
$20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems hits Hacker News and
generates agood conversation. One of the common sentiments about the cloud was
raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own
hardware instead of using the cloud?Ryan Park, Operations Engineer at
Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfectmodern responseto that
ultimate existential design dilemma:Our #1 requirement has been to keep up
with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that
there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast
enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a
dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which
gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud
providers.AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to
the list price for on-demand instances.

<p>Introduction: What should the architecture of your scalable, real-time, highly available
service look like? There are as many options as there are developers, but if
you are looking for a general template, this architecture as described by
Prashant Malik, Facebook's lead for theMessagesback end team, in Scaling the
Messages Application Back End, is a very good example to consider. Although
Messages is tasked with handling 135+ billion messages a month, from email,
IM, SMS,  text messages, and Facebook messages, you may think this is an
example of BigArchitecture and doesn't apply to smaller sites. Not so. It's a
good, well thought out example of a non-cloud architecture exhibiting many
qualities any mom would be proud of:Layered- components are independent and
isolated. Service/API Driven- each layer is connected via well defined
interface that is the sole entry point for accessing that service. This
prevents nasty complicated interdependencies. Clients hide behind an
application API.

<p>Introduction: You may have read somewhere that Facebook has introduced a newSocial Inbox
integrating email, IM, SMS,  text messages, on-site Facebook messages. All-in-
all they need to store over 135 billion messages a month. Where do they store
all that stuff? Facebook's Kannan Muthukkaruppan gives the surprise answer
inThe Underlying Technology of Messages:HBase. HBase beat out MySQL,
Cassandra, and a few others.Why a surprise? Facebook created Cassandra and it
was purpose built for an inbox type application, but they found Cassandra's
eventual consistency model wasn't a good match for their new real-time
Messages product. Facebook also has an extensiveMySQL infrastructure, but they
found performance suffered as data set and indexes grew larger. And they could
have built their own, but they chose HBase.HBase is ascaleout table store
supporting very high rates of row-level updates over massive amounts of data.
Exactly what is needed for a Messaging system. HBase is also a column based

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems
to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly
increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly
using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and
gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous
information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and
ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only
SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it's true that the marketing wave of NoSQL
has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that's been around for quite a
while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all,
everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend
of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very profitable
either.So, what'</p><p>6 0.94704157 <a title="1042-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j_-_a_Graph_Database_that_Kicks_Buttox.html">628 high scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j - a Graph Database that Kicks Buttox</a></p>

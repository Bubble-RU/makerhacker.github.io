<p>Introduction: Update:Good Vibrationsby Radovan Seman√Ñ?ik. Lot's of interesting questions
about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.Google
Waveis a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML
documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency
updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new,
convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users ofGoogle
Waveand we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open
platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and
become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to
"federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google
Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and
collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation
Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.Hereare

<p>Introduction: InSecrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger
shares three strategies Instagram uses to outsmart high latency mobile
networks and make mobile apps feel faster than they really are, which helped
Instagram reach 12 million users in 12 months:The motivation:"mobile
experiences fill gaps while we wait. no one wants to wait while they
wait"Perform actions optimistically. Make the user feel productive. Likes,
comments, and follows are registered on screen while the like operation is
being sent in the background. Adaptively preload content. Load content before
it's needed. Don't images according to time, it will take too long, instead
re-prioritize based on interest. Show what the social network things is the
most popular. Listen to what your user's flicks and taps are telling you.Move
bits when no-one is watching.Picture uploading startsbeforeyou share them,
most apps wait until after the share screen. The rule is send data as soon as
it's ready, then match it</p><p>5 0.87019688 <a title="1057-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-10-Viddler_Architecture_-_7_Million_Embeds_a_Day_and_1500_Req-Sec_Peak__.html">1037 high scalability-2011-05-10-Viddler Architecture - 7 Million Embeds a Day and 1500 Req-Sec Peak  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Viddler is in the high quality Video as a Service business for a customer who
wants to pay a fixed cost, be done with it, and just have it work. Similar to
Blip and Ooyala, more focussed on business than YouTube. They serve thousands
of business customers, including high traffic websites like FailBlog,
Engadget, and Gawker.Viddler is a good case to learn from because they are a
small company trying to provide a challenging service in a crowded field. We
are catching them just as they transitioning from a startup that began in one
direction, as a YouTube competitor, and pivoted into a slightly larger company
focussed on paying business customers.Transition is the key word for Viddler:
transitioning from a free YouTube clone to a high quality paid service.
Transitioning from a few colo sites that didn't work well to a new higher
quality datacenter. Transitioning from an architecture that was typical of a
startup to one that features redundancy, high availability, and automation.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Brian Doll, Application Performance Engineer at New
Relic.New Relic's multitenant, SaaS web application monitoring service
collects and persists over 100,000 metrics every second on a sustained basis,
while still delivering an average page load time of 1.5 seconds.  We believe
that good architecture and good tools can help you handle an extremely large
amount of data while still providing extremely fast service.  Here we'll show
you how we do it. New Relic is Application Performance Management (APM) as a

<p>Introduction: Hi,We're running a enterprise SaaS solution that currently holds about 700
customers with up to 50.000 users per customer (growing quickly). Our
customers have SLA agreements with us that contains guaranteed uptimes,
response times and other performance counters. With an increasing number of
customers and traffic we find it difficult to provide our customer with actual
SLA data. We could set up external probes that monitors certain parts of the
application, but this is time consuming with 700 customers (we do it today for
our biggest clients). We can also extract data from web logs but they are now
approaching about 30-40 GB a day.What we really need is monitoring software
that not only focuses on the internal performance counters but also lets us
see the application from the customers viewpoint and allows us to aggregate
data in different ways. Would the best approach be to develop a custom
solution (for instance a distributed app that aggregates data from different
logs every night a</p><p>3 0.7037245 <a title="1082-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-09-Batoo_JPA_-_The_new_JPA_Implementation_that_runs_over_15_times_faster....html">1336 high scalability-2012-10-09-Batoo JPA - The new JPA Implementation that runs over 15 times faster...</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is byHasan Ceylan, an Open Source software enthusiast from
Istanbul.I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together
with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I
contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.Those were the days
our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and
applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot
of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we
can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml
descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to
use the curse called "XDoclet".On the other side, our company grew steadily,
our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and
ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew
considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of
money. The challenge we h</p><p>4 0.7019735 <a title="1082-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr_Architecture.html">152 high scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>6 0.69861251 <a title="1082-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-13-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_13th%2C_2013.html">1564 high scalability-2013-12-13-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 13th, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Launched in 2001 by Microsoft, since then this platform is widely popular
among organizations to increase the efficiency of their business and
productive volume. As we all know the importance of communication mode in
every organization and by keeping in the mind this fact, Microsoft SharePoint
communicates over all barriers and spread the required information within a
company.Microsoft SharePoint is an ideal solution for companies who have
multiple offices and staff members who are on the move. Using SharePoint,
documents and other materials can be easily shared with both colleagues and
managers. Other features include advanced document management, which allows
users to virtually check out a document, modify it or just read it, then check
in the document again. This allows managers/company owners to see exactly when
their staff members are working and just what they are doing. When combined
with a highly customizable workflow management system and group calendars,
SharePoint can improv</p><p>3 0.92921364 <a title="1082-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-What_is_Network-based_Application_Virtualization_and_Why_Do_You_Need_It%3F.html">924 high scalability-2010-10-21-What is Network-based Application Virtualization and Why Do You Need It?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>4 0.92345917 <a title="1082-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-17-Hot_Links_for_2009-9-17_.html">707 high scalability-2009-09-17-Hot Links for 2009-9-17 </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Save 25% on Hadoop Conference TicketsApache Hadoop is a hot technology getting
traction all over the enterprise and in the Web 2.0 world. Now, there's going
to be a conference dedicated to learning more about Hadoop. It'll be Friday,
October 2 at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City.Hadoop World, as it's being
called, will be the first Hadoop event on the east coast. Morning sessions
feature talks by Amazon, Cloudera, Facebook, IBM, and Yahoo! Then it breaks
out into three tracks: applications, development / administration, and
extensions / ecosystems. In addition to the conference itself, there will also
be 3 days of training prior to the event for those looking to go deeper. In
addition to general sessions speakers, presenters include Hadoop project
creator Doug Cutting, as well as experts on large-scale data from Intel,
Rackspace, Softplayer, eHarmony, Supermicro, Impetus, Booz Allen Hamilton,
Vertica, About.com, and other companies.Readers get a 25% discount if you

<p>Introduction: Since its inception,Amazon EC2has enabled companies to run highly scalable
infrastructure with minimal overhead.  Over the years, Amazon Web Services has
expanded with new offerings and additional regions around the world.All this
growth has made establishing a global footprint easier than ever.  And yet,
most EC2 customers still choose to operate in a single region.  While this is
fine for many applications, customers with significant web infrastructure are
depriving users of drastically improved performance.  Deploying infrastructure
in EC2's new regions cuts out one of the biggest sources of latency:
distance.Inthis post, I describe howBizosignificantly reduced load times by
implementing Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) to distribute traffic across
all Amazon regions.Click here to read more on Bizo's dev blog</p><p>6 0.9211576 <a title="1082-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-26-Hot_Links_for_2009-8-26.html">688 high scalability-2009-08-26-Hot Links for 2009-8-26</a></p>

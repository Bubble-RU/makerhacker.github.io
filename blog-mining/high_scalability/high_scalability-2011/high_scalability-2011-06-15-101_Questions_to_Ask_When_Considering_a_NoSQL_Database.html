<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi
Media, Inc:Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS
data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape
of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve
performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom
filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or
document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide
for yourself.Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the
key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database
offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me
after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your
options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)An interesting
observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal to large</p><p>5 0.15327744 <a title="1062-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: This excellent survey of the field waswritten by Ian Thomas Varleyas part of
his Master of Science in Engineering program.The aim of this paper is to
explore the conceptual design space of non-relational databases as compared to
traditional relational databases. It is clear that the design needs of the two
paradigms are different, but how fundamental are the differences, and what
strategies can we use to transition our conceptual designs from one to the
other?There are a few things to like about this paper. A running a example is
used to show the different ways to model data depending on which type of
solution you are targeting, especially covering how many-to-many relationships
are modeled, data integrity, and how to support optional attributes. There's
also a brief survey of some of the major systems.The most interesting section
of the report is where it tackles the problem of design for non-relational
systems. The approach has two different phases: design questions and design

<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey, founder ofNuoDB, in thisthread on the Cloud Computing group,
delivers a masterful post on why he thinks the relational model is the best
overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself
from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave
new lock free world....I'll[Jim Starkey]go into more detail later in the post
for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency
is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human
facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips
between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads
inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage
this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together
related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make
sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the server and
using i</p><p>4 0.83383369 <a title="1062-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-20-35%2B_Use_Cases_for_Choosing_Your_Next_NoSQL_Database.html">1064 high scalability-2011-06-20-35+ Use Cases for Choosing Your Next NoSQL Database</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail
system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded
architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each
with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies
(Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers . The benefit of this
approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA loadbalancing on the
perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move
accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users).
Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has
MySQL support. What we also liked about this approach was that it had no
dependency on a distributed or networked filesystem, so less chance of
corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches
capacity, we just off load users to a less used server. If any server goes
offline, it only affects the fraction of users</p><p>3 0.93940556 <a title="1062-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-07-Strategy%3A_Recompute_Instead_of_Remember_Big_Data.html">852 high scalability-2010-07-07-Strategy: Recompute Instead of Remember Big Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Professor Lance Fortnow, in his blog post Drowning in Data, says complexity
has taught him this lesson:When storage is expensive, it is cheaper to
recompute what you've already computed. And that's the world we now live in:
Storage is pretty cheap but data acquisition and computation are even
cheaper.Jouni, one of the commenters, thinks the opposite is true:storage is
cheap, but computation is expensive. When you are dealing with massive data,
the size of the data set is very often determined by the amount of computing
power available for a certain price.With such data, a linear-time algorithm
takes O(1) seconds to finish, while a quadratic-time algorithm requires O(n)
seconds. But as computing power increases exponentially over time, the
quadratic algorithm gets exponentially slower.For me it's not a matter of
which is true, both positions can be true, but what's interesting is to think
that storage and computation are in some cases fungible. Your architecture can
decide which tradeof</p><p>4 0.93366212 <a title="1062-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling_IMAP_and_POP3.html">81 high scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling IMAP and POP3</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lately I've been reading more cases were different people have started to
realize the limitations of the NoSQL promise to database scalability. Note the
references below:Why does Quora use MySQL as the data store instead of NoSQLs
such as Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB etc?Why did Diaspora abandon MongoDB for
MySQL?How scalable is CouchDB in practice, not just in theory?Take MongoDB for
example. It's damn fast, but it doesn't really know how to save data reliably
to disk. I've had it set up in a replica pair to mitigate that risk. Guess
what - both servers in the pair failed and corrupted their data files at the
same day.It appears that for many, the switch to NoSQL can be rather painful.
IMO that doesn't necessarily mean that NoSQL is wrong in general, but it's a
combination of 1) lack of maturity 2) not the right tool for the job.That
brings the question of what's the alternative solution?In the following post I

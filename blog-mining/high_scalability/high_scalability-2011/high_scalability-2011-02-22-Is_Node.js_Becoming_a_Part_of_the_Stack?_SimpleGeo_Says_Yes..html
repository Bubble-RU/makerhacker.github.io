Neubauer not only does a fantastic job explaining a complicated routing
algorithm using the graph databaseNeo4j, but he surfaces an interesting
architectural conundrum:make it really fast so work can be done on the reads
or do all the work on the writes so the reads are really fast.The money quote
pointing out the competing options is:[Being] able to do these calculations in
sub-second speeds on graphs of millions of roads and waypoints makes it
possible in many cases to abandon the normal approach ofprecomputing indexes
with K/V stores and be able to put routing into the critical path with the
possibility to adapt to the live conditions and build highly personalized and
dynamic spatial services.ďťżThe poster boys for the precompute strategy

<p>Introduction: If you started out building a dating site and instead ended up  building a
video sharing site (YouTube) that handles 4 billion views a day, then it's
just possible you learned something along the way. And indeed, Mike Solomon,
one of the original engineers at YouTube, did learn a lot and he has given a
talk about it atPyCon:Scalability at YouTube.This isn't an architecture driven
talk where we are led through a description of how a lot of boxes connect to
each other. Mike could give that sort of talk. He has worked on building
YouTube's servlet infrastructure, video indexing feature, video transcoding
system, their full text search, a CDN, and much more. But instead, he's taken
a step back, took a long look around at what time has wrought, and shared some
deep lessons, obviously hard won from experience.The key takeaway away of the
talk for me was doinga lot with really simple tools. While many teams are
moving on to more complex ecosystems, YouTube really does keep it simple. They

<p>Introduction: Dropboxsaves one million files every 15 minutes,  more tweets than even
Twitterers tweet. That mind blowing statistic was revealed by Rian Hunter, a
Dropbox Engineer, in his presentation How Dropbox Did It and How Python Helped
at PyCon 2011.The first part of the presentation is some Dropbox lore, origin
stories and other foundational myths. We learn thatDropbox is a startup
company located in San Francisco that has probably one of the most popular
file synchronization and sharing tools in the world, shipping Python on the
desktop and supporting millions of users and growing every day. About half way
through the talk turns technical. Not a lot of info on how Dropbox handles
this massive scale was dropped, but there were a number of good lessons to
ponder:Use Python99.9 % of their code is in Python. Used on the server
backend; desktop client, website controller logic, API backend, and
analytics.Can't use Python on the Android due to memory constraints.Runs on a

<p>Introduction: OK, thisinterview is with meon Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger
idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java
World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them
:-)The interview went an interesting direction, but there's more I'd like add
and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have
popped out at me:Java - It's the platform stupid. Java the language isn't the
big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM,
libraries, and toolsets.Java - It's the community stupid. A lot of creativity
is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability
challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing
Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.The fecundity of
the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our
multi-core future. There's a multi-core crisis going in case you haven't

<p>Introduction: InHow to launch in a month and scale to a million users,Joseph Perla, Former
VP of Technology and founding team of Turntable.fm, shares techniques he used
to build and quickly scale his startups. The post is very well written and a
must read. Here are the essentials:Keep it simple.Build API's before making
the website or mobile apps. Keep interfaces small and single-purpose. Get it
right.Build in automated tests from the start. Create function tests, module
level tests, and full integration tests. Run tests on every commit. No new
code written while bugs exist.Don't hide power.UsePebblesto write bug-free
Javascript, a library to create complicated AJAX interactions by writing 0
javascript by adding a few extra HTML tags to code.Use procedure arguments to
provide flexibility in an interface.Pass functions instead of parameters to
support complicated scenarios. For example, a filter function return a

What you can do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>5 0.76827031 <a title="993-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Why_doesn%27t_anyone_use_j2ee%3F.html">82 high scalability-2007-09-06-Why doesn't anyone use j2ee?</a></p>

Java, but in a very pragmatic way. They use servlets, an application server,
the JDK, and they do the rest themselves. They skip JSP, entity beans, and
JMS.When you need to scale putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky
strategy. Why use JSP when you can do better? When use entity beans when you
can do better? Use servlets because they are a very effective way of handling
http requests. Use Java because it is fast, runs everywhere, and has a boat
load of libraries you can use to build your build your custom system.Probably
the major reason J2EE is absentee is simply LAMP. LAMP is just so incredibly

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking The
Datacenter as a Computer book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I
would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!John Fries in aG+
commenthas what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the
book:It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by
interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the
entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and
realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter
anymoreIt's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize
simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to
warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware;
datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to
deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key
challenges, which include ra</p><p>2 0.94493198 <a title="993-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-17-Ringo_-_Distributed_key-value_storage_for_immutable_data.html">468 high scalability-2008-12-17-Ringo - Distributed key-value storage for immutable data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ringo is an experimental, distributed, replicating key-value store based on
consistent hashing and immutable data. Unlike many general-purpose databases,
Ringo is designed for a specific use case: For archiving small (less than 4KB)
or medium-size data items (<100MB) in real-time so that the data can survive K
- 1 disk breaks, where K is the desired number of replicas, without any
downtime, in a manner that scales to terabytes of data. In addition to
storing, Ringo should be able to retrieve individual or small sets of data
items with low latencies (<10ms) and provide a convenient on-disk format for
bulk data access.Ringo is compatible with themap-reduce framework Discoand it
was started atNokia Research CenterPalo Alto.</p><p>3 0.94241965 <a title="993-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-16-Interview_With_Google%27s_Ilya_Grigorik_On_His_New_Book%3A_High_Performance_Browser_Networking.html">1533 high scalability-2013-10-16-Interview With Google's Ilya Grigorik On His New Book: High Performance Browser Networking</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do
something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one
Ilya Grigorik, Developer Advocate,Make the Web Fastat Google, and author of a
great new book:High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer
should know about networking and web performance. That's a big topic you might
be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed
pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It's like
a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.In case you are not familiar
with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For
years Ilya has been producing excellent content onhis blog and if yousearch
YouTube you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the
book. Authority established.Reading the book I was struck by what a

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with Wade Simmons, an Infrastructure Engineer at
SimpleGeo, a service making iteasy for developers to create location-aware
applications, on their increasing use ofNode.js as a backend service
component, replacing code that would have at one time been written in Java,
Python or Ruby. Node.js is finding it's way into many stacks these days and I
was curious why that might be. My experience writing several messaging systems
is that programmers don't like the async model and it's a big surprise that a
pure async programming model like Node.js, especially one that uses server-
side Javascript, would be taking off. Wade was generous enough to help explain
their reasoning behind using Node.js at SimpleGeo. I'd really like to thank
Wade for taking the time for this interview. He did a really great job and
provided a lot of insight on how the modern web stack is evolving in the
crucible of real-life experience.  And here begins the interview with Wade

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>6 0.9272626 <a title="993-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>

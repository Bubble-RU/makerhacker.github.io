<p>Introduction: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things . -- Corinthians
 
 With this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs .  I like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.  -- Sylvain on  Google Groups 
 
The dream is dead. Google App Engine's bold  pay for what you use  dream dies as it leaves childish things behind and becomes a  real product .  Pricing will change . Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will change. But Google App Engine  will survive.   
 
Google is  shutting down  many of its  projects . GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank for it surving the  more wood behind  more deadly arrows push? Without a radical and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote in the long scroll of good ideas.

<p>Introduction: Update 6: :  Back to the Future for Data Storage .  We are in the middle of a renaissance in data storage with the application of many new ideas and techniques; there's huge potential for breaking out of thinking about data storage in just one way.   Update 5 :  Building Scalable Web Applications with Google App Engine  by Brett Slatkin.
 
 Update 4 :  Why Google App Engine is broken and what Google must do to fix it  by Aral Balkan.  We don't care that it can scale. We care that it does scale. And that it scales when you need it the most.   Issues: 1MB limit on data structures; 1MB limit on data structures; the short-term high CPU quota; quotas in general; Admin? What's that?  Update 3 : BigTable  Blues . Catherine Devlin couldn't port an application to GAE because it can't do basic filtering and can't search 5,000 records without timing out: "Querying from 5000 records - too much for the mighty BigTable, apparently." Followup:  not the future database .

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive</p><p>5 0.15302801 <a title="1084-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-08-Google_AppEngine_-_A_First_Look.html">301 high scalability-2008-04-08-Google AppEngine - A First Look</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look around their documentation and seeing what stands out  for me. It's not the much speculated   super cluster VM  . AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran a   website out of S3   with a splash of   Heroku   thrown in as a chaser.      The idea is clearly to take advantage of our   massive multi-core future   by creating a shared nothing infrastructure based firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage: email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps.  A shared nothing request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build</p><p>6 0.14025073 <a title="1084-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>

 Unlocked Achievements:  Twitter: 900,000 Apps, 600,000 Developers And 13 Billion API Requests Per Day ;  Rackspace Now Has 70,000 Servers  
 Quotable Quotes for the speed of light Alex:            
 
  @LusciousPear  According to everyone I talk to, in aggregate, every single #nosql company is irrelevant, doing great, making tons of money, and broke. 
  XIX  Give a man a GO compiler and he eats for a day. Give a man a C compiler and he feeds upon php/python/jscript/lua/etc for the rest of his life. 
  @movingsideways  This tweet features a robust architecture and high scalability. 
  @serenestudios   Human touch trumps code 'scalability'? People matter more than code - we agree.

<p>Introduction: With the  Google IO Developer Conference  completed there are  dozens and dozens  of information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos available so quickly after the conference. 
 
Let's say you don't want to watch all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:

  @muratdemirbas : In the cloudcomputing webservices domain antifragility= elastic scalability + network effect 
  @SQLPerfTips : More hardware won't solve response time problems. Proper indexing does. 
  Stefan Boberg : The fastest I/O request is the one you dont'! 
  Alan Kay : The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and behaviors should be.

<p>Introduction: Inspired by a  xkcd comic ,  Peter Norvig ,  Director of Research at Google and all around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful systems profiled on HighScalability.  
 
 The original code is at  xkcd 1313: Regex Golf , which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's deliberate strategy for finding a regex.  
 
 The post demonstrating the iterated improvement of the program is at  xkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite Problems) . As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the program Peter recommends the following steps:

<p>Introduction: Hi,     In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought is   class ReferenceIdGenerator {   public static setReferenceId(String login) {      threadLocal.set(login + System.currentMillis());   }     public static String getReferenceId() {     return threadLocal.get();   }   private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =       new ThreadLocal();       }     class MySevlet {     void service(.....) {       HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);      String userId = session.get("userId");          ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId</p><p>3 0.97837663 <a title="1084-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed_content_system_with_bandwidth_balancing.html">605 high scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed content system with bandwidth balancing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1 copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random server to serve the file as a temp fix...     It's a small video streaming service. I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's psuedo streaming, but it works.     I have been looking at MogileFS, which would solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar). However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth % usage?     Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>4 0.96565044 <a title="1084-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-16-Paper%3A_A_Provably_Correct_Scalable_Concurrent_Skip_List.html">1305 high scalability-2012-08-16-Paper: A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  MemSQL Architecture  we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps eliminate contention and make writes fast. 
 
If this all sounds a little pie-in-the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it clearer:  A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List .
 
From the abstract:
  We propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization, searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms, this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that</p><p>5 0.96000713 <a title="1084-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-07-Six_Lessons_Learned_Deploying_a_Large-scale_Infrastructure_in_Amazon_EC2_.html">559 high scalability-2009-04-07-Six Lessons Learned Deploying a Large-scale Infrastructure in Amazon EC2 </a></p>

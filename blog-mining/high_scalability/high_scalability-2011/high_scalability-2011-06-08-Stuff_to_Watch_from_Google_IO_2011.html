<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look
around their documentation and seeing what stands out for me. It's not the
much speculatedsuper cluster VM. AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and
structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran awebsite out of S3with a
splash ofHerokuthrown in as a chaser.The idea is clearly to take advantage of
ourmassive multi-core futureby creating a shared nothing infrastructure based
firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU
services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage:
email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps. A shared nothing
request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures
must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google
is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy
creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build on. Now they

<p>Introduction: Khan Academyis a non profit company started bySalman Khanwith the Big Hairy
Audacious Goal of providing a free, world class education to anyone, anywhere,
anytime. That's a lot of knowledge. Having long been inspired and captivated
by the Khan Academy, I was really curious to know how they plan to do it.Ben
Kamens, lead developer at Khan Academy, gives the somewhat surprising answer
in an interview:How to Scale your Startup to Millions of Users.Theshort
answer: develop a strong team, focus on features, letGoogle App Enginedo the
heavy lifting.Some people seem to be turned off by all the GAE love in the
interview. Part of it is that the interviewer is Fred Sauer, Developer
Advocate for Google App Engine, so there's a level of familiarity between the
two. But the biggest part is simply that they really like GAE, for all the
reasons your are supposed to like GAE. And that's OK. In this day and age you
are free to love whichever platform you choose.Biggest surprise:A profile on

<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling
65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate
problemBuddyPokeco-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution
at Wednesday'sFacebook Meetup. Slides for the complete talk arehere. For those
not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets
users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line
avatars.In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application.
It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play
mechanics, viral loops, and creative monetization strategies are all part of
if its everyday conceptualization. It mashes together different technologies,
not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way, but in a smart way that gets the
most bang for the buck. Part of it runs on Facebook servers (free). Part of it
runs on flash in a browser (free). Part of it runs on a storage cloud (higher

<p>Introduction: Wikipedia andWikimediahave some of the best, most complete real-world
documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas
Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an
overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid,
lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN, how
caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how
they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle
load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of
configuration files. This is a really useful resource.Related

<p>Introduction: With theGoogle IO Developer Conferencecompleted there aredozens and dozensof
information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty
free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos
available so quickly after the conference. Let's say you don't want to watch
all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen
scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:App
Engine Backends by Justin Haugh, Greg Darke. One of this biggest complaints
about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new
Backend node.Scaling App Engine Applicationsby Justin Haugh, Guido van Rossum.
Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make
it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000
queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good
discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides when to spawn
instances;</p><p>3 0.87998748 <a title="1055-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-03-Snooze_-_Open-source%2C_Scalable%2C_Autonomic%2C_and_Energy-efficient_VM_Management_for_Private_Clouds.html">1238 high scalability-2012-05-03-Snooze - Open-source, Scalable, Autonomic, and Energy-efficient VM Management for Private Clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Snoozeis an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual
machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly to other VM
management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it
allows to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources.
Particularly, once installed and configured users can submit and control the
life-cycle of a large number of VMs. However, contrary to existing frameworks
for scalability and fault tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and
healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it
performs distributed VM management and is designed to be energy efficient.
Therefore, it implements features to monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU,
memory, network Rx, network Tx) demands, detect and resolve overload/underload
situations, perform dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and
finally power management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a
generic scheduler</p><p>4 0.87800419 <a title="1055-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-04-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_February_4%2C_2010.html">771 high scalability-2010-02-04-Hot Scalability Links for February 4, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lots of cool stuff happening this week...Voldemort gets rebalancing.It's one
thing to shard data to scale, it's a completely different level of
functionality to manage those shards intelligently. Voldemort has stepped up
by adding advanced rebalancing functionality: Dynamic addition of new nodes to
the cluster; Deletion of nodes from cluster; Load balancing of data inside a
cluster.Microsoft Finally Opens Azure for Business.Out of the blue Microsoft
opens up their platform as a service service. Good to have more competition
and we'll keep an eye out for experience reports.New details on LinkedIn
architectureby Greg Linden.LinkedIn appears to only use caching minimally,
preferring to spend their efforts and machine resources on making sure they
can recompute computations quickly than on hiding poor performance behind
caching layers.The end of SQL and relational databases?  byDavid

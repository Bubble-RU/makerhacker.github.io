<p>Introduction: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things . -- Corinthians
 
 With this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs .  I like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.  -- Sylvain on  Google Groups 
 
The dream is dead. Google App Engine's bold  pay for what you use  dream dies as it leaves childish things behind and becomes a  real product .  Pricing will change . Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will change. But Google App Engine  will survive.   
 
Google is  shutting down  many of its  projects . GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank for it surving the  more wood behind  more deadly arrows push? Without a radical and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote in the long scroll of good ideas.

<p>Introduction: Update 6: :  Back to the Future for Data Storage .  We are in the middle of a renaissance in data storage with the application of many new ideas and techniques; there's huge potential for breaking out of thinking about data storage in just one way.   Update 5 :  Building Scalable Web Applications with Google App Engine  by Brett Slatkin.
 
 Update 4 :  Why Google App Engine is broken and what Google must do to fix it  by Aral Balkan.  We don't care that it can scale. We care that it does scale. And that it scales when you need it the most.   Issues: 1MB limit on data structures; 1MB limit on data structures; the short-term high CPU quota; quotas in general; Admin? What's that?  Update 3 : BigTable  Blues . Catherine Devlin couldn't port an application to GAE because it can't do basic filtering and can't search 5,000 records without timing out: "Querying from 5000 records - too much for the mighty BigTable, apparently." Followup:  not the future database .

 Quotable Quotes:                                   
 
  @PenLlawen : @spolsky In my time as a scalability engineer, I’ve seen plenty of cases where optimisation was left too late. Even harder to fix. 
  @davidlubar : Whoever said you can't fold a piece of paper in half more than 7 times probably forget to unfold it each time. I'm up to 6,000. 
  deno :  A quick comparison of App Engine vs. Compute Engine prices shows that App Engine is at best 10x more expensive per unit of RAM. 
  Fred Wilson : strategy is figuring out what part of the market the company wants to play in, how it goes to market, and how it differentiates itself in the market it is about what you are going to do and importantly what you are not going to do

<p>Introduction: With the  Google IO Developer Conference  completed there are  dozens and dozens  of information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos available so quickly after the conference. 
 
Let's say you don't want to watch all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:
  
  App Engine Backends  by Justin Haugh, Greg Darke. One of this biggest complaints about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new Backend node. 
  Scaling App Engine Applications  by Justin Haugh, Guido van Rossum. Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000 queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides w</p><p>4 0.83342224 <a title="1117-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_24%2C_2013.html">1464 high scalability-2013-05-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 24, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Between love and madness lies  HighScalability : 
  
  Google now 10x better : MapReduce sorts 1 petabyte of data using 8000 computers in 33 minutes;  1 Billion on Social Networks ;  Tumblr at 10 Billion Posts ;  Twitter at 100 Million Users ;  Testing at Google Scale : 1800 builds, 120 million test suites, 60 million tests run daily. 
 From the  Dash Memo  on Google's Plan:  Go is a very promising systems-programming language in the vein of C++. We fully hope and expect that Go becomes the standard back-end language at Google over the next few years.  On GAE  Go can load from  a cold start in 100ms and the typical instance size is 4MB. Is it any wonder Go is a go? Should we expect to see Java and Python deprecated because Go is so much cheaper to run at scale?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ivan de Prado  and  Pere Ferrera , founders of  Datasalt , the company behind  Pangool  and  Splout SQL  Big Data open-source projects.  
 
The amount of payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and shops for improving their relationship with the market. At  Datasalt  we have developed a system in collaboration with the  BBVA bank  that is able to analyze years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web and mobile applications.
 
The main challenge we faced besides processing Big Data input is that  the output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the input . And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.
 
The solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few tho</p><p>3 0.91565222 <a title="1117-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_3%2C_2013.html">1451 high scalability-2013-05-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 3, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This article is from an interview with    Zuhaib Siddique   , a production engineer at    HipChat   , makers of     group chat and IM for teams.  
   HipChat started in an unusual space, one you might not think would have much promise, enterprise group messaging, but as we are learning there is gold in them there    enterprise hills   . Which is why Atlassian, makers of well thought of tools like JIRA and Confluence,    acquired HipChat in 2012   . 
   And in a tale not often heard, the resources and connections of a larger parent have actually helped HipChat enter an    exponential growth cycle   . Having reached the 1.2 billion message storage mark they are now doubling the number of messages sent, stored, and indexed every few months. 
   That kind of growth puts a lot of pressure on a once adequate infrastructure. HipChat exhibited a common scaling pattern. Start simple, experience traffic spikes, and then think what do we do now? Using bigger computers is usually the first and bes</p><p>5 0.90535104 <a title="1117-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-01-Khan_Academy_Checkbook_Scaling_to_6_Million_Users_a_Month_on_GAE.html">1432 high scalability-2013-04-01-Khan Academy Checkbook Scaling to 6 Million Users a Month on GAE</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Khan Academy   is a non profit company started by  Salman Khan  with the Big Hairy Audacious Goal of providing a free, world class education to anyone, anywhere, anytime. That’s a lot of knowledge. Having long been inspired and captivated by the Khan Academy, I was really curious to know how they plan to do it.   Ben Kamens  , lead developer at Khan Academy, gives the somewhat surprising answer in an interview:  How to Scale your Startup to Millions of Users .
  The  short answer : develop a strong team, focus on features, let   Google App Engine   do the heavy lifting.
   Some people seem to be turned off by all the GAE love in the interview. Part of it is that the interviewer is Fred Sauer, Developer Advocate for Google App Engine, so there’s a level of familiarity between the two. But the biggest part is simply that they really like GAE, for all the reasons your are supposed to like GAE. And that’s OK. In this day and age you are free to love whichever platform you choose.

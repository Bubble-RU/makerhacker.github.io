</p><p>4 Architectures using embedded databases typically never expose a raw database abstraction at all. [sent-9, score-0.214]
</p><p>5 They have a service API and the services use the embedded database library call transparently behind the scene. [sent-10, score-0.236]

</p><p>7 BerkelyDB  is one well known example of an embedded database,  SQLite  is another, the file system is perhaps the most commonly used database, and there have been many many other btree libraries in common use. [sent-12, score-0.227]
</p><p>8 Here are some excellent FAQish tips, performance suggestions, and porting issues extracted from the list:     Largest tested database: 1 billion entries with 16 byte keys and 100 byte values (roughly 100 GB of raw data, about half that after compression). [sent-20, score-0.314]
</p><p>9 They wanted to put together something like the BigTable tablet stack that had minimal dependencies and would be suitable for open sourcing, and also would be suitable for use in Chrome (for the IndexedDB implementation). [sent-25, score-0.16]
</p><p>10 What leveldb does differently from B+trees is that it trades off write latency for write throughput: write latency is reduced by doing bulk writes, but the same data may be rewritten multiple times (at high throughput) in the background due to compactions. [sent-43, score-0.878]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Sachin Sinha , Founder of  Iqlect  and developer of  BangDB . 
 
The goal for the paper is to provide the performances data for following embedded databases under various scenarios for random operations such as write and read. The data is presented in graphical manner to make the data self explanatory to some extent.
  
  LevelDB :

LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values. Leveldb is based on LSM (Log-Structured Merge-Tree) and uses SSTable and MemTable for the database implementation. It's written in C++ and availabe under BSD license. LevelDB treats key and value as arbitrary byte arrays and stores keys in ordered fashion. It uses snappy compression for the data compression. Write and Read are concurrent for the db, but write performs best with single thread whereas Read scales with number of cores

<p>Introduction: How would you implement a key-value storage system if you were starting from scratch? The approach Basho settled on with  Bitcask , their new backend for Riak, is an interesting combination of using RAM to store a hash map of file pointers to values and a log-structured file system for efficient writes.  In this excellent  Changelog interview , some folks from Basho describe Bitcask in more detail.
 
The essential Bitcask:
  
 
 Keys are stored in memory for fast lookups. All keys must fit in RAM. 
 Writes are append-only, which means writes are strictly sequential and do not require seeking. Writes are write-through. Every time a value is updated the data file on disk is appended and the in-memory key index is updated with the file pointer. 
 Read queries are satisfied with O(1) random disk seeks. Latency is very predictable if all keys fit in memory because there's no random seeking around through a file. 
 For reads, the file system cache in the kernel is used instead of writing a c</p><p>4 0.19635138 <a title="1096-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_8%2C_2011.html">1076 high scalability-2011-07-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 8, 2011</a></p>

You have to have complete fluidity with the storage tier, the web tier. We are running our own data centers. We are looking more at doing our own data centers with more of a private cloud.

<p>Introduction: I don't know about you, but when I first learned about Redis my initial thought was wow, why hasn't anyone done this before? My next thought was why put this functionality in a separate process? Why not just embed it in your own server code and skip the network path completely? Especially in a Service Oriented Architecture there's no need for an extra hop or extra software installation and configuration.
 
Now you can embed Redis-like code directly into your server with  Vedis  - an  embeddable datastore  C library built with over 70 commands similar in concept to Redis but without the networking layer since Vedis run in the same process of the host application. It's transactional, cross platform, thread safe, key-value, supports terabyte sized databases, has a GPL-like license (which isn't great for commercial apps), and supports an on-disk as well as in-memory datastore.
 
More about Vedis:

<p>Introduction: Pomegranate  is a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high concurrency, high throughput, and low latency.   Their tests seem to indicate it works:
  

We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observed  linearly  increased more than  100,000  aggregate read and write requests served per second (  RPS  ).   

  
Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use. Every application could use it out of the box.
 
The features of Pomegranate are:

<p>Introduction: I currently use BerkeleyDB as an embedded database   http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/   a decision which was initially brought on by learning that Google used BerkeleyDB for their universal sign-on feature.     Lustre looks impressive, but their white paper shows speeds of 800 files created per second, as a good number.  However, BerkeleyDB on my mac mini does 200,000 row creations per second, and can be used as a distributed file system.     I'm having I/O scalability issues with BerkeleyDB on one machine, and about to implement their distributed replication feature (and go multi-machine), which in effect makes it work like a distributed file system, but with local access speeds.  That's why I was looking at Lustre.     The key feature difference between BerkeleyDB and Lustre is that BerkeleyDB has a complete copy of all the data on each computer, making it not a viable solution for massive sized database applications.  However, if you have < 1TB (ie, one disk) of total pos</p><p>6 0.7547031 <a title="1096-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-17-Tachyon__-_Fault_Tolerant_Distributed_File_System_with_300_Times_Higher_Throughput_than_HDFS.html">1442 high scalability-2013-04-17-Tachyon  - Fault Tolerant Distributed File System with 300 Times Higher Throughput than HDFS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it’s easy to forget about network-based application virtualization. But it’s the one virtualization technique you  shouldn’t  forget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad other solutions will be enabled.
   WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION VIRTUALIZATION?    
This term may not be familiar to you but that’s because since its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it’s always just been called “server virtualization”. After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the way) it was always referred to as  service virtualization  in  SOA  and XML circles. With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server virtualization solutions, it’s become impossible to just use the term “server virtualization” and “service virtualization” is just as ambiguous so it seems appropriate to giv</p><p>3 0.9842537 <a title="1096-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-14-Big_List_of_Scalabilty_Conferences.html">1115 high scalability-2011-09-14-Big List of Scalabilty Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please comment on that too.
 
Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work. Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not. Taking all that wisdom and stuffing it into a presentations is surprisingly hard</p><p>4 0.98327333 <a title="1096-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-17-World_of_Warcraft%27s_Lead_designer_Rob_Pardo_on_the_Role_of_the_Cloud_in_Games.html">1342 high scalability-2012-10-17-World of Warcraft's Lead designer Rob Pardo on the Role of the Cloud in Games</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson:  Game Industry Legends: Rob Pardo , where the future of gaming is discussed, there was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:
  Q. If the game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of those technical issues?

 


 Rob Pardo : I certainly think there's a lot of potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with the infrastructure that can have all those games up there.

<p>Introduction: I'm Going To Scale My Foot Up Your Ass  -  Shut up about scalability, no one is using your app anyway.      Multi-Tenant Data Architecture  - Microsoft's take on different approaches to multitenancy.     Cloud computing rides on spiraling Energy costs  -   A report by US researchers has shown the increasing cost of power and cooling in the data centre is a driver towards cloud computing.      Interview: Apple’s Gigantic New Data Center Hints at Cloud Computing  -  Companies building centers this big are getting into cloud computing. Running apps in the cloud requires massive infrastructure: Google-size infrastructure.      What Does Cloud Computing Actually Cost? An Analysis of the Top Vendors  -  Amazon is currently the lowest cost cloud computing option overall. At least for production applications that need more than 6.5 hours of CPU/day, otherwise GAE is technically cheaper because it's free until this usage level.      no:sql(east)  - October 28–30, 2009, Atlanta, GA.

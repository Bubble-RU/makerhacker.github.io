<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAndy Gelfond, VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy
has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the
earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and
operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site.
There's an update for this article atAn Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run
On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment. For TripAdvisor, scalability is woven into
our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture,
development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture
and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a
scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and
deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a
culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and
effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable consumer

<p>Introduction: Sometimes I get article proposals and then there's no follow up. Though these
TripAdvisor data points are from 2010, I thought them worth sharing:Our site
serves in excess of 100M dynamically generated page view a day (all media and
static content goes through CDN), and we do this with about 100 machines, no
single point of failure, supported by distributed service architecture that
that responds to over 2B requests a day, and a data warehouse of over 20TB
that is used to drive email campaigns, SEM, and general reporting. We are a
Linux/Java/Apache/Tomcat/Postgres/Lucene shop, and have built our own
distributed computing architecture. We also maintain duplicate data centers
(one active, one standby) for redundancy and maintenance purposes.Too bad, it
sounds like it would have been a good article.Related Articles A new twist on

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ali Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead at
PlanForCloud.com.  I read a recent blog post about TripAdvisor's experiment
with AWS where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a
replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on
Pinterest's massive growth on AWS. These blogs highlighted exactly the types
of questions we're interested in, mainly:How much would it cost to deploy
System X on Cloud Y? e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the
AWS US-East cloud?Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y? e.g.
would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances,
different cloud providers...What happens to costs when the system grows? e.g.
Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate
of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?I created a couple
of deployments in PlanForCloud to explore these questions and the results are
very interesting - th</p><p>5 0.18015637 <a title="1072-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-24-Update_on_How_29_Cloud_Price_Drops_Changed_the_Bottom_Line_of_TripAdvisor_and_Pinterest_-_Results_Mixed.html">1480 high scalability-2013-06-24-Update on How 29 Cloud Price Drops Changed the Bottom Line of TripAdvisor and Pinterest - Results Mixed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAli Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead atPlanForCloud. The
original article was publishedon their site. With 29 cloud price reductions I
thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change
compared to an articlewe published last year. The result is surprisingly
little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances havenot dropped
as fastas for other other instances types.Over the last year and a half,we
counted 29 price reductionsin cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute
Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct
effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is
that effect on the bottom line?Last year I wrote aboutcloud cost forecasts for
TripAdvisor and Pinterest.TripAdvisor was experimenting with AWSand attempted
to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of its live site,
andPinterest was growing massively on AWS. In the wake of the cloud providers'

There's an update for this article atAn Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run
On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment. For TripAdvisor, scalability is woven into
our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture,
development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture
and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a
scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and
deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a
culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and
effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable consumer

<p>Introduction: Seldom do we get to hear stories of the bumps and bruses earned by a popular
website during its formative years. Ross Snyder, a Sr. Software Engineer at
Etsy, changes that with an engaging talk he gave at Surge 2011:Scaling Etsy:
What Went Wrong, What Went Right.Ross gives a detailed and honest account of
how Etsy went from a raw startup in 2005, to a startup struggling with their
success in 2007, to the mean, handmade, super scaling, ops driven machine
they've become in 2011.There's lots to learn from this illuminating story of
transformation:Origin StoryEtsyis a market for handmade goods. They connect
buyers and sellers, similar to eBay, they don't handle goods.Started: June
2005,3 guys in an apartment.Today: 250 employees, billions of pageviews a

<p>Introduction: Pud off*ckedcomany.com (FC) fame, a favorite site of the dot bomb era, and a
site I absolutely loved until my company became featured, has given us a look
at his backend: Why Must You Laugh At My Back End. For those whose don't
remember FC's history, TechCrunch published afitting eulogy:[FC] first went
live in 2000, chronicling failing and troubled companies in its unique and
abrasive style after the dot com bust. Within a year it had a massive audience
and was getting serious mainstream press attention. As the startup economy
became better in 2004, much of the attention the site received went away. But
a large and loyal audience remains at the site, coming back day after day for
its unique slant on the news. At its peak, FC had 4 million unique monthly
visitors.Delightfully, FC was not a real-names kind of site. Hard witty
cynicism ruled and not a single cat picture was in sight. It was a blast of
fun when all around was the enclosing dark.So when I saw Pud's post I was

<p>Introduction: I've largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the "NoSQL vs.
Relational" conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about
currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to
build in, I'd like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint.
In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I've inadvertently given myself
plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches,
and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say
with a fair amount of certainty, that I've found a good compromise. You can

<p>Introduction: If you are aninsect, don't work at TripAdvisor, specialization is out. One of
the most commented on strategies from theTripAdvisor architecture article is
their rather opinionated take on the role of engineers in the
organization.Typically engineers live in a box. They are specialized, they do
database work and not much else, and they just do programming, not much else.
TripAdvisor takes the road less traveled:Engineers work across entire stack-
HTML, CSS, JS, Java, scripting. If you do not know something, you learn it.
The only thing that gets in the way of delivering your project is you, as you
are expected to work at all levels - design, code, test, monitoring, CSS, JS,
Java, SQL, scripting.We do not have "architects."  At TripAdvisor, if you
design something, your code it, and if you code it you test it. Engineers who
do not like to go outside their comfort zone, or who feel certain work is
"beneath" them will simply get in the way.A radical take for an established
organization. We</p><p>3 0.77966583 <a title="1072-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Yslow_to_speed_up_your_web_pages.html">47 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Yslow to speed up your web pages</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hello highscalability world. I just discovered this site yesterday in a search
for a scalability resource and was very pleased to find such useful
information. I have some questions regarding distributed caching that I was
hoping the scalability intelligentsia trafficking this forum could answer. I
apologize for my lack of technical knowledge; I'm hoping this site will
increase said knowledge! Feel free to answer all or as much as you want. Thank
you in advance for your responses and thank you for a great resource!1.) What
are the standard benchmarks used to measure the performance of memcached or
mySQL/memcached working together (from web 2.0 companies etc)?2.) The little
research I've conducted on this site suggests that most web 2.0 companies use
a combination of mySQL and a hacked memcached (and potentially sharding). Does
anyone know if any of these companies use an enterprise vendor for their
distributed caching layer? (At this point in time I've only heard of Jive

<p>Introduction: Update:Digg on their choice and use of Puppet. They chose puppet over
cfengine, and bcfg2 because they liked Puppet's resource abstraction layer
(RAL), the ability to implement configuration management incrementally,
support for bundles, and the overall design philosophy.Puppetimplements a
declarative (what not how) configuration language for automating common
administration tasks. It's the system every large site writes for themselves
and it's already made for you! Ilike was able to "easily" scale from0 to
hundreds of serversusing Puppet. I can't believe I've never seen this before.
It looks really cool. What is Puppet and how can it help you scale your

help the sysadmin community move to building and sharing mature tools that
avoid the duplication of everyone solving the same problem. It does so in two

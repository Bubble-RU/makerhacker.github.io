<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Dan Bartow, VP ofSOASTA, talking about how they pelted
MySpace with 1 million concurrent users using 800 EC2 instances. I thought
this was an interesting story because: that's a lot of users, it takes big
cajones to test your live site like that, and not everything worked out quite
as expected. I'd like to thank Dan for taking the time to write and share this
article.In December of 2009 MySpace launched a new wave of streaming music
video offerings in New Zealand, building on the previous success of MySpace
music.  These new features included the ability to watch music videos, search
for artist's videos, create lists of favorites, and more. The anticipated load
increase from a feature like this on a popular site like MySpace is huge, and
they wanted to test these features before making them live. If you manage the
infrastructure that sits behind a high traffic application you don't want any
surprises.  You want to understand your breaking points, define your cap</p><p>4 0.35559762 <a title="1011-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-12-MySpace_Architecture.html">511 high scalability-2009-02-12-MySpace Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hello highscalability world. I just discovered this site yesterday in a search
for a scalability resource and was very pleased to find such useful
information. I have some questions regarding distributed caching that I was
hoping the scalability intelligentsia trafficking this forum could answer. I
apologize for my lack of technical knowledge; I'm hoping this site will
increase said knowledge! Feel free to answer all or as much as you want. Thank
you in advance for your responses and thank you for a great resource!1.) What
are the standard benchmarks used to measure the performance of memcached or
mySQL/memcached working together (from web 2.0 companies etc)?2.) The little
research I've conducted on this site suggests that most web 2.0 companies use
a combination of mySQL and a hacked memcached (and potentially sharding). Does
anyone know if any of these companies use an enterprise vendor for their
distributed caching layer? (At this point in time I've only heard of Jive

<p>Introduction: My favorite kind of histories are those told from an insider's perspective.
The story of Richard the Lionheart is full of great battles and dynastic
intrigue. The story of one of his soldiers, not so much. Yet the soldiers'
story, as someone who has experienced the real consequences of decisions made
and actions taken, is more revealing.We get such a history in Chat Wars, a
wonderful article written by David Auerbach, who in 1998 worked at Microsoft
on MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft's instant messaging app (for a related
story see The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted).It's as
if Herodotus visited Microsoft and wrote down his experiences. It has that
same sort of conversational tone, insightful on-the-ground observations, and
facts no outsider might ever believe.Much of the article is a play-by-play
account of the cat and mouse game David plays changing Messenger to track
AOL's Instant Messenger protocol changes. AOL repeatedly tried to make it so

the status of the waiting list of hundreds of thousands of users eagerly
waiting to download your product. That's the enviable positionMailbox, a free
mobile email management app, found themselves early in their release cycle.
Hasn't email been done already? Apparently not. Mailbox scaled to one million
users in a paltry six weeks with a team ofabout 14 people. As of April they
were delivering over100 million messages per day.How did they do it? Mailbox
engineering lead,Sean Beausoleil, gave an informative interview on
readwrite.comon how Mailbox planned to scale... Gather signals early. A pre-
release launch video helped generate interest, but it also allowed them to
gauge early interest before even releasing. From the overwhelming response
they knew they would need to have to scale and scale quickly. Have something
unique. The average person might not think a mailbox app would be a fertile
product space. T</p><p>5 0.78392339 <a title="1011-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster_Lost_Lead_Because_of_a_Failure_to_Scale.html">153 high scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster Lost Lead Because of a Failure to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important. Jim Scheinman, former Bebo
and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to
scale as why they lost the social networking race:VB: Can you tell me a bit
about what you learned in your time at Friendster? JS:For me, it basically
came down to failed execution on the technology side -- we had millions of
Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log
in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in
to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling
us that if we didn't get our site working better soon, they'd be 'forced to
join' a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpaceâ&euro;Śthe
rest is history. To be fair to Friendster's technology team at the time, they
were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites
simply hadn't had to deal with prior to Friendster. As is often the case, the

<p>Introduction: Robert Scobleis a kind of Brothers Grimm for the digital age. Instead of
inspired romantics walking around the country side collecting the folk tales
of past ages, he is an inspired technologist documenting the current mythology
of startups.One of the developments Robert is exploring is the rise of
thecontextual age. Where every bit of information about you is continually
being prodded, pulled, and observed, shoveled into a great learning machine,
and turned into a fully actionableknowledge graphof context. A digital
identity more real to software than your physical body ever was. Sinner or
saviour, the Age of Context has interesting implications for startups. It
raises the entrance bar to dizzying heights. Much of the reason companies are
tearing down the Golden Age of the Web, one open protocol at a time, is to
create a walled garden of monopolized information.To operate in this world you
will have to somehow create a walled garden of your own. And it will be a damn
big garden. So yo</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96465236 <a title="1011-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-25-Did_the_Microsoft_Stack_Kill_MySpace%3F.html">1011 high scalability-2011-03-25-Did the Microsoft Stack Kill MySpace?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble wrote a fascinating case study,MySpace's death spiral: insiders
say it's due to bets on Los Angeles and Microsoft, where he reports MySpace
insiders blame the Microsoft stack on why theylost the great social network
raceto Facebook.  Does anyone know if this is true? What's the real story?I
was wondering because it doesn't seem to track with theMySpace Architecture
post that I did in 2009, where they seem happy with their choices and had
stats to back up their improvements. Why this matters is it's a fascinating
model for startups to learn from. What does it really take to succeed? Is it
the people or the stack? Is it the organization or the technology? Is it the
process or the competition? Is the quality of the site or the love of the
users? So much to consider and learn from.Some conjectures from the
article:Myspace didn't have programming talent capable of scaling the site to
compete with Facebook.Choosing the Microsoft stack made it difficult to hire

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,EhcacheTerracotta Inc.Note:
this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are
still generally valid and useful.The legendary Moore's Law, which states that
the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every two years, has held true since 1965. It
follows that integrated circuits will continue to get smaller, with chip
fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm process (1). Users of big iron
hardware, or servers that are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity,
benefit from this trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful
over time. At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum
mechanics will preclude further density increases.At the same time, low-cost
commodity hardware influences enterprise architects to scale their
applications horizontally, where processing is spread across clusters of low-
cost commodity serv</p><p>4 0.9564172 <a title="1011-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-28-Amazon%27s_EC2%3A_Pay_as_You_Grow_Could_Cut_Your_Costs_in_Half.html">195 high scalability-2007-12-28-Amazon's EC2: Pay as You Grow Could Cut Your Costs in Half</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: SummizeComputes Computing Resources for a Startup. Lots of nice
graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost
efficient for well used larger machines. Long term storage costs may eat your
saving away. And out of cloud bandwidth costs are high.Update:
viaProductionScale, a nice Digital Web article onhow to setup S3 to store
media filesand how Blue Origin was able to handle 3.5 million requests and 758
GBs in bandwidth in a single day for very little $$$. Also a Right Scale
article onNetwork performance within Amazon EC2 and to Amazon S3. 75MB/s
between EC2 instances, 10.2MB/s between EC2 and S3 for download, 6.9MB/s
upload.Now that Amazon's S3 (storage service) isout of betaand EC2 (elastic
compute cloud) has added newinstance types(the class of machine you can rent)
with more CPU and more RAM, I thought it would be interesting to take a look
out how their pricing stacks up.The quick conclusion:the more you scale the
more you save. A six node co</p><p>5 0.95546925 <a title="1011-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-10-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_10%2C_2012.html">1302 high scalability-2012-08-10-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 10, 2012</a></p>

</p><p>11 Some issues in their previous datacenter motivated the move:Network issues, someBGP(Border Gateway Protocol) providers would stop working, they wouldn't peer automatically, and they would end up with a dead site for an hour and had to really push to have their datacenter manually remove the peer.

views per second, 694,444 views per minute, and 41,666,667 views per

order to become your video platform leader--all for free. Upload, edit, watch,
search, and comment on video from your own site without visiting YouTube.
Compose your site internally from APIs because you'll need to expose them
later anyway.YouTube grew incredibly fast, to over 100 million video views per
day, with only a handful of people responsible for scaling the site. How did
they manage to deliver all that video to all those users? And how have they
evolved since being acquired by Google?Information SourcesGoogle

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: Update 10:The Value of CDNsby Mike Axelrod of Google. Google implements a
distributed content cache from withinlarge ISPs. This allows them to serve
content from the edge of the network and save bandwidth on the ISPs
backbone.Update 9:Just Jump: Start using Clouds and CDNs. Bob Buffone gives a
really nice and practical tutorial of how to use CloudFront as your
CDN.breakUpdate 8:Akamai’s Services Become Affordable for Anyone! Blazing Web
Site Performance by Distribution Cloud.Distribution Cloud starts at $150 per
month for access to the best content distribution network in the world and the
leader of Content Distribution Networks.Update 7:Where Amazon’s Data Centers
Are Located,Expanding the Cloud: Amazon CloudFront.Why Amazon's CDN Offering
Is No Threat To Akamai, Limelight or CDN Pricing. Amazon has launched their
CDN with "“low latency, high data transfer speeds, and no commitments.” The
perfect relationship for many. The majority of the locations are in North
America, but some are i</p><p>6 0.79570735 <a title="1037-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-01-How_to_update_video_views_count_effectively%3F.html">294 high scalability-2008-04-01-How to update video views count effectively?</a></p>

power, and popcorn.Evernote hits 10 million users. StackExchange hits 1

<p>Introduction: Viddler is in the high quality Video as a Service business for a customer who
wants to pay a fixed cost, be done with it, and just have it work. Similar to
Blip and Ooyala, more focussed on business than YouTube. They serve thousands
of business customers, including high traffic websites like FailBlog,
Engadget, and Gawker.Viddler is a good case to learn from because they are a
small company trying to provide a challenging service in a crowded field. We
are catching them just as they transitioning from a startup that began in one
direction, as a YouTube competitor, and pivoted into a slightly larger company
focussed on paying business customers.Transition is the key word for Viddler:
transitioning from a free YouTube clone to a high quality paid service.
Transitioning from a few colo sites that didn't work well to a new higher
quality datacenter. Transitioning from an architecture that was typical of a
startup to one that features redundancy, high availability, and automation.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post bySiddharth Anand, a senior member of LinkedIn's
Distributed Data Systems team. Preamble RambleIf you've been working in the
online (e.g. internet) space over the past 3 years, you are no stranger to
terms like "the cloud" and "NoSQL".In 2007, Amazon published a paper onDynamo.
The paper detailed how Dynamo, employing a collection of techniques to solve
several problems in fault-tolerance, provided a resilient solution to the on-
line shopping cart problem. A few years go by while engineers at AWS toil in
relative obscurity at standing up their public cloud.It's December 2008 and I
am a member of Netflix's Software Infrastructure team. We've just been told
that there is something called the "CAP theorem" and because of it, we are to
abandon our datacenter in hopes of leveraging Cloud Computing.Huh?A month into
the investigation, we start wondering about our Oracle database. How are we
are going to move it into the cloud? That's when we are told that we are to

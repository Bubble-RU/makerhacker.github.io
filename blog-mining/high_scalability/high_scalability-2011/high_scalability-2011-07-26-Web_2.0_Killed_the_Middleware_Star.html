<p>Introduction: Caching/data-grids are going through a similar evolution to databases. As with
databases, we started by using caching as an embedded service to the
application. Now we are in the phase where we need to be able to share the
data between multiple applications, or in cases where we don't want to share
the data, we need to be able to share the resources for managing the data,
while keeping a high degree of isolation.The demand for these sort of
requirements becomes much more common with SOA or SaaS-based applications. As
we approach the next generation of middleware and data-centers, it becomes
clear that we cannot move to the next wave of virtualization and cloud
computing without a strong security and isolation solution that is built-in to
all layers of our application and middleware.</p><p>3 0.18919118 <a title="1087-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Breakthrough_Web-Tier_Solutions_with_Record-Breaking_Performance.html">453 high scalability-2008-12-01-Breakthrough Web-Tier Solutions with Record-Breaking Performance</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application
delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to
addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application
delivery tier of the data center. By Lori Mac Vittie, F5 Networks The "High
Scalability" blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not
disappoint with a posthighlighting a set of scalability design patternsthat
was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on "6 Ways to
Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way." Credit:Michael
Chow/azcentral.com  This particular post caught my attention primarily because
although I've touched on many of these patterns in the past, I've never
thought to call them what they are: scalability patterns. That's probably a
side-effect of forgetting thatbuilding an architecture of any kind is at its

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: An interesting and different implementation approach: Tempest: Scalable Time-
Critical Web Services Platform: Tempest is a new framework for developing
time-critical web services. Tempest enables developers to build scalable,
fault-tolerant services that can then be automatically replicated and deployed
across clusters of computing nodes. The platform automatically adapts to load
ďŹ&sbquo;uctuations, reacts when components fail, and ensures consistency between
replicas by repairing when inconsistencies do occur. Tempest relies on a
family of epidemic protocols and on Ricochet, a reliable time critical
multicast protocol with probabilistic guarantees.Tempest is built around a
novel storage abstraction called the TempestCollection in which application
developers store the state of a service. Our platform handles the replication
of this state across clones of the service, persistence, and failure handling.

developer, th</p><p>3 0.80269706 <a title="1087-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-25-Is_Your_Data_Really_Secured%3F.html">727 high scalability-2009-10-25-Is Your Data Really Secured?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems

That's the question addressed by Dominique Guinard in his ambitious
dissertation: A Web of Things Application Architecture - Integrating the Real-
World (slides). With the continued siloing of content, perhaps we can keep our
things open and talking to each other?In the architecture things are modeled
using REST, they will be findable via search, they will be social via a social
access controller, and they will be mashupable. Here's great graphical
overview of the entire system: Abstract:A central concern in the area of
pervasive computing has been the integration of digital artifactsts with the
physical world and vice-versa. Recent developments in the fi eld of embedded
devices have led to smart things increasingly populating our daily life. We de
fine smart things as digitally enhanced physical objectsts and devices that
have communication capabilities. Application domains are for instance wireless

<p>Introduction: Jeff Atwood started a barn burner of a conversation inMaybe Normalizing Isn't
Normalon how to create a fast scalable tagging system. Jeff eventually asks
that terrible question:which is better -- a normalized database, or a
denormalized database?And all hell breaks loose. I know, it's hard to imagine
database debates becoming contentious, but it does happen :-) It's lucky
developers don't have temporal power or rivers of blood would flow.Here are a
few of the pithier points (summarized):breakNormalization is not magical fairy
dust you sprinkle over your database to cure all ills; it often creates as
many problems as it solves. (Jeff)Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until
it works. (Jeff)Use materialized views which are tables created and maintained
by your RDBMS. So a materialized view will act exactly like a de-normalized
table would - except you keep you original normalized structure and any change
to original data will propagate to the view automatically. (Goran)According to

<p>Introduction: Recently I had to help users on one of my opensource project ISPMan.
http://ispman.netThis project started in 2001 as I was too unwilling to take
care of the DNS and VitualHosting stuff as it was a side-thing to the company
I worked for (so i wrote a software that took care of all these little
details)Summary: A large project that needs a rewrite can be done in a matter
of day.I will not give you a full case study about a project that went through
a re-write but a case study about how easy it is to re-write
something.breakDetails:My boss was cool enough to let me open-source the
project and obviously, I got a lot of cool-cred out of it.Later on I also did
some support and implementation and earned quiet some money with it.Eventually
I had to let the project go out of my hand to the community as I only did it
to facilitate a job that wasnt williing to do. (Setup DNS zones of multiple
servers, find out which host should host the website and put VirtualHost
section there, find out which m</p><p>4 0.97528172 <a title="1087-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-When_things_aren%27t_scalable.html">232 high scalability-2008-01-29-When things aren't scalable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK,I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any
sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll
ask here.Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application"
that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good
consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen
sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but
no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server"
when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously
useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-
alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.The
normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page
like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy
page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let a user
"in" a</p><p>same-blog 5 0.97482961 <a title="1087-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-26-Web_2.0_Killed_the_Middleware_Star.html">1087 high scalability-2011-07-26-Web 2.0 Killed the Middleware Star</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It started out innocently enough with a simple question, "What exactly *is*
the model for PaaS services scalability? If based on HTTP/REST API
integration, fairly easy. If native middleware… input?" You'll forgive the odd
phrasing - Twitter's limitations sometimes make conversations of this nature …
interesting.The discussion culminated in what appeared to be the sentiment
that middleware was mostly obsolete with respect to PaaS.THE OLD WAYVery
briefly for those of you who are more infrastructure / network minded than
application architecture fluent, let's review the traditional middleware-based
application architecture.Generally speaking, middleware - a.k.a. JMS, MQ
Series and most recently, ESB - is leveraged as means to enable a publish-
subscribe model of sharing data. Basically, it's an integration pattern, but
no one really likes to admit that because of the connotations associated with
the evil word "integration" in the enterprise. But that's what it's used for -

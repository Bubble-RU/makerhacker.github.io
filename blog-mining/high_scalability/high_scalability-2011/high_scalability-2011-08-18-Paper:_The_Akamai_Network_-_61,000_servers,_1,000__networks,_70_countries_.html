Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the

different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available

<p>Introduction: CDNs (content delivery networks) are the secret shadow super powers behind the
web and Dan Rayburn atstreamingmedia.comis the go to investigative reporter
for quality information on CDNs. Every year Dan has a Content Delivery Summit
on all things CDN and those videos arenow available. Dan also gives a kind
ofstate of the industry talkwhere he does something wonderful, he gives real
numbers and prices. Dan really knows his stuff and is an excellent speaker, so
watch the video, but here's my gloss on the state of the CDN so far this
year:Massive growth. Large customers are expecting 126% growth in video
traffic over last year; medium size customers are seeing 48% traffic growth,
small sized customer are seeing 73.3% traffic growth.More traffic != More
profit. Traffic growth doesn't lead to more profit because the traffic growth
is concentrated in larger customers that can make the best deals.Video takes
up the largest amount of traffic on a CDNs network but gives the least amount

<p>Introduction: Playing like the big boys may be getting cheaper. The big boys, likeYouTube,
farm the serving of their most popular videos to a third party CDN. A lot of
people were surprised YouTube didn't serve all their content themselves, but
it makes sense. It allows them to keep up with demand without a large hit for
infrastructure build out, much like leasing computers instead of buying
them.breakThe problem has been CDNs are expensive. Om Malik reports inAkamai &
the CDN Price Warsthat may be changing. CDN service could be becoming
affordable enough that you might consider using them as part of your scaling
strategy.Akamai, once the clear leader in the CDN field, is facing strong
competition from the likes of Limelight Networks, Level 3, Internap,
CDNetworks, Panther Express and EdgeCast Networks.Thiscommoditizationmay be
bad for their stock prices, but it's good for website builders looking for new
scaling strategies. EdgeCast, for example, passes on the cost savings when

<p>Introduction: Yahoo has developed a new language called Pig Latin that fit in a sweet spot
between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level,
procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.The
accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into
physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce
implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined
Hadoop as a subproject.The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo!
are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and
execution of their data analysis tasks, compared tousing Hadoop
directly.References:Apache Pig Wiki</p><p>2 0.99262947 <a title="1100-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-23-Big_Data_on_Grids_or_on_Clouds%3F_.html">743 high scalability-2009-11-23-Big Data on Grids or on Clouds? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:Now that we have a new computing paradigm,
Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data
vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds?
Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space,
and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still
seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids
versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are
a number of issues driving this uncertainty.read more at:BigDataMatters.com</p><p>3 0.99184483 <a title="1100-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-23-When_to_migrate_your_database%3F.html">782 high scalability-2010-02-23-When to migrate your database?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming
your business - reports are out of date, your batch processing window is
nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database
consolidation - remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database
environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware,
OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are
clear,  what now?ďťżRead more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>4 0.98695356 <a title="1100-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-02-Some_Real_Financial_Numbers_for_Your_Startup.html">107 high scalability-2007-10-02-Some Real Financial Numbers for Your Startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are a startup you may find useful Guy Kawasaki's postFinancial Models
for Underachievers: Two Years of the Real Numbers of a Startup. Part of any
business plan are the projected guestimates. They are guestimates because
everyone keeps these numbers hidden like a Swiss bank account. But notRedfin.
They've bravely shared their initial cost projections, their actual numbers
from real life, and the lessons they've learned from the discrepancy between
the two...breakYou can find their model estimates and actuals for Rent, Per
Employee, Per Month (model: $250, actual: $336); Initial Per-Employee
Equipment Cost; Monthly Benefits, Per-Employee; Annual Payroll Tax; Quarterly
Bonus Payout, as a % of the Total Possible; Annual Payroll Increase for
Existing Employees; All-Company Meeting Cost, Per-Meeting, Per-Employee;
Annual Accounting Costs, and a few more.There is also a great lessons section:
Focus on headcount; Plan slow, run fast; Run top-down sanity-checks; Forget
economies of scale</p><p>5 0.98653233 <a title="1100-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-12-Should_I_use_LAMP_or_Windows%3F.html">8 high scalability-2007-07-12-Should I use LAMP or Windows?</a></p>

haven't received a good answer about what I should use to buildit, so I
thought I would give it a shot.I am a windows guy. I know .Net and ASP and how
to build web sites using that stack. But I notice most sites use LAMP and

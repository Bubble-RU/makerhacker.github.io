<p>Introduction: It started out innocently enough with a simple question, "What exactly *is*
the model for PaaS services scalability? If based on HTTP/REST API
integration, fairly easy. If native middleware… input?" You'll forgive the odd
phrasing - Twitter's limitations sometimes make conversations of this nature …
interesting.The discussion culminated in what appeared to be the sentiment
that middleware was mostly obsolete with respect to PaaS.THE OLD WAYVery
briefly for those of you who are more infrastructure / network minded than
application architecture fluent, let's review the traditional middleware-based
application architecture.Generally speaking, middleware - a.k.a. JMS, MQ
Series and most recently, ESB - is leveraged as means to enable a publish-
subscribe model of sharing data. Basically, it's an integration pattern, but
no one really likes to admit that because of the connotations associated with
the evil word "integration" in the enterprise. But that's what it's used for -

<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill wrote an interesting article on O'Reilly Radar covering the
current solutions for running Big Data in the CloudBig data and cloud
technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing,
which clouds can readily provide.Big PaaSEdd touched briefly on the role of
PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloudBeyond IaaS, several
cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes
referred to as managed solutions, or platform as a service (PaaS), these
services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce,
reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers
can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass
those savings on to the customer.To put it simply, managing data clusters is
one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we
need to think about when we're dealing with application platforms, as I noted
in one of my earlier</p><p>4 0.11234535 <a title="977-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBenjamin Wootton, CTO ofContino, a London based
consultancy specialising in applying DevOps and Continuous Delivery to
software delivery projects. Microservices are a style of software architecture
that involves delivering systems as a set of very small, granular, independent
collaborating services.Though they aren't a particularly new idea,
Microservices seem to have exploded in popularity this year, with articles,
conference tracks, and Twitter streams waxing lyrical about the benefits of
building software systems in this style.This popularity is partly off the back
of trends such as Cloud, DevOps and Continuous Delivery coming together as
enablers for this kind of approach, and partly off the back of great work at
companies such as Netflix who have very visibly applied the pattern to great
effect.Let me say up front that I am a fan of the approach. Microservices
architectures have lots of very real and significant benefits:The services
themselves are very simp</p><p>3 0.76831383 <a title="977-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-11-The_interactive_cloud.html">702 high scalability-2009-09-11-The interactive cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How many times have you been called in the middle of the night by your
operation guys telling you that your application throws some odd red alerts?
How many times did you found out that when those issues happens you don't have
enough information to analyze this incident? have you tried to increase the
log level just to find out that your problem became even worse - now your
application throws tons of information in a continues basis most of which is
complete garbage...The current separation between the way we implement our
application and the way we manage it leads to many of this ridicules
situations. Cloud makes those things even worse.Inthis posti suggest an
alternative approach. Why don't we run our application the way we run our
business? I refer to this approach as the "interactive cloud" where our
application behaves just like our project team and the operations just like
our managers. As with our business our application would need to take more
responsibility to the way it runs</p><p>4 0.7340771 <a title="977-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops
Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access
to production machin</p><p>6 0.71952176 <a title="977-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-05-10_Golden_Principles_For_Building_Successful_Mobile-Web_Applications.html">1277 high scalability-2012-07-05-10 Golden Principles For Building Successful Mobile-Web Applications</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot
of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications
stemming from this, we use AIDA.AIDA(Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant)
is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git,
TeamCity and JIRA.In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were
able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous
integration.We'll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use
here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release
branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we'll discuss AIDA's major
contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.Git flowThe Badoo Team uses
Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and
tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in
JIRA and a description of the problem.BFG-

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.90140563 <a title="977-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-21-PaaS_shouldn%E2%80%99t_be_built_in_Silos.html">977 high scalability-2011-01-21-PaaS shouldn’t be built in Silos</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unlike many of the existing Platforms, in this second-generation phase, its
not going to be enough to package and bundle different individual middleware
services and products (Web Containers, Messaging, Data, Monitoring, Automation
and Control, Provisioning) and brand them under the same name to make them
look as one. (Fusion? Fabric? A rose is a rose by any other name - and in this
case, it's not a rose.)The second-generation PaaS needs to come with a
holistic approach that couples all those things together and provide a
complete holistic experience. By that I mean that if I add a machine into
cluster, I need to see that as an increase in capacity on my entire
application stack, the monitoring system needs to discover that new machine
and start monitoring it without any configuration setup, the load-balancer
need to add it to its pool and so forth.Our challenge as technologists would
be to move from our current siloed comfort zone. That applies not just to the
way we design our applic</p><p>6 0.89417636 <a title="977-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex_Architecture.html">258 high scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex Architecture</a></p>

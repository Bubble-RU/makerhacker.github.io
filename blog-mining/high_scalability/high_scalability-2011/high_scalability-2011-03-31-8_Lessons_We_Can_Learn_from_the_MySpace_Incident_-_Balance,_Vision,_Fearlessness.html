  All computer companies are technology companies first.   A repeated theme was that you can't be an entertainment company first. You are a technology company providing entertainment using technology. The tech can inform the entertainment side, the entertainment side drives features, but they really can't be separated. An awesome stack that does nothing is useless. A great idea on a poor stack is just as useless. There's a difficult balance that must be achieved and both management and developers must be aware that there's something to balance.  All pigs are equal .

</p><p>6 On the flip side if the development staff doesn't push to do the right things because they either don't know or are intimidated by management, then you will fail. [sent-14, score-0.187]
</p><p>7 Justin Kruger with a  great illustration : B y pegging revenue to page impressions it made increases page views more important the pruning tuning and tightening the site. [sent-17, score-0.165]
</p><p>8 The deal soured with Google because the terms were around  pageviews  and clicks. [sent-18, score-0.148]
</p><p>9 MySpace  and Fox decided to target those terms to maximize revenue. [sent-19, score-0.163]
</p><p>10 Our team kept joking with management that we were going to create a  MySpace - Lite  as a side project from our REST  APIs  and to get rid of all of the crap. [sent-22, score-0.273]
</p><p>11 But the cadence at 'web' players was sporadic at best and often frenetic, feature request, test, iterate, feature, iterate, test, coast, coast, coast, feature, feature, feature, test, coast, Etc. [sent-33, score-0.313]
</p><p>12 As ideas struck the 'web' infrastructure folks they would would immediately implement some sort of prototype or test case, then rapid fire come up with features the infrastructure needed to support to maximize this feature. [sent-34, score-0.388]
</p><p>13 But sometimes they would go long periods, months, where nothing would change (in the infrastructure side, web pages, UX, etc sure but same servers and storage assets). [sent-35, score-0.295]
</p><p>14 What happens if you try to change faster than the infrastructure can change, is that you end up hacking around the limits, and that builds up technical scar tissue that over time slows your mobility still further. [sent-37, score-0.46]
</p><p>15 So bottom line, you can't continue to pivot faster than your infrastructure, if you're hacking your way around the infrastructure to change, then your ability to change will die by a thousand hacks. [sent-38, score-0.395]
</p><p>16 Success doesn't last - change fearlessly . [sent-51, score-0.108]
</p><p>17 Justin Kruger  describes MySpace's management culture  as one afraid to innovate and move forward:  We also had management that didn't want to piss off users and so we would have 2 or 3 versions of the site out there, and we required users to upgrade to new versions. [sent-52, score-0.192]
</p><p>18 MySpace responded slowly to the competition, for reasons of technical and/or cultural debt, both processes that set in motion the forces that bring about destruction. [sent-58, score-0.102]
</p><p>19 Once Google  pulled its advertising deal , which was the majority of MySpace's revenue, layoffs began which drained the momentum out of the company. [sent-60, score-0.138]
</p><p>20 Build a diverse portfolio of revenue sources so you are not held hostage to one company. [sent-61, score-0.165]

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble wrote a fascinating case study,  MySpace’s death spiral: insiders say it’s due to bets on Los Angeles and Microsoft , where he reports MySpace insiders blame the Microsoft stack on why they  lost the great social network race  to Facebook.  
 
Does anyone know if this is true? What's the real story?
 
I was wondering because it doesn't seem to track with the  MySpace Architecture  post that I did in 2009, where they seem happy with their choices and had stats to back up their improvements. Why this matters is it's a fascinating model for startups to learn from. What does it really take to succeed? Is it the people or the stack? Is it the organization or the technology? Is it the process or the competition? Is the quality of the site or the love of the users? So much to consider and learn from.
 
Some conjectures from the article:
  
 Myspace didn't have programming talent capable of scaling the site to compete with Facebook.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Dan Bartow, VP of  SOASTA , talking about how they pelted MySpace with 1 million concurrent users using 800 EC2 instances. I thought this was an interesting story because: that's a lot of users, it takes big cajones to test your live site like that, and not everything worked out quite as expected. I'd like to thank Dan for taking the time to write and share this article. 
 
 
 
 In December of 2009  MySpace launched a new wave of streaming music video offerings in New  Zealand, building on the previous success of MySpace music.  These  new features included the ability to watch music videos, search for  artist’s videos, create lists of favorites, and more. The anticipated  load increase from a feature like this on a popular site like MySpace  is huge, and they wanted to test these features before making them live.  
 
 If you manage the  infrastructure that sits behind a high traffic application you don’t  want any surprises.  You want to understand your breakin</p><p>4 0.23184331 <a title="1014-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-12-MySpace_Architecture.html">511 high scalability-2009-02-12-MySpace Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Presentation: Behind the Scenes at MySpace.com . Dan Farino, Chief Systems Architect at MySpace shares details of some of MySpace's cool internal operations tools.   MySpace.com  is one of the fastest growing site on the Internet with 65 million subscribers and 260,000 new users registering each day. Often criticized for poor performance, MySpace has had to tackle scalability issues few other sites have faced. How did they do it?

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

Why people feel so passionate about this I'm not quite sure, but fortunately for us, in the best sense of the web, it generated an amazing number of insightful comments and observations. If we stand back and take a look at the whole incident, what can we take a way that might help us in the future?
         
  All computer companies are technology companies first.   A repeated theme was that you can't be an entertainment company first. You are a technology company providing entertainment using technology. The tech can inform the entertainment side, the entertainment side drives features, but they really can't be separated. An awesome stack that does nothing is useless. A great idea on a poor stack is just as useless.

Does anyone know if this is true? What's the real story?
 
I was wondering because it doesn't seem to track with the  MySpace Architecture  post that I did in 2009, where they seem happy with their choices and had stats to back up their improvements. Why this matters is it's a fascinating model for startups to learn from. What does it really take to succeed? Is it the people or the stack? Is it the organization or the technology? Is it the process or the competition? Is the quality of the site or the love of the users? So much to consider and learn from.

<p>Introduction: You know your product is doing well when most of your  early blog posts  deal with the status of the waiting list of hundreds of thousands of users eagerly waiting to download your product. That's the enviable position  Mailbox , a free mobile email management app, found themselves early in their release cycle. 
 
Hasn't email been done already? Apparently not. Mailbox scaled to one million users in a paltry six weeks with a team of  about 14 people . As of April they were delivering over  100 million messages per day .
 
How did they do it? Mailbox engineering lead,  Sean Beausoleil , gave an  informative interview on readwrite.com  on how Mailbox planned to scale... 
  
  Gather signals early . A pre-release launch video helped generate interest, but it also allowed them to gauge early interest before even releasing. From the overwhelming response they knew they would need to have to scale and scale quickly.

<p>Introduction: My favorite kind of histories are those told from an insider's perspective. The story of Richard the Lionheart is full of great battles and dynastic intrigue. The story of one of his soldiers, not so much. Yet the soldiers' story, as someone who has experienced the real consequences of decisions made and actions taken, is more revealing.
 
We get such a history in  Chat Wars , a wonderful article written by David Auerbach, who in 1998 worked at Microsoft on MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft’s instant messaging app (for a related story see  The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted ).
 
It's as if Herodotus visited Microsoft and wrote down his experiences. It has that same sort of conversational tone, insightful on-the-ground observations, and facts no outsider might ever believe.
 
Much of the article is a play-by-play account of the cat and mouse game David plays changing Messenger to track AOL's Instant Messenger protocol changes. AOL repeatedly tried to make it so M</p><p>5 0.75154305 <a title="1014-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster_Lost_Lead_Because_of_a_Failure_to_Scale.html">153 high scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster Lost Lead Because of a Failure to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important.  Jim Scheinman,  former Bebo and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to scale as why they lost the social networking race:   VB  : Can you tell me a bit about what you learned in your time at Friendster? 
 
     JS  :  For me, it basically came down to failed execution on the technology side — we had millions of Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling us that if we didn’t get our site working better soon, they’d be ‘forced to join’ a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpace…the rest is history. To be fair to Friendster’s technology team at the time, they were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites simply hadn’t had to deal with prior to Friendster.

<p>Introduction: A surprising amount of heat and light was generated by the whole  Micrsoft vs MySpace  discussion. Why people feel so passionate about this I'm not quite sure, but fortunately for us, in the best sense of the web, it generated an amazing number of insightful comments and observations. If we stand back and take a look at the whole incident, what can we take a way that might help us in the future?
         
  All computer companies are technology companies first.   A repeated theme was that you can't be an entertainment company first. You are a technology company providing entertainment using technology. The tech can inform the entertainment side, the entertainment side drives features, but they really can't be separated. An awesome stack that does nothing is useless. A great idea on a poor stack is just as useless. There's a difficult balance that must be achieved and both management and developers must be aware that there's something to balance.  All pigs are equal .

<p>Introduction: Save 25% on Hadoop Conference Tickets  Apache Hadoop is a hot technology getting traction all over the enterprise and in the Web 2.0 world. Now, there's going to be a conference dedicated to learning more about Hadoop. It'll be Friday, October 2 at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City.  Hadoop World, as it's being called, will be the first Hadoop event on the east coast. Morning sessions feature talks by Amazon, Cloudera, Facebook, IBM, and Yahoo! Then it breaks out into three tracks: applications, development / administration, and extensions / ecosystems. In addition to the conference itself, there will also be 3 days of training prior to the event for those looking to go deeper. In addition to general sessions speakers, presenters include Hadoop project creator Doug Cutting, as well as experts on large-scale data from Intel, Rackspace, Softplayer, eHarmony, Supermicro, Impetus, Booz Allen Hamilton, Vertica, About.com, and other companies.

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble  is a kind of Brothers Grimm for the digital age. Instead of inspired romantics walking around the country side collecting the folk tales of past ages, he is an inspired technologist documenting the current mythology of startups.
 
One of the developments Robert is exploring is the rise of the  contextual age . Where every bit of information about you is continually being prodded, pulled, and observed, shoveled into a great learning machine, and turned into a fully actionable  knowledge graph  of context. A digital identity more real to software than your physical body ever was. 
 
Sinner or saviour, the Age of Context has interesting implications for startups. It raises the entrance bar to dizzying heights. Much of the reason companies are tearing down the Golden Age of the Web, one open protocol at a time, is to create a walled garden of monopolized information.
 
To operate in this world you will have to somehow create a walled garden of your own. And it will be a damn</p><p>5 0.92807215 <a title="1014-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-24-Big%2C_Small%2C_Hot_or_Cold_-_Examples_of_Robust_Data_Pipelines_from_Stripe%2C_Tapad%2C_Etsy_and_Square.html">1618 high scalability-2014-03-24-Big, Small, Hot or Cold - Examples of Robust Data Pipelines from Stripe, Tapad, Etsy and Square</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a  guest repost  by  Pete Soderling , Founder at  Hakka Labs , creating a community where software engineers come to grow. 
 
In response to a recent post from MongoHQ entitled “ You don’t have big data ," I would generally agree with many of the author’s points.
 
However, regardless of whether you call it big data, small data, hot data or cold data - we are all in a position to admit that *more* data is here to stay - and that’s due to many different factors.
 
Perhaps primarily, as the article mentions, this is due to the decreasing cost of storage over time. Other factors include access to open APIs, the sheer volume of ever-increasing consumer activity online, as well as a plethora of other incentives that are developing (mostly) behind the scenes as companies “share” data with each other. (You know  they do this , right?)
 
But one of the most important things I’ve learned over the past couple of years is that it’s crucial for forward thinking companies to start to design</p><p>6 0.9277252 <a title="1014-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-21-What_CDN_would_you_recommend%3F.html">576 high scalability-2009-04-21-What CDN would you recommend?</a></p>

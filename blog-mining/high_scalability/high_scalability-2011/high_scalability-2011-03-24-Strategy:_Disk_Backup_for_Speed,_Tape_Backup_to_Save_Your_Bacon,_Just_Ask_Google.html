</p><p>5 There was a palpable fear in the land that email accounts might never be restored. [sent-10, score-0.284]
</p><p>6 Over a period of a few days the accounts were restored, and the hero this time was:  tape . [sent-16, score-0.848]
</p><p>7 Well, in some rare instances software bugs can affect several copies of the data. [sent-21, score-0.391]
</p><p>8 Since the tapes are offline, they’re protected from such software bugs. [sent-25, score-0.286]
</p><p>9 We released a storage software update that introduced the unexpected bug, which caused 0. [sent-28, score-0.37]
</p><p>10 In this case it was a software update that caused the problem. [sent-33, score-0.269]
</p><p>11 The reason:  bugs that effect control are more powerful than bugs that effect data . [sent-36, score-0.466]
</p><p>12 Handling it Better   While Google did a great in having a tape backup and then in how they diligently worked to restore accounts from tape, handling communication with the users could have went better. [sent-48, score-0.983]
</p><p>13 Wtallis summed up the problem  succinctly:     People who were affected had their entire Google accounts disabled, and upon trying to log in, they got exactly the same messages they would have gotten if Google had decided to delete the account for ToS abuse. [sent-49, score-0.566]
</p><p>14 Additionally, since the entire account (not just GMail) had to be disabled in order to repair things, stuff like shared google calendars went offline, so users whose accounts were not directly affected were getting misleading error messages, too. [sent-50, score-0.917]
</p><p>15 Some possible fixes:     Programs should give finer grained error messages rather than generic error messages. [sent-52, score-0.411]

<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle , infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made a  really interesting statement  about the economics of scale in the datacenter:
  

Weâ&euro;&trade;ve shown that when you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.

  
My first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>5 0.10846274 <a title="1010-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-20-HighScalability_is_old_news._Step_your_scaling_game_way_up..._%28NSFW_cartoon%29.html">1119 high scalability-2011-09-20-HighScalability is old news.

<p>Introduction: In a  People of ACM  interview with  Sanjay Ghemawat , a Google Fellow in the Systems Infrastructure Group (MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, GFS, etc), talks about a few interesting aspects of Google's culture.
  What Made Google Google  
Progress is a modern idea. The conviction that future can be changed for the better through individual advancement and action has over hundreds of years driven an exponential growth in the technome.
 
What drives progress? Challenges. Individuals finding and defeating a challenge. There's usually something someone wants to do so badly that they put in the effort, the thought, and the money into solving all the problems. The results are often something new and amazing.
 
And so it was for Google:
  

The main motivation behind the development of much of Google's infrastructure was the challenge of keeping up with ever-growing data sets. For example, at the same time Google's web search was gaining usage very quickly, we were also scaling up the size of ou</p><p>4 0.74178767 <a title="1010-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-04-For_%245_Million_You_Can_Buy_Enough_Storage_to_Compete_with_Google.html">201 high scalability-2008-01-04-For $5 Million You Can Buy Enough Storage to Compete with Google</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kevin Burton calculates that   Blekko  , one of the barbarian hoard storming Google's search fortress, would need to spend $5 million just to buy enough weapons, er storage.      Kevin estimates storing a deep crawl of the internet would take about 5 petabytes. At a projected $1 million per petabyte that's a paltry $5 million. Less than expected. Imagine in days of old an ambitious noble itching to raise an army to conquer a land and become its new prince. For a fine land, and the search market is one of the richest, that would be a smart investment for a VC to make.      In these situations I always ask: What would Machiavelli do?        Machiavelli taught some lands are hard to conquer and easy to keep and some are easy to conquer and hard to keep. A land like France was easy to conquer because it was filled with nobles. You can turn nobles on each other because they always hate each other for some reason or another. But it's hard to keep a land of nobles because they all think they</p><p>5 0.70746154 <a title="1010-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-05-Strategy%3A_Planning_for_a_Power_Outage_Google_Style.html">789 high scalability-2010-03-05-Strategy: Planning for a Power Outage Google Style</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We can all learn from problems. The Google App Engine team has created a teachable moment through a remarkably honest and forthcoming  post-mortem for February 24th, 2010 outage  post, chronicling in elaborate detail a power outage that took down Google App Engine for a few hours.
 
The world is ending! The cloud is unreliable! Jump ship! Not. This is not evidence that the cloud is a beautiful, powerful and unsinkable ship that goes down on its maiden voyage. Stuff happens, no matter how well you prepare. If you think private datacenters don't go down, well, then I have some rearangeable deck chairs to sell you. The goal is to keep improving and minimizing those failure windows. From that perspective there is a lot to learn from the problems the Google App Engine team encountered and how they plan to fix them.
 
Please read the article for all the juicy details, but here's what struck me as key:

<p>Introduction: In  Stack Overflow Architecture Update - Now At 95 Million Page Views A Month , a commenter expressed surprise about Stack Overflow's backup strategy: 
  

Backup is to disk for fast retrieval and to tape for historical archiving.

  
The comment was:
  

Really? People still do this? I know some organizations invested a tremendous amount in automated, robotic tape backup, but seriously, a site founded in 2008 is backing up to tape?

   The Case of the Missing Gmail Accounts  
I admit that I was surprised at this strategy too. In this age of copying data to disk three times for safety, I also wondered if tape backups were still necessary? Then, like in a movie, an event happened that made sense of everything, Google suffered the quintessential  #firstworldproblem , gmail accounts went missing! Queue emphatic music. And what's more they were taking a long time to come back. There was a palpable fear in the land that email accounts might never be restored. Think about that.

<p>Introduction: John McCutchan ,   after a long career spent working on the Linux kernel and being hired out as a code optimization guru, joined Google's Dart team. A curious hire until you watch  Bringing SIMD to the Web via Dart , where John makes a programmer accessible explanation of why he likes Dart: performance, performance, performance.  
    Dart    is an open-source Web programming language    developed by Google   . The motivation for Dart is twofold: provide a language capable of scaling up to the complex web applications that are becoming the norm. Think Gmail. And provide a single language capable of working on both the client and server. Towards those ends Dart is a complete language, full tool environment, and provides an advanced Web UI framework for building web applications at a high level of abstraction. 
   Why isn't JavaScript good enough? The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause  web app</p><p>3 0.93673229 <a title="1010-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-20-Second_Life_Architecture_-_The_Grid.html">473 high scalability-2008-12-20-Second Life Architecture - The Grid</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Presentation: Second Life’s Architecture .  Ian Wilkes, VP of Systems Engineering, describes the architecture used by the popular game named Second Life. Ian presents how the architecture was at its debut and how it evolved over years as users and features have been added.    Second Life  is a 3-D virtual world created by its Residents. Virtual Worlds are expected to be more and more popular on the internet so their architecture might be of interest. Especially important is the appearance of open virtual worlds or metaverses.  What happens when video games meet Web 2.0? What happens is the  metaverse  .

 Key to making sensors ubiquitous is getting the BOM cost down. Here's a dream way of making that happen:  Bye-Bye Batteries: Radio Waves as a Low-Power Source . “Silicon technology has advanced to the point where even tiny amounts of energy can do useful work.” No batteries == cheaper, smaller products == ubiquity. 
  The MySQL “swap insanity” problem and the effects of the NUMA architecture . Jeremy Cole with a spectacular article on the differences between NUMA and SMP/UMA systems and the mostly unsatisfactory tricks required to get MySQL to perform on NUMA systems. There are really two issues: the evils of an OS controlled swap and NUMA performance effects due to a single node (in the NUMA sense) running out of memory. This is the kind of stuff you only see when you push your systems to the edge. Also,  Measuring NUMA effects with the STREAM benchmark ,  MongoDB</p><p>5 0.9294163 <a title="1010-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-31-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_31st%2C_2014.html">1588 high scalability-2014-01-31-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 31st, 2014</a></p>

 Upgrades are the great killer of software systems.

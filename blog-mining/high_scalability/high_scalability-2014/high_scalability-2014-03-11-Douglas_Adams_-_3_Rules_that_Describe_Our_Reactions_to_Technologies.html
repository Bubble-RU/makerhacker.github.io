below. If you agree with a statement then you "take it"; if you disagree then
you "leave it." And if you are so moved please write a convincing comment as
to why. Got it?Snowden vs. the State.Snowden represents true the spirit of
freedom and is not a threat to all we hold dear.Walled Garden vs. Federated
Freedom.The Walled Garden has won the last decade. The cycle of life will
return the balance and federated services will once again win the day.Mobile +
messaging vs. Le Web.Mobile + messaging is eating search and the web, changing
the way things are found, discovered, and bought.Fiat vs.

<p>Introduction: Inspired by axkcd comic,Peter Norvig,Director of Research at Google and all
around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving
a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful
systems profiled on HighScalability.The original code is atxkcd 1313: Regex
Golf, which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the
winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is
readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but
soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find
regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's
deliberate strategy for finding a regex.The post demonstrating the iterated
improvement of the program is atxkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite
Problems). As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the
program Peter recommends the following steps: Profiling: Figure out where the
program spends its time.

if you are interested in flexing your holiday thought muscles we might have a
good discussion too.Eight years is a difficult prediction horizon. It's too
short to simply project out current trends and it's too long to discount
potential technological breakthroughs coming to market. There's the

<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder Steve
Wozniakand Atari founderNolan Bushnell, had a chance to sit down for a chat at
the C2SVconference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can
decide futures.  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability  Steve talked about
how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years
of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was
expandable. It hadeight expansion slotsand the RAM was also expandable
(starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility
orexpansion capabilities. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the
Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak
won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They
published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer
community. So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh all failed,

<p>Introduction: Chris Dixonunearthed agreat quotefrom Douglas Adams on the nature of
technological adoption that unsurprisingly hits the mark in our ever changing
and evolving world:Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal
and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.Anything
that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and
exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.Anything
invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of thingsSome
that come to mind: horse to car, index card to online search, PC to mobile,
web to app, portal to messaging, Newton to Einstein, oil to electric, rock to
rap, Aquinas to Bacon, buying to renting, files to streaming, network TV to
cordkilling, broadcast to social, programming CPUs to programming biology,
server to cloud, vm to container, wired to wireless, long read to TLDR,
privacy to public to ephemeral, paper based news aggregation to digital
aggregation, checks to onlin</p><p>3 0.70551807 <a title="1610-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_30%2C_2012.html">1219 high scalability-2012-03-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 30, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.We tend to think compute
of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of
innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will
reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the
datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of
datacenters in the future.Given the diversity of compute resources it's
reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API.
They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those
specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough
to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever
they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the
fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever
resources it doesn't have</p><p>6 0.61749905 <a title="1610-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_4th%2C_2013.html">1527 high scalability-2013-10-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 4th, 2013</a></p>

careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they
manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new,
using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached,
RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.What is Poppen.de?Poppen.de (NSFW) is
the top dating website in Germany, and while it may be a small site compared
to giants like Flickr or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to

<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>5 0.11980116 <a title="1640-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-21-9_Principles_of_High_Performance_Programs.html">1652 high scalability-2014-05-21-9 Principles of High Performance Programs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Arvid Norbergon thelibtorrent bloghas put together an excellent list
ofprinciples of high performance programs, obviously derived from hard won
experience programming on bittorrent:Two fundamental causes of performance
problems:Memory Latency. A big performance problem on modern computers is the
latency of SDRAM. The CPU waits idle for a read from memory to come
back.Context Switching. When a CPU switches context "the memory it will access
is most likely unrelated to the memory the previous context was accessing.
This often results in significant eviction of the previous cache, and requires
the switched-to context to load much of its data from RAM, which is
slow."Rules to help balance the forces of evil:Batch work. Avoid context
switching by batching work. For example, there are vector versions of system
calls like writev() and readv() that operate on more than one item per call.
An implication is that you want to merge as many writes as possible.Avoid
Magic Numbers. They don't scale.</p><p>6 0.11419043 <a title="1640-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_22%2C_2013.html">1428 high scalability-2013-03-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 22, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The paper MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O
(video,slides) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a
better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started
with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support
for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling
to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they
created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented
workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."The result:
MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29% (for long connections) and
582% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed
version of memcached between 15% and 320%. For a workload based on real-world
HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of nginx by 75%.What's this most
excellent and interesting paper about?Message-oriented network workloads,

<p>Introduction: breakThis JoelOnSoftwarethreadasks the age old question of what and how to
log. The usual trace/error/warning/info advice is totally useless in a large
scale distributed system. Instead, you need tolog everything all the timeso
you can solve problems that have already happened across a potentially huge
range of servers. Yes, it can be done.To see why the typical logging approach
is broken, imagine this scenario: Your site has been up and running great for
weeks. No problems. A foreshadowing beeper goes off at 2AM. It seems some
users can no longer add comments to threads. Then you hear the debugging
deathknell: it's an intermittent problem and customers are pissed. Fix it.
Now.So how are you going to debug this? The monitoring system doesn't show any
obvious problems or errors. You quickly post a comment and it works fine. This
won't be easy. So you think. Commenting involves a bunch of servers and
networks. There's the load balancer, spam filter, web server, database server,

<p>Introduction: InLog Everything All the TimeI advocate applications shouldn't bother logging
at all. Why waste all that time and code? No, wait, that's not right. I preach
logging everything all the time. Doh. Facebook obviously feels similarly which
is why they opened sourcedScribe, their internal logging system, capable of
logging 10s of billions of messages per day. These messages include access
logs, performance statistics, actions that went to News Feed, and many
others.Imagine hundreds of thousands of machines across many geographical
dispersed datacenters just aching to send their precious log payload to the
central repository off all knowledge. Because really, when you combine all the
meta data with all the events you pretty much have a complete picture of your
operations. Once in the central repository logs can be scanned, indexed,
summarized, aggregated, refactored, diced, data cubed, and mined for every
scrap of potentially useful information.Just imagine the log stream from all
of Faceboo</p><p>5 0.61274225 <a title="1640-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-04-Paper%3A_An_Analysis_of_Linux_Scalability_to_Many_Cores__.html">914 high scalability-2010-10-04-Paper: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores, by a number of MIT
researchers, is a refreshingly practical paper on what it takes to scale Linux
and common applications like Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake,
Psearchy, and MapReduce to run on 48 core systems. A very timely paper given
moderately massive multicore systems are reportedly the near future of
computing.This paper must have taken a lot of work. They both tracked down
bottlenecks in a number of applications and the Linux kernel and they also
tried to fix them. Modestly speaking the authors said they made "modest"
changes to the kernel and applications, but there's nothing modest about what
they did. It's excellent work.After the next bit, which is the abstract, there
is a list of the problems they found and how they fixed them.The abstract:This
paper analyzes the scalability of seven system applications (Exim, memcached,
Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce) running on Linux on a

<p>Introduction: Adrian Singer has boiled down 7 years of experience to a set of 10 very useful
tips on how to bestoptimize NGINX and PHP-fpm for high traffic sites:Switch
from TCP to UNIX domain sockets. When communicating to processes on the same
machine UNIX sockets have better performance the TCP because there's less
copying and fewer context switches.Adjust Worker Processes. Set the
worker_processes in your nginx.conf file to the number of cores your machine
has and  increase the number of worker_connections.Setup upstream load
balancing. Multiple upstream backends on the same machine produce higher
throughout than a single one.Disable access log files. Log files on high
traffic sites involve a lot of I/O that has to be synchronized across all
threads. Can have a big impact.Enable GZip. Cache information about frequently
accessed files. Adjust client timeouts.Adjust output buffers./etc/sysctl.conf
tuning.Monitor. Continually monitor the number of open connections, free
memory and number of waiting</p><p>2 0.87733167 <a title="1640-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons_Learned_at_208K%3A_Towards_Debugging_Millions_of_Cores.html">484 high scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons Learned at 208K: Towards Debugging Millions of Cores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we debug and profile a cloud full of processors and threads? It's a
problem more will be seeing as we code big scary programs that run on even
bigger scarier clouds. Logging gets you far, but sometimes finding the root
cause of problem requires delving deep into a program's execution. I don't
know about you, but setting up 200,000+ gdb instances doesn't sound all that
appealing. Tools like STAT (Stack Trace Analysis Tool) are being developed to
help with this huge task. STAT "gathers and merges stack traces from a
parallel application's processes." So STAT isn't a low level debugger, but it
will help you find the needle in a million haystacks.Abstract:Petascale
systems will present several new challenges to performance and correctness
tools. Such machines may contain millions of cores, requiring that tools use
scalable data structures and analysis algorithms to collect and to process
application data. In addition, at such scales, each tool itself will become a
large parallel app</p><p>3 0.87427044 <a title="1640-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-Event%3A_CloudCamp_Silicon_Valley_Unconference_on_30th_September.html">388 high scalability-2008-09-23-Event: CloudCamp Silicon Valley Unconference on 30th September</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with
our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting
monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously
how Netflix used Chaos Monkey, a tool to test failover handling by
continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been
added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a
problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is
handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this
approach in this very interesting post: The Netflix Simian Army.I know what
you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down
lately. Dmuino addressedthis potential embarrassment, putting all fears of
cloud inferiority to rest:Unfortunately we're not running 100% on the cloud
today. We're working on it, and we could use more help. The latest outage was
caused by a component that sti</p><p>5 0.85537088 <a title="1640-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-03-Why_most_large-scale_Web_sites_are_not_written_in_Java.html">110 high scalability-2007-10-03-Why most large-scale Web sites are not written in Java</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If Google was a boxer then MapReduce would be a probing right hand that sets up the massive left hook that is  Dremel , Google's—scalable (thousands of CPUs, petabytes of data, trillions of rows), SQL based, columnar, interactive (results returned in seconds), ad-hoc—analytics system. If Google was a magician then MapReduce would be the shiny thing that distracts the mind while the trick goes unnoticed. I say that because even though Dremel has been around internally at Google since 2006, we have not heard a whisper about it. All we've heard about is MapReduce, clones of which have inspired entire new industries.  Tricky .
 
Dremel, according to Brian Bershad, Director of Engineering at Google, is targeted at solving  BigData class problems :
  

While we all know that systems are huge and will get even huger, the implications of this size on programmability, manageability, power, etc. is hard to comprehend.

   Controlled Experiments at Large Scale : Bing found that every 100ms faster they deliver search result pages yields 0.6% more in revenue  
  Luis Bettencourt : A city is first and foremost a social reactor. It works like a star, attracting people and accelerating social interaction and social outputs in a way that is analogous to how stars compress matter and burn brighter and faster the bigger they are. 
  @nntaleb : unless you understand that fat tails come from concentration of errors, you should not discuss probability & risk

  @jimplush : Google spent 2.3 billion on infrastructure in Q1. Remember that when you say you want to be "the Google of something" 
 Clay Shirky: I think one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive, I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of apps, separate from c</p><p>5 0.86487174 <a title="1607-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_4%2C_2012.html">1239 high scalability-2012-05-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 4, 2012</a></p>

 Quotable quotes:                      
 
 Richard Feynman: Suppose that little things behave very differently than anything big 
  @orgnet : "Data, data everywhere, but not a thought to think" -- John Allen Paulos, Mathematician 
  @ bcarlso  : just throw out the word " scalability  ". That'll bring em out  
  @ codypo  :  Here are the steps to the Scalability Shuffle. 1: log everything. 2: analyze logs. 3: profile. 4: refactor. 5: repeat.  
  @ FoggSeastack  :  If math had been taught in a relevant way I might have been a   # BigData    person today.  
  @secboffin : I know a programming joke about 10,000 mutexes, but it's a bit contentious.

<p>Introduction: Shanti Braford  details how his Ruby on Rails  based website survived a 24 hour 550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup details, so there's not much I can add.   Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR, nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of the performance boost.    Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>3 0.90126514 <a title="1607-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_18%2C_2011.html">992 high scalability-2011-02-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 18, 2011</a></p>

  $1.5 billion : The cost of cutting London-Toyko latency by 60ms;  9 days : It took AOL 9 years to hit 1 million users. Facebook 9 months. Draw Something 9 days;   ~362 sq ft solar array : powers 1 sq ft of data center.

 As the DevOps turns. You won't see this on TMZ.  Adrian Cockcroft :  There is no central control, the teams do it for themselves in the cloud;  John Allspaw : s/NoOps/OpsDoneMaturelyButStillOps/g;  Edward Capriolo : Trust developers not. Good thing is we all agree DevOps is necessary, the differences are in the how and whom. 
 In a word (or two), Wordnik has  gone cloud . Gone is their big iron, in are envious EC2 instances. Driving the move was HA in multi-datacenters, elasticity for traffic bursts, and incremental cluster upgrades. There has been almost no reduction in performance.

</p><p>4 com that they used to sustain 10s of thousand of concurrent users at 3K req/sec. [sent-28, score-0.077]

</p><p>6 Comparision of different concurrency models: Actors, CSP, Disruptor and Threads. [sent-85, score-0.078]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byDave HaglerSystems Architect at AOL.The AOL homepages
receive more than8 million visitors per day.  That's more daily viewers than
Good Morning America or the Today Show on television.  Over a billion page
views are served each month.  AOL.com has been a major internet destination
since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.The architecture
for AOL.com is in it's 5th generation.  It has essentially been rebuilt from
scratch 5 times over two decades.  The current architecture was designed 6
years ago.  Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along
the way, but the overall design remains largely intact.  The code, tools,
development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of
continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very
stable.The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations
andtotals around 25 people.  The majority are in Dulles, Virginia with a
smaller team i</p><p>5 0.14323629 <a title="1634-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: Debugging complex problems is 90% persistence and 50% cool tools. Brendan
Gregg in10 Performance Wins tells a fascinating story of how a team at Joyent
solved some weird and challenging performance issues deep in the OS. It took
lots of effort,DTrace, Flame Graphs,USE Method, and writing custom tools when
necessary. Here's a quick summary of the solved cases:Monitoring. 1000x
improvement. An application blocked while paging anonymous memory back in. It
was also blocked during file system fsync() calls. The application was
misconfigured and sometimes briefly exceeded available memory, getting page
out.Riak. 2x improvement. The Erlang VM used half the CPU count it was
supposed to, so CPUs remained unused.  Fix was a configuration change.MySQL.
380x improvement. Reads were slow. Cause was correlated writes. Fix was to
tune the cache flush interval on the storage controller.Various. 2800x
improvement. Large systems calls to getvmusage() could take a few seconds.

<p>Introduction: This question comes from Ulysses on aninteresting threadfrom the Mechanical
Sympathy news group, especially given how multiple processors are now the
norm:Ulysses:On an 8xCPU Linux instance,  is it at all advantageous to use the
Linux taskset command to pin an 8xJVM process set (co-ordinated as a
www.infinispan.org distributed cache/data grid) to a specific CPU affinity set
(i.e. pin JVM0 process to CPU 0, JVM1 process to CPU1, ...., JVM7process to
CPU 7) vs. just letting the Linux OS use its default mechanism for
provisioning the 8xJVM process set to the available CPUs?In effrort to seek an
optimal point (in the full event space), what are the conceptual trade-offs in
considering "searching" each permutation of provisioning an 8xJVM process set
to an 8xCPU set via taskset?Giventaskset is they key to the question, it would
help to have a definition:Used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity of a
running process given its PID or to launch a new COMMAND with a given CPU
affinity.  CPU affi</p><p>3 0.95398903 <a title="1634-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-15-4_Reasons_Facebook_Dumped_HTML5_and_Went_Native.html">1323 high scalability-2012-09-15-4 Reasons Facebook Dumped HTML5 and Went Native</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook made quite a splash when they released theirnative iOS app, not
because of their app per se, but because of their conclusion that theirbiggest
mistake was betting on HTML5, so they had to go native.As you might imagine
this was a bit like telling a Great White Shark that its bark is worse than
its bite.  Acommon refrainwas Facebook simply had made a bad HTML5 site, not
that HTML5 itself is bad, as plenty of other vendors have made slick well
performing mobile sites.An interesting and relevant conversation given the
rising butt kickery of mobile. But we were lacking details. Now we aren't. If
you were wondering just why Facebook ditched HTML5, Tobie Langel inPerf
Feedback - What's slowing down Mobile Facebook, lists out the reasons:Tooling
/ Developer APIs. Most importantly, the lack of tooling to track down memory
problems. Scrolling performance.Scrolling must be fast and smooth and full

<p>Introduction: Stardog makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can
be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a recent article
StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable,
improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now
handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It
can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. What did they do
that you can also do?Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data
structures. For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue.Use
ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid
synchronization.Batch LRU evictions in a single thread. Triggered by several
LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by
additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times.Move to
SHA1 for hashing URIs, bnodes, and literal values. Making hash collisions
nearly impossible enable significant s</p><p>5 0.93497497 <a title="1634-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-29-Strategy%3A_Exploit_Processor_Affinity_for_High_and_Predictable_Performance.html">1218 high scalability-2012-03-29-Strategy: Exploit Processor Affinity for High and Predictable Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Martin Thompson wrote a really interestingarticleon the beneficial performance
impact of taking advantage of Processor Affinity:The interesting thing I've
observed is that the unpinned test will follow a step function of
unpredictable performance.  Across many runs I've seen different patterns but
all similar in this step function nature.  For the pinned tests I get
consistent throughput with no step pattern and always the greatest
throughput.The idea is by assigning a thread to a particular CPU that when a
thread is rescheduled to run on the same CPU, it can take advantage of the
"accumulated  state in the processor, including instructions and data in the
cache."  With multi-core chips the norm now, you may want to decide for
yourself how to assign work to cores and not let the OS do it for you. The
results are surprisingly strong.</p><p>6 0.92375016 <a title="1634-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-30-Paper%3A_GraphLab%3A_A_New_Framework_For_Parallel_Machine_Learning.html">850 high scalability-2010-06-30-Paper: GraphLab: A New Framework For Parallel Machine Learning</a></p>

</p><p>5 I think of type systems as a kind of the physics of a programming environment, encoding the physical laws of computation. [sent-31, score-0.21]
</p><p>6 But I wonder of some of these laws don't apply to web projects where faster iteration, frequent deployment, and frequent addition of new design and features is the rule? [sent-36, score-0.21]
</p><p>7 These energy savings are mainly driven by increased data center efficiency when using cloud services (email, calendars, and more). [sent-42, score-0.175]

</p><p>12 They were able to optimize it from tens of layouts to thousands of layout per second, which enabled their strategy of trying a bunch of different layouts and picking the best one. [sent-127, score-0.193]
</p><p>13 Replication in networked games: Latency (Part 2) :  In this article we surveyed three different techniques for dealing with latency in networked games, though our review was by no means exhaustive. [sent-131, score-0.181]
</p><p>14 : This article looks at methods of quantifying consistency (or lack thereof) in eventually consistent storage systems. [sent-135, score-0.135]
</p><p>15 These methods are necessary for meaningful comparisons among different system configurations and workloads. [sent-136, score-0.121]
</p><p>16 Building fast Bayesian computing machines out of intentionally stochastic, digital parts : The brain interprets ambiguous sensory information faster and more reliably than modern computers, using neurons that are slower and less reliable than logic gates. [sent-146, score-0.137]
</p><p>17 But Bayesian inference, which underpins many computational models of perception and cognition, appears computationally challenging even given modern transistor speeds and energy budgets. [sent-147, score-0.219]
</p><p>18 Here we show how to build fast Bayesian computing machines using intentionally stochastic, digital parts, narrowing this efficiency gap by multiple orders of magnitude. [sent-149, score-0.281]
</p><p>19 We find that by connecting stochastic digital components according to simple mathematical rules, one can build massively parallel, low precision circuits that solve Bayesian inference problems and are compatible with the Poisson firing statistics of cortical neurons. [sent-150, score-0.337]
</p><p>20 We evaluate circuits for depth and motion perception, perceptual learning and causal reasoning, each performing inference over 10,000+ latent variables in real time — a 1,000x speed advantage over commodity microprocessors. [sent-151, score-0.282]

<p>Introduction: A conjunction of a few new technologies may trigger disruptive changes in the future. This observation was prompted by a talk  Steve Perlman  gave at the Columbia Engineering School:  Benjamin Button, Cloud Everything and Why Shannon's Law Isn't . In it he covers a set of technologies that at first may seem unrelated, but turn out to be deeply related after all, culminating in a realization of the long talked about vision of an application utility, where all applications are hosted and run out of the cloud. 
 
First Perlman talks about the realistic human rendering technology developed at Rearden, his research incubator company. This technology was developed over many years and is the secret behind the wonderful effects found in movies like  Benjamin Button . It is now being used in many other films, and promises to revolutionize film making, possibly even replacing actors with computers, in real-time.

<p>Introduction: Plop, Plop, Fizz, Fizz, Oh, What a HighScalability it is:
  
  $1.5 billion : The cost of cutting London-Toyko latency by 60ms;  9 days : It took AOL 9 years to hit 1 million users. Facebook 9 months. Draw Something 9 days;   ~362 sq ft solar array : powers 1 sq ft of data center. 
 Is Amazon is trying to margenalize OpenStack by  partnering with Eucalyptus ? 
 As the DevOps turns. You won't see this on TMZ.  Adrian Cockcroft :  There is no central control, the teams do it for themselves in the cloud;  John Allspaw : s/NoOps/OpsDoneMaturelyButStillOps/g;  Edward Capriolo : Trust developers not. Good thing is we all agree DevOps is necessary, the differences are in the how and whom. 
 In a word (or two), Wordnik has  gone cloud . Gone is their big iron, in are envious EC2 instances. Driving the move was HA in multi-datacenters, elasticity for traffic bursts, and incremental cluster upgrades. There has been almost no reduction in performance.

  David Krakauer : We fail to make intelligent machines because engineering is about putting together stupid components to make smart objects. Evolution is about putting together smart components into intelligent aggregates. Your brain is like an ecosystem of organisms. It's not like a circuit of gates. 
  @spyced : At this point if you depend on EBS for critical services you're living in denial and I can't help you.  
  @skilpat : TIL Friedrich Engels, not Leslie Lamport, invented logical clocks in a 1844 letter to Karl Marx

    Twitter valiantly  survived  an Oscar  DDoS  attack by non-state actors.   
  Several Billion : Apple iMessages per Day along with 40 billion notifications and 15 to 20 million FaceTime calls. Take that WhatsApp. Their architecture? Hey, this is Apple, only the Shadow knows.

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.   
 
As I was writing  an article  on the architecture of the  Storm Botnet , I couldn't help but notice the deep similarity of how Storm works and changes we're seeing in the evolution of political systems. In particular, the rise of the  virtual-state . As crazy as this may sound, I think this is also the direction applications will need follow to survive in a complex world of billions of compute devices.
 
You may have already heard of  virtual corporations .  Virtual corporations are companies with limited office space, a distributed workforce, and production facilities located wherever it is profitable to locate them. The idea is to stay lean and compete using the  rapid development and introduction of new products into high value-added markets .

<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously how Netflix used  Chaos Monkey , a tool to test failover handling by continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this approach in this very interesting post:  The Netflix Simian Army .
 
I know what you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down lately.  Dmuino addressed  this potential embarrassment, putting all fears of cloud inferiority to rest:

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the  Stack Overflow Architecture . Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up and out in the last few years.
 
Stack Overflow has grown up by more then doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  
 
Stack Overflow has grown out by expanding into the  Stack Exchange Network , which includes Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.
 
What hasn't changed is Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been handling their growth:  Stack Exchange’s Architecture in Bullet Points ,  Stack Overflow’s New York Data Center ,  Designing For Scalability of Manageme</p><p>6 0.91957557 <a title="1600-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_18%2C_2013.html">1389 high scalability-2013-01-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 18, 2013</a></p>

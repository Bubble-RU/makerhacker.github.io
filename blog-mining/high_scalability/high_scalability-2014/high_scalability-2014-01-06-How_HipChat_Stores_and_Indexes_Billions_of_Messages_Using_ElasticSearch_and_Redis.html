<p>Introduction: Adrian Cockcroft on the future ofCloud, Open Source, SaaS and the End of
Enterprise Computing:Most big enterprise companies are actively working on
their AWS rollout now. Most of them are also trying to get an in-house cloud
to work, with varying amounts of success, but even the best private clouds are
still years behind the feature set of public clouds, which is has a big impact
on the agility and speed of product developmentWhile theSnowden
revelationshave tattered the thin veil of trust secreting Big Brother from We
the People, they may also be driving a fascinating new tension in architecture
choices between Cloud Native (scale-out, IaaS), Amazon Native (rich service
dependencies), and Enterprise Native (raw hardware, scale-up).This tension
became evident in a recentHipChat interviewwhere HipChat, makers of an AWS
based SaaS chat product, were busy creating an on-premises version of their
product that could operate behind the firewall in enterprise datacenters. This
is consistent w</p><p>3 0.17208488 <a title="1573-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me_Architecture_-_Synchronicity_Kills.html">431 high scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me Architecture - Synchronicity Kills</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What's cool about starting a new project is you finally have a chance to do it
right. You of course eventually mess everything up in your own way, but for
that one moment the world has a perfect order, a rightness that feels
satisfying and good. Arne Claassen, the CTO of notify.me, a brand new real
time notification delivery service, is in this honeymoon period now.Arne has
been gracious enough to share with us his philosophy of how to build a
notification service. I think you'll find it fascinating because Arne goes
into a lot of useful detail about how his system works.His main design
philosophy is to minimize the bottlenecks that form around synchronous access,
that is whensome resource is requested and the requestor ties up more
resources, waiting for a response. If the requested resource can't be
delivered in a timely manner, more and more requests pile up until the server
can't accept any new ones. Nobody gets what they want and you have an outage.
Breaking synchronous operations</p><p>4 0.17089576 <a title="1573-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-14-New_Facebook_Chat_Feature_Scales_to_70_Million_Users_Using_Erlang.html">318 high scalability-2008-05-14-New Facebook Chat Feature Scales to 70 Million Users Using Erlang</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Erlang at Facebook by Eugene Letuchy. How Facebook uses Erlang to
implement Chat, AIM Presence, and Chat Jabber support. I've done
someXMPPdevelopment so when I readFacebook was making a Jabber chat clientI
was really curious how they would make it work. While core XMPP is
straightforward, a number of protocol extensions like discovery, forms, chat
states, pubsub, multi user chat, and privacy lists really up the
implementation complexity. Some real engineering challenges were involved to
make this puppy scale and perform. It's not clear what extensions they've
implemented, but a blog entry by Facebook's Eugene Letuchy hits some of the
architectural challenges they faced and how they overcame them.A web based
Jabber client poses a few problems because XMPP, like most IM protocols, is an
asynchronous event driven system that pretty much assumes you have a full time
open connection. After logging in the server sends a client roster information
and presence information. Your client</p><p>5 0.16189858 <a title="1573-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling_Pinterest_-_From_0_to_10s_of_Billions_of_Page_Views_a_Month_in_Two_Years.html">1440 high scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling Pinterest - From 0 to 10s of Billions of Page Views a Month in Two Years</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>6 0.15318757 <a title="1573-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Michael Laing, a Systems Architect at NYTimes, gave thisgreat decriptionof
their use ofRabbitMQ and their overall architecture on the RabbitMQ mailing
list. The closing sentiment marks this as definitely an architecture to learn
from:Although it may seem complex,Fabrik has simple components and is mostly
principles and plumbing. The key point to grasp is that there is no head, no
master, no single point of failure. As I write this I can see components
failing (not RabbitMQ), and we are fixing them so they are more reliable. But
the system doesn't fail, users can connect, and messages are delivered,
regardless - all within design parameters.Since it's short, to the point, and
I couldn't say it better, I'll just reproduce several original sources
here:Just a quick note and thank you to the RabbitMQ team for a great
product.Our premier online offering www.nytimes.com has a new look and new
underpinnings, now including a messaging architecture implemented using

billion. We learned about their early architecture, which centered around a
maniacal focus on optimizing Erlang into handling 2 million connections a
server, working on All The Phones, and making users happy through
simplicity.Two years later traffic has grown 10x. How did WhatsApp make that
jump to the next level of scalability?Rick Reedtells us in a talk he gave at

<p>Introduction: In Don't panic! Here's how to quickly scale your mobile apps Mike
Maelzerpaints a wonderful picture of howAvocado, a mobile app for connecting
couples, evolved to handle 30x traffic within a few weeks. If you are just
getting started then this is a great example to learn from.What I liked: it's
well written, packing a lot of useful information in a little space; it's
failure driven, showing the process of incremental change driven by purposeful
testing and production experience; it shows awareness of what's important, in
their case, user signup; a replica setup was used for testing, a nice cloud
benefit. Their Biggest lesson learned is a good one:It would have been great
to start the scaling process much earlier. Due to time pressure we had to make
compromises -like dropping four of our media resizer boxes. While throwing
more hardware at some scaling problems does work, it's less than ideal.Here's

<p>Introduction: I've largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the "NoSQL vs.
Relational" conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about
currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to
build in, I'd like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint.
In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I've inadvertently given myself
plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches,
and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say
with a fair amount of certainty, that I've found a good compromise. You can

<p>Introduction: This article is from an interview withZuhaib Siddique, a production engineer
atHipChat, makers ofgroup chat and IM for teams.HipChat started in an unusual
space, one you might not think would have much promise, enterprise group
messaging, but as we are learning there is gold in them thereenterprise hills.
Which is why Atlassian, makers of well thought of tools like JIRA and
Confluence,acquired HipChat in 2012.And in a tale not often heard, the
resources and connections of a larger parent have actually helped HipChat
enter anexponential growth cycle. Having reached the 1.2 billion message
storage mark they are now doubling the number of messages sent, stored, and
indexed every few months.That kind of growth puts a lot of pressure on a once
adequate infrastructure. HipChat exhibited a common scaling pattern. Start
simple, experience traffic spikes, and then think what do we do now? Using
bigger computers is usually the first and best answer. And they did that. That

<p>Introduction: Scoblethe Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video
channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that
have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things
you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off
the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.For a strategy hit
he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about
when makingFeedBlendr:One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services
you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up
and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up
and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He
told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in
designing their architecture.</p><p>4 0.94025499 <a title="1573-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_16%2C_2011.html">1117 high scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 16, 2011</a></p>

promising systems-programming language in the vein of C++. We fully hope and
expect that Go becomes the standard back-end language at Google over the next
few years.On GAE Go can load from a cold start in 100ms and the typical
instance size is 4MB. Is it any wonder Go is a go? Should we expect to see
Java and Python deprecated because Go is so much cheaper to run at

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>6 0.93868279 <a title="1573-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-01-Khan_Academy_Checkbook_Scaling_to_6_Million_Users_a_Month_on_GAE.html">1432 high scalability-2013-04-01-Khan Academy Checkbook Scaling to 6 Million Users a Month on GAE</a></p>

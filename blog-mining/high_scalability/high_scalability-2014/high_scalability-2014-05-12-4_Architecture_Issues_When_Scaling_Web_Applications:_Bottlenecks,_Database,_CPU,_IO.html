</p><p>3 Response Time    Is the time taken by web application to process request and return response. [sent-7, score-0.491]
</p><p>4 If application is taking beyond the acceptable time, it is said to be non-performing or degraded. [sent-9, score-0.499]
</p><p>5 Scalability    The web application is said to be scalable if by adding more hardware, application can linearly take more requests than before. [sent-10, score-1.022]
</p><p>6 Two ways of adding more hardware are      Scaling Up (vertical scaling)  :– increasing the number CPUs or adding faster CPUs on a single box. [sent-11, score-0.52]
</p><p>7 But increasing the number of requests that an application can handle on a single commodity hardware box is also important. [sent-14, score-0.935]
</p><p>8 An application is said to be performing well if it can handle more requests with-out degrading response time by just adding more resources. [sent-15, score-1.078]
</p><p>9 application might have acceptable response times but can not handle more than certain number of requests or application is handle increasing number of requests but has poor or long response times. [sent-18, score-1.799]
</p><p>10 Adding multiple Load balancers is rare as a single box running nginx or HAProxy can handle more than 20K concurrent connections per box compared to web application boxes which can handle few thousand concurrent requests. [sent-27, score-0.997]
</p><p>11 So a single load balancer box can handle several web application boxes. [sent-28, score-0.673]
</p><p>12 Master-Slave provides limited scaling of reads beyond which developers has to split the database into multiple databases. [sent-32, score-0.557]
</p><p>13 Another way to split database is by moving few columns of an entity to one database and few other columns to another database. [sent-38, score-0.642]
</p><p>14 Transiting from single database to multiple database using partitioning or sharding is a challenging task. [sent-42, score-0.565]
</p><p>15 Architecture Bottlenecks   Scaling bottlenecks are formed due to two issues        Centralised component  A component in application architecture which can not be scaled out adds an upper limit on number of requests that entire architecture or request pipeline can handle.

</p><p>16 High latency component  A slow component in request pipeline puts lower limit on the response time of the application. [sent-44, score-0.648]

</p><p>18 By increasing CPU speed application response time can be reduced. [sent-47, score-0.671]
</p><p>19 IO Bound Application   An application is said to be IO bound if application throughput is limited by its IO or network operations and increasing CPU speed does not bring down application response times. [sent-55, score-1.582]
</p><p>20 Most applications are IO bound due to the CRUD operation in most applications Performance tuning or scaling IO bound applications is a difficult job due to its dependency on other systems downstream. [sent-56, score-1.137]

<p>Introduction: We've referenced this  189 slide masterpiece  by Ask Bjorn Hansen before, but it was hidden without its own first class link. He describes his presentation as 3 hours of 5 minute lightening talks and that sounds about right.   The presentation covers:  overall platform and architecture considerations involved in tuning applications from a holistic perspective. Youâ&euro;&trade;ll be shown design scalable architectures for dynamic, high-volume web sites. Topics covered include caching, scalable database design, replication architecture, load-balancing, and architectural decisions derived from many years of experience.    His prime directive of scaling:  Think Horizontally  at every point in your architecture, not just at the web tier.   You may not agree with everything, but there's a lot of useful advice. Here's a summary of some of what is covered:

<p>Introduction: In the era of Web 2.0 traditional approaches to capacity planning are often difficult to implement. Guerrilla Capacity Planning facilitates rapid forecasting of capacity requirements based on the opportunistic use of whatever performance data and tools are available.  One unique Guerrilla tool is Virtual Load Testing, based on Dr. Gunther's "Universal Law of Computational Scaling", which provides a highly cost-effective method for assessing application scalability. Neil Gunther, M.Sc., Ph.D. is an internationally recognized computer system performance consultant who founded Performance Dynamics Company in 1994.  Some reasons why you should understand this law:   1. A lot of people use the term "scalability" without clearly defining it, let alone defining it quantitatively. Computer system scalability must be quantified. If you can't quantify it, you can't guarantee it. The universal law of computational scaling provides that quantification.   2.

<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture principles then take a look at Will Larson's  Introduction to Architecting Systems for Scale . Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:
  
    Load Balancing: Scalability & Redundancy . Horizontal scalability and redundancy are usually achieved via load balancing, the spreading of requests across multiple resources.    
 
    Smart Clients . The   client has a list of hosts and load balances across that list of hosts. Upside is simple for programmers. Downside is it's hard to update and change. 
    Hardware Load Balancers . Targeted at larger companies, this is dedicated load balancing hardware. Upside is performance. Downside is cost and complexity. 
    Software Load Balancers . The recommended approach, it's  software that handles load balancing, health checks, etc.

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see how!     Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed in a format called   Alexandrian form which draws on constructs used by Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:     The pattern name   The problem the pattern is trying to solve     Context   Solution   Examples   Design rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why experts use it       Patterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context, and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next ‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest repost by  Venkatesh CM  at  Architecture Issues Scaling Web Applications . 
 
I will cover architecture issues that show up while scaling and performance tuning large scale web application in this blog.
 
Lets start by defining few terms to create common understanding and vocabulary. Later on I will go through different issues that pop-up while scaling web application like
  
 Architecture bottlenecks 
 Scaling Database 
 CPU Bound Application 
 IO Bound Application 
  
 Determining optimal thread pool size of an web application  will be covered in next blog.
  Performance  
Term performance of web application is used to mean several things. Most developers are primarily concerned with are response time and scalability.
  
 

  Response Time 


Is the time taken by web application to process request and return response. Applications should respond to requests (response time) within acceptable duration. If application is taking beyond the acceptable time, it is said to</p><p>4 0.96313703 <a title="1646-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-13-Must_see%3A_5_Steps_to_Scaling_MongoDB_%28Or_Any_DB%29_in_8_Minutes.html">1114 high scalability-2011-09-13-Must see: 5 Steps to Scaling MongoDB (Or Any DB) in 8 Minutes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jared Rosoff  concisely, effectively, entertainingly, and convincingly gives an  8 minute MongoDB tutorial  on scaling MongoDB at  Scale Out Camp . The ideas aren't just limited to MongoDB, they work for most any database: Optimize your queries; Know your working set size; Tune your file system; Choose the right disks; Shard. Here's an explanation of all 5 strategies:
  
  Optimize your queries . Computer science works. Complexity analysis works. A btree search is faster than a table scan. So analyze your queries. Use explain to see what your query is doing. If it is saying it's using a cursor then it's doing a table scan. That's slow. Look at the number of documents it looks at to satisfy a query. Look at how long it takes. Fix: add indexes. It doesn't matter if you are running on 1 or 100 servers. 
  Know your working set size . Sticking memcache in front of your database is silly. You have lots of RAM, use it. Embed your cache in the database, which is how MongoDB works. Working set</p><p>5 0.95515519 <a title="1646-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-15-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Justin.Tv%27s_Live_Video_Broadcasting_Architecture.html">1359 high scalability-2012-11-15-Gone Fishin': Justin.Tv's Live Video Broadcasting Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is one of my favorite posts for a couple of reasons. I think it gives a lot of useful information in an interesting space. And Kyle Vogt was just a real pleasure to talk to. He was very helpful and forthcoming, which makes the whole experience better for everyone. 
 
 
 
The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality augmentation, live crab (fresh and local), and live event publishing. One of the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a  broadcaster  and a consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a time shift war. The resources and the engineering needed to make this happened must be substantial.

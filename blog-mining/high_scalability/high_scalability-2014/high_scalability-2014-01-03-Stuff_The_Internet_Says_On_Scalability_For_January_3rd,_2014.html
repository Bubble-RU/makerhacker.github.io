<p>Introduction: Oh, you don't have a Quantum Computer Lab staffed with researchers? Well,
Google does. Here they areon G+. To learn what they are up to the Verge hasA
first look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab. The lab is partnership
between NASA, Google, and a 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum computer.  One result
from the lab is:The first practical application has been on Google Glass, as
engineers put the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it
to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks. For
engineering reasons, the quantum processor can never be installed in Glass,
but together with Google's conventional server centers, it can point the way
to a better blink-detecting algorithm. That would allow the Glass processor to
detect blinks with better accuracy and using significantly less power. If
successful, it could be an important breakthrough for wink-triggered apps,
which have struggled with the task so far.Google thinksquantum computing has a

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

cables and we unite the digital and material worlds.1 billion: searches on
DuckDuckGo in 2013Quotable Quotes: pg: We [Hacker News] currently get just
over 200k uniques and just under 2m page views on weekdays (less on weekends).
rtm: New server: one Xeon E5-2690 chip, 2.9 GHz, 8 cores total, 32 GB RAM.Kyle
Vanhemert: The graph shows the site's [Reddit] beginnings in the primordial
muck of porn and programming.Drake Baer: But it's not about knowing the most
people possible. Instead of being about size, a successful network is about
shape.@computionist: Basically when you cache early to scale you've admitted
you have no idea what you're doing.Norvig's Law: Any technology that surpasses
50% penetration will never double again.  mbell: Keep in mind that a single
modern physical server that is decently configured (12-16 cores, 128GB of ram)
is the processing equivalent of about 16 EC2 m1.large instances.@dakami:

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time:(Giant Hurricane on Saturn, here's onein New
Orleans) 1,966,080 cores: Time Warp synchronization protocol using up to 7.8M
MPI tasks on 1,966,080 cores of the {Sequoia} Blue Gene/Q supercomputer
system. 33 trillion events processed in 65 seconds yielding a peak event-rate
in excess of 504 billion events/second using 120 racks of Sequoia.Quotable
Quotes:Thad Starner: the longer accessing a device exceeds 2s, the more its
actually usage would decrease exponentially. Thus, he made a claim that wrist
watch interface always sitting on one's wrist ready to use should be more
successful than mobile phones which have to pulled out of the pocket.

<p>Introduction: Update:Good Vibrationsby Radovan SemanÄ?ik. Lot's of interesting questions
about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.Google
Waveis a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML
documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency
updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new,
convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users ofGoogle
Waveand we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open
platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and
become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to
"federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google
Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and
collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation
Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.Hereare

<p>Introduction: In his blog post,Scaling WSO2 Stratos, Srinath Perera explains the scaling
architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure.
It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new
concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.Overall,
WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading
to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the
paper WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing.
ProblemStratos is multi-tenanted. In other words, there are many tenants. Each
tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants,
where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos
supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products
(e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants
may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, and Gadgets
etc. WSO2 Str</p><p>3 0.91627997 <a title="1572-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-16-S3_Failed_Because_of_Authentication_Overload.html">249 high scalability-2008-02-16-S3 Failed Because of Authentication Overload</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Being an authentic human being is difficult and apparently authenticating all
those S3 requests can be a bit overwhelming as well. Amazon fingered a lot of
processor heavy authentication requests as the reason for their
downtime:breakEarly this morning, at 3:30am PST, we started seeing elevated
levels of authenticated requests from multiple users in one of our locations.
While we carefully monitor our overall request volumes and these remained
within normal ranges, we had not been monitoring the proportion of
authenticated requests. Importantly, these cryptographic requests consume more
resources per call than other request types.Shortly before 4:00am PST, we
began to see several other users significantly increase their volume of
authenticated calls. The last of these pushed the authentication service over
its maximum capacity before we could complete putting new capacity in place.
In addition to processing authenticated requests, the authentication service
also performs account valida</p><p>same-blog 4 0.89035398 <a title="1572-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_3rd%2C_2014.html">1572 high scalability-2014-01-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 3rd, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good
SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and
make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was
written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in A day in the life of a slow page
at Stack Overflow, where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was
possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for
other pages the improvement was 100x.Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of
his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the
tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:Using theirmini-
profiler it was shown that abadge detail pagewas taking 630.3 ms to load,
298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL
queries for the page and how long each took.From the historical logs, which
are stored inHAProxy on a month-by-month basis, Sam was able to determine this

<p>Introduction: FromFRESH Portsand their website:ISPmanis an ISP management software written
in perl, using an LDAPbackend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP. It can be
used to manage,DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration,
cyrusmail boxes, proftpd etc.ISPMan was written as a management tool for the
network at 4unet wherebetween 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is
crazily growing.Managing these domains and their users was a little time
consuming,and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these
daemonsfluently. Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and
users.LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server canbe
scaled from 1 to n as required. An LDAP entry called maildroptells the SMTP
server (postfix) where to deliver the mail. The SMTPservers can be
loadbalanced with one of many load balancingtechniques. The program is written
with scalability and Highavailability in mind.This may not be the right

<p>Introduction: HackerEarth is a coding skill practice and testing service that in a series of

site and how they overcame them: Scaling Python/Django application with Apache

HAProxy,Continuous Deployment System,HackerEarth Technology Stack.What
characterizes these articles and makes them especially helpful is a drive for
improvement and an openness towards reporting what didn't work and how they
figured out what would work.As they say, mistakes happen when you are building
a complex product with a team of just 3-4 engineers, but investing in
infrastructure allowed them to take more breaks, roam the streets of Bangalore

<p>Introduction: Launched in 2001 by Microsoft, since then this platform is widely popular
among organizations to increase the efficiency of their business and
productive volume. As we all know the importance of communication mode in
every organization and by keeping in the mind this fact, Microsoft SharePoint
communicates over all barriers and spread the required information within a
company.Microsoft SharePoint is an ideal solution for companies who have
multiple offices and staff members who are on the move. Using SharePoint,
documents and other materials can be easily shared with both colleagues and
managers. Other features include advanced document management, which allows
users to virtually check out a document, modify it or just read it, then check
in the document again. This allows managers/company owners to see exactly when
their staff members are working and just what they are doing. When combined
with a highly customizable workflow management system and group calendars,
SharePoint can improv</p><p>2 0.84762406 <a title="1579-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable_Web_Architectures_and_Application_State.html">656 high scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable Web Architectures and Application State</a></p>

<p>Introduction: "Everything in war is simple, but theďťż simplest thing is difficult." -- Carl
von ClausewitzGames are proving grounds for software architecture. They
combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost
sensitivity, and the need for profit. And when games have in-game currency,
like EVE Online has, there's money at play, so you can't just get away with a
c'est la vie attitude. Engineering must be applied. InPlanning for war: how
the EVE Online servers deal with a 3,000 person battle, we learn some
techniques EVE Online uses to handle large games:7 Sensible...Do nothing.Most
games are manageable or have spikes that quickly dissipate. Run it Hot.
There's nothing to throttle as servers run at 100%. Why waste money? Use all
your CPU.Shard it. Games are sharded by solar system and multiple solar
systems run on a node.Move it. Games are moved when a machine becomes
overloaded. Live Node Remap, where a live game is moved to a new node without
disconnecting users, is n</p><p>5 0.83779877 <a title="1579-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-30-Dramatically_Improving_Performance_by_Debugging_Brutally_Complex_Prolems.html">1314 high scalability-2012-08-30-Dramatically Improving Performance by Debugging Brutally Complex Prolems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Debugging complex problems is 90% persistence and 50% cool tools. Brendan
Gregg in10 Performance Wins tells a fascinating story of how a team at Joyent
solved some weird and challenging performance issues deep in the OS. It took
lots of effort,DTrace, Flame Graphs,USE Method, and writing custom tools when
necessary. Here's a quick summary of the solved cases:Monitoring. 1000x
improvement. An application blocked while paging anonymous memory back in. It
was also blocked during file system fsync() calls. The application was
misconfigured and sometimes briefly exceeded available memory, getting page
out.Riak. 2x improvement. The Erlang VM used half the CPU count it was
supposed to, so CPUs remained unused.  Fix was a configuration change.MySQL.
380x improvement. Reads were slow. Cause was correlated writes. Fix was to
tune the cache flush interval on the storage controller.Various. 2800x
improvement. Large systems calls to getvmusage() could take a few seconds.
Cause was a priority invers</p><p>6 0.83742827 <a title="1579-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-15-Cloud_Bursting_between_AWS_and_Rackspace.html">1264 high scalability-2012-06-15-Cloud Bursting between AWS and Rackspace</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>3 0.15906568 <a title="1642-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a meetup Wednesday onOpenStack,
whose tag line isthe open source, open standards cloud. I was shocked at the
large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of
them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free
t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are
really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud
doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from
Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems
to be. The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:OpenStack allows any organization
to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software
running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically
creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack
Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage using
clusters o</p><p>6 0.14234005 <a title="1642-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>

minutes, with 40 minutes of speechifying and 20 minutes for questions.The

<p>Introduction: Monitor, monitor, monitor. That's the advice every startup gives once they
reach a certain size. But can you ever monitor enough? If you are Bitly and
everyone will complain when you are down, probably not.Here are 10 Things We
Forgot to Monitor from Bitly, along with good stories and copious amounts of
code snippets. Well worth reading, especially after you've already started
monitoring the lower hanging fruit.An interesting revelation from the article
is that:We run bitly split across two data centers, one is a managed
environment with DELL hardware, and the second is Amazon EC2.  Fork Rate. A
strange configuration issue caused processes to be created at a rate of
several hundred a second rather than the expected 1-10/second. Flow control
packets.  A network configuration that honors flow control packets and isn't
configured to disable them, can temporarily cause dropped traffic.Swap In/Out

<p>Introduction: How do you scale an inbox that has multiple highly volatile feeds? That's a
problem faced by social networks like Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter. Follow a
few hundred event sources and it's hard to scalably order an inbox so that you
see a correct view as event sources continually publish new events.This can be
considered like aview materializationproblem in a database. In a database a
view is a virtual table defined by a query that can be accessed like a table.
Materialization refers to when the data behind the view is created. If a view
is a join on several tables and that join is performed when the view is
accessed, then performance will be slow. If the view is precomputed access to
the view will be fast, but more resources are used, especially considering
that the view may never be accessed.Your wall/inbox/stream is a view on all
the people/things you follow. If you never look at your inbox then
materializing the view in your inbox is a waste of resources, yet you'll be

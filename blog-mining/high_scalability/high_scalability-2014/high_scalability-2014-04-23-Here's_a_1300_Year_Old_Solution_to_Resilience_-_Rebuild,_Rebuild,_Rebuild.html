The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are you still the same person?
 
The  Ise Grand Shrine  has been in continuous existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then dismantled.
 
Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that imperative.

</p><p>5 A blog post on  Persuing Wabi  has some fabulous photos of the shrine along with a brief description of why it's the way it is:     The shrines and any associated structures such as bridges and towering torii gates are totally rebuilt every 20 years on an adjacent site. [sent-11, score-1.231]
</p><p>6 The main pillars from the old structures are used for torii gates in the new shrine. [sent-15, score-0.479]
</p><p>7 Another reason is that the shrines follow the architectural style of grain houses from the Yayoi period (300 BC to 300 AD), which stored seed rice in case of famines. [sent-21, score-0.494]
</p><p>8 The roofs of these warehouses had a thatched roof, which becomes heavier over time as they absorb water. [sent-22, score-0.409]
</p><p>9 More on how the structure design led to the  need for periodic renewal :     This kind of grain warehouse was normally supported by more than a dozen pillars sunk directly into the ground and had a thatched roof. [sent-25, score-0.803]
</p><p>10 A great deal of rain usually falls in Japan's early-summer monsoon, and as the thatched roof absorbs rainwater it becomes heavier. [sent-26, score-0.543]
</p><p>11 Thus, the roof and pillars function together like a living organism to securely protect the seed rice from moisture and pests. [sent-29, score-0.789]
</p><p>12 The only way to support a thatched roof designed to increase in weight is to set the pillars directly into the ground. [sent-30, score-0.699]
</p><p>13 However, with this method, the pillars and the thatched roof eventually start to rot. [sent-31, score-0.699]
</p><p>14 However, the life-giving seed rice could not be protected if the rebuilding process started only after the old warehouses could no longer be used. [sent-33, score-0.513]
</p><p>15 The shrine itself is built in an ancient and unique architectural style called  shimmei-zukuri , a style characterized by extreme simplicity of design. [sent-35, score-0.803]
</p><p>16 Is the shrine just an intriguing slice of history that has nothing to do with the world of technology? [sent-39, score-0.561]
</p><p>17 I see a thread of humanity that stretches all the way back to the shrine and forward to our modern software culture. [sent-41, score-0.561]
</p><p>18 There's a direct mapping of the shrine rebuild pattern in an  upgrade practice  that started with the advent of the cloud. [sent-42, score-0.702]
</p><p>19 The shrine as an example of extreme simplicity and functionality must have also had great value to the community. [sent-64, score-0.746]
</p><p>20 Perhaps the patterns of recurrence we see in software are not just a wasteful silliness, but a familiar example of a Darwinian selection process, where simplicity and value are kept alive in a community of human minds. [sent-65, score-0.362]

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: Jurriaan Persyn is a Lead Web Developer at Netlog, a social portal site that gets 50 million unique visitors and 5+ billion page views per month. In this paper Jurriaan goes into a lot of excellent nuts and bolts details about how they used sharding to scale their system. If you are pondering sharding as a solution to your scaling problems you'll want to read this paper. As the paper is quite well organized there's no reason to write a summary, but I especially liked this part from the conclusion:       If you can do with simpler solutions (better hardware, more hardware, server tweaking and tuning, vertical partitioning, sql query optimization, ...) that require less development cost, why invest lots of effort in sharding? On the other hand, when your visitor statistics really start blowing through the roof, it is a good direction to go. After all, it worked for us.</p><p>6 0.060433276 <a title="1636-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon_Architecture.html">96 high scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon Architecture</a></p>

  @thoward3 : OH: "We make scalability a possibility.. You know, we make 'scalapossibilty'. " 
  Tesla : When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.

<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are you still the same person?
 
The  Ise Grand Shrine  has been in continuous existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then dismantled.
 
Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that imperative.
 
You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed in each new environment.
 
The patterns of recurrence in software are the result of Darw</p><p>2 0.80477554 <a title="1636-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-09-Paper%3A_Propagation_Networks%3A_A_Flexible_and_Expressive_Substrate_for_Computation_.html">839 high scalability-2010-06-09-Paper: Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation  Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation , offers to help us  break free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of autonomous but interconnected machines .  We can do this by  organizing computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.  The abstract from his thesis is : 
  In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected with stateful storage</p><p>3 0.73876655 <a title="1636-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-18-Robert_Scoble%27s_Rules_for_Successfully_Scaling_Startups.html">352 high scalability-2008-07-18-Robert Scoble's Rules for Successfully Scaling Startups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignant   FriendFeed thread   commiserating PodTech's unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup. Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with them:       Have a story.   Have everyone on board with that story.   If anyone goes off of that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.   Make sure people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.   Work ONLY for a leader who will make the tough decisions.   Build a place where excellence is expected, allowed, and is enabled.   Fire idiots quickly.   If your engineering team can't give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only things that are measured ever get improved.   When your stars aren't listened to the company is in trouble.

<p>Introduction: If you are interested in future foward OS designs then you might find  Akaros  worth a look. It's an operating system designed for many-core architectures and large-scale SMP systems, with the goals of:
  
 Providing better support for parallel and high-performance applications 
 Scaling the operating system to a large number of cores  
  
A more indepth explanation of the motiviation behind Akaros can be found in  Improving Per-Node Efﬁciency in the Datacenter with NewOS Abstractions  by Barret Rhoden, Kevin Klues, David Zhu, and Eric Brewer.
 
The abstract:
  We believe datacenters can beneﬁt from more focus on per-node efﬁciency, performance, and predictability, versus the more common focus so far on scalability to a large number of nodes. Improving per-node efﬁciency decreases costs and fault recovery because fewer nodes are required for the same amount of work. We believe that the use of complex, general-purpose operating systems is a key contributing factor to these inefﬁciencies</p><p>5 0.66117793 <a title="1636-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-06-Product%3A_Lightcloud_-_Key-Value_Database.html">528 high scalability-2009-03-06-Product: Lightcloud - Key-Value Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lightcloud is a distributed and persistent   key-value database   from   Plurk.com  . Performance is said to be comparable to memcached. It's different than   memcachedb   because it scales out horizontally by adding new nodes. It's different than memcached because it persists to disk, it's not just a cache. Now you have   one more option   in the never ending quest to ditch the RDBMS.     Their website does a nice job explaining the system:       Built on Tokyo Tyrant. One of the fastest key-value databases [benchmark]. Tokyo Tyrant has been in development for many years and is used in production by Plurk.com, mixi.jp and scribd.com (to name a few)...   Great performance (comparable to memcached!)   Can store millions of keys on very few servers - tested in production   Scale out by just adding nodes   Nodes are replicated via master-master replication.

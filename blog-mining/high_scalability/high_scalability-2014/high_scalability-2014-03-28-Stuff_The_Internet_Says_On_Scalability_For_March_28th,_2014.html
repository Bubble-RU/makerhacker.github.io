<p>Introduction: In some ways the original Amazon cloud, the one most of us still live in, was like that really cool house that when you stepped inside and saw the old  green shag carpet  in the living room, you knew the house hadn't been updated in a while. The network is a little slow, the processors are a bit dated, and virtualization made the house just feel smaller. It has been difficult to run high bandwidth or low latency workloads in the cloud. Bottlenecks everywhere. Not a big deal for most applications, but for many high performance applications (HPC) it was a killer.
 
In a typical house you might just do a remodel. Upgrade a few rooms. Swap out builder quality appliances with gleaming stainless steel monsters. But Amazon has a big lot, instead of remodeling they simply keep adding on entire new wings, kind of like the  Winchester Mystery House  of computing.
 
The first new wing added was a  CPU based HPC system  featuring blazingly fast  Nehalem chips , virtualization replaced by a close t</p><p>3 0.13236228 <a title="1621-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

 How algorithms help determine that shape of our world. First we encode normative rules of an idealized world in algorithms. Second those algorithms help enforce those expectations by nudging humans in to acting accordingly. A fun example is the story of  Ed Bolian's Record-Breaking Drive . Ed raced from New York to L.A. at speeds of up to 158 mph, "breaking countless laws – and the previous record, by more than two hours." His approach is one that any nerd would love. He had three radar detectors, two laser jammers, two nav systems, a CB radio, a scanner, two iPhones and two iPads running applications like Waze, lookouts in the back seat scanning for cops, and someone scouting ahead. Awesome! For the moral of the story, they were going s</p><p>4 0.87215465 <a title="1621-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_3%2C_2013.html">1451 high scalability-2013-05-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 3, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The story of driving the  golden spike  to symbolize the completion of the  transcontinental railroad  is famous in the US. What is not so well known is the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that possibly be?
  Telegraph as Internet  
First, let's establish the telegraph and cable systems was an early version of an Internet.
 
As railroad tracks were being laid a  transcontental telegraph  system was also being constructed. Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could ride.
 
With the  transalantic cable system  information could quickly span continents in minutes:
  

The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to 12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to 110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870, 40</p><p>2 0.90505755 <a title="1621-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-10-Future_of_EJB3_%21%21_%3F%3F.html">179 high scalability-2007-12-10-Future of EJB3 !! ??</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:   New Gearman Server & Library in C, MySQL UDFs .   Gearman  is an open source  message queuing  system that makes it easy to do distributed job processing using multiple languages.  With Gearman you:  farm out work to other machines, dispatching function calls to machines that are better suited to do work, to do work in parallel, to load balance lots of function calls, to call functions between languages, spread CPU usage around your network .   Gearman is used by companies like LiveJournal, Yahoo!, and Digg. Digg, for example, runs 300,000 jobs a day through Gearman without any issues. Most large sites use something similar. Why would anyone ever even need a message queuing system?
   
 Message queuing is a handy way to move work off your web servers (like image manipulation),  to generate thousands of documents in the background, to run the multiple requests in parallel needed to build a web page, or to perform tasks that can comfortably be run in the background and not part</p><p>5 0.87131619 <a title="1621-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-05-10_Things_You_Should_Know_About_AWS.html">1543 high scalability-2013-11-05-10 Things You Should Know About AWS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Authored by  Chris Fregly   :  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.  
   Ahead of the upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi’s recent    presentation    at an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few of my recent    Fluxcapacitor.com    consulting engagements, I’ve compiled a list of 10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS. 
    1) Query AWS resource metadata  
      
   Can’t remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?     awsnow.info    is the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.  Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You’re in luck.  There’s now a    REST API   , as well! 
   Note:  These are default soft limits and will vary by account. 
    2) Tame your S3 buckets  
       
   Delete an entire S3 bucket with a single CLI command:</p><p>6 0.85044992 <a title="1621-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_9th%2C_2014.html">1645 high scalability-2014-05-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 9th, 2014</a></p>

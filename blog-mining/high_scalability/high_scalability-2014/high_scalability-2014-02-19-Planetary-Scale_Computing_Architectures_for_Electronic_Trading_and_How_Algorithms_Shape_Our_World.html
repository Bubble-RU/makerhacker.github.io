<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.We tend to think compute
of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of
innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will
reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the
datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of
datacenters in the future.Given the diversity of compute resources it's
reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API.
They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those
specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough
to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever
they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the
fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever
resources it doesn't have</p><p>6 0.12043411 <a title="1599-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-25-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_25th%2C_2013.html">1537 high scalability-2013-10-25-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 25th, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Oh, you don't have a Quantum Computer Lab staffed with researchers? Well,
Google does. Here they areon G+. To learn what they are up to the Verge hasA
first look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab. The lab is partnership
between NASA, Google, and a 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum computer.  One result
from the lab is:The first practical application has been on Google Glass, as
engineers put the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it
to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks. For
engineering reasons, the quantum processor can never be installed in Glass,
but together with Google's conventional server centers, it can point the way
to a better blink-detecting algorithm. That would allow the Glass processor to
detect blinks with better accuracy and using significantly less power. If
successful, it could be an important breakthrough for wink-triggered apps,
which have struggled with the task so far.Google thinksquantum computing has a

simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed

<p>Introduction: Lighttpd(pronounced "lighty") is a web server which is designed to be secure,
fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-
critical environments. Its low memory footprint (compared to other web
servers), light CPU load and its speed goals make lighttpd suitable for
servers that are suffering load problems, or for serving static media
separately from dynamic content. lighttpd is free software / open source, and
is distributed under the BSD license. lighttpd runs on GNU/Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows.Load-balancing FastCGI, SCGI

<p>Introduction: Algorithms are moving out of the Platonic realm and are becoming dynamic first
class players in real life. We've seen corporations become people. Algorithms
will likely also follow that path to agency.Kevin Slavin in his intriguing TED
talk: How Algorithms Shape Our World, gives many and varied examples of how
algorithms have penetrated RL. One of his most interesting examples is from a
highly technical paper on Relativistic statistical arbitrage, which says to
make money on markets you have to be where the people are, the red dots (on
the diagram below), which means you have to put servers where the blue dots
are, many of which are in the ocean. Here's the diagram from the paper:Mr.
Slavin neatly sums this up by saying:And it's not the money that's so
interesting actually. It's what the money motivates, thatwe're actually
terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency. And in
that light, you go back and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs, and you

<p>Introduction: This excellent survey of the field waswritten by Ian Thomas Varleyas part of
his Master of Science in Engineering program.The aim of this paper is to
explore the conceptual design space of non-relational databases as compared to
traditional relational databases. It is clear that the design needs of the two
paradigms are different, but how fundamental are the differences, and what
strategies can we use to transition our conceptual designs from one to the
other?There are a few things to like about this paper. A running a example is
used to show the different ways to model data depending on which type of
solution you are targeting, especially covering how many-to-many relationships
are modeled, data integrity, and how to support optional attributes. There's
also a brief survey of some of the major systems.The most interesting section
of the report is where it tackles the problem of design for non-relational
systems. The approach has two different phases: design questions and design

<p>Introduction: What's cool about starting a new project is you finally have a chance to do it
right. You of course eventually mess everything up in your own way, but for
that one moment the world has a perfect order, a rightness that feels
satisfying and good. Arne Claassen, the CTO of notify.me, a brand new real
time notification delivery service, is in this honeymoon period now.Arne has
been gracious enough to share with us his philosophy of how to build a
notification service. I think you'll find it fascinating because Arne goes
into a lot of useful detail about how his system works.His main design
philosophy is to minimize the bottlenecks that form around synchronous access,
that is whensome resource is requested and the requestor ties up more
resources, waiting for a response. If the requested resource can't be
delivered in a timely manner, more and more requests pile up until the server
can't accept any new ones. Nobody gets what they want and you have an outage.
Breaking synchronous operations</p><p>5 0.76639384 <a title="1599-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-25-Paper%3A_On_Designing_and_Deploying_Internet-Scale_Services.html">288 high scalability-2008-03-25-Paper: On Designing and Deploying Internet-Scale Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Greg Lindenlinks to a heavily lesson ladened LISA 2007 paper titledOn
Designing and Deploying Internet-Scale Servicesby James Hamilton of the
Windows Live Services Platform group. I know people crave nitty-gritty
details, but this isn't a how to configure a web server article. It hitches
you to a rocket and zooms you up to 50,000 feet so you can take a look at best
web operations practices from a broad, yet practical perspective. The author
and his team of contributors obviously have a lot of in the trenches
experience. Many non-obvious topics are covered. And there's a lot to learn
from.The paper has too many details to cover here, but the big sections
are:RecommendationsAutomatic Management and ProvisioningDependency

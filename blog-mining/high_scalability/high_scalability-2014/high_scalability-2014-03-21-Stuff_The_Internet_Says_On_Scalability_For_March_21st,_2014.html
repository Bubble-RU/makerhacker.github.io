<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture for  Poppen.de , a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new, using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached, RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.
  What is Poppen.de?  
Poppen.de (NSFW) is the top dating website in  Germany, and while it may be a small site compared to giants like Flickr  or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to learn from if you  are starting to get some scaling problems.
  The  Stats   
 2.000.000 users 
 20.000  concurrent users 
 300.000 private messages per day 
 250.000  logins per day 
 We have a team  of  eleven developers, two designers and two sysadmins for this project. 
   Business Model  
The site works with a  freemium model, where users can do for free things like:

<p>Introduction: This question comes from Ulysses on an  interesting thread  from the Mechanical Sympathy news group, especially given how multiple processors are now the norm:
 
Ulysses:
   
 On an 8xCPU Linux instance,  is it at all advantageous to use the Linux taskset command to pin an 8xJVM process set (co-ordinated as a www.infinispan.org distributed cache/data grid) to a specific CPU affinity set  (i.e. pin JVM0 process to CPU 0, JVM1 process to CPU1, ...., JVM7process to CPU 7) vs. just letting the Linux OS use its default mechanism for provisioning the 8xJVM process set to the available CPUs? 
 In effrort to seek an optimal point (in the full event space), what are the conceptual trade-offs in considering "searching" each permutation of provisioning an 8xJVM process set to an 8xCPU set via taskset? 
   
Given  taskset  is they key to the question, it would help to have a definition:

  Gideon Lewis-Kraus :Â As the engineer and writer Alex Payne put it, these startups represent â&euro;&oelig;the field offices of a large distributed workforce assembled by venture capitalists and their associate institutions,â&euro;? doing low-overhead, low-risk R&D; for five corporate giants. In such a system, the real disillusionment isnâ&euro;&trade;t the discovery that youâ&euro;&trade;re unlikely to become aÂ billionaire; itâ&euro;&trade;s the realization that your feeling of autonomy is a fantasy, and that the vast majority of you have been set up to fail by design.

<p>Introduction: In his blog post,  Scaling WSO2 Stratos , Srinath Perera explains the scaling architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure. It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.
 
Overall, WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the paper     WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing .   
  Problem  
 Stratos is   multi-tenanted  . In other words, there are many tenants. Each tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants, where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products (e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, a</p><p>2 0.93197358 <a title="1617-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-Google_Wave_Architecture.html">618 high scalability-2009-06-05-Google Wave Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Good Vibrations  by Radovan Semančík. Lot's of interesting questions about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.   Google Wave  is a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new, convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users of  Google Wave  and we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to "federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.

<p>Introduction: Being an authentic human being is difficult and apparently authenticating all those S3 requests can be a bit overwhelming as well. Amazon fingered a lot of processor heavy authentication requests as the reason for their downtime:        Early this morning, at 3:30am PST, we started seeing elevated levels of authenticated requests from multiple users in one of our locations.  While we carefully monitor our overall request volumes and these remained within normal ranges, we had not been monitoring the proportion of authenticated requests.  Importantly, these cryptographic requests consume more resources per call than other request types.  Shortly before 4:00am PST, we began to see several other users significantly increase their volume of authenticated calls.  The last of these pushed the authentication service over its maximum capacity before we could complete putting new capacity in place.  In addition to processing authenticated requests, the authentication service also performs accou</p><p>4 0.90476656 <a title="1617-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-10-Building_Scalable_Databases%3A_Denormalization%2C_the_NoSQL_Movement_and_Digg.html">698 high scalability-2009-09-10-Building Scalable Databases: Denormalization, the NoSQL Movement and Digg</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database schemas that ensures that the data is optimal for ad-hoc querying and that modifications such as deletion or insertion of data does not lead to data inconsistency. Database denormalization is the process of optimizing your database for reads by creating redundant data. A consequence of denormalization is that insertions or deletions could cause data inconsistency if not uniformly applied to all redundant copies of the data within the database.

  Jonathan Ive : Steve, and I don’t recognize my friend in much of it. Yes, he had a surgically precise opinion. Yes, it could sting. Yes, he constantly questioned. ‘Is this good enough? Is this right?’ but he was so clever. His ideas were bold and magnificent. They could suck the air from the room.

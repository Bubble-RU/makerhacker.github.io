<p>Introduction: In my last  post , I outlined considerations that need to be taken into account when choosing between a centralized and federated security model. So, how do we implement the chosen model?   Based on a real-world case study, I will outline a Kerberos architecture that enables cutting-edge collaborative research through federated sharing of resources.

<p>Introduction: MySQL Expert Ronald Bradford explains how one key way to improve the scalability of a MySQL server, and undoubtedly nearly every other server, is to  eliminate unnecessary SQL , saying  the most efficient way to improve an SQL statement is to eliminate it :
  

The MySQL kernel can only physically process a certain number of SQL statements for a given time period (e.g. per second). Regardless of the type of machine you have, there is a physical limit. If you eliminate SQL statements that are unwarranted and unnecessary, you automatically enable more important SQL statements to run. There are numerous other downstream affects, however this is the simple math. To run more SQL, reduce the number of SQL you need to run.

  
Ronald shows how to use  mk-query-digest  to look at query execution times and determine which ones can be profitably whacked.

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble  is a kind of Brothers Grimm for the digital age. Instead of inspired romantics walking around the country side collecting the folk tales of past ages, he is an inspired technologist documenting the current mythology of startups.
 
One of the developments Robert is exploring is the rise of the  contextual age . Where every bit of information about you is continually being prodded, pulled, and observed, shoveled into a great learning machine, and turned into a fully actionable  knowledge graph  of context. A digital identity more real to software than your physical body ever was. 
 
Sinner or saviour, the Age of Context has interesting implications for startups. It raises the entrance bar to dizzying heights. Much of the reason companies are tearing down the Golden Age of the Web, one open protocol at a time, is to create a walled garden of monopolized information.
 
To operate in this world you will have to somehow create a walled garden of your own.

<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder  Steve Wozniak  and Atari founder  Nolan Bushnell , had a chance to sit down for a chat at the  C2SV  conference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can decide futures.  
  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability       
 
 
Steve talked about how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was expandable. It had  eight expansion slots  and the RAM was also expandable (starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility or  expansion capabilities . Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer community. 
 
So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh al</p><p>3 0.66599673 <a title="1608-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-11-Douglas_Adams_-_3_Rules_that_Describe_Our_Reactions_to_Technologies.html">1610 high scalability-2014-03-11-Douglas Adams - 3 Rules that Describe Our Reactions to Technologies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chris Dixon   unearthed a  great quote   from Douglas Adams on the nature of technological adoption that unsurprisingly hits the mark in our ever changing and evolving world:
  
 Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.  
 Anything that’s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.  
 Anything invented after you’re thirty-five is against the natural order of things

<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson:  Game Industry Legends: Rob Pardo , where the future of gaming is discussed, there was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:
  Q. If the game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of those technical issues?

 


 Rob Pardo : I certainly think there's a lot of potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with the infrastructure that can have all those games up there.

<p>Introduction: My favorite kind of histories are those told from an insider's perspective. The story of Richard the Lionheart is full of great battles and dynastic intrigue. The story of one of his soldiers, not so much. Yet the soldiers' story, as someone who has experienced the real consequences of decisions made and actions taken, is more revealing.
 
We get such a history in  Chat Wars , a wonderful article written by David Auerbach, who in 1998 worked at Microsoft on MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft’s instant messaging app (for a related story see  The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted ).
 
It's as if Herodotus visited Microsoft and wrote down his experiences. It has that same sort of conversational tone, insightful on-the-ground observations, and facts no outsider might ever believe.
 
Much of the article is a play-by-play account of the cat and mouse game David plays changing Messenger to track AOL's Instant Messenger protocol changes.

<p>Introduction: The way this game is played is you read a few statements on some hot topics below. If you agree with a statement then you “take it”; if you disagree then you “leave it.” And if you are so moved please write a convincing comment as to why. Got it?
  
 

  Snowden vs. the State.  Snowden represents true the spirit of freedom and is not a threat to all we hold dear. 

 
 

  Walled Garden vs. Federated Freedom.  The Walled Garden has won the last decade. The cycle of life will return the balance and federated services will once again win the day. 

 
 

  Mobile + messaging vs. Le Web.  Mobile + messaging is eating search and the web, changing the way things are found, discovered, and bought.  

 
 

  Fiat vs. Cryptocurrency.  BitCoin has had its 400 million dollars of fame, it’s on the way out, a tulip gone out of bloom. 

 
 

  True Detective vs. The Field.  True Detective is the best show on TV, ever. Wired and Breaking Bad need not apply.</p><p>2 0.80086029 <a title="1608-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-20-Sponsored_Post%3A_Event_-_Social_Developer_Summit.html">814 high scalability-2010-04-20-Sponsored Post: Event - Social Developer Summit</a></p>

 Key to making sensors ubiquitous is getting the BOM cost down. Here's a dream way of making that happen:  Bye-Bye Batteries: Radio Waves as a Low-Power Source . “Silicon technology has advanced to the point where even tiny amounts of energy can do useful work.” No batteries == cheaper, smaller products == ubiquity. 
  The MySQL “swap insanity” problem and the effects of the NUMA architecture . Jeremy Cole with a spectacular article on the differences between NUMA and SMP/UMA systems and the mostly unsatisfactory tricks required to get MySQL to perform on NUMA systems. There are really two issues: the evils of an OS controlled swap and NUMA performance effects due to a single node (in the NUMA sense) running out of memory. This is the kind of stuff you only see when you push your systems to the edge. Also,  Measuring NUMA effects with the STREAM benchmark ,  MongoDB</p><p>6 0.68980956 <a title="1608-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-04-Its_time_for_auto_scaling_%E2%80%93_avoid_peak_load_provisioning_for_web_applications.html">524 high scalability-2009-03-04-Its time for auto scaling – avoid peak load provisioning for web applications</a></p>

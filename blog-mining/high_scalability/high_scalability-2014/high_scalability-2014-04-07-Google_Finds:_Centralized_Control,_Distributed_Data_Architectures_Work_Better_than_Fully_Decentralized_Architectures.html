<p>Introduction: The RAD Lab (Reliable Adaptive Distributed Systems Laboratory) wants to
leapfrog the Big Switch and create The Next Big Switch, skipping the
cloud/utility evolutionary stage altogether. This hyper-evolutionary niche
buster develops technology so advanced the cloud disperses and you can go back
to building your own personal datacenters again. Where Google took years to
create their datacenters, using a prefab Datacenter Operating System you might
create your own in a long holiday weekend. Not St. Patrick's of course.Their
vision:Enable one person to invent and run the next revolutionary IT service,
operationally expressing a new business idea as a multi-million-user service
over the course of a long weekend. By doing so we hope to enable an Internet
"Fortune 1 million".How? By wizardry in the form of a “datacenter operating
system” created from a pinch of "statistical machine learning (SML)" and a
tincture of "recent insights from networking and distributed systems." But

<p>Introduction: If you were going to design a next generation Internet at the physical layer
that routes around the current Internet, what would it look like? What should
it do? How should it work? Who should own it? How should it be paid for? How
would you access it?It has long been said the Internet routes around
obstacles. Snowden has revealed some major obstacles. The beauty of the
current current app and web system is the physical network doesn't matter. We
can just replace it with something else. Something that doesn't flow through
choke points like backhaul networks,under sea cables, andcell towers. What
might that something else look like?Google's Loon ProjectProject Loonwas so
named because the idea was thought to be loony. Maybe not.The idea is to float
high-altitude balloons 20 miles in the air to create an aerial wireless
network with up to 3G-like speeds. Signals travel through the balloon network
from balloon to balloon, then to a ground-based station connected to an

<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says the best
way to avoid failure is to fail constantly. In the cloud it's expected
instances can fail at any time, so you always have to be prepared. In the real
world we prepare by running drills. Remember all those exciting fire drills?
It's not just fire drills of course. The military, football teams, fire
fighters, beach rescue, virtually any entity that must react quickly and
efficiently to disaster hones their responsiveness by running drills.Netflix
aggressively moves this strategy into the cloud by randomly failing servers
using a tool they built called Chaos Monkey. The idea is:If we aren't
constantly testing our ability to succeed despite failure, then it isn't
likely to work when it matters most - in the event of an unexpected
outage.They respond to failures bydegrading service, but they always
respond:If the recommendations system is down they'll show popular titles
instead.If the search system is slow then th</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9358176 <a title="1627-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-07-Google_Finds%3A_Centralized_Control%2C_Distributed_Data_Architectures_Work_Better_than_Fully_Decentralized_Architectures.html">1627 high scalability-2014-04-07-Google Finds: Centralized Control, Distributed Data Architectures Work Better than Fully Decentralized Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For years a war has been fought in the software architecture trenches between
the ideal of decentralized services and the power and practicality of
centralized services. Centralized architectures, at least at themanagement and
control planelevel, are winning. And Google not only agrees, they are
enthusiastic adopters of this model, even in places you don't think it should
work.Here's an excerpt from Google Lifts Veil On "Andromeda" Virtual
Networking, an excellent article by Timothy Morgan, that includes a money
quote fromAmin Vahdat, distinguished engineer and technical lead for
networking at Google:Like many of the massive services that Google has
created, the Andromeda network has centralized control. By the way, so did the
Google File System and the MapReduce scheduler that gave rise to Hadoop when
it was mimicked, so did the BigTable NoSQL data store that has spawned a
number of quasi-clones, and even the B4 WAN and the Spanner distributed file
system that have yet to be cloned.

<p>Introduction: TypePad is considered the largest paid blogging service in the world. After
experience problems because of their meteoric growth, they eventually
transitioned to an architecture patterned after their sister company,
LiveJournal.Site: http://www.typepad.com/The
PlatformMySQLMemcachedPerlMogileFSApacheLinuxThe StatsAs of 2005 TypePad sends
250mbps of traffic using multiple network pipes for 3TB of traffic a day. They
were growing by 10-20% each month. I was unable to find more recent
statistics.The ArchitectureOriginal Architecture:- Single server running
Linux, Apache, Postgres, Perl, mod_perl- Storage was NFS on a filer.A
Devastating Crash Caused a New Direction- A RAID controller failed and spewed
data across all RAID disks.- The database was corrupted and the backups were
corrupted.- Their redundant filers suffered from "split brain" syndrome.They

<p>Introduction: Garry Tan, cofounder of Posterous, lists 12 lessons for scaling that apply to
more than just Rails.Use cloud storage for static files.Use HTTP Cache Control
to tell the browser what it can cache.Use Sphinx for text search.Use InnoDB
for more crash resistant and faster writes.Don't use textbook Rails
ActiveRecord objects. Use New Relic to find exactly what is slow in your
system.Use memcache later so you find your database bottlenecks now.Use
mongrel proctitle to find your slow queries. You are only as fast as your
slowest queries.Use asynchronous job queuing to do work in parallel.Use
monitoring so you'll know when your site went down and why.Learn by reading
the source code, fixing problems, and submitting them back to the
community.Use new plugins. Old plugins can't be trusted.Use new information.
Old information can't be trusted.</p><p>6 0.90238476 <a title="1627-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-18-The_Clever_Ways_Chrome_Hides_Latency_by_Anticipating_Your_Every_Need.html">1267 high scalability-2012-06-18-The Clever Ways Chrome Hides Latency by Anticipating Your Every Need</a></p>

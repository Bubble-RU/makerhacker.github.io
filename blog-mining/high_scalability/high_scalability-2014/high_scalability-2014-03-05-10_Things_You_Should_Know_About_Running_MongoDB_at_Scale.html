[sent-6, score-0.212]
</p><p>2 Second biggest impact is from lack of indexes or wrong indexes or way too many indexes. [sent-14, score-0.316]
</p><p>3 But even when the schema design is perfect and indexes are optimal, it is the disk IO throughput capacity that ends up being the next limiting factor, especially to the write throughput. [sent-15, score-0.389]
</p><p>4 Insufficient RAM will cause a lot of page faulting and add pressure to the disk IO, more on RAM needs later. [sent-16, score-0.325]
</p><p>5 Lots of MongoDB users succeed with a single replica set. [sent-17, score-0.218]
</p><p>6 " When you have very poorly tuned schema, or incorrect indexes, sharding won't solve your problem, instead you will end up with several poorly tuned and poorly performing shards! [sent-21, score-0.622]
</p><p>7 Sharding is appropriate when a specific resource becomes a bottleneck on a single machine or replica set, and you can't add more of that resource at a reasonable cost. [sent-22, score-0.279]
</p><p>8 You may need more disk IO throughput, or more RAM, or occasionally more storage or more concurrency. [sent-23, score-0.213]
</p><p>9 There are indications and metrics that can demonstrate whether or not the amount of RAM you have is adequate for the type of load you are putting on your database. [sent-28, score-0.24]
</p><p>10 If the amount of RAM is not adequate for your performance requirements, you will see page faulting and as page fault rate goes up, ultimately the opcounters will fall below where you want them to be. [sent-30, score-0.314]
</p><p>11 You can see how long it takes to flush the dirty pages in data files to disk in the "Background flush average" chart in MMS. [sent-33, score-0.377]
</p><p>12 You should also remember that everything you write is flushed to disk twice - immediately into thejournaland periodically into the data files. [sent-36, score-0.297]
</p><p>13 Presumably, it's so that you can restore the data in case of some catastrophic event that impacts all replica set nodes. [sent-42, score-0.353]
</p><p>14 "Replication lag," which is a measure of how far a secondary is behind the primary, is just one indicator of the health of your replica sets. [sent-48, score-0.283]
</p><p>15 Just as important as monitoring replication lag iskeeping an eye on your replication oplog window. [sent-49, score-0.431]
</p><p>16 In other words, it's the estimated amount of time a replica node can be down and still be able to catch upon rejoining the set without having to perform a full data resync. [sent-51, score-0.369]
</p><p>17 Over time, your write load will fluctuate, and your replication oplog window will fluctuate in response. [sent-52, score-0.506]
</p><p>18 It is crucial in your capacity planning that you prepare for the busiest data ingestion times when your window to recover is the lowest. [sent-54, score-0.324]
</p><p>19 Here is a side-by-side view in MMS showing replication oplog window across the replica set:MongoDB doesn't know how secure your data needs to be. [sent-55, score-0.663]
</p><p>20 The only "special" system generated collection that you'll want to have familiarity with isthe profiler collection, and periodically profiling your queries is a great way to make sure that things are operating as you expect them to. [sent-64, score-0.212]

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built

herder for the last 20 years, architecting and overseeing the infrastructure
for a number of SaaS based companies.  Data Replication for Disaster
RecoveryAn inevitable part of disaster recovery planning is making sure
customer data exists in multiple locations.  In the case of LogicMonitor, a
SaaS-based monitoring solution for physical, virtual, and cloud environments,
we wanted copies of customer data files both within a data center and outside
of it.  The former was to protect against the loss of individual servers
within a facility, and the latter for recovery in the event of the complete
loss of a data center.Where we were:  RsyncLike most everyone who starts off
in a Linux environment, we used our trusty friend rsync to copy data around.
Rsync is tried, true and tested, and works well when the number of servers,
the amount of data, and the number of files is not horrendous.  When any of
these are no longer</p><p>4 0.23387808 <a title="1606-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-18-Sponsored_Post%3A_Couchbase%2C_Tokutek%2C_Logentries%2C_Booking%2C_Apple%2C_MongoDB%2C_BlueStripe%2C_AiScaler%2C_Aerospike%2C_LogicMonitor%2C_AppDynamics%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7__.html">1598 high scalability-2014-02-18-Sponsored Post: Couchbase, Tokutek, Logentries, Booking, Apple, MongoDB, BlueStripe, AiScaler, Aerospike, LogicMonitor, AppDynamics, ManageEngine, Site24x7  </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jared Rosoffconcisely, effectively, entertainingly, and convincingly gives an
8 minute MongoDB tutorialon scaling MongoDB at Scale Out Camp. The ideas
aren't just limited to MongoDB, they work for most any database: Optimize your
queries; Know your working set size; Tune your file system; Choose the right
disks; Shard. Here's an explanation of all 5 strategies:Optimize your queries.
Computer science works. Complexity analysis works. A btree search is faster
than a table scan. So analyze your queries. Use explain to see what your query
is doing. If it is saying it's using a cursor then it's doing a table scan.
That's slow. Look at the number of documents it looks at to satisfy a query.
Look at how long it takes. Fix: add indexes. It doesn't matter if you are
running on 1 or 100 servers.Know your working set size. Sticking memcache in
front of your database is silly. You have lots of RAM, use it. Embed your
cache in the database, which is how MongoDB works. Working set = Active

<p>Introduction: Guest post byAsya Kamsky, Principal Solutions Architect at MongoDB.This post
outlines ten things you need to know for operating MongoDB at scale based on
my experience working with MongoDB customers and open source users:MongoDB
requires DevOps, too.MongoDB is a database. Like any other data store, it
requires capacity planning, tuning, monitoring, and maintenance. Just because
it's easy to install and get started and it fits the developer paradigm more
naturally than a relational database, don't assume that MongoDB doesn't need
proper care and feeding. And just because it performs super-fast on a small
sample dataset in development doesn't mean you can get away without having a
good schema and indexing strategy, as well as the right hardware resources in
production! But if you prepare well and understand the best practices,

<p>Introduction: In the "should I or shouldn't I" debate around deploying SSD, it always helps
to have real-world data. Fiesta! with alive-blog summary of a presentation by
Kenny Gorman onShutterfly on MongoDB Performance Tuning.What if you still need
more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs.
Shutterfly usesFacebook's flashcache: kernel module to cache data on SSD.
Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single
mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O.
Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can
delay sharding: less complexity.The wholeseries of posts has a lot of great
information and is worth a longer look, especially if you are considering
using MongoDB. Related ArticlesSlides forMongoSF 2011 slides: MongoDB

<p>Introduction: Jared Rosoffconcisely, effectively, entertainingly, and convincingly gives an
8 minute MongoDB tutorialon scaling MongoDB at Scale Out Camp. The ideas
aren't just limited to MongoDB, they work for most any database: Optimize your
queries; Know your working set size; Tune your file system; Choose the right
disks; Shard. Here's an explanation of all 5 strategies:Optimize your queries.
Computer science works. Complexity analysis works. A btree search is faster
than a table scan. So analyze your queries. Use explain to see what your query
is doing. If it is saying it's using a cursor then it's doing a table scan.
That's slow. Look at the number of documents it looks at to satisfy a query.
Look at how long it takes. Fix: add indexes. It doesn't matter if you are
running on 1 or 100 servers.Know your working set size. Sticking memcache in
front of your database is silly. You have lots of RAM, use it. Embed your
cache in the database, which is how MongoDB works. Working set = Active

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeff Behl, VP Ops @ LogicMonitor. Jeffhas been a bit
herder for the last 20 years, architecting and overseeing the infrastructure
for a number of SaaS based companies.  Data Replication for Disaster
RecoveryAn inevitable part of disaster recovery planning is making sure
customer data exists in multiple locations.  In the case of LogicMonitor, a
SaaS-based monitoring solution for physical, virtual, and cloud environments,
we wanted copies of customer data files both within a data center and outside
of it.  The former was to protect against the loss of individual servers
within a facility, and the latter for recovery in the event of the complete
loss of a data center.Where we were:  RsyncLike most everyone who starts off
in a Linux environment, we used our trusty friend rsync to copy data around.
Rsync is tried, true and tested, and works well when the number of servers,
the amount of data, and the number of files is not horrendous.  When any of
these are no longer</p><p>5 0.76331514 <a title="1606-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: Guest post byAsya Kamsky, Principal Solutions Architect at MongoDB.This post
outlines ten things you need to know for operating MongoDB at scale based on
my experience working with MongoDB customers and open source users:MongoDB
requires DevOps, too.MongoDB is a database. Like any other data store, it
requires capacity planning, tuning, monitoring, and maintenance. Just because
it's easy to install and get started and it fits the developer paradigm more
naturally than a relational database, don't assume that MongoDB doesn't need
proper care and feeding. And just because it performs super-fast on a small
sample dataset in development doesn't mean you can get away without having a
good schema and indexing strategy, as well as the right hardware resources in
production! But if you prepare well and understand the best practices,
operating large MongoDB clusters can be boring instead of nerve-
wracking.Successful MongoDB users monitor everything and prepare for

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking The
Datacenter as a Computer book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I
would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!John Fries in aG+

book:It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by
interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the
entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and
realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter
anymoreIt's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize
simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to
warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware;
datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to
deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key

something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one
Ilya Grigorik, Developer Advocate,Make the Web Fastat Google, and author of a
great new book:High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer
should know about networking and web performance. That's a big topic you might
be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed
pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It's like
a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.In case you are not familiar
with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For
years Ilya has been producing excellent content onhis blog and if yousearch

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byZardosht Kasheff, Software Developer atTokutek, a
storage engine company that delivers 21st-Century capabilities to the leading
open source data management platforms.As software developers, we value
abstraction. The simpler the API, the more attractive it becomes. Arguably,
MongoDB's greatest strengths are its elegant API and itsagility, which let
developers simply code.But whenMongoDBruns into scalability problems onbig
data, developers need to peek underneath the covers to understand the
underlying issues and how to fix them. Without understanding, one may end up
with an inefficient solution that costs time and money. For example, one may
shard prematurely, increasing hardware and management costs, when a simpler
replication setup would do. Or, one may increase the size of a replica set
when upgrading to SSDs would suffice.This article showshow to reason about
some big data scalability problemsin an effort to find efficient
solutions.Defining the IssuesFirst, l</p><p>6 0.95414597 <a title="1606-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-21-What_CDN_would_you_recommend%3F.html">576 high scalability-2009-04-21-What CDN would you recommend?</a></p>

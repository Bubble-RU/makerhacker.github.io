<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip

scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.Have we reached the end
of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The
End of" headlines. We've reachedThe End of Historybecause the Western liberal
democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the
final form of human government." We've reachedThe End of Sciencebecause of the
"fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions."
We've even reachedThe End of Theorybecause all answers can be found in the
continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're
atThe End of the World?Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began
to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?For a while I thought
this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is
because of the slow down of potential articles at
myHighScalability.comwebsite,</p><p>3 0.87577653 <a title="1576-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-12-4_Strategies_for_Punching_Down_Traffic_Spikes.html">1282 high scalability-2012-07-12-4 Strategies for Punching Down Traffic Spikes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Travis Reeder inSpikability - An Application's Ability to Handle Unknown
and/or Inconsistent Load gives four good ways of handling spikey loads:Have
more resources than you'll ever need. Estimate the maximum traffic you'll need
and keep that many servers running. Downside is you are paying for capacity
you aren't using.Disable features during high loads. Reduce load by disabling
features or substituting in lighter weight features. Downside is users to have
access to features.Auto scaling. Launch new servers in response to load.
Downsides are it's complicated to setup and slow to respond. Random spikes
will cause cycling of instances going up and down.Use message queues. Queues
soak up work requests during traffic spikes. More servers can be started to
process work from the queue. Resources aren't wasted and features are
disabled. Downside is increased latency.</p><p>4 0.87127578 <a title="1576-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-29-Second_Hand_Seizure_%3A_A_New_Cause_of_Site_Death.html">1070 high scalability-2011-06-29-Second Hand Seizure : A New Cause of Site Death</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Like a digital SWAT team that implodes the wrong door on a raid, the FBI
seized multiple racks of computers from DigitalOne, theseracks host websites
from many clients that just happened to be in the same racks as whomever they
are investigating. Downed sites include Instapaper, Curbed Network,
andPinboard. With thedensity of serversthese days many 1000s of sites could
easily have been effected.Sites like Pinboard were victims by association,
they did not inhale. This is an association sites have no control over. On a
shared hosting service, you have no control over your fellow VM mates. In a
cloud or a managed service, you have no control over which racks your servers
are in. So like second hand smoke, you get the disease by random association.
There's something inherently unfair about that.Acomment by illumin8 shows just
how Darth insidious this process can be:A popular method used by hackers is to
sign up for a virtual server with a stolen credit card. If they are careful

<p>Introduction: Update: Parascale's CTO on what's different about Parascale.Let's say you have
gigglebytes of data to store and you aren't sure you want to use aCDN.
Amazon'sS3doesn't excite you. And you aren't quite ready to join
thegridnation. You want to keep it all in house. Wouldn't it be nice to have
something like theGoogle File Systemyou could use to create a unified file
system out of all your disks sitting on all your nodes?According to Robin
Harris, a.k.aStorageMojo(a great blog BTW), you can now have your own
GFS:Parascale launches Google-like storage software.Parascalecalls their
softwate a Virtual Storage Network (VSN). It "aggregates disks across
commodity Linux x86 servers to deliver petabyte-scale file storage. With
features such as automated, transparent file replication and file migration,
Parascale eliminates storage hotspots and delivers massive read/write
bandwidth." Why should you care?I don't know about you, but the "storage
problem" is one the most frustrating parts of buildin</p><p>6 0.86210239 <a title="1576-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-The_7_Stages_of_Scaling_Web_Apps.html">391 high scalability-2008-09-23-The 7 Stages of Scaling Web Apps</a></p>

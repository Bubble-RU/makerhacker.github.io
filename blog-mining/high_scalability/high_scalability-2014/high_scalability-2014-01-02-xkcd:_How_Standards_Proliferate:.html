<p>Introduction: Professor Lance Fortnow, in his blog post Drowning in Data, says complexity
has taught him this lesson:When storage is expensive, it is cheaper to
recompute what you've already computed. And that's the world we now live in:
Storage is pretty cheap but data acquisition and computation are even
cheaper.Jouni, one of the commenters, thinks the opposite is true:storage is
cheap, but computation is expensive. When you are dealing with massive data,
the size of the data set is very often determined by the amount of computing
power available for a certain price.With such data, a linear-time algorithm
takes O(1) seconds to finish, while a quadratic-time algorithm requires O(n)
seconds. But as computing power increases exponentially over time, the
quadratic algorithm gets exponentially slower.For me it's not a matter of
which is true, both positions can be true, but what's interesting is to think
that storage and computation are in some cases fungible. Your architecture can
decide which tradeof</p><p>3 0.11874673 <a title="1571-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-14-I%2C_Cloud.html">919 high scalability-2010-10-14-I, Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Every time a technological innovation has spurred automation - since the time
of Henry Ford right up to a minute ago - someone has claimed that machines
will displace human beings. But the rainbow and unicorn dream attributed to
business stakeholders everywhere, i.e. the elimination of IT, is just that - a
dream. It isn't realistic and in fact it's downright silly to think that
systems that only a few years ago were unable to automatically scale up and
scale down will suddenly be able to perform the complex analysis required of
IT to keep the business running.The rare reports of the elimination of IT
staff due tocloud computingand automation are highlighted in the news because
they evoke visceral reactions in technologists everywhere and, to be honest,
they get the click counts rising. But thejury remains out on this oneand in
fact many postulate that it is not a reduction in staff that will occur, but
atransformationof staff, which may eliminate some old timey positions (think

<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about
building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in
terms of scalability. Thepaperdescribes a new technology by the startup
company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction
of the cost of earlier possibilities.Complete Genomics is building the world's
largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey,
outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.By 2010,
their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30
petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.Do

<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word
alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and
the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world
is:the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more
dough for many more cookies. It’s the difference between making enough dough
in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.Hey, pretty close to
the website notion. Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be
tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed
to do (quoted from the article):Be Patient- When making large batches of
cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.Use
Fresh Ingredients- This is always an important thing to keep in mind.Don’t use
as much leavening- When you’re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember
to scale down the amount of baking powder that you use.Watch the spice- As a

<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder Steve
Wozniakand Atari founderNolan Bushnell, had a chance to sit down for a chat at
the C2SVconference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can
decide futures.  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability  Steve talked about
how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years
of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was
expandable. It hadeight expansion slotsand the RAM was also expandable
(starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility
orexpansion capabilities. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the
Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak
won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They
published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer
community. So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh all failed,

an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>3 0.85301292 <a title="1571-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex_Architecture.html">258 high scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Anatomy of a crash in a new part of Yandex written in Django. Writing
to a magic session variable caused an unexpected write into an InnoDB database
on every request. Writes took 6-7 seconds because of index rebuilding. Lots of
useful details on the sizing of their system, what went wrong, and how they
fixed it.Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their
search index. We only know a few fun facts about how they do things, nothing
at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I
thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with
Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:3.5 billion pages in the search
index.Over several thousand servers.35 million searches a day.Several data
centers around Russia.Two-layer architecture.The database is split in pieces
and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database
servers and brings it together for the user.Languages used: c++, perl, some
java.FreeBSD</p><p>4 0.84431183 <a title="1571-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-26-Product%3A_HyperGraphDB_-_A_Graph_Database.html">766 high scalability-2010-01-26-Product: HyperGraphDB - A Graph Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the success ofNeo4jas a graph database in the NoSQL revolution, it's
interesting to see another graph database,HyperGraphDB, in the mix. Their
quick blurb on HyperGraphDB says it is a:general purpose, extensible,
portable, distributed, embeddable, open-source data storage mechanism. It is a
graph database designed specifically for artificial intelligence and semantic
web projects, it can also be used as an embedded object-oriented database for
projects of all sizes.From theNoSQL Archivethe summary on HyperGraphDB is:
API:Java(and Java Langs), Written in:Java,  Query Method:Javaor P2P,
Replication:P2P, Concurrency:STM, Misc: Open-Source, Especially for AI and
Semantic Web.So it has some interesting features, like software transactional
memory andP2P  for data distribution, but I found that my first and most
obvious question was not answered: what the heck is ahypergraphand why do I
care? Buried in the tutorial was:A HyperGraphDB database is a generalized
graph of entities. The gene</p><p>5 0.82782441 <a title="1571-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-14-A_TripAdvisor_Short.html">1059 high scalability-2011-06-14-A TripAdvisor Short</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes I get article proposals and then there's no follow up. Though these
TripAdvisor data points are from 2010, I thought them worth sharing:Our site
serves in excess of 100M dynamically generated page view a day (all media and
static content goes through CDN), and we do this with about 100 machines, no
single point of failure, supported by distributed service architecture that
that responds to over 2B requests a day, and a data warehouse of over 20TB
that is used to drive email campaigns, SEM, and general reporting. We are a
Linux/Java/Apache/Tomcat/Postgres/Lucene shop, and have built our own
distributed computing architecture. We also maintain duplicate data centers
(one active, one standby) for redundancy and maintenance purposes.Too bad, it
sounds like it would have been a good article.Related Articles A new twist on

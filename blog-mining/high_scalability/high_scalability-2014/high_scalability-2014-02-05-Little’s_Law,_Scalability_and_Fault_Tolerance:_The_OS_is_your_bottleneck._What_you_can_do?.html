a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a

limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and

many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 The number of concurrent requests that can fit inRAMdepends on how much memory each request consumes, but assuming we can keep this to well below1MB, and given the low cost ofRAM, this number is probably well over 1 million, and certainly over several hundreds-of-thousands. [sent-58, score-0.582]
</p><p>2 So the number of concurrent request we can handle is also limited by the number of threads theOScan handle. [sent-67, score-0.663]
</p><p>3 Allowing the software to spawn thread willy-nilly may bring our application to its knees, so we usually set a hard limit on the number of threads we let the application spawn. [sent-75, score-0.516]
</p><p>4 Since we call them sequentially (for the time being) our web service's request processing time, or processing latency, is 1 second. [sent-83, score-0.38]
</p><p>5 This can bring our latency back to under 1 second, and our request handling capacity back to 2000 requests per second even in the event of a failure, at the cost of added complexity. [sent-115, score-0.525]
</p><p>6 4000 requests per second is the best we can do, and it might be much worse than that if we allow latency greater than 500ms for any of the micro services. [sent-150, score-0.402]
</p><p>7 While the calls tofooandbarare submitted asynchronously and their callbacks can be executed at any time and any order (once they complete), we can still safely increment thefailuresandcompletedvariables, because whenever the callbacks run, they will all run on the same thread - never concurrently. [sent-187, score-0.571]
</p><p>8 In practice, the functional style is callback-based, but it usually contains rigorous mechanisms for combining callbacks, which, once you learn them, can make your code much more methodic. [sent-213, score-0.384]
</p><p>9 In addition, because the callbacks are not executed in the same thread as the original request handler (or the same thread as one another) we cannot use any library functions that rely onThreadLocalstate. [sent-219, score-0.518]
</p><p>10 We're no longer using threads to guide the flow of our code and delineate requests, soLis no longer dominated by theOS's scheduling capacity. [sent-225, score-0.397]
</p><p>11 The circuit-breakers and the functional programming style were requiredbecause threads are expensive. [sent-237, score-0.524]
</p><p>12 Some languages, most notably Erlang and Go, provide lightweight threads (processes in Erlang; goroutines in Go). [sent-239, score-0.419]
</p><p>13 The runtime can often do a far better job than theOSat scheduling those lightweight threads because it knows more about their purpose. [sent-242, score-0.484]
</p><p>14 The runtime scheduler usually employs what is known as M:N scheduling, where M lightweight threads are mapped onto NOSthreads, with M » N. [sent-244, score-0.491]
</p><p>15 Just like anything else, lightweight threads aren't magic, and they have their own tradeoffs. [sent-245, score-0.419]
</p><p>16 Their main problem is that all blocking function calls you issue on a lightweight thread must be integrated with the scheduler. [sent-246, score-0.399]
</p><p>17 So let's see how we can re-write our original example to be scalable and fault-tolerant, this time using lightweight threads via Comsat:import. [sent-252, score-0.419]
</p><p>18 Fibers are cheap, and we can handle hundreds-of-thousands of them, or even millions, at once (we might still want to use a library like Hystrix to prevent an unbounded number of fibers from piling up, but even without it our server can recover gracefully from a short-term failure). [sent-291, score-0.425]
</p><p>19 To maintain scalability and fault tolerance you must work around this limitation by either forgoing the simple thread-per-request model and adopting a functional programming style, or by using a language or a library that provides lightweight threads for your platform. [sent-313, score-0.56]
</p><p>20 If you're developing for theJVM,Quasargives you lightweight threads (fibers), andComsatgives you fiber-aware implementations to standard Java APIs. [sent-314, score-0.419]

<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process
level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback
models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple
models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to
make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like
work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.But that's not
all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be
composed across threads of control.Your favorite language may not give you
access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there
has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially
for controlling latency variance, so I think it's time to talk about these
kind of issues. When it was do everything in the thread of a web server thread

<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDBis a great follow up
to the idea inHow SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMSthat more programming is the
price paid for performance in SimpleDB. It shows how much work and
infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of
SimpleDB.Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you
want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests.
Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to
parallelize. Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a
little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.Parallelization is the
approach taken by Haakon@AWS in his Java code example of how to get the most
out of SimpleDB. You can find the code atIndexing and Querying Amazon S3
Metadata with Amazon SimpleDB. We'll also consider how a back-end service
architecture built on Erlang may be a better fit with cloud computing.breakTwo

<p>Introduction: OK, thisinterview is with meon Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger
idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java
World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them
:-)The interview went an interesting direction, but there's more I'd like add
and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have
popped out at me:Java - It's the platform stupid. Java the language isn't the
big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM,
libraries, and toolsets.Java - It's the community stupid. A lot of creativity
is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability
challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing
Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.The fecundity of
the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our
multi-core future. There's a multi-core crisis going in case you haven't
heard.

<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for

<p>Introduction: Hidden in every computer is a hardware backplane for moving signals around.
Hidden in every application are ways of moving messages around and giving code
CPU time to process them. Unhiding those capabilities and making them first
class facilities for the programmer to control is the idea behind
AppBackplane.This goes directly against the trend of hiding everything from
the programmer and doing it all automagically. Which is great, until it
doesn't work. Then it sucks. And the approach of giving the programmer all the
power also sucks, until it's tuned to work together and performance is
incredible even under increasing loads. Then it's great.These are two
different curves going in opposite directions. You need to decide for your
application which curve you need to be on.AppBackplane is an example framework
supporting the multiple application architectures we talked about inBeyond
Threads And Callbacks. It provides a scheduling system that supports
continuous and high loads, meets crit</p><p>5 0.83358395 <a title="1591-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-10-Hitting_300_SimbleDB_Requests_Per_Second_on_a_Small_EC2_Instance.html">317 high scalability-2008-05-10-Hitting 300 SimbleDB Requests Per Second on a Small EC2 Instance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDBis a great follow up
to the idea inHow SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMSthat more programming is the
price paid for performance in SimpleDB. It shows how much work and
infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of
SimpleDB.Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you
want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests.
Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to
parallelize. Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a
little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.Parallelization is the
approach taken by Haakon@AWS in his Java code example of how to get the most
out of SimpleDB. You can find the code atIndexing and Querying Amazon S3
Metadata with Amazon SimpleDB. We'll also consider how a back-end service
architecture built on Erlang may be a better fit with cloud computing.breakTwo

<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>2 0.99335003 <a title="1591-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_3%2C_2010.html">967 high scalability-2011-01-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 3, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure...Quotable Quotes@hofmanndavid:
Performance and scalability anxiety makes developers want to catch the flying
butterflies@tivrfoa:"Scalability solutions aren't magic. They involve
partitioning, indexing and replication." Twitter engineerAlan Perlis: Fools
ignore complexity; pragmatists suffer it; experts avoid it; geniuses remove
it.CIO update: Post-mortem on the Skype outage. Interesting tale of a
cascading collapse in complex, distributed, interactive systems. For more
background see the highly illuminating Explaining Supernodes by Dan
York.RethinkDB and SSD Databases. SSD was not a revolution by Kevin Burton.

exciting, it wasn't as revolutionary in 2010 as I would have liked to have

<p>Introduction: I had a false beliefI thought I came here to stayWe're all just visitingAll
just breaking like wavesThe oceans made me, but who came up with me?Push me,
pull me, push me, or pull me out .So true Perl Jam(Push me Pull me lyrics), so
true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes.
Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from
servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.breakTo pull
events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server.
This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a
list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has
changed and makes those changes available to you. Knowing what has changed can
be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very
complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state
on what I client still needs to see.Polling is heavy man. Imagine all your

<p>Introduction: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic
is written by UC Berkeley's Joseph Hellersteinfor a keynote speech he gave at
PODS. The video version of the talk is here. You may have heard about Mr.
Hellerstein through theBerkeley Orders Of Magnitude project (BOOM), whose
purpose is to help people build systems that are OOM (orders of magnitude)
bigger than are building today, with OOM less effort than traditional
programming methodologies. A noble goal which may be why BOOM was rated as a
top 10 emerging technology for 2010 byMIT Technology Review. Quite an
honor.The motivation for the talk is a familiar one: it's a dark period for
computer programming and if we don't learn how to write parallel programs the
children of Moore's law will destroy us all. We have more and more processors,
yet we are stuck on figuring out how the average programmer can exploit them.
The BOOM solution is the Bloom language which is based onDedalus: Dedalus is a

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post derived from an email conversation withRussell Sullivan,
a computer architect and creator ofAlchemy Database,A Hybrid RDBMS/NOSQL-
Datastore.Russell (AKA Jak Sprats) has been pondering, considering, and
implementing distributed databases for many years. In a recent email
conversation he shared 44 of the lessons he has learned from developing the
infrastructure for high performance / highly scalable systems. Some are well
known, some are debatable, and some obviously result from a deep experience
that is worth learning from:There are maybe 20 classic bottlenecks (CPU, NIC
overload, memory fragmentation, disk seeks, swap, thread deadlock, packet
loss, etc.), have a basic understanding of them, because each is a dark
tunnel, and you need a specialised flashlight for each.The true style of
scalable architecture is rooted in the nature of bottlenecks. I always talk
aboutcommutative operationson a sharded relational model, and I figure if that

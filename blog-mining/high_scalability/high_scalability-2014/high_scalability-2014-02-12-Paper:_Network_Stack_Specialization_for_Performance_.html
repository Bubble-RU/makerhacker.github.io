<p>Introduction: You program in a dynamic language, that runs on a JVM, that runs on a OS designed  40 years ago  for a completely different purpose, that runs on virtualized hardware. Does this make sense? We've talked about this idea before in  Machine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting The Cloud From Scratch , where the vision is to treat  cloud virtual hardware as a compiler target, and converting high-level language source code directly into kernels that run on it. 
 
As new technologies evolve the friction created by our old tool chains and architecture models becomes ever more obvious. Take, for example, what a  team  at  UCSD  is releasing: a  phase-change memory prototype   -  a   solid state storage device that provides performance thousands of times faster than a conventional hard drive and up to seven times faster than current state-of-the-art solid-state drives (SSDs).  However, PCM has access latencies several times slower than DRAM.

Update 4 :  Nginx better than Pound for load balancing.  Pound spikes at 80% CPU, Nginx uses 3% and is easier to understand and better documented.

<p>Introduction: The world of scalable databases is not a simple one. They come in every race, creed, and color. Rick Cattell has brought some harmony to that world by publishing  High Performance Scalable Data Stores , a nicely detailed one stop shop paper comparing scalable databases soley on the content of their character. Ironically, the first step in that evaluation is dividing the world into four groups:
  
 Key-value stores: Redis, Scalaris, Voldmort, and Riak. 
 Document stores: Couch DB, MongoDB, and SimpleDB. 
 Record stores: BigTable, HBase, HyperTable, and Cassandra. 
 Scalable RDBMSs: MySQL Cluster, ScaleDB, Drizzle, and VoltDB. 
  
The paper describes each system and then compares them on the dimensions of Concurrency Control, Data Storage Replication, Transaction Model, General Comments, Maturity, K-hits, License Language.
 
And the winner is: there are no winners. Yet. Rick concludes by pointing to a great convergence:

<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:  Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework  by  Luigi Rizzo . As commodity networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen?

 


Abstract:

 

Today 10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the design of device drivers and network stacks.


The netmap framework is a promising step in this direction.

So that's why the authors started with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."
 
The result: MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between  29% (for long connections)  and  582% (for short connections) . MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed version of  memcached between 15% and 320% . For a workload based on real-world HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of  nginx by 75% .

<p>Introduction: You program in a dynamic language, that runs on a JVM, that runs on a OS designed  40 years ago  for a completely different purpose, that runs on virtualized hardware. Does this make sense? We've talked about this idea before in  Machine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting The Cloud From Scratch , where the vision is to treat  cloud virtual hardware as a compiler target, and converting high-level language source code directly into kernels that run on it. 
 
As new technologies evolve the friction created by our old tool chains and architecture models becomes ever more obvious. Take, for example, what a  team  at  UCSD  is releasing: a  phase-change memory prototype   -  a   solid state storage device that provides performance thousands of times faster than a conventional hard drive and up to seven times faster than current state-of-the-art solid-state drives (SSDs).  However, PCM has access latencies several times slower than DRAM.
 
This technology has obvious mind blowing implications, but an</p><p>5 0.74070543 <a title="1594-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-07-It%27s_a_VM_Wasteland_-_A_Near_Optimal_Packing_of_VMs_to_Machines_Reduces_TCO_by_22%25.html">1419 high scalability-2013-03-07-It's a VM Wasteland - A Near Optimal Packing of VMs to Machines Reduces TCO by 22%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation  we learn some shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):
  
  Average server utilization in many data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.  
 Surely that's just for old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade. 
  
It's a VM wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same server.
 
It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithm</p><p>6 0.73147845 <a title="1594-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-24-A_Scalable%2C_Commodity_Data_Center_Network_Architecture.html">371 high scalability-2008-08-24-A Scalable, Commodity Data Center Network Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joel Spolsky and Jeff   Atwood are  raising VC money  for    StackOverflow.  This is interesting for three reasons: 1) Joel has always seemed like a keep it small and grow organically type of guy, so this is a big step in a different direction. 2) It means they think there's a very big market in the Q&A; space and they mean to capture as much as the market as possible. 3) Most importantly for this blog, Joel gives some good advice on when to stay fresh and local and when it's time to jump for the brass ring, scale up your ambition, and go for VC money. Please see  Joel's blog  post for the details, but here's when to go VC:
  
 There’s a land grab going on. 
 There is a provable concept that’s repeatable. 
 The business itself could benefit from the publicity. 
 The investor will add substantial value to the business. 
 The business can potentially have a big exit or become a large, publically traded company. 
 The founders are not in it for their own personal aggrandizement.

<p>Introduction: In the scalability is specialization department here is an interesting paper presented at  HotNets '13  on high performance networking:  Network Stack Specialization for Performance .
 
The idea is generalizing a service so it fits in the kernel comes at a high performance cost. So move TCP into user space.  The result is a web server with ~3.5x the throughput of Nginx "while experiencing low CPU utilization, linear scaling on multicore systems, and saturating current NIC hardware."
 
Here's a good description of the paper published  on Layer 9 :
  Traditionally, servers and OSes have been built to be general purpose. However now we have a high degree of specialization. In fact, in a big web service, you might have thousands of machines dedicated to one function. Therefore, there's scope for specialization. This paper looks at a specific opportunity in that space. Network stacks today are good for high throughput with large transfers, but not small files (which are common in web browsi</p><p>3 0.92096633 <a title="1594-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-25-Strategy%3A_Rule_of_3_Admins_to_Save_Your_Sanity.html">830 high scalability-2010-05-25-Strategy: Rule of 3 Admins to Save Your Sanity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The idea came up in this Hacker News  thread , commenting on a 37signals interview, that having three system administrators is the minimum optimal number of admins. Everyone wants to lower their costs by having each admin administer a lot of machines. The problem is when you have fewer than three admins you can never get a break from the constant corrosive pressure of always being on call. When every moment of your life you are dreading the next emergency, it eats at you. Having three admins solves that problem. With three admins you can:
  
 Go on a real vacation. The two remaining admins can switch off being on call. 
 Not be on call all the time. 
  
A larger shop will naturally have more admins so it's not as big an issue, but at smaller shops trying to minimize head count, carrying three admins (or people in those roles) might be something to consider.</p><p>4 0.90308785 <a title="1594-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-04-Jim_Starkey_is_Creating_a_Brave_New_World_by_Rethinking_Databases_for_the_Cloud.html">1092 high scalability-2011-08-04-Jim Starkey is Creating a Brave New World by Rethinking Databases for the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey , founder of  NuoDB , in this  thread  on the Cloud Computing group, delivers a  masterful post  on why he thinks the relational model is the best overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave new lock free world.... 
 
I'll  [Jim Starkey]  go into more detail later in the post for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the s</p><p>5 0.88595057 <a title="1594-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-22-Paper%3A_On_Delivering_Embarrassingly_Distributed_Cloud_Services.html">387 high scalability-2008-09-22-Paper: On Delivering Embarrassingly Distributed Cloud Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we scale datacenters? Should we build a few mammoth million machine datacenters or many smaller micro datacenters? Intuitively we usually go with a bigger is better economies of scale type argument, but it may not be so. What works for Walmart may not work for White Box World. Mega datacenters may actually exhibit diseconomies of scale. It may be better to run applications over many distributed  micro datacenters instead of one large one.  This paper by Ken Church, Albert Greenberg, and James Hamilton, all from Microsoft, takes a look at the different issues and concludes:
   Putting it all together, the micro model offers a design point with attractive performance, reliability, scale and cost. Given how much the industry is currently investing in the mega model, the industry would do well to consider the micro alternative.

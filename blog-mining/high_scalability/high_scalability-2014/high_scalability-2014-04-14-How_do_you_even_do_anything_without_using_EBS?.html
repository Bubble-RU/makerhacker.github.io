<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.How do you scale anAWS(Amazon Web Services) infrastructure?
This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can
use to make the most of Amazon's dynamic approach, and the architectural model
you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.I base my report on my
experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming
(Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS
(Geographic Information System). It's true that my experience in gaming
(IsCool, The Game) is currently the most representative in terms of
scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU - daily active
users - at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my
experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different
view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability
and data management. I will therefore</p><p>3 0.3176496 <a title="1631-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-21-5_Scalability_Poisons_and_3_Cloud_Scalability_Antidotes.html">1121 high scalability-2011-09-21-5 Scalability Poisons and 3 Cloud Scalability Antidotes</a></p>

remains...cloudy.I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes

<p>Introduction: Amazon has a very will written account of their 8/8/2011 downtime:Summary of
the Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon RDS Service Event in the EU West
Region. Power failed, backup generators failed to kick in, there weren't
enough resources for EBS volumes to recover, API servers where overwhelmed, a
DNS failure caused failovers to alternate availability zones to fail, a double
fault occurred as the power event interrupted the repair of a different bug.
All kind of typical stuff that just seems to happen.Considering the previous
outage, the big question for programmers is: what does this mean? What does it
mean for how systems should be structured? Have we learned something that
can't be unlearned?The Amazon post has lots of good insights into how EBS and
RDS work, plus lessons learned. The short of the problem is large + complex =
high probability of failure. The immediate fixes are adding more resources,
more redundancy, more isolation between components, more automation, reduce

Yes, it Delivers More Consistent and Higher Performance IO</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with theirProvisioned IOPSfor RDS,
EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn
a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model.
You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous
cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used.
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?Rodrigo
Campos put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he
describes inIOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012.The
result?Yes, AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and
Higher Performance IO:It is clear that the provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer
a huge performance upgrade when compared to the non-optimized EBS volumes, but
as data has to be spread among more underlying disks or systems, it seems that
the volume is increasingly more susceptible to performance

<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirmingCuriosity landing on
Mars, then this paper,High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for
Main-Memory Databases, has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an
excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead
on in-memory datastructures:A database system optimized for in-memory storage
can support much higher transaction rates than current systems. However,
standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to the high
transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two
efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory
databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from
updates but differ in how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is
pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions never block
during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure
correct serializatio</p><p>2 0.97468996 <a title="1631-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-22-It%27s_the_Fraking_IOPS_-_1_SSD_is_44%2C000_IOPS%2C_Hard_Drive_is_180.html">1066 high scalability-2011-06-22-It's the Fraking IOPS - 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS, Hard Drive is 180</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

<p>Introduction: This is a question everyone must struggle with when building out their
datacenter. Storage choices are always the ones I have the least confidence
in. David Marks in his blogYou Can Change It Later!asks the questionShould I
get a SAN to scale my site architecture?and answers no. A better solution is
to use commodity hardware, directly attach storage on servers, and partition
across servers to scale and for greater availability.David's reasoning is
interesting:A SAN creates a SPOF (single point of failure) that is dependent
on a vendor to fly and fix when there's a problem. This can lead to long down
times during this outage you have no access to your data at all.Using easily
available commodity hardware minimizes risks to your company, it's not just
about saving money. Zooming over to Fry's to buy emergency equipment provides
the kind of agility startups need in order to respond quickly to ever changing
situations.It's hard to beat the power and flexibility (backups, easy to add

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAli Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead atPlanForCloud. The
original article was publishedon their site. With 29 cloud price reductions I
thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change
compared to an articlewe published last year. The result is surprisingly
little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances havenot dropped
as fastas for other other instances types.Over the last year and a half,we
counted 29 price reductionsin cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute
Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct
effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is
that effect on the bottom line?Last year I wrote aboutcloud cost forecasts for
TripAdvisor and Pinterest.TripAdvisor was experimenting with AWSand attempted
to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of its live site,
andPinterest was growing massively on AWS. In the wake of the cloud providers'

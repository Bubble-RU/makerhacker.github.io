[sent-2, score-0.318]
</p><p>2 I am currently involved in architecting a system based around Microservices, and whilst the individual services are very simple, a lot of complexity exists at a higher level level in terms of managing these services and orchestrating business processes throughout them. [sent-8, score-0.531]
</p><p>3 Where a monolithic application might have been deployed to a small application server cluster, you now have tens of separate services to build, test, deploy and run, potentially in polyglot languages and environments. [sent-12, score-0.754]
</p><p>4 All of these services potentially need clustering for failover and resilience, turning your single monolithic system into, say, 20 services consisting of 40-60 processes after we've added resilience. [sent-13, score-0.689]
</p><p>5 Throw in load balancers and messaging layers for plumbing between the services and the estate starts to become pretty large when compared to that single monolithic application that delivered the equivalent business functionality! [sent-14, score-0.568]
</p><p>6 Sure, we can avoid some of these changes with backwards compatibility approaches, but you often find that a business driven requirements prohibit staged releases anyway. [sent-33, score-0.297]
</p><p>7 Releasing a new product line or an externally mandated regulatory change for instance can force our hand to release lots of services together. [sent-34, score-0.279]
</p><p>8 This represents additional release risk over the alternative monolithic application due to the integration points. [sent-35, score-0.408]
</p><p>9 If we let collaborating services move ahead and become out of sync, perhaps in a canary releasing style, the effects of changing message formats can become very hard to visualise. [sent-36, score-0.53]
</p><p>10 That does however introduce more potentially synchronous coupling into the system, so is not a decision we would take lightly. [sent-41, score-0.269]
</p><p>11 We could duplicate the effort, adding the tax calculation into all of the services that need it. [sent-42, score-0.25]
</p><p>12 This can be useful, but it won't always work in a polyglot environment and introduces coupling which may mean that services have to be released in parallel to maintain the implicit interface between them. [sent-45, score-0.347]
</p><p>13 It seems to me that all three of these options are sub-optimal as opposed to writing the piece of code once and making it available throughout the monolithic application. [sent-47, score-0.281]
</p><p>14 Backwards compatibility and graceful degradation are nice properties to have that we might not have implemented within the monolithic alternative, helping keep the system up and more highly available than the monolithic application would be. [sent-55, score-0.704]
</p><p>15 Distributed systems are an order of magnitude more difficult to develop and test against, so again the bar is raised vs building that unsexy monolithic application. [sent-57, score-0.468]
</p><p>16 Related to the abovei point, systems built in the Microservices style are likely to be much more asynchronous than monolithic applications, leaning on messaging and parallelism to deliver their functionality. [sent-59, score-0.584]
</p><p>17 Testability ChallengesWith so many services all evolving at different paces and different services rolling out canary releases internally, it can be difficult to recreate environments in a consistent way for either manual or automated testing. [sent-62, score-0.582]
</p><p>18 When we add in asynchronicity and dynamic message loads, it becomes much harder to test systems built in this style and gain confidence in the set of services that we are about to release into production. [sent-63, score-0.773]
</p><p>19 We can test the individual service, but in this dynamic environment, very subtle behaviours can emerge from the interactions of the services which are hard to visualise and speculate on, let alone comprehensively test for. [sent-64, score-0.305]
</p><p>20 I am a big believer in this approach - lowing the barriers to release and leaning continuous delivery in order to speed up lean delivery. [sent-66, score-0.413]

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

What you can do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>6 0.12361046 <a title="1628-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-27-TripAdvisor_Architecture_-_40M_Visitors%2C_200M_Dynamic_Page_Views%2C_30TB_Data.html">1068 high scalability-2011-06-27-TripAdvisor Architecture - 40M Visitors, 200M Dynamic Page Views, 30TB Data</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Unlike many of the existing Platforms, in this second-generation phase, its
not going to be enough to package and bundle different individual middleware
services and products (Web Containers, Messaging, Data, Monitoring, Automation
and Control, Provisioning) and brand them under the same name to make them
look as one. (Fusion? Fabric? A rose is a rose by any other name - and in this
case, it's not a rose.)The second-generation PaaS needs to come with a
holistic approach that couples all those things together and provide a
complete holistic experience. By that I mean that if I add a machine into
cluster, I need to see that as an increase in capacity on my entire
application stack, the monitoring system needs to discover that new machine
and start monitoring it without any configuration setup, the load-balancer
need to add it to its pool and so forth.Our challenge as technologists would
be to move from our current siloed comfort zone. That applies not just to the
way we design our applic</p><p>4 0.82895368 <a title="1628-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAndy Gelfond, VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy
has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the
earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and
operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site.
There's an update for this article atAn Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run
On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment. For TripAdvisor, scalability is woven into
our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture,
development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture
and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a
scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and
deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a
culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and
effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable consumer

<p>Introduction: Are long VM instance spin-up times in the cloud costing you money? That's the
question that immediately came to mind whenJames Urquhart, in an interview at
the Stata Conference, made this thought provoking comment:the faster you can
get the resources into the hands of the people who use them, the more money
you save overall.One of the many super powers of the cloud iselasticity, the
ability to dynamically acquire and release resources in response to demand.
But like any good superhero, their strength must also form the basis of a not
quite fatal flaw. Years and years of angsty episodes are usually required to
explore this contradiction.In the case of the cloud, the weakness reveals
itself in slow VM spin-up times. Spinning up a VM in EC2 can take a little as
1-3 minutes, or can average 5-10 minutes, or it can take much longer if
there's heavy usage in your availability zone. EC2 is not alone. A common
complaint about Google App Engine is thecold-start problem. When a request

What you can do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>3 0.99625987 <a title="1628-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-10-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_10%2C_2012.html">1190 high scalability-2012-02-10-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 10, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post derived from an email conversation withRussell Sullivan,
a computer architect and creator ofAlchemy Database,A Hybrid RDBMS/NOSQL-
Datastore.Russell (AKA Jak Sprats) has been pondering, considering, and
implementing distributed databases for many years. In a recent email
conversation he shared 44 of the lessons he has learned from developing the
infrastructure for high performance / highly scalable systems. Some are well
known, some are debatable, and some obviously result from a deep experience
that is worth learning from:There are maybe 20 classic bottlenecks (CPU, NIC
overload, memory fragmentation, disk seeks, swap, thread deadlock, packet
loss, etc.), have a basic understanding of them, because each is a dark
tunnel, and you need a specialised flashlight for each.The true style of
scalable architecture is rooted in the nature of bottlenecks. I always talk
aboutcommutative operationson a sharded relational model, and I figure if that
is in place, whatever is bu</p><p>5 0.99477845 <a title="1628-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling_Twitter%3A_Making_Twitter_10000_Percent_Faster.html">639 high scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling Twitter: Making Twitter 10000 Percent Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why

<p>Introduction: InStack Overflow Architecture Update - Now At 95 Million Page Views A Month, a
commenter expressed surprise about Stack Overflow's backup strategy: Backup is
to disk for fast retrieval and to tape for historical archiving.The comment
was:Really? People still do this? I know some organizations invested a
tremendous amount in automated, robotic tape backup, but seriously, a site
founded in 2008 is backing up to tape?The Case of the Missing Gmail AccountsI
admit that I was surprised at this strategy too. In this age of copying data
to disk three times for safety, I also wondered if tape backups were still
necessary? Then, like in a movie, an event happened that made sense of
everything, Google suffered the quintessential #firstworldproblem, gmail
accounts went missing! Queue emphatic music. And what's more they were taking
a long time to come back. There was a palpable fear in the land that email
accounts might never be restored. Think about that. They might never be
restored...The Hero:</p><p>4 0.14402322 <a title="1588-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

normative rules of an idealized world in algorithms. Second those algorithms

fun example is the story of Ed Bolian's Record-Breaking Drive. Ed raced from
New York to L.A. at speeds of up to 158 mph, "breaking countless laws - and
the previous record, by more than two hours." His approach is one that any
nerd would love. He had three radar detectors, two laser jammers, two nav
systems, a CB radio, a scanner, two iPhones and two iPads running applications
like Waze, lookouts in the back seat scanning for cops, and someone scouting
ahead. Awesome! For the moral of the story, they were going so fast Ed said

million concurrent users: SkypeKey to making sensors ubiquitous is getting the
BOM cost down. Here's a dream way of making that happen: Bye-Bye Batteries:
Radio Waves as a Low-Power Source. "Silicon technology has advanced to the
point where even tiny amounts of energy can do useful work." No batteries ==
cheaper, smaller products == ubiquity.The MySQL "swap insanity" problem and
the effects of the NUMA architecture. Jeremy Cole with a spectacular article
on the differences between NUMA and SMP/UMA systems and the mostly
unsatisfactory tricks required to get MySQL to perform on NUMA systems. There
are really two issues: the evils of an OS controlled swap and NUMA performance
effects due to a single node (in the NUMA sense) running out of memory. This
is the kind of stuff you only see when you push your systems to the edge.

Engineering, describes the architecture used by the popular game named Second
Life. Ian presents how the architecture was at its debut and how it evolved
over years as users and features have been added.Second Lifeis a 3-D virtual
world created by its Residents. Virtual Worlds are expected to be more and
more popular on the internet so their architecture might be of interest.
Especially important is the appearance of open virtual worlds or

below. If you agree with a statement then you "take it"; if you disagree then
you "leave it." And if you are so moved please write a convincing comment as
to why. Got it?Snowden vs. the State.Snowden represents true the spirit of
freedom and is not a threat to all we hold dear.Walled Garden vs. Federated
Freedom.The Walled Garden has won the last decade. The cycle of life will
return the balance and federated services will once again win the day.Mobile +
messaging vs. Le Web.Mobile + messaging is eating search and the web, changing
the way things are found, discovered, and bought.Fiat vs.

<p>Introduction: John McCutchan,after a long career spent working on the Linux kernel and being
hired out as a code optimization guru, joined Google's Dart team. A curious
hire until you watch Bringing SIMD to the Web via Dart, where John makes a
programmer accessible explanation of why he likes Dart: performance,
performance, performance.Dartis an open-source Web programming
languagedeveloped by Google. The motivation for Dart is twofold: provide a
language capable of scaling up to the complex web applications that are
becoming the norm. Think Gmail. And provide a single language capable of
working on both the client and server. Towards those ends Dart is a complete
language, full tool environment, and provides an advanced Web UI framework for
building web applications at a high level of abstraction.Why isn't JavaScript
good enough? The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts
crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause web
apps to lose out to mobile apps.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.92593384 <a title="1588-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-31-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_31st%2C_2014.html">1588 high scalability-2014-01-31-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 31st, 2014</a></p>

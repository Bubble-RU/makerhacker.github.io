[sent-2, score-0.136]
</p><p>2 Benedict Evans  (paraphrased): A startup 15 years ago raised 10 million dollars, had 100 people, and a million users. [sent-9, score-0.136]
</p><p>3 Alex Pentland : Put another way, social physics is about how human behavior is driven by the exchange of ideas—how people cooperate to discover, select, and learn strategies and coordinate their actions—rather than how markets are driven by the exchange of money. [sent-20, score-0.284]
</p><p>4 By contrast, 4G networks require coordination between the device and the radio tower for each uplink transfer. [sent-24, score-0.282]
</p><p>5 First off, latency aside, and regardless of wireless technology, consider the energy costs of your network transfers! [sent-25, score-0.156]
</p><p>6 Periodic transfers incur high energy overhead due to the need to wake up the radio on each transmission. [sent-26, score-0.345]
</p><p>7 Second, same periodic transfers also incur high uplink coordination overhead - 4G in particular. [sent-27, score-0.465]
</p><p>8 Aggregate your network requests and fire them in one batch: you will reduce energy costs and reduce latency by amortizing scheduling overhead. [sent-29, score-0.156]
</p><p>9 Finding turns neuroanatomy on its head: Researchers present new view of myelin : The fact that it is the most evolved neurons, the ones that have expanded dramatically in humans, suggests that what we're seeing might be the "future. [sent-42, score-0.236]
</p><p>10 " As neuronal diversity increases and the brain needs to process more and more complex information, neurons change the way they use myelin to "achieve" more. [sent-43, score-0.463]
</p><p>11 These long myelin gaps may be needed to increase neuronal communication and synchronize responses across different neurons. [sent-45, score-0.409]
</p><p>12 We have 8 redis instances on each redis box currently, that each serve fundamentally different roles - one for our core cache etc (where "core" here means "not careers"), one for machine-learning, one for pub/sub distribution, etc. [sent-64, score-0.297]
</p><p>13 Cassandra with local disk replaces Oracle/MySQL, SAN, Array, etc; AWS S3 and Google Data Store replace tape for backup/archive; Cloud prices halve every two years; Epic Google and AWS price war (everyone else dies); SSD moves to the memory channel, for even lower latency. [sent-71, score-0.185]
</p><p>14 Key theme is microservices are one of the strategies for satisfying your need for speed to market. [sent-74, score-0.197]
</p><p>15 It uses memory-mapped files, so it has the read performance of a pure in-memory database while still offering the persistence of standard disk-based databases, and is only limited to the size of the virtual address space, (it is not limited to the size of physical RAM). [sent-79, score-0.236]
</p><p>16 The impact: The connection pooling is 600 times faster than the no pooling alternative. [sent-90, score-0.138]
</p><p>17 So don't bet on cheap flash in your pricing models just yet. [sent-95, score-0.19]
</p><p>18 The supply of both flash and hard disk is constrained. [sent-98, score-0.306]
</p><p>19 Thus flash will command a premium over hard disk prices so that the market directs the limited supply of flash to those applications, such as tablets, smartphones, and high-performance servers, where its added value is highest. [sent-99, score-0.618]
</p><p>20 We propose the concept of coordination avoidance as a unifying, underlying principle behind the former and discuss lessons from our recent experiences mitigating the latter. [sent-118, score-0.146]

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

  Mining Experiment: Running 600 Servers for a Year Yields 0.4 Bitcoin . Yes, this is a far superior way of doing things. Chew up the commons for marginal gain. It's like old times. 
  Game designers, forget the sardines and go hunt some whale .  Swrve found : half of free-to-play games’ in-app purchases came from 0.15 percent of players. Only 1.5 percent of players of games in the Swrve network spent any money at all.

<p>Introduction: In   NoSQL: Past, Present, Future    Eric Brewer  has a particularly fine section on explaining the often hard to understand ideas of   BASE   (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent),   ACID   (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability),   CAP   (Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in banking.
    Myth   : Money is important, so banks   must   use transactions to keep money safe and consistent, right? 
    Reality   : Banking transactions are inconsistent, particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over Consistency. 
   Why?   1)  Availability correlates with revenue and consistency generally does not.  2)  Historically there was never an idea of perfect communication so everything was partitioned.

 Clay Shirky: I think one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive, I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of apps, separate from c</p><p>4 0.94634855 <a title="1637-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_24%2C_2012.html">1198 high scalability-2012-02-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 24, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something called   Self Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance   (SCIT).  Botnets  are created when vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks like a  dog chasing its tail ). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a great deal of sense once I thought about it.  With SCIT you stop and restart VM instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window vulnerability)....
   
 This short exposure window means worms and viri do not have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack. A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM</p><p>6 0.94399977 <a title="1637-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy%3A_Efficiently_Geo-referencing_IPs.html">168 high scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy: Efficiently Geo-referencing IPs</a></p>

</p><p>3 Let’s explore why this deal makes more sense for Oculus than it might first appear and the central role scalability plays in the decision making. [sent-21, score-0.109]
</p><p>4 rjd    picks up on this theme on the Oculus side:       The Sony morpheus system is already better than oculus feature wise, with better position tracking, and accessory tracking as well. [sent-25, score-0.861]
</p><p>5 And don't under estimate that, I've read some pretty strong "never again" comments from people using VR headsets and loosing grip of the controls and floundering and/or having to take the headset off to get the controls back into their grips again. [sent-26, score-0.169]
</p><p>6 Essentially without backing they will loose all market capabilities and be relegated to experimental hardware and not a mass market device. [sent-30, score-0.128]
</p><p>7 The only thing that I see changing is that Facebook will be able to help them get it to market sooner. [sent-33, score-0.096]
</p><p>8 Facebook missed on mobile like Microsoft missed on the Internet and has had to spend a lot money getting back in the game. [sent-35, score-0.118]
</p><p>9 This theme emerges out of a    Facebook conference call about acquiring Oculus   . [sent-36, score-0.152]
</p><p>10 You can’t beat Apple by building a better iPhone and you can't beat Google by building a better search. [sent-47, score-0.172]
</p><p>11 You must obsolete the old technology with something disruptive and move customers over to the new thing while the old thing lives on. [sent-48, score-0.098]
</p><p>12 The conference call also mentions scaling marketing and other corporate functions. [sent-73, score-0.08]
</p><p>13 Brendan Iribe,   Oculus CEO, in that same conference call tells the story of the romance between Oculus and Facebook. [sent-76, score-0.08]

</p><p>15 This seems silly to many of us, it's too simple, but when you are at the heart of human interaction you are almost by definition in the modern world in the best position to profit. [sent-82, score-0.098]
</p><p>16 So if you want to focus on social do you rebuild all those social network from scratch? [sent-87, score-0.138]
</p><p>17 Maybe there’s also a little fear that Sony will be better a games so the quicker the diversification into other markets the better? [sent-90, score-0.121]
</p><p>18 We view this as a software and services thing, where if we can make it so that this becomes a network where people can be communicating and buying things and virtual goods, and there might be advertising in the world, but we need to figure that out down the line. [sent-93, score-0.112]
</p><p>19 VR is not just the next social platform, but the most social platform ever: “Virtual reality headsets might someday be used to enjoy a courtside seat at a basketball game, study in a classroom, consult with a doctor face-to-face or shop in a virtual store. [sent-95, score-0.392]

<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: " High Performance at Massive Scale –  Lessons learned at Facebook ". The abstract for the talk is:
  

Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web architectures.

  
There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into  later, but I thought you might want a head start on learning how Facebook handles 30K+ machines,</p><p>4 0.1100942 <a title="1619-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-23-The_Real_News_is_Not_that_Facebook_Serves_Up_1_Trillion_Pages_a_Month%E2%80%A6.html">1123 high scalability-2011-09-23-The Real News is Not that Facebook Serves Up 1 Trillion Pages a Month…</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s some amount of debate whether Facebook  really  crossed over the one trillion page view per month threshold. While one report says it did,  another respected firm says it did not ; that its monthly page views are a mere 467 billion per month.


In the big scheme of things, the discrepancy is somewhat irrelevant, as neither show the  true  load on Facebook’s infrastructure – which is far more impressive a set of numbers than its externally measured “page view” metric.  Mashable reported in “ Facebook Surpasses 1 Trillion Pageviews per Month ” that the social networking giant saw “approximately 870 million unique visitors in June and 860 million in July” and followed up with some per visitor statistics, indicating “each visitor averaged approximately 1,160 page views in July and 40 per visit — enormous by any standard. Time spent on the site was around 25 minutes per user.”


From an architectural standpoint it’s not  just  about the page views. It’s about requests and responses,</p><p>5 0.10991699 <a title="1619-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Hive_-_A_Petabyte_Scale_Data_Warehouse_using_Hadoop.html">624 high scalability-2009-06-10-Hive - A Petabyte Scale Data Warehouse using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post about using Hive and Hadoop for analytics comes straight from Facebook engineers.  Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis and business intelligence applications used by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook products are also based on analytics.   These products range from simple reporting applications like Insights for the Facebook Ad Network, to more advanced kind such as Facebook's Lexicon product.   As a result a flexible infrastructure that caters to the needs of these diverse applications and users and that also scales up in a cost effective manner with the ever increasing amounts of data being generated on Facebook, is critical. Hive and Hadoop are the technologies that we have used to address these requirements at Facebook.

<p>Introduction: Facebook made quite a splash when they released their  native iOS app , not because of their app per se, but because of their conclusion that their  biggest mistake was betting on HTML5 , so they had to go native.
 
As you might imagine this was a bit like telling a Great White Shark that its bark is worse than its bite.  A  common refrain  was Facebook simply had made a bad HTML5 site, not that HTML5 itself is bad, as plenty of other vendors have made slick well performing mobile sites.
 
An interesting and relevant conversation given the rising butt kickery of mobile. But we were lacking details. Now we aren't. If you were wondering just why Facebook ditched HTML5, Tobie Langel in  Perf Feedback - What's slowing down Mobile Facebook , lists out the reasons:
  
  Tooling / Developer APIs . Most importantly, the lack of tooling to track down memory problems.  
  Scrolling performance.  Scrolling must be fast and smooth and full featured. It's not.

<p>Introduction: To celebrate the new year Facebook has  shared the results  of a little end of the year introspection. It has been a fecund year for Facebook:
  
 43,869,800 changed their status to single 
 3,025,791 changed their status to "it's complicated" 
 28,460,516 changed their status to in a relationship 
 5,974,574 changed their status to engaged 
 36,774,801 changes their status to married 
  
If these numbers are simply to large to grasp, it doesn't get any better when you look at happens in a mere 20 minutes:

<p>Introduction: Robert Johnson,   a director of engineering at Facebook, celebrated Facebook's monumental achievement of reaching 500 million users by sharing the  scaling principles that helped  reach that milestone. In case you weren't suitably impressed by the 500 million user number, Robert ratchets up the numbers game with these impressive figures:      
 
 1 million users per engineer 
 500 million active users 
 100 billion hits per day 
 50 billion photos 
 2 trillion objects cached, with hundreds of millions of requests per second 
 130TB of logs every day 
 
  
How did Facebook get to this point?
   
  People Matter Most . It's people who build and run systems. The best tools for scaling are an engineering and operations teams that can handle anything. 
  Scale Horizontally . Handling exponentially growing traffic requires spreading load arbitrarily across many machines. Using different databases for tables like accounts and profiles only doubles capacity. This approach hurts efficiency, but</p><p>5 0.79525542 <a title="1619-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring_the_software_behind_Facebook%2C_the_world%E2%80%99s_largest_site.html">845 high scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring the software behind Facebook, the world’s largest site</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recent  acquisitions  have been surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's  5 day whirlwind acquisition  of   Oculus  , immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a now paltry sounding $2 billion.
   The    backlash    is a pandemic, jumping across    social networks    with the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can generate.  
   For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here, Facebook’s ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.  
  For the many who voted for an open future with their  Kickstarter dollars , there’s a deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook’s promise to leave Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to people. It's new, it's different, it create</p><p>3 0.86922991 <a title="1619-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization_and_Cloud_Computing_is_Changing_the_Network_to_East-West_Routing.html">1157 high scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization and Cloud Computing is Changing the Network to East-West Routing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s  called “east-west” networking, which when compared to its predecessor,  “north-south” networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane  winds and tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation  between the transformative shift this change in networking patterns has  on the data center with that of El Niño’s transformative power upon the  weather patterns across the globe.
  

    Traditionally,  data center networks have focused on North-South network traffic. The  assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly communicate with  servers at the core, rather than across the network to other clients. 


 But  server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual  appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical  infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with  workloads moving to different physical locations on the network as  virtual servers are migrated (in the case of data center networks) and  clients move</p><p>4 0.85906696 <a title="1619-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-22-Paper%3A_Revisiting_Network_I-O_APIs%3A_The_netmap_Framework.html">1213 high scalability-2012-03-22-Paper: Revisiting Network I-O APIs: The netmap Framework</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:  Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework  by  Luigi Rizzo . As commodity networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen?

 


Abstract:

 

Today 10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the design of device drivers and network stacks.


The netmap framework is a promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary overhead and moves</p><p>5 0.85872823 <a title="1619-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Database_War_Stories_%233%3A_Flickr.html">282 high scalability-2008-03-18-Database War Stories #3: Flickr</a></p>

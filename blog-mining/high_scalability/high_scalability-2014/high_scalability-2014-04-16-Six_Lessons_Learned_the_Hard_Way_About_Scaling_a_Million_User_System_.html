<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: Steve Huffman, co-founder of social news site Reddit, gave an
excellentpresentation (slides,transcript) on the lessons he learned while
building and growing Reddit to 7.5 million users per month, 270 million page
views per month, and 20+ database servers.Steve says a lot of the lessons were
really obvious, so you may not find a lot of completely new ideas in the
presentation. But Steve has an earnestness and genuineness about him that is
so obviously grounded in experience that you can't help but think deeply about
what you could be doing different. And if Steve didn't know about these
lessons, I'm betting others don't either.There are seven lessons, each has
their own summary section: Lesson one: Crash Often; Lesson 2: Separation of
Services; Lesson 3: Open Schema; Lesson 4: Keep it Stateless; Lesson 5:
Memcache; Lesson 6: Store Redundant Data; Lesson 7: Work Offline.By far the
most surprising feature of their architecture is in Lesson Six, whose
essential idea is: The key to speed is</p><p>6 0.14277522 <a title="1633-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog
PileEffectinDog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails. Glenn
Franxman also has a Django solution inMintCache.Data is usually cached because
it's too expensive to calculate for every hit. Maybe it's a gnarly SQL query

<p>Introduction: Tugela Cacheis a cache system like memecached, but instead of storing data
just in RAM, it stores data in the file system using a b-tree. You trade
latency in order to have a very large cache. It's useful for sites that have
caching requirements that exceed their available memory. It uses the same wire
protocol asmemcachedso it can be dropped in without a hassle. From the
website:As large MediaWiki deployments may gain performance using Memcached,
at some level cost of RAM to store all objects becomes too high. In order to
balance resource usage and make more use of our Apache server disks, Tugela,
the distributed cached on-disk hash database, has arrived.Tugela Cache is
derived from Memcached. Much of the code remains the same, but notably, these
changes:Internal slab allocator replaced by BerkeleyDB B-Tree database.Expiry
policy management moved to external program tugela-expireMuch statistics code
made obsolete.An interesting point brought up in the comments is using

<p>Introduction: In a paper delivered at HotCloud '12 by a group from CMU and Intel Labs,
Saving Cash by Using Less Cache (slides,  pdf), they show it may be possible
to use less DRAM under low load conditions to save on operational costs. There
are some issues with this idea, but in a give me more cache era, it could be
an interesting source of cost savings for your product. Caching is used
to:Reduce load on the database.Reduce latency.Problem:RAM in the cloud is
quite expensive. A third of costs can come from the caching tier.Solution:
Shrink your cache when the load is lower. Their work shows when the load drops
below a certain point you can throw away 50% of your cache while still
maintaining performance.A few popular items often account for most of your
hits, implying can remove the cache for the long tail. Use two tiers of
servers, the Retiring Group, which is the group of servers you want to get rid
of. The Primary Group is the group of servers you are keeping. A cache request
goes to both serve</p><p>6 0.83466733 <a title="1633-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-29-Ehcache_-_A_Java_Distributed_Cache_.html">359 high scalability-2008-07-29-Ehcache - A Java Distributed Cache </a></p>

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>2 0.99162883 <a title="1633-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-01-Paper%3A_Can_Programming_Be_Liberated_From_The_Von_Neumann_Style%3F_.html">1641 high scalability-2014-05-01-Paper: Can Programming Be Liberated From The Von Neumann Style? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist John Backus, he's the B in BNF(Backus-Naur form) and
the creator of Fortran, gave a Turing Award Lecture titled Can programming be
liberated from the von Neumann style?: a functional style and its algebra of
programs, that has layed out a division in programming that lives long after
it was published in 1977. It's the now familiar argument for why functional
programming is superior:The assignment statement is the von Neumann bottleneck
of programming languages and keeps us thinking in word-at-a-time terms in much
the same way the computer's bottleneck does....The second world of
conventional programming languages is the world of statements. The primary
statement in that world is the assignment statement itself. All the other
statements of the language exist in order to make it possible to perform a
computation that must be based on this primitive construct: the assignment
statement.Here's a response by DijkstraA review of the 1977 Turing Award

<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson: Game
Industry Legends: Rob Pardo, where the future of gaming is discussed, there
was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot
of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:Q. If the
game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that
can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to
overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of
those technical issues? Rob Pardo: I certainly think there's a lot of
potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of
hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these
servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any
less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with
the infrastructure that can have all those games up there. Another issue the

<p>Introduction: O'Reilly Radar's James Turner conducted avery informative interviewwith Joe
Stump, current CTO ofSimpleGeoand former lead architect atDigg, in which Joe
makes some of his usually insightful comments on his experience using
Cassandra vs MySQL. As Digg started out with aMySQL oriented architectureand
has recently beenmoving full speedto Cassandra, his observations on some of
their lessons learned and the motivation for the move are especially valuable.
Here are some of the key takeaways you find useful:Precompute on writes, make
reads fast. This is an oldie as a scaling strategy, but it's valuable to see
how SimpleGeo is applying it to their problem of finding entities within a
certain geographical region. Using Cassandra they've built two clusters: one
for indexes and one for records. The records cluster, as you might imagine, is
a simple data lookup. The index cluster has a carefully constructed key for
every lookup scenario. The indexes are computed on the write, so reads are

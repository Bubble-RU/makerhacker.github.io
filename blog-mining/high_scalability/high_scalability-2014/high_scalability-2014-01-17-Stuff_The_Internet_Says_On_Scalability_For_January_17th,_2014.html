<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.   It's 2008: C</p><p>5 0.12785019 <a title="1581-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

  Thad Starner : the longer accessing a device exceeds 2s, the more its actually usage would decrease exponentially. Thus, he made a claim that wrist watch interface always sitting on one's wrist ready to use should be more successful than mobile phones which have to pulled out of the pocket.  
  @joedevon : We came for scalability but we stayed for agility #NoSQL 
  @jahmailay : "Our user base is exploding. I really wish we spent more time on scalability instead of features customers don't use." - Everybody, always.

  @etherealmind : You can dramatically improve blog performance by blocking Amazon IP address ranges. Tells you how much information mining is occurring. 
  Randy Bias : Choice is possible only when there’s architectural consistency between public and private cloud infrastructure. Those who focus only on API compatibility are either confused or intentionally misleading people. There is NO API COMPATIBILITY without architectural compatibility. 
  Nassim Nicholas Taleb : Everything that is fragile and still in existence (that is, unbroken), will be harmed more by a certain stressor of intensity X than by k times a stressor of intensity X/k, up to the point of breaking.</p><p>5 0.86364716 <a title="1581-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-05-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_5%2C_2013.html">1436 high scalability-2013-04-05-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 5, 2013</a></p>

  @petdance : "I wish I had enough money to run Oracle instead of Postgres." "Why do you want to do that?" "I don't, I just wish I had enough money to." 
  @JBossMike : Java is old. Java is verbose. Java is boring. Java is dead… Java is FAST.  
  @old_sound : We need a "shrink conf" for when scaling is not what we actually need. 
  Carsten Puls : At first, customers want to get going. Understanding what's going on under the hood isn't that important. As grows, want more control and go under the hood. Managing that balance through lifecycle is important.

<p>Introduction: Bees have a similar problem to website servers: how to do a lot of work with limited resources in an ever changing environment. Usually lessons from biology are hard to apply to computer problems. Nature throws hardware at problems. Billions and billions of cells cooperate at different levels of organizations to find food, fight lions, and make sure your DNA is passed on.   Nature's software is "simple," but her hardware rocks. We do the opposite. For us hardware is in short supply so we use limited hardware and leverage "smart" software to work around our inability to throw hardware at problems. But we might be able to borrow some load balancing techniques from bees. What do bees do that we can learn from?
 
Bees do a dance to indicate the quality and location of a nectar source. When a bee finds a better source they do a better dance and resources shift to the new location.  This approach may seem inefficient, but it turns out to be "optimal for the unpredictable nectar world."

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting and still relevant research paper by Jim Gray, Prashant Shenoy at Microsoft Research that examines the rules of thumb for the design of data storage systems. It looks at storage, processing, and networking costs, ratios, and trends with a particular focus on performance and price/performance.     Jim Gray has an updated presentation on this interesting topic:   Long Term Storage Trends and You  .

Club website; churn in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5  second procedure; capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem; memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10 minutes; videos, ar</p><p>5 0.85826546 <a title="1581-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_30%2C_2012.html">1365 high scalability-2012-11-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 30, 2012</a></p>

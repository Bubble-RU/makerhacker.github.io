It has long been said the Internet routes around obstacles. Snowden has revealed some major obstacles. The beauty of the current current app and web system is the physical network doesn't matter. We can just replace it with something else. Something that doesn't flow through choke points like  backhaul networks ,  under sea cables , and  cell towers . What might that something else look like?
  Google's Loon Project  
     
 
 Project Loon  was so named because the idea was thought to be loony. Maybe not.
 
The idea is to float high-altitude balloons 20 miles in the air to create an aerial wireless network with up to 3G-like speeds.

<p>Introduction: Now that we have the    C10K concurrent connection problem    licked, how do we level up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope, systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar. 
   To learn how it’s done we turn to    Robert Graham   , CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely fantastic talk at    Shmoocon 2013    called    C10M Defending The Internet At Scale   . 
  Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I’ve never heard of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn’t originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane and the data plane. The  problem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data plane , which we shouldn’t do at all.

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like? Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing. Specifically the  InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group  (IPNSIG).
 
 
 
 Ansible-like  faster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning telegraph system.
 
It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances and with much  longer delays :
  

The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2] Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances, so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to large delays and</p><p>3 0.85181487 <a title="1584-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-02-How_Will_DIDO_Wireless_Networking_Change_Everything%3F.html">1091 high scalability-2011-08-02-How Will DIDO Wireless Networking Change Everything?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A conjunction of a few new technologies may trigger disruptive changes in the future. This observation was prompted by a talk  Steve Perlman  gave at the Columbia Engineering School:  Benjamin Button, Cloud Everything and Why Shannon's Law Isn't . In it he covers a set of technologies that at first may seem unrelated, but turn out to be deeply related after all, culminating in a realization of the long talked about vision of an application utility, where all applications are hosted and run out of the cloud. 
 
First Perlman talks about the realistic human rendering technology developed at Rearden, his research incubator company. This technology was developed over many years and is the secret behind the wonderful effects found in movies like  Benjamin Button . It is now being used in many other films, and promises to revolutionize film making, possibly even replacing actors with computers, in real-time.

<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient and made the diagnosis. What did they find?

  Diagnosis : invasive tunnelation. ( tubes anyone? ) 
  Prognosis : even Dr. House might not be able to help. 
  Cure : go back to what the Internet was; kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything; disrupt the telcos. 
  
This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder, tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity.

<p>Introduction: The story of driving the  golden spike  to symbolize the completion of the  transcontinental railroad  is famous in the US. What is not so well known is the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that possibly be?
  Telegraph as Internet  
First, let's establish the telegraph and cable systems was an early version of an Internet.
 
As railroad tracks were being laid a  transcontental telegraph  system was also being constructed. Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could ride.
 
With the  transalantic cable system  information could quickly span continents in minutes:
  

The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to 12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to 110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870, 40</p><p>6 0.8236106 <a title="1584-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-02-RFC_1925_-_The_Twelve_%28Timeless%29_Networking_Truths.html">1526 high scalability-2013-10-02-RFC 1925 - The Twelve (Timeless) Networking Truths</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:   How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences .  Shows how to analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and how to resolve them.  80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what I mean. Steve Souders, author of  High Performance Websites  and  Yslow , has  ten more best practices to speed up your website :
  Split the initial payload   Load scripts without blocking   Don’t scatter scripts   Split dominant content domains   Make static content cookie-free   Reduce cookie weight   Minify CSS   Optimize images   Use iframes sparingly   To www or not to www  Sadly, according to String Theory, there are only 26.7 rules left, so get them while they're still in our dimension.  Here are  slides  on the first few rules. Love the speeding dog slide.

<p>Introduction: Update :  Organism without a brain creates external memories for navigation  shows slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants.

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released information on  Pregel . Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip. Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure...
   ...to mine a wide range of graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's topology.  Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

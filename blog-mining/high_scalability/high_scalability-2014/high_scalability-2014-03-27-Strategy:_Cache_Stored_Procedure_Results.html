<p>Introduction: Facebook's Ryan Mack gave aMySQL Tech Talk where he talked about using what he
called Non-stored Proceduresfor adding edges to Facebook's social graph. The
question is: how can edges quickly be added to the social graph? The answer is
ultimately one of deciding where logic should be executed, especially when
locks are kept open during network hops.Ryan explained a key element of the
Facebook data model are the connections between people, things they've liked,
and places they've checked-in. A lot of their writes are adding edges to the
social graph. Currently this is a two step process, run inside a
transaction:add a new edge into the graphif the add was successful then
increment the number of edges on a nodeThis approach works until there's a
very hot node that is being added to rapidly. For example, a popular game adds
a new character and everyone likes it at the same time or a new album comes
out and everyone likes it at the same time.They were limited to the rate they
could add edge</p><p>3 0.11614078 <a title="1620-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-04-A_Bunch_of_Great_Strategies_for_Using_Memcached_and_MySQL_Better_Together.html">360 high scalability-2008-08-04-A Bunch of Great Strategies for Using Memcached and MySQL Better Together</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've

<p>Introduction: Two forces account for the trend of moving behavior to data: larger values
used in key-value stores and spotty cloud networks. For some time we've seen
functions pushed close to data with MapReduce, which is a batch process, but
we are now seeing this model extend to interactive applications, which match
the current emphasis on highly scalable, real-time, event driven
applications.To see the trend look at the increasing support for collocated
behavior at the datastore level:HBase is implementing a coprocessor
feature.Cassandra is also implementing coprocessors or plugins.Membase is
creatingNodeCode, which is a process for executing functions on data in the
database.MongoDB supportsJavaScript stored procedures. VoltDB hasJava based
stored procedures.In-memory DataGridproducts like GigaSpaces have been doing
something like this forever. The key difference historically being GigaSpaces'
tight integration with languages C++ and Java, instead of using a language
agnostic protocol based appr</p><p>5 0.10780449 <a title="1620-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-27-Heroku_Emergency_Strategy%3A_Incident_Command_System_and_8_Hour_Ops_Rotations_for_Fresh_Minds.html">1030 high scalability-2011-04-27-Heroku Emergency Strategy: Incident Command System and 8 Hour Ops Rotations for Fresh Minds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In Resolved: Widespread Application Outage, Herokutells their story of how
they dealt with theAmazon outage. While taking 100% responsibility for the
downtime, they also shared a number of the strategies they used to bring their
service back to full working order.One ofHeroku'smost interesting strategies
wasn't a technical hack at all, but how they consciously went about deploying
their Ops personnel in response to the emergency. An outline of their strategy
is: Monitoring systems immediately alerted Ops to the problem. An on-call
engineer applied triage logic to the problem and classified it as serious,
which caused the on-callIncident Commanderto be woken out of restful slumber.

<p>Introduction: We have a lot of dependencies to our SQL databases and we have heard that
caching does help a lot as we move into scaling and providing better
performance.So the question is what are some reliable software products out
there that we could consider in this space ? We want to put a lot of
frequently called database calls that do not change frequently into this
caching layer.Also what would be an easy way to move only those database
changes into the cache as opposed to reloading or pulling it into cache every
few mins or hours.We need something smart that would just push changes to the
caching layer as it happens. I guess we could build our own, but are there any
good reliable products out there ? Please also mention how they play with
regards to pricing 'cos that would be a determining factor as well.Thanks</p><p>3 0.79015714 <a title="1620-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy%3A_How_to_Manage_Sessions_Using_Memcached.html">436 high scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy: How to Manage Sessions Using Memcached</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>4 0.78385425 <a title="1620-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-16-Six_Lessons_Learned_the_Hard_Way_About_Scaling_a_Million_User_System_.html">1633 high scalability-2014-04-16-Six Lessons Learned the Hard Way About Scaling a Million User System </a></p>

scaling a Twitter, but of building a million user system, which is the sweet
spot for a lot of projects. His conclusion rings true:Building scalable
systems is not all sexy roflscale fun. It's a lot of plumbing and yak shaving.
A lot of hacking together tools that really ought to exist already, but all

<p>Introduction: Caching is not new of course, but I don't think I've heard of caching store
procedure results before. It's like memoization in the database. Brent Ozar
covers this idea in How to Cache Stored Procedure Results.The benefits are the
usual for doing work in the database, it doesn't take per developer per app
work, just code it once in the stored proc and it works for everyone,
everywhere, for all of time. The disadvantage is the usual as well, it adds
extra load to a probably already busy database, so it should only be applied
to heavy computations.Brent positions this strategy as an emergency bandaid to
apply when you need to take pressure off a database now. Developers can then
work on moving the cache off the database and into its own tier. Interesting
idea. And as the comments show the implementation is never as simple as it
seems.</p><p>4 0.80210155 <a title="1620-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Database_War_Stories_%233%3A_Flickr.html">282 high scalability-2008-03-18-Database War Stories #3: Flickr</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist Leslie Lamport is definitely not a worse is
betterkind of guy. In Computation and State Machines he wants to make the case
that to get better programs we need to teach programmers to think better. And
programmers will think better when they learn to think in terms of concepts
firmly grounded in the language of mathematics.I was disappointed that there
was so much English in the paper. Surely it would have been more convincing if
it was written as a mathematical proof. Or would it?This whole topic has been
argued extensively throughout thousands of years of philosophy. Mathematics
has always been a strange attractor for those trying to escape a flawed human
rationality. In the end as alluring as the utopia of mathematics is, it lacks
a coherent theory of meaning and programming is not about rearranging
ungrounded symbols, it's about manipulating and shaping meaning.For

<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDBis a great follow up
to the idea inHow SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMSthat more programming is the
price paid for performance in SimpleDB. It shows how much work and
infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of
SimpleDB.Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you
want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests.
Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to
parallelize. Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a
little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.Parallelization is the
approach taken by Haakon@AWS in his Java code example of how to get the most
out of SimpleDB. You can find the code atIndexing and Querying Amazon S3

<p>Introduction: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly
many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for
these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning
to take advantage of the potential speed up.In this paper, we develop a
broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to
many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the
tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up
a single algorithm at a time.Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit
the Statistical Query model can be written in a certain “summation form,”
which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt
Google’s map-reduce paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique
on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear
regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM,

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally
successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips
with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these
successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to
multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are
reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we
are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be
squashed.To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a
corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer
2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use
symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to
work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore
designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core
efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtaining</p><p>5 0.73816335 <a title="1641-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-18-Paper%3A_The_Declarative_Imperative%3A_Experiences_and_Conjectures_in_Distributed_Logic.html">844 high scalability-2010-06-18-Paper: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic
is written by UC Berkeley's Joseph Hellersteinfor a keynote speech he gave at
PODS. The video version of the talk is here. You may have heard about Mr.
Hellerstein through theBerkeley Orders Of Magnitude project (BOOM), whose
purpose is to help people build systems that are OOM (orders of magnitude)
bigger than are building today, with OOM less effort than traditional
programming methodologies. A noble goal which may be why BOOM was rated as a
top 10 emerging technology for 2010 byMIT Technology Review. Quite an
honor.The motivation for the talk is a familiar one: it's a dark period for
computer programming and if we don't learn how to write parallel programs the
children of Moore's law will destroy us all. We have more and more processors,
yet we are stuck on figuring out how the average programmer can exploit them.
The BOOM solution is the Bloom language which is based onDedalus: Dedalus is a

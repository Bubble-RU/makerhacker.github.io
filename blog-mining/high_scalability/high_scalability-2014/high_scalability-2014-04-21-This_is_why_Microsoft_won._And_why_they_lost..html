<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.I have a problem I'd like to have your view on. I've
looked around a lot, and I haven't found a definite answer. The question is
this:Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of
users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open
source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will
cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft
licenses(OS, SQL Server, â&euro;Ś)?I am in charge of selecting the technology toolbox
for a startup which is going to build a scalable public web platform. I've
worked as a developer and database developer/admin (mainly as a DBA) using
different platforms and technologies, but my main focus is on Microsoft
technology. I've considered all other important factors for this decision, and
at the end, I always come back to the question of money. When I finish
developing the first st</p><p>3 0.13500527 <a title="1635-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-25-Did_the_Microsoft_Stack_Kill_MySpace%3F.html">1011 high scalability-2011-03-25-Did the Microsoft Stack Kill MySpace?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble wrote a fascinating case study,MySpace's death spiral: insiders
say it's due to bets on Los Angeles and Microsoft, where he reports MySpace
insiders blame the Microsoft stack on why theylost the great social network
raceto Facebook.  Does anyone know if this is true? What's the real story?I
was wondering because it doesn't seem to track with theMySpace Architecture
post that I did in 2009, where they seem happy with their choices and had
stats to back up their improvements. Why this matters is it's a fascinating
model for startups to learn from. What does it really take to succeed? Is it
the people or the stack? Is it the organization or the technology? Is it the
process or the competition? Is the quality of the site or the love of the
users? So much to consider and learn from.Some conjectures from the
article:Myspace didn't have programming talent capable of scaling the site to
compete with Facebook.Choosing the Microsoft stack made it difficult to hire

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steve Newman, co-founder of Writely (Google Docs),
tech lead on the Paxos-based synchronous replication in Megastore, and founder
of cloud service providerScalyr.com.Microsoft's Azure service suffered a
widely publicized outage on February 28th / 29th. Microsoft recently published
an excellentpostmortem. For anyone trying to run a high-availability service,
this incident can teach several important lessons.The central lesson is that,
no matter how much work you put into redundancy, problems will arise. Murphy
is strong and, I might say, creative; things go wrong. So preventative
measures are important, but how you react to problems is just as important.
It's interesting to review the Azure incident in this light.The postmortem is
worth reading in its entirety, but here's a quick summary: each time Azure
launches a new VM, it creates a "transfer certificate" to secure
communications with that VM. There was a bug in the code that determines the
certificate expirat</p><p>5 0.10804262 <a title="1635-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_18th%2C_2014.html">1634 high scalability-2014-04-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 18th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignantFriendFeed threadcommiserating PodTech's
unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup.
Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with
them:Have a story.Have everyone on board with that story.If anyone goes off of
that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.Make sure
people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues
should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get
fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.Work ONLY for a leader who
will make the tough decisions.Build a place where excellence is expected,
allowed, and is enabled.Fire idiots quickly.If your engineering team can't
give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only
things that are measured ever get improved.When your stars aren't listened to
the company is in trouble.Getting rid of the CEO, even if it's all his fault,

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed

<p>Introduction: ArchCamp: Scalable Databasess (NoSQL)The ArchCamp unconference was held this
past Friday at HackerDojo in Mountain View, CA.  There was plenty of pizza,
beer, and great conversation.  This session started out free-form, but shaped
up pretty quickly into a discussion of the popular open source scalable NoSQL

<p>Introduction: This is a question everyone must struggle with when building out their
datacenter. Storage choices are always the ones I have the least confidence
in. David Marks in his blogYou Can Change It Later!asks the questionShould I
get a SAN to scale my site architecture?and answers no. A better solution is
to use commodity hardware, directly attach storage on servers, and partition
across servers to scale and for greater availability.David's reasoning is
interesting:A SAN creates a SPOF (single point of failure) that is dependent
on a vendor to fly and fix when there's a problem. This can lead to long down
times during this outage you have no access to your data at all.Using easily
available commodity hardware minimizes risks to your company, it's not just
about saving money. Zooming over to Fry's to buy emergency equipment provides
the kind of agility startups need in order to respond quickly to ever changing
situations.It's hard to beat the power and flexibility (backups, easy to add

<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

latency 1 msec.50TBs of SSDs in one machine for $80,000. With the densities

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAli Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead atPlanForCloud. The
original article was publishedon their site. With 29 cloud price reductions I
thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change
compared to an articlewe published last year. The result is surprisingly
little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances havenot dropped
as fastas for other other instances types.Over the last year and a half,we
counted 29 price reductionsin cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute
Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct
effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is
that effect on the bottom line?Last year I wrote aboutcloud cost forecasts for
TripAdvisor and Pinterest.TripAdvisor was experimenting with AWSand attempted
to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of its live site,
andPinterest was growing massively on AWS. In the wake of the cloud providers'

<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture for  Poppen.de , a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new, using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached, RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.
  What is Poppen.de?  
Poppen.de (NSFW) is the top dating website in  Germany, and while it may be a small site compared to giants like Flickr  or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to learn from if you  are starting to get some scaling problems.
  The  Stats   
 2.000.000 users 
 20.000  concurrent users 
 300.000 private messages per day 
 250.000  logins per day 
 We have a team  of  eleven developers, two designers and two sysadmins for this project.

<p>Introduction: What should the architecture of your scalable, real-time, highly available service look like? There are as many options as there are developers, but if you are looking for a general template, this architecture as described by Prashant Malik, Facebook's lead for the  Messages  back end team, in  Scaling the Messages Application Back End , is a very good example to consider. 
 
Although Messages is tasked with handling 135+ billion messages a month, from email, IM, SMS,  text messages, and Facebook messages, you may think this is an example of BigArchitecture and doesn't apply to smaller sites. Not so. It's a good, well thought out example of a non-cloud architecture exhibiting many qualities any mom would be proud of:
  
  Layered  - components are independent and isolated.  
  Service/API Driven  - each layer is connected via well defined interface that is the sole entry point for accessing that service. This prevents nasty complicated interdependencies.

<p>Introduction: When we last  visited WhatsApp  they’d just been acquired by Facebook for $19 billion. We learned about their early architecture, which centered around a maniacal focus on optimizing Erlang into handling 2 million connections a server, working on All The Phones, and making users happy through simplicity.
   Two years later traffic has grown 10x. How did WhatsApp make that jump to the next level of scalability? 
    Rick Reed    tells us in a talk he gave at the Erlang Factory:    That's 'Billion' with a 'B': Scaling to the next level at WhatsApp    (   slides   ), which revealed some eye popping WhatsApp stats:

<p>Introduction: It's a little known fact that Santa Clause was an early queue innovator. Faced with the problem of delivering a planet full of presents in one night, Santa, in his hacker's workshop, created a Present Distribution System using thousands of region based priority present queues for continuous delivery by the Rudolphs. Rudolphs? You didn't think there was only one Rudolph did you? Presents are delivered in parallel by a cluster of sleighs, each with redundant reindeer in a master-master configuration. Each Rudolph is a cluster leader and they coordinate work using an early and more magical version of the ZooKeeper protocol.
 
Programmers have followed Santa's lead and you can find a  message queue  in nearly every major architecture profile on  HighScalability . Historically they may have been introduced after a first generation architecture needed to scale up from their two tier system into something a little more capable (asynchronicity, work dispatch, load buffering, database offloadin</p><p>4 0.6928876 <a title="1577-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-28-How_Disqus_Went_Realtime_with_165K_Messages_Per_Second_and_Less_than_.2_Seconds_Latency.html">1638 high scalability-2014-04-28-How Disqus Went Realtime with 165K Messages Per Second and Less than .2 Seconds Latency</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here's an  Update On Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes Python . 
 
How do you add realtime functionality to a web scale application? That's what  Adam Hitchcock , a Software Engineer at Disqus talks about in an excellent talk:  Making DISQUS Realtime  ( slides ).
 
Disqus had to take their commenting system and add realtime capabilities to it. Not something that's easy to do when at the time of the talk (2013) they had had just hit a billion unique visitors a month.
 
What Disqus developed is a realtime commenting system called “realertime” that was tested to handle 1.5 million concurrently connected users, 45,000 new connections per second, 165,000 messages/second, with less than .2 seconds latency end-to-end.
 
The nature of a commenting system is that it is IO bound and has a high fanout, that is a comment comes in and must be sent out to a lot of readers. It's a problem very similar to what  Twitter must solve .

Scaling to the next level at WhatsAppreveals some eye
poppingWhatsAppstats:What has hundreds of nodes, thousands of cores, hundreds
of terabytes of RAM, and hopes to serve the billions of smartphones that will
soon be a reality around the globe? The Erlang/FreeBSD-based server
infrastructure at WhatsApp. We've faced many challenges in meeting the ever-
growing demand for our messaging services, but as we continue to push the
envelope on size (>8000 cores) and speed (>70M Erlang messages per second) of
our serving system.But since we don't have that talk yet, let's take a look at
a talk Rick Reed gave two years ago on WhatsApp:Scaling to Millions of
Simultaneous Connections.Having built a high performance messaging bus in C++
while at Yahoo, Rick Reed is not new to the world of high scalability
architectures. The founders are also ex-Yahoo guys with not a little
experience scaling systems. So WhatsApp comes by thei</p><p>6 0.68448007 <a title="1577-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-15-ZooKeeper_-_A_Reliable%2C_Scalable_Distributed_Coordination_System_.html">350 high scalability-2008-07-15-ZooKeeper - A Reliable, Scalable Distributed Coordination System </a></p>

<p>Introduction: As part of  Dr. Indranil Gupta 's  CS 525 Spring 2011 Advanced Distributed Systems  class, he has collected an incredible  list of resources on distributed systems . His  research group  is also doing some interesting work.
 
The  various topics  include: Before there Were Clouds, Cloud Computing, P2P Systems, Basic Distributed Computing Concepts, Sensor Networks, Overlays and DHTs, Cloud Programming, Cloud Scheduling, Key-Value Stores, Storage, Sensor Net Routing, Geo-Distribution, P2P Apps, In-network processing, Epidemics, Probabilistic Membership Protocols, Distributed Monitoring and  Management, Publish-Subscribe/CDNs, Measurement Studies, Old Wine: Stale or Vintage?, In Byzantium, Cloud Pricing, Other Industrial Systems, Structure of Networks, Completing the Circle, Green Clouds, Distributed Debugging, Flash!, The Middle or the End?, Availability-Aware Systems, Design Methodologies, Handling Stress, Sources of unreliability in networks, Handling Stress, Selfish algorithms, Securi</p><p>2 0.9446528 <a title="1577-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:   My recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid expiration headers) is employ a    reverse proxy    as mentioned in this article.   In the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.  It's trivial to implement for anyone interested...</p><p>3 0.94424629 <a title="1577-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-06-Product%3A_ChironFS.html">143 high scalability-2007-11-06-Product: ChironFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across data centers,  then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What is  ChironFS  and how does it work?
 
Adapted from the ChironFS website:   The Chiron Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not FILESYSTEMS.  Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become a real nightmare!</p><p>4 0.94420552 <a title="1577-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">191 high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Deploying, running and monitoring application on a big cluster is a challenging task. Recently  Hazelcast  team deployed a demo application on Amazon EC2 platform to show how Hazelcast p2p cluster scales and screen recorded the entire process from deployment to monitoring.
 
Hazelcast is open source (Apache License), transactional, distributed caching solution for Java. It is a little more than a cache though as it provides distributed implementation of map, multimap, queue, topic, lock and executor service.Â 
 
Details of running 100 node Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2 can be  found here .

does bring up some issues worth arguing about. Hacker News has agood

than 30,000 miles on it.Yes, you heard that right, less than 30,000 miles. I
don't drive my car very often because, well, my commute is a short trip down
two flights of stairs. I don't need to go very far when I do drive it's only
ten miles or so round trip to the grocery store. So from my perspective, gas
isn't really very expensive. I may use a tank of gas a month, which works out
to â€¦ well, it's really not even worth mentioning the cost. But for someone who
commutes every day - especially someone who commutes a long-distance every day
- gas is expensive. It's a significant expense every month for them and they

not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed
Pays, in Milliseconds. Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a500

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers
podcastShow 15 - Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls. The
conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can
be processed by a WAF (Web Application Firewall), which inspects HTTP for
security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much
was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be
necessary, but I digress.Toterminate SSLmost shops run SSL connections into
Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for
developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of
the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.Load
balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very
efficiently in hardware. Efficiently enough that if you are willing to get rid
of the general purpose Linux boxes and use your big iron load balancers, your
server count can be decreased</p><p>3 0.71793473 <a title="1587-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-17-Load_Balancing_of_web_server_traffic.html">217 high scalability-2008-01-17-Load Balancing of web server traffic</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Monitor, monitor, monitor. That's the advice every startup gives once they
reach a certain size. But can you ever monitor enough? If you are Bitly and
everyone will complain when you are down, probably not.Here are 10 Things We
Forgot to Monitor from Bitly, along with good stories and copious amounts of
code snippets. Well worth reading, especially after you've already started
monitoring the lower hanging fruit.An interesting revelation from the article
is that:We run bitly split across two data centers, one is a managed
environment with DELL hardware, and the second is Amazon EC2.  Fork Rate. A
strange configuration issue caused processes to be created at a rate of
several hundred a second rather than the expected 1-10/second. Flow control
packets.  A network configuration that honors flow control packets and isn't
configured to disable them, can temporarily cause dropped traffic.Swap In/Out
Rate. Measure the right thing. It's the rate memory is swapped in/out that can

completely vendor independent, as that's the only honor preserving and

minutes, with 40 minutes of speechifying and 20 minutes for questions.The

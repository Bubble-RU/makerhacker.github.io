[sent-13, score-0.261]
</p><p>2 Lessons: DNS is not a great means of load balancing traffic; Modifying sysctl values from their defaults can be important to ensure reliability; Graphing metrics is your friend;  Through TCP tuning and utilizing AWS Elastic Load Balancer we were able to decrease our response time by 98. [sent-15, score-0.246]
</p><p>3 Creating a resilient organization is a little like getting an allergy shot, you have to ingest a little of what ails you to boost your immune system. [sent-21, score-0.194]
</p><p>4 The idea is to push changes to the client by looking at changes in the database by tailing the database log and specifying a query to find what changes to send to clients. [sent-36, score-0.257]
</p><p>5 We ﬁnd that computation is a significant factor that makes up as much as 35% of the critical path, and that synchronous JavaScript plays a signiﬁcant role in page load time by blocking HTML parsing. [sent-87, score-0.18]
</p><p>6 SPDY reduces page load time only for networks with high RTTs and mod_pagespeed helps little on an average page. [sent-89, score-0.225]
</p><p>7 Though it does bring up the age of old question of do great people make the times or do the times make great people? [sent-100, score-0.182]
</p><p>8 Biggest surprise is the time you ask a question doesn't seem to make a difference. [sent-101, score-0.181]
</p><p>9 Data Efficiency at Scale : Essentially, this form of deduplication means trading a write of a duplicate chunk for a read. [sent-114, score-0.2]
</p><p>10 In that case, the bigger the system gets, the more expensive reads get - so processing of duplicate data becomes slower and slower as the storage system fills - this is why you won't find many 100 TB NetApp file systems with deduplication turned on. [sent-116, score-0.2]
</p><p>11 By explicitly considering application-level invariants, invariant confluence analysis allows databases to coordinate between operations only when anomalies that might violate invariants are possible. [sent-119, score-0.36]
</p><p>12 We demonstrate the utility of invariant confluence analysis on a subset of SQL and via a coordination-avoiding proof- of-concept database prototype that scales linearly to over a millionTPC-C New-Order transactions per second on 100 servers. [sent-121, score-0.219]
</p><p>13 One of the surprising observations in this paper is that link speeds change dramatically with time, and current transport protocols build up multi-second queues in network gateways, thereby yielding low throughputs and highly variable packet delays. [sent-127, score-0.387]
</p><p>14 This paper proposes Sprout, an end-to-end transport protocol primarily designed for interactive applications to function well over highly variable cellular network channels. [sent-128, score-0.655]
</p><p>15 The second surprising design choice in Sprout is that it does not function anything like any known TCP-style congestion control protocol;rather, it learns a stochastic model of the cellular channel based on packet arrival times, and uses the model to quickly adapt the transmission rate of a flow. [sent-129, score-0.26]
</p><p>16 The third surprising aspect about the paper is the evaluation. [sent-131, score-0.189]
</p><p>17 Across four different cellular networks, the authors show that Sprout achieved a factor of 7-9 reduction in the end-to-end self-inflicted delay, and a factor of 2-4 enhancement in the bit rate throughput, for 3 popular interactive applications: Google Hangout, Skype and Apple FaceTime. [sent-132, score-0.502]
</p><p>18 The authors also show that Sprout matches or outperforms TCP Cubic coupled with an active queue management technique that requires changes to the cellular network. [sent-133, score-0.341]
</p><p>19 These surprises put together make this paper a very interesting read. [sent-134, score-0.178]
</p><p>20 It allows users to trade-off query accuracy for response time, enabling interactive queries over massive data by running queries on data samples and presenting results annotated with meaningful error bars. [sent-136, score-0.375]

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: Matthew Might , as a first responder to a surprise  traffic surge  on his inexpensive linode hosted blog, took emergency steps that you might find useful in a similar situation:
  
  Find the bottleneck.  Reloading the page in firebug showed the first page took 24 seconds to load and after that everything else loaded quickly. In retrospect this burst meant the site was thread limited as the CPU was idle. 
  Cut image sizes in half  with a shell script using ImageMagick's convert. Load time is now 12 seconds. 
  Turn dynamic content into static content  using a static index.html file  copied using the browser's "view source" feature. Load time is now 6 seconds. 
  Added threads  to the Apache configuration file. Load time is now 2 seconds. Crises averted. 
  
Because of this quick thinking and quick action the patient survived to serve pages another day.
 
And in fine post-mortem tradition some of the future changes are:

<p>Introduction: A lot of sites hosted in San Francisco are down because of at least 6 back-to-back power outages power outages. More details at  laughingsquid .
   
Sites like SecondLife, Craigstlist, Technorati, Yelp and all Six Apart properties, TypePad, LiveJournal and Vox are all down. The cause was an underground explosion in a transformer vault under a manhole at 560 Mission Street. Flames shot 6 feet out from the manhole cover. Over PG&E; 30,000 customers are without power.  What's perplexing is the UPS backup and diesel generators didn't kick in to bring the datacenter back on line. I've never toured that datacenter, but they usually have massive backup systems. It's probably one of those multiple simultaneous failure situations that you hope never happen in real life, but too often do. Or maybe the infrastructure wasn't rolled out completely.  Update: the cause was a cascade of failures in a tightly couples system that could never happen :-) Details at  Failure Happens: A summary of the power</p><p>4 0.95273066 <a title="1596-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-18-How_to_get_started_with_sizing_and_capacity_planning%2C_assuming_you_don%27t_know_the_software_behavior%3F.html">1566 high scalability-2013-12-18-How to get started with sizing and capacity planning, assuming you don't know the software behavior?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here's a common situation and question from the  mechanical-sympathy  Google group by Avinash Agrawal on the black art of capacity planning:
  

How to get started with sizing and capacity planning, assuming we don't know the software behavior and its completely new product to deal with?

  
 Gil Tene , Vice President of Technology and CTO & Co-Founder, wrote a very  understandable and useful answer  that is worth highlighting:
  

Start with requirements. I see way too many "capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.


There are two key sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:


In the "How Much" part, you need to establish, based on expected business needs, Numbers for things (like connections, users, streams, transactions or messages per second) that you expect to interact with at the peak t</p><p>5 0.9425782 <a title="1596-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-10-Sify.com_Architecture_-_A_Portal_at_3900_Requests_Per_Second.html">825 high scalability-2010-05-10-Sify.com Architecture - A Portal at 3900 Requests Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sify.com is one of the leading portals in India. Samachar.com is owned by the same company and is one of the top content aggregation sites in India, primarily targeting Non-resident Indians from around the world. Ramki Subramanian, an Architect at Sify, has been generous enough to describe the common back-end for both these sites. One of the most notable aspects of their architecture is that Sify does not use a traditional database. They query Solr and then retrieve records from a distributed file system. Over the years many people have argued for file systems over databases. Filesystems can work for key-value lookups, but they don't work for queries, using Solr is a good way around that problem. Another interesting aspect of their system is the use of Drools for intelligent cache invalidation. As we have more and more data duplicated in multiple specialized services, the problem of how to keep them  synchronized  is a difficult one. A rules engine is a clever approach.

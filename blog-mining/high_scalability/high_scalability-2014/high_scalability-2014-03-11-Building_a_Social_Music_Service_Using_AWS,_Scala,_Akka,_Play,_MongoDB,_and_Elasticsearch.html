</p><p>4 When we looked at the JVM ecosystem, scala stood out as an interesting language option that allowed a modern approach to writing code, while keeping full interoperability with Java. [sent-10, score-0.295]
</p><p>5 Its dynamic indexing schema and the many search and faceting possibilities it provides allowed us to build many features on top of it, making it a central component in our architecture. [sent-23, score-0.309]
</p><p>6 Some numbersSerendip's "pump" (the part that processes the Twitter public stream and Facebook user feeds)digests around 5,000,000 items per day. [sent-28, score-0.285]
</p><p>7 These items are passed through a series of "filters" that detect and resolve music links from supported services (YouTube, Soundcloud, Bandcamp etc. [sent-29, score-0.697]
</p><p>8 The pump and filters are running as akka actors, and the whole process is managed by a singlem1. [sent-31, score-0.234]
</p><p>9 Out of these items we get around 850,000 valid items per day (that is items that really contains relevant music links). [sent-34, score-1.102]
</p><p>10 Building a feedWhen we started designing the architecture for serendip's main music feed, we knew we wanted the feed to be dynamic and reactive to user actions and input. [sent-46, score-0.912]
</p><p>11 If a user "dislikes" an artist, we should not play that music again. [sent-48, score-0.65]
</p><p>12 We also wanted the feed to be a combination of music from several sources, like the music shared by friends, music by favorite artists and music shared by "suggested" users that have the same musical taste. [sent-49, score-2.908]
</p><p>13 The set of features Elasticsearch provides allowed us to build this kind of real-time feed generation. [sent-52, score-0.391]
</p><p>14 The feed algorithm consists of several "strategies" for selecting items which are combined dynamically with different ratios on every feed fetch. [sent-53, score-0.651]
</p><p>15 The combination of strategies is translated to several searches on the live data that is constantly indexed by Elasticsearch. [sent-55, score-0.277]
</p><p>16 As part of the constant social stream processing, the system is preparing data by calculating the top shared artists for social network users it encounters (using a faceted search on their shared music). [sent-61, score-0.581]
</p><p>17 When a serendip user gives out a signal (either by airing music or interacting with the feed), it can trigger a re-calculating of the music soulmates for that user. [sent-62, score-1.573]
</p><p>18 The algorithm finds other users that are top matched according to the list of favorite artists (which is constantly updated), weighing in additional parameters like popularity, number of shares etc. [sent-63, score-0.235]
</p><p>19 It then applies another set of algorithms to filter out spammers (yes, there are music spammersâ&euro;Ś) and outliers. [sent-64, score-0.6]
</p><p>20 We found out that this process gives us good enough results while saving us from needing additional systems that can run more complex clustering or recommendation algorithms. [sent-65, score-0.239]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Eric Czech, Chief Architect at Next Big Sound, talks
about some unique approaches taken to solving scalability challenges in music
analytics.Tracking online activity is hardly a new idea, but doing it for the
entire music industry isn't easy. Half a billion music video streams, track
downloads, and artist page likes occur each day and measuring all of this
activity across platforms such as Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, Facebook, and
more, poses some interesting scalability challenges. Next Big Sound collects
this type of data from over a hundred sources, standardizes everything, and
offers that information to record labels, band managers, and artists through a
web-based analytics platform.While many of our applications use open-source
systems like Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Mongo, RabbitMQ, and MySQL, our usage
is fairly standard, but there is one aspect of what we do that is pretty
unique. We collect or receive information from 100+ sources and we struggled

<p>Introduction: There has been a lot of speculation over how Apple'siCloudwould work. With the
Apple Worldwide Developers Conferencekeynotes having just completed, we
finally learned the truth. We can handle it. They made some interesting and
cost effective architecture choices that preserved the value of their devices
and the basic model of how their existing services work.A lot of pundits
foretold that with all the datacenters Apple was building we would get a
streaming music solution. Only one copy of music would be stored and then
streamed on demand to everyone. Or they could go the Google brute force method
and copy up all a user's music and play it on demand.Apple did neither. The
chose an interesting middle path that's not Google, Amazon, or even
MobileMe.They key idea is you no longer need a PC. Device content is now
synced over the air and is managed by the cloud, not your legacy computer.
Your data may not even be stored in the cloud, but the whole management,
syncing, and control of content</p><p>5 0.15879221 <a title="1609-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-31-Sponsored_Post%3A_aiCache%2C_Next_Big_Sound%2C_ElasticHosts%2C_Red_5_Studios%2C_Attribution_Modeling%2C_Logic_Monitor%2C_New_Relic%2C_AppDynamics%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1185 high scalability-2012-01-31-Sponsored Post: aiCache, Next Big Sound, ElasticHosts, Red 5 Studios, Attribution Modeling, Logic Monitor, New Relic, AppDynamics, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post onPrismatic's Architecture is adapted from an email conversation
with Prismatic programmerJason Wolfe.What should you read on the web today?
Any thoroughly modern person must solve this dilemma every day, usually using
some occult process to divine what's important in their many feeds: Twitter,
RSS, Facebook, Pinterest, G+, email, Techmeme, and an uncountable numbers of
other information sources.Jason Wolfe from Prismatic has generously agreed to
describe their thoroughly modern solution for answering the "what to read
question" using lots of sexy words like Machine Learning, Social Graphs,
BigData, functional programming, and in-memory real-time feed processing. The
result is possibly even more occult, but this or something very much like it
will be how we meet the challenge of finding interesting topics and stories

<p>Introduction: Sify.com is one of the leading portals in India. Samachar.com is owned by the
same company and is one of the top content aggregation sites in India,
primarily targeting Non-resident Indians from around the world. Ramki
Subramanian, an Architect at Sify, has been generous enough to describe the
common back-end for both these sites. One of the most notable aspects of their
architecture is that Sify does not use a traditional database. They query Solr
and then retrieve records from a distributed file system. Over the years many
people have argued for file systems over databases. Filesystems can work for
key-value lookups, but they don't work for queries, using Solr is a good way
around that problem. Another interesting aspect of their system is the use of
Drools for intelligent cache invalidation. As we have more and more data
duplicated in multiple specialized services, the problem of how to keep
themsynchronized is a difficult one. A rules engine is a clever
approach.Platform / ToolsLin</p><p>5 0.75296116 <a title="1609-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-28-How_Next_Big_Sound_Tracks_Over_a_Trillion_Song_Plays%2C_Likes%2C_and_More_Using_a_Version_Control_System_for_Hadoop_Data.html">1586 high scalability-2014-01-28-How Next Big Sound Tracks Over a Trillion Song Plays, Likes, and More Using a Version Control System for Hadoop Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Eric Czech, Chief Architect at Next Big Sound, talks
about some unique approaches taken to solving scalability challenges in music
analytics.Tracking online activity is hardly a new idea, but doing it for the
entire music industry isn't easy. Half a billion music video streams, track
downloads, and artist page likes occur each day and measuring all of this
activity across platforms such as Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, Facebook, and
more, poses some interesting scalability challenges. Next Big Sound collects
this type of data from over a hundred sources, standardizes everything, and
offers that information to record labels, band managers, and artists through a
web-based analytics platform.While many of our applications use open-source
systems like Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Mongo, RabbitMQ, and MySQL, our usage
is fairly standard, but there is one aspect of what we do that is pretty
unique. We collect or receive information from 100+ sources and we struggled

<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a

<p>Introduction: The fascination over Instagram continues and fortunately we have several new
streams of information to feed the insanity. So consider this article an
update toThe Instagram Architecture Facebook Bought For A Cool Billion
Dollars, based primarily onScaling Instagram, a slide deck for an AirBnB tech
talk given by Instagram co-founder, Mike Krieger. Several other information
sources, listed at the bottom of the article, were also used.Unfortunately we
just have a slide deck, so the connective tissue of the talk is missing, but
it's still very interesting, in the same spirit of wisdom presentations we
often see after developers come up for air after spending significant time
spent in the trenches.If you expect to dive deep into the technological
details and find a billion reasons why Instagram was acquired, you will be
disappointed. That magic can be found in the emotional investment in the
relationship between all of the users and the product, not in the bits about
how they bytes are mana</p><p>6 0.94701624 <a title="1609-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-07-3_Secrets_to_Lightning_Fast_Mobile_Design_at_Instagram.html">1259 high scalability-2012-06-07-3 Secrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design at Instagram</a></p>

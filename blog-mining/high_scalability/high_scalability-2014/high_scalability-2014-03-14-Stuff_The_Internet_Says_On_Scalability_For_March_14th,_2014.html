The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality augmentation, live crab (fresh and local), and live event publishing. One of the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a  broadcaster  and a consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a time shift war.

 How algorithms help determine that shape of our world. First we encode normative rules of an idealized world in algorithms. Second those algorithms help enforce those expectations by nudging humans in to acting accordingly. A fun example is the story of  Ed Bolian's Record-Breaking Drive . Ed raced from New York to L.A. at speeds of up to 158 mph, "breaking countless laws – and the previous record, by more than two hours." His approach is one that any nerd would love. He had three radar detectors, two laser jammers, two nav systems, a CB radio, a scanner, two iPhones and two iPads running applications like Waze, lookouts in the back seat scanning for cops, and someone scouting ahead. Awesome!

  Mining Experiment: Running 600 Servers for a Year Yields 0.4 Bitcoin . Yes, this is a far superior way of doing things. Chew up the commons for marginal gain. It's like old times. 
  Game designers, forget the sardines and go hunt some whale .  Swrve found : half of free-to-play games’ in-app purchases came from 0.15 percent of players. Only 1.5 percent of players of games in the Swrve network spent any money at all.

  The Master Switch : History shows a typical progression of information technologies: from somebody’s hobby to somebody’s industry; from jury-rigged contraption to slick production marvel; from a freely accessible channel to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel—from open to closed system. 
  @adrianco : #qconlondon @russmiles on PaaS "As old as I am, a leaky abstraction would be awful..." 
  @Obdurodon : "Scaling is hard.  Let's make excuses."

  @CompSciFact : "The cheapest, fastest and most reliable components of a computer system are those that aren't there." -- Gordon Bell

<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is adding   Elastic IP Addresses   and   Availability Zones  .     Elastic IP addresses are far better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight with   Jessica Alba   and they are:        Static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures by programmatica</p><p>3 0.93654221 <a title="1612-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-04-Changing_Architectures%3A_New_Datacenter_Networks_Will_Set_Your_Code_and_Data_Free___.html">1316 high scalability-2012-09-04-Changing Architectures: New Datacenter Networks Will Set Your Code and Data Free   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: One consequence of IT   standardization and commodification    has been Google’s    datacenter is the computer    view of the world. In that view all compute resources (memory, CPU, storage) are fungible. They are interchangeable and location independent, individual computers lose identity and become just a part of a service.     Thwarting that nirvana has been the abysmal performance of commodity datacenter networks which have caused the preference of architectures that favor the collocation of state and behaviour on the same box. MapReduce famously    ships code over to storage nodes    for just this reason.    Change the network and you change the fundamental assumption driving collocation based software architectures. You are then free to store data anywhere and move compute anywhere you wish. The datacenter becomes the computer.     On the host side with an x8 slot running at    PCI-Express 3.0    speeds able to push 8GB/sec (that’s bytes) of bandwidth in both directions, we have</p><p>4 0.93634278 <a title="1612-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-02-The_Data-Scope_Project_-_6PB_storage%2C_500GBytes-sec_sequential_IO%2C_20M_IOPS%2C_130TFlops.html">1186 high scalability-2012-02-02-The Data-Scope Project - 6PB storage, 500GBytes-sec sequential IO, 20M IOPS, 130TFlops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: “ Data is everywhere, never be at a single location. Not scalable, not maintainable. ”  –Alex Szalay    While Galileo played life and death doctrinal games over the mysteries revealed by the telescope, another revolution went unnoticed, the microscope gave up mystery after mystery and nobody yet understood how subversive would be what it revealed. For the first time these new tools of perceptual augmentation allowed humans to peek behind the veil of appearance. A new new eye driving human invention and discovery for hundreds of years.     Data is another    material    that hides, revealing itself only when we look at different scales and investigate its underlying patterns. If the universe is truly    made of information   , then we are looking into truly primal stuff. A new eye is needed for Data and an ambitious project called    Data-scope    aims to be the lens.     A detailed    paper    on the Data-Scope tells more about what it is:

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ivan de Prado  and  Pere Ferrera , founders of  Datasalt , the company behind  Pangool  and  Splout SQL  Big Data open-source projects.  
 
The amount of payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and shops for improving their relationship with the market. At  Datasalt  we have developed a system in collaboration with the  BBVA bank  that is able to analyze years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web and mobile applications.
 
The main challenge we faced besides processing Big Data input is that  the output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the input . And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.
 
The solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few tho</p><p>6 0.92846352 <a title="1612-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-06-Building_a_Unique_Data_Warehouse.html">716 high scalability-2009-10-06-Building a Unique Data Warehouse</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Van JacobsonVan Jacobson is a Research Fellow atPARC. Prior to
that he was Chief Scientist and co-founder of Packet Design. Prior to that he
was Chief Scientist at Cisco. Prior to that he was head of the Network
Research group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He's been studying
networking since 1969. He still hopes that someday something will start to
make sense.Scaling the Internet – Does the Net needs an upgrade?As the

undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web.Update 7:How do you know when
you need more memcache servers?. Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache
not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed
Pays, in Milliseconds. Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a500
millisecondtrading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside,
Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together

<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday
you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is
technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient
and made the diagnosis. What did they find?Diagnostic team: the Packet Pushers
gang (Greg Ferro,Jan Zorz,Ivan Pepelnjak) in the podcast How We Are Killing
the Internet.Diagnosis: invasive tunnelation. (tubes anyone?)Prognosis: even
Dr. House might not be able to help.Cure: go back to what the Internet was;
kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything;
disrupt the telcos.This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--
but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's
where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder,
tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's
all being carried out on battlefield few get to see: the infrastructure of

<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like?
Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing.
Specifically the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group(IPNSIG
).Ansible-likefaster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical
warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning
telegraph system.It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more
interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that
was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances
and with muchlonger delays:The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also
called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a
set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2]
Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances,
so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to
large delays and errors.[2] While the In</p><p>5 0.74747872 <a title="1651-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala_-_P2P_Online_Storage_Cloud.html">368 high scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala - P2P Online Storage Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected
availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P
systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show
you how! They havelaunched Wuala, the social online storage service which
scales as new nodes join the P2P network.The goal ofWua.lais to provide
distributed online storage that is:largescalablereliablesecureby harnessing
the idle resources of participating computers.This challenge is an old dream
of computer science. In fact asAndrew Tanenbaumwrote in 1995:"The design of a
world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by
millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise
for the reader"After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich,
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system,
Caleido is ready to unveil the result: Wuala. Wuala is a new way of storing,

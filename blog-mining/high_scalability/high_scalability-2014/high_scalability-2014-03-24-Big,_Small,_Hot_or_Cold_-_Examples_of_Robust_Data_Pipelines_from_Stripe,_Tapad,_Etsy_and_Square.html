<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>5 0.14952436 <a title="1618-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-30-Prismatic_Architecture_-_Using_Machine_Learning_on_Social_Networks_to_Figure_Out_What_You_Should_Read_on_the_Web_.html">1293 high scalability-2012-07-30-Prismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning on Social Networks to Figure Out What You Should Read on the Web </a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post onPrismatic's Architecture is adapted from an email conversation
with Prismatic programmerJason Wolfe.What should you read on the web today?
Any thoroughly modern person must solve this dilemma every day, usually using
some occult process to divine what's important in their many feeds: Twitter,
RSS, Facebook, Pinterest, G+, email, Techmeme, and an uncountable numbers of
other information sources.Jason Wolfe from Prismatic has generously agreed to
describe their thoroughly modern solution for answering the "what to read
question" using lots of sexy words like Machine Learning, Social Graphs,
BigData, functional programming, and in-memory real-time feed processing. The
result is possibly even more occult, but this or something very much like it
will be how we meet the challenge of finding interesting topics and stories
hidden inside infinitely deep pools of information.A couple of things stand

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>3 0.88365644 <a title="1618-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-28-Making_Hadoop_Run_Faster.html">1313 high scalability-2012-08-28-Making Hadoop Run Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Making Hadoop Run FasterOne of the challenges in processing data is that the
speed at which we can input data is quite often much faster than the speed at
which we can process it. This problem becomes even more pronounced in the
context of Big Data, where the volume of data keeps on growing, along with a
corresponding need for more insights, and thus the need for more complex
processing also increases.Batch Processing to the RescueHadoop was designed to
deal with this challenge in the following ways:1. Use a distributed file
system: This enables us to spread the load and grow our system as needed.2.
Optimize for write speed: To enable fast writes the Hadoop architecture was
designed so that writes are first logged, and then processed. This enables
fairly fast write speeds.3. Use batch processing (Map/Reduce) to balance the
speed for the data feeds with the processing speed.Batch Processing
ChallengesThe challenge with batch-processing is that it assumes that the
feeds come in bursts. I</p><p>4 0.84706074 <a title="1618-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-08-How_To_Get_Experience_Working_With_Large_Datasets.html">956 high scalability-2010-12-08-How To Get Experience Working With Large Datasets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I think I have been lucky that several of the projects I been worked on have
exposed me to having to manage large volumes of data. The largest dataset was
probably at MailChannels, though Livedoor.com also had some sizeable data for
their books store and department store. Most of the pain with Livedoor's data
was from it being in Japanese. Other than that, it was pretty static. This was
similar to the data I worked with at the BBC. You would be surprised at how
much data can be involved with a single episode of a TV show. With any in-
house generated data the update size and frequency is much less dramatic, even
if the data is being regularly pumped in from 3rd parties.Those HumansThe real
fun comes when the public (that's you guys) are generating data to be pumped
into the system. MailChannels' work with email, which is human generated
(lies! 95% is actually from spambots). Humans are unpredictable. They suddenly
all get excited about the same thing at the same time, they are demandin</p><p>5 0.83926481 <a title="1618-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-14-Ask_HS%3A_Design_and_Implementation_of_scalable_services%3F.html">1578 high scalability-2014-01-14-Ask HS: Design and Implementation of scalable services?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We have written agents deployed/distributed across the network. Agents sends
data every 15 Secs may be even 5 secs. Working on a service/system to which
all agent can post data/tuples with marginal payload. Upto 5% drop rate is
acceptable. Ultimately the data will be segregated and stored into DBMS System
(currently we are using MSQL).Question(s) I am looking for answer1.
Client/Server Communication: Agent(s) can post data. Status of sending data is
not that important. But there is a remote where Agent(s) to be notified if the
server side system generates an event based on the data sent.- Lot of advices
from internet suggests using Message Bus (ActiveMQ) for async communication.
Multicast and UDP are the alternatives.2. Persistence: After some evaluation
data to be stored in DBMS System.- End of processing data is an aggregated
record for which MySql looks scalable. But on the volume of data is
exponential. Considering HBase as an option.Looking if there are any

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>2 0.97744465 <a title="1618-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-16-Paper%3A_An_Experimental_Investigation_of_the_Akamai_Adaptive_Video_Streaming.html">991 high scalability-2011-02-16-Paper: An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues
of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well
documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an
insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has
managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!,
maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at
conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing
major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of
their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High
Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in
depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn
practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information
that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life
environments. And you</p><p>4 0.97381657 <a title="1618-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling_Social_Ecommerce_Architecture_Case_study.html">1016 high scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling Social Ecommerce Architecture Case study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading
retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent
applications. Furthermore, over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are
more likely to make a purchase after "liking" a brand they find online.

they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex
relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:the architectural
considerations behind their solutionwhy they chose memory over diskhow they
partitioned the data to gain scalabilitywhy they chose to execute code with
the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution frameworkhow they integrated
with Facebookwhy they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-
memory caching and scaleIn this post I tried to summarize the main takeaway

<p>Introduction: I follow a certain philosophy when developing system architectures. I assume
that very few systems will ever exist in a consistent form for more than a
short period of time. What constitutes a “short period of time” differs
depending on the specifics of each system, but in an effort to quantify it, I
generally find that it falls somewhere between a week and a month.The driving
forces behind the need for an ever changing architecture are largely business
requirement based. This is a side effect of the reality that software
development, in most cases, is used as a supporting role within the business
unit it serves. As business requirements (i.e. additional features, new
products, etc.) pour forth, it is the developer’s job to evolve their software
system to accommodate these requirements and provide a software based solution
to whatever problems lay ahead.Given that many businesses can be identified as
having the above characteristics, I can now begin to explain why I believe

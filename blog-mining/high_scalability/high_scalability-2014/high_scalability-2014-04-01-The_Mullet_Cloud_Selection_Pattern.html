<p>Introduction: Update: Zdnet says  Ozzie signals Microsoft’s surrender to the cloud . CD ROMs are to the internet as the internet is to the cloud and Microsoft aims to scratch and claw its way into this paradigm shift as well.      The gloves are off. The tag line for Microsoft's new SQL Server Data Service is   Your Data, Any Place, Any Time  . Thems fighten' words. Microsoft is itch'n for a fight! Who will be Amazon's second?     The service description:    SQL Server Data Services (SSDS) are highly scalable, on-demand data storage and query processing utility services. Built on robust SQL Server database and Windows Server technologies, these services provide high availability, security and support standards-based web interfaces for easy programming and quick provisioning.       Sounds like a fast uppercut  aimed squarely at SimpleDB's jaw. As a developer what do you need to know?         Highly available and highly scalable.   Targeted at applications that can tolerate high internet latencies.

<p>Introduction: The RAD Lab (Reliable Adaptive Distributed Systems Laboratory) wants to leapfrog the Big Switch and create The Next Big Switch, skipping the cloud/utility evolutionary stage altogether. This hyper-evolutionary niche buster develops technology so advanced the cloud disperses and you can go back to building your own personal datacenters again. Where Google took years to create their datacenters, using a prefab Datacenter Operating System you might create your own in a long holiday weekend. Not St. Patrick's of course.     Their vision:   Enable one person to invent and run the next revolutionary IT service, operationally expressing a new business idea as a multi-million-user service over the course of a long weekend. By doing so we hope to enable an Internet "Fortune 1 million".        How? By wizardry in the form of a “datacenter operating system” created from a pinch of "statistical machine learning (SML)" and a tincture of "recent insights from networking and distributed systems."

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Frédéric Faure   (architect at  Ysance )  on the differences between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frédéric was kind enough to translate the original French version of this article into English. 
 
I’ve been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such as  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) and a traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you. Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure. I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.

<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something called   Self Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance   (SCIT).  Botnets  are created when vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks like a  dog chasing its tail ). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a great deal of sense once I thought about it.  With SCIT you stop and restart VM instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window vulnerability)....
   
 This short exposure window means worms and viri do not have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack. A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM</p><p>3 0.65666723 <a title="1624-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-05-A_Simple_6_Step_Transition_Guide_for_Moving_Away_from_X_to_AWS_.html">1470 high scalability-2013-06-05-A Simple 6 Step Transition Guide for Moving Away from X to AWS </a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you just want to visit Rome and not go full on Cloud Native like Netflix, then  Soundslice 's  Adrian Holovaty  in  Why I left Heroku, and notes on my new AWS setup  provides a simple guide for helping make your first trip a good one.
 
First, let's dispose of why Soundslice left Heroku. The essence is because of various issues "Heroku lost my trust." YMMV, but once a fact, what do you do?
 
After a consultation with  Scott VanDenPlas , former director of dev ops for the Obama reelection tech team, they came up a simple transition guide that I think is quite good and generally useful (full details in the  original post ): 
  
  Bake an AMI . Install all the stuff you need on an AMI and use that as your deployment unit. This works well for Netflix and for users who value a certain sort of simplicity more than flexibility. There were a lot of comments saying how it's better to use Chef/Puppet and configure instances on the fly, but there's a confidence that only a baked image provides</p><p>4 0.6531539 <a title="1624-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-26-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_26%2C_2011.html">1106 high scalability-2011-08-26-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 26, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Adrian Cockcroft on the future of    Cloud, Open Source, SaaS and the End of Enterprise Computing   :  
  
   Most big enterprise companies are actively working on their AWS rollout now. Most of them are also trying to get an in-house cloud to work, with varying amounts of success, but even the best private clouds are still years behind the feature set of public clouds, which is has a big impact on the agility and speed of product development  

    While the    Snowden revelations    have tattered the thin veil of trust secreting Big Brother from We the People, they may also be driving a fascinating new tension in architecture choices between Cloud Native (scale-out, IaaS), Amazon Native (rich service dependencies), and Enterprise Native (raw hardware, scale-up). 
   This tension became evident in a recent    HipChat interview    where HipChat, makers of an AWS based SaaS chat product, were busy creating an on-premises version of their product that could operate behind the firewall in</p><p>6 0.64916301 <a title="1624-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud_AWS_Infrastructure_vs._Physical_Infrastructure.html">853 high scalability-2010-07-08-Cloud AWS Infrastructure vs. Physical Infrastructure</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yes, I just got through watching the Superbowl so chips and salsa are on my mind and in my stomach. In recreational eating more chips requires downing more salsa. With mulitcore chips it turns out as cores go up salsa goes down, salsa obviously being a metaphor for speed.     Sandia National Laboratories found in their simulations:   a significant increase in speed going from two to four multicores, but an insignificant increase from four to eight multicores. Exceeding eight multicores causes a decrease in speed. Sixteen multicores perform barely as well as two, and after that, a steep decline is registered as more cores are added. The problem is the lack of memory bandwidth as well as contention between processors over the memory bus available to each processor.      The implication for those following a diagonal scaling strategy is to work like heck to make your system fit within eight multicores. After that you'll need to consider some sort of partitioning strategy.

<p>Introduction: In a recent  thread on Hacker News  one of the commenters mentioned that they use Digital Ocean for personal stuff, but use AWS for business.
 
This DO for personal and AWS for business split has become popular enough that we can now give it a name: the  Mullet Cloud Selection Pattern -  business on the front and party on the back.
 
Providers like DO are cheap and the lightweight composable container model has an aesthetic appeal to developers. Even though it seems like much of the VM infrastructure has to be reinvented for containers, the industry often follows the lead of developer preference.
 
The mullet is dead. Long live the mullet! Developers are ever restless, always eager to move onto something new.</p><p>3 0.8552174 <a title="1624-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-03-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Sep_3%2C_2010.html">893 high scalability-2010-09-03-Hot Scalability Links For Sep 3, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Web Log Storming  is an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows. The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and how it fits into your desired scenario.  Web Log Storming does far more than just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.  In other words, analyze your web logs like never before!   It's easy to track sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed.

<p>Introduction: Stanford Info Lab is taking pains to document a direction we've been moving for a while now, using RAM not just as a cache, but as the primary storage medium. Many  quality products  have built on this model. Even if the vision isn't radical, the paper does produce a lot of data backing up the transition, which is in itself helpful. From the The Abstract:   
 Disk-oriented approaches to online storage are becoming increasingly problematic: they do not scale grace-fully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications, and improvements in disk capacity have far out-stripped improvements in access latency and bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity servers. We believe that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access lat</p><p>6 0.7909773 <a title="1624-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-09-Batoo_JPA_-_The_new_JPA_Implementation_that_runs_over_15_times_faster....html">1336 high scalability-2012-10-09-Batoo JPA - The new JPA Implementation that runs over 15 times faster...</a></p>

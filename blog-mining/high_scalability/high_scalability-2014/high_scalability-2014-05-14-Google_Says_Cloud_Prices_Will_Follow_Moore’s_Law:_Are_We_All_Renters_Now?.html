</p><p>7 This is because, right, datacenters have costs other than hard disks (power, cooling, bandwidth, building infrastructure, diesel backup generators, battery backup systems, fire suppression, staffing, etc). [sent-21, score-0.417]
</p><p>8 Most of those costs do not follow Moore's Law -- in fact energy costs are on a long trend upwards. [sent-22, score-0.364]

Dan also gives a kind of    state of the industry talk    where he does something wonderful, he gives real numbers and prices. Dan really knows his stuff and is an excellent speaker, so watch the video, but here’s my gloss on the state of the CDN so far this year: 
  
  Massive growth . Large customers are expecting 126% growth in video traffic over last year; medium size customers are seeing 48% traffic growth, small sized customer are seeing 73.3% traffic growth. 
   More traffic != More profit   . Traffic growth doesn’t lead to more profit because the traffic growth is concentrated in larger customers that can make the best deals.

  @jimplush : Google spent 2.3 billion on infrastructure in Q1. Remember that when you say you want to be "the Google of something" 
 Clay Shirky: I think one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive, I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of apps, separate from c</p><p>6 0.1375971 <a title="1647-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-31-Biggest_Under_Reported_Story%3A_Google%27s_BigTable_Costs_10_Times_Less_than_Amazon%27s_SimpleDB.html">336 high scalability-2008-05-31-Biggest Under Reported Story: Google's BigTable Costs 10 Times Less than Amazon's SimpleDB</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Should you pay more in the cloud or pay less for bare metal in the datacenter? This is a crucial decision point facing startups today. Which way should you go? In this  Webpulp.tv interview   , Joe Stump, always a go-to guy when you need a metric ass-ton (a favorite expression of Joe’s) of good advice on cutting edge practices for the modern startup, laughs at conventional wisdom by saying  the cloud is really not more expensive than bare metal. 
 
The argument for a cheaper cloud has a three main points:
  
   Raw Hardware Costs are Close . Buying hardware is cheaper than renting hardware from Amazon, but it’s close when you consider  reserved instances . A reserved instance costs about $250 a year and a new server costs about $1500.  Let’s say Amazon is 30% slower. That means for a cluster of 20 machines you would need a another 7 servers. This takes 10 minutes and 4 button clicks to provision on the cloud (the advantage of a scale-out architecture + automation + cloud aware tools).</p><p>3 0.76022905 <a title="1647-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-29-AWS_v_GCE_Face-off_and_Why_Innovation_Needs_Lower_Cost_Infrastructures.html">1448 high scalability-2013-04-29-AWS v GCE Face-off and Why Innovation Needs Lower Cost Infrastructures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 2 ( part 1 ) of  an interview  I did for the  Boundary blog . 
 
 Boundary:  There’s another battle coming down the pike between Amazon (AWS) and Google (GCE). How should the CTO decide which one’s best? 
 
 Hoff:  Given that GCE is still closed to public access we have very little common experience on which to judge. The best way to decide is as always, by running a few experiments. Pick a few representative projects, a representative team, implement the projects on both infrastructures, crunch some numbers, figure out the bigger picture and then select the one you wanted in the first place   .
 
Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, recently  wrote about his experiences  on both platforms and found some interesting differences: AWS has a much richer set of services; GCE is on-demand only, so AWS can be cheaper; GCE has faster disk and faster network IO, especially between datacenters; GCE has faster boot times and can mount read-only partitions across multiple</p><p>4 0.71156377 <a title="1647-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-06-Cloud_Programming_Directly_Feeds_Cost_Allocation_Back_into_Software_Design.html">527 high scalability-2009-03-06-Cloud Programming Directly Feeds Cost Allocation Back into Software Design</a></p>

Why D'Ya Do This to Us?  Free accounts on a cloud platform are a constant drain of money.  Update 4:  Caching becomes even more important in  CPU based billing environments . Avoiding the CPU means saving money.  Update 3:  An interesting simple example of this idea showed up on the Google AppEngine list. With one paging algorithm and one use of AJAX the yearly cost of the site was $1000. By changing those algorithms the site went under quota and became free again. This will make life a lot more interesting for developers.  Update 2:   Business Model Influencing Software Architecture  by Brandon Watson.

<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle , infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made a  really interesting statement  about the economics of scale in the datacenter:
  

Weâ&euro;&trade;ve shown that when you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.

  
My first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>6 0.69139707 <a title="1647-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-29-Amazon%3A_Creating_a_Customer_Utopia_One_Culture_Hack_at_a_Time.html">1466 high scalability-2013-05-29-Amazon: Creating a Customer Utopia One Culture Hack at a Time</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After Google  cut prices  on their Google Cloud Platform Amazon quickly followed with their own  price cuts . Even more interesting is what the future holds for pricing. The near future looks great. After that? We'll see.
 
Adrian Cockcroft highlights that Google thinks  prices should follow  Moore’s law, which means we should expect prices to halve every 18-24 months.
 
That's good news. Greater cost certainty means you can make much more aggressive build out plans. With the savings you can hire more people, handle more customers, and add those media rich features you thought you couldn't afford. Design is directly related to costs.
 
Without Google competing with Amazon there's little doubt the price reduction curve would be much less favorable.
 
As a late cloud entrant Google is now in a customer acquisition phase, so they are willing to pay for customers, which means lower prices are an acceptable cost of doing business. Profit and high margins are not the objective.

<p>Introduction: Ganglia  is a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical design targeted at federations of clusters. It leverages widely used technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-node overheads and high concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been ported to an extensive set of operating systems and processor architectures, and is currently in use on thousands of clusters around the world. It has been used to link clusters across university campuses and around the world and can scale to handle clusters with 2000 nodes.</p><p>4 0.80760884 <a title="1647-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-28-Elasticity_for_the_Enterprise_--_Ensuring_Continuous_High_Availability_in_a_Disaster_Failure_Scenario.html">816 high scalability-2010-04-28-Elasticity for the Enterprise -- Ensuring Continuous High Availability in a Disaster Failure Scenario</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many enterprises' high-availability architecture is based on the assumption that you can prevent failure from happening by putting all your critical data in a centralized database, back it up with expensive storage, and replicate it somehow between the sites. As I argued in one of my previous posts ( Why Existing Databases (RAC) are So Breakable! ) many of those assumptions are broken at their core, as storage is doomed to failure just like any other device, expensive hardware doesn’t make things any better and database replication is often not enough.
 
One of the main lessons that we can take from the likes of Amazon and Google is that the right way to ensure continuous high availability is by designing our system to cope with failure. We need to assume that what we tend to think of as unthinkable will probably happen, as that’s the nature of failure. So rather than trying to prevent failures, we need to build a system that will tolerate them.

<p>Introduction: Here are a few updates on the article  Paper: Don’t Settle For Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS  from Mike Freedman and Wyatt Lloyd.
 
 Q: How software architectures could change in response to casual+ consistency? 
 
 A : I don't really think they would much. Somebody would still run a two-tier architecture in their datacenter:  a front-tier of webservers running both (say) PHP and our client library, and a back tier of storage nodes running COPS.  (I'm not sure if it was obvious given the discussion of our "thick" client -- you should think of the COPS client dropping in where a memcache client library does...albeit ours has per-session state.)
 
 
 
 Q: Why not just use vector clocks? 
 
 A : The problem with vector clocks and scalability has always been that the size of vector clocks in O(N), where N is the number of nodes.  So if we want to scale to a datacenter with 10K nodes, each piece of metadata must have size O(10K).  And in fact, vector</p><p>6 0.77464044 <a title="1647-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-11-Arhcitecture_for_content_management.html">440 high scalability-2008-11-11-Arhcitecture for content management</a></p>

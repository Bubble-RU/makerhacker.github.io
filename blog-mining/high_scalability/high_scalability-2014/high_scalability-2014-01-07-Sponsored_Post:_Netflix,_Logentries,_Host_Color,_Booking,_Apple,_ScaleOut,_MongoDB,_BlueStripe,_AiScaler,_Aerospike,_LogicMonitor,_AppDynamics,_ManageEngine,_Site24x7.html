<p>Introduction: As any reader of this site knows we're huge huge supporters of the arts. To continue that theme here's a visionary poem by Mason Hale. Few have reached for inspiration and found their muse in the emotional maelstrom that is cloud computing, but Mason has and the results speak for themselves:      Partly Cloudy      We have a dream   A vision   An aspiration   To compute in the cloud   To pay as we go   To drink by the sip   To add cores at our whim   To write to disks with no end   To scale up with demand   And scale down when it ends   Elasticity   Scalability   Redundancy   Computing as a utility   This is our dream   Becoming reality     But…   There’s a hitch.

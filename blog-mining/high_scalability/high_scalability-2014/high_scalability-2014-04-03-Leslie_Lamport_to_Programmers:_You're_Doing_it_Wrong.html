<p>Introduction: Neil Conway  from Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk at  a meetup today  in San Francisco on a new paper:  Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming  - extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. 
 
The description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the paper:
  Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability. Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of strong consistency can be very challenging.

 


In this talk, I'll discuss work from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a broader range of</p><p>5 0.090707041 <a title="1625-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-30-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_April_30%2C_2010.html">819 high scalability-2010-04-30-Hot Scalability Links for April 30, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic  is written by UC Berkeley's  Joseph Hellerstein  for a keynote speech he gave at  PODS . The video version of the talk is  here . You may have heard about Mr. Hellerstein through the  Berkeley Orders Of Magnitude  project ( BOOM ), whose purpose is to help  people build systems that are OOM (orders of magnitude) bigger than are building today, with OOM less effort than traditional programming methodologies . A noble goal which may be why BOOM was rated as a top 10 emerging technology for 2010 by  MIT Technology Review . Quite an honor.
 
The motivation for the talk is a familiar one: it's a dark period for computer programming and if we don't learn how to write parallel programs the children of Moore's law will destroy us all. We have more and more processors, yet we are stuck on figuring out how the average programmer can exploit them. The BOOM solution is the Bloom language which is based on  Dedalus:</p><p>4 0.74338806 <a title="1625-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce_for_Machine_Learning_on_Multicore.html">581 high scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning to take advantage of the potential speed up.      In this paper, we develop a broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a time.      Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model can be written in a certain “summation form,” which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt Google’s map-reduce  paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM</p><p>5 0.72621572 <a title="1625-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-21-Paper%3A_Parallelizing_the_Web_Browser.html">660 high scalability-2009-07-21-Paper: Parallelizing the Web Browser</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There have been reports that  software engineering is dead . Maybe, like the future, software engineering is simply not evenly distributed? When you read this paper I think you'll agree there is some real engineering going on, it's just that most of the things we need to build do not require real engineering. Much like my old childhood tree fort could be patched together and was "good enough." This brings to mind the old joke: If a software tree falls in the woods would anyone hear it fall? Only if it tweeted on the way down...  What this paper really showed me is we need not only to change programming practices and constructs, but we also need to design solutions that allow for deep parallelism to begin with. Grafting parallelism on later is difficult.

<p>Introduction: Atif Ghaffar  has a nice strategy to deal with virus checking uploads:
   Upload item into a safe area. If necessary, the uploader blocks waiting for a result.    Queue a work order into a job system so all the work can be distributed throughout your cluster.    A service in your cluster performs the virus scan and informs the uploader of the result.    Move the vetted item into your system.  This removes the CPU bottleneck from your web servers and distributes it through your cluster.  Keep your web servers providing prompt service to users. Let your cluster do the heavy lifting. This minimizes response time and maximizes throughput. A similar system can be used for creating thumbnails, transcoding, copyright checks, updating indexes, event notification or any other kind of intensive work.</p><p>2 0.86832654 <a title="1625-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ.html">592 high scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We usually think of the wonderful advantages of  service oriented architectures  as a software thing, but it also applies to hardware. In  Security Now 385 , that Doyen of Disk,  Steve Gibson , tells the fascinating story (@ about 41:30) of how moving to a service oriented architecture in hard drives, modeling a drive as a linear stream of sectors, helped create the amazing high density disk drives we enjoy today.
 
When drives switched to use the  IDE  (integrated drive electronics) interface, the controller function moved into the drive instead of the computer. No longer were low level drive signals moved across cables and into the motherboard. Now we just ask the drive for the desired sector and the drive takes care of it.
 
This allowed manufacturers to do anything they wanted to behind the IDE interface. The drive stopped being dumb, it became smart, providing a sort of sector service. Density sky rocketed because there was no dependency on the computer. All the internals could co</p><p>same-blog 4 0.82914692 <a title="1625-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie_Lamport_to_Programmers%3A_You%27re_Doing_it_Wrong.html">1625 high scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie Lamport to Programmers: You're Doing it Wrong</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist  Leslie Lamport  is definitely not a  worse is better  kind of guy. In  Computation and State Machines  he wants to make the case that to get better programs we need to teach programmers to think better. And programmers will think better when they learn to think in terms of concepts firmly grounded in the language of mathematics.
 
I was disappointed that there was so much English in the paper. Surely it would have been more convincing if it was written as a mathematical proof. Or would it?
 
This whole topic has been argued extensively throughout thousands of years of philosophy. Mathematics has always been a strange attractor for those trying to escape a flawed human rationality. In the end as alluring as the utopia of mathematics is, it lacks a coherent theory of meaning and programming is not about rearranging ungrounded symbols, it's about manipulating and shaping meaning.
 
For programmers I think  Ludwig Wittgenstein  has the right sense of things.

<p>Introduction: Todd had originally posted an entry on  collectl  here at  Collectl - Performance Data Collector . Collectl collects real-time data from a large number of subsystems like buddyinfo, cpu, disk, inodes, infiniband, lustre, memory, network, nfs, processes, quadrics, slabs, sockets and tcp, all using one tool and in one consistent format.
 
Since then a lot has happened.  It's now part of both Fedora and Debian distros, not to mention several others. There has also been a pretty good summary written up by  Joe Brockmeier . It's also pretty well documented (I like to think) on  sourceforge . There have also been a few blog postings by   Martin Bach   on his blog.
 
Anyhow, awhile back I released a new version of collectl-utils and gave a complete face-lift to one of the utilities, colmux, which is a collectl multiplexor.  This tool has the ability to run collectl on multiple systems, which in turn send all their output back to colmux.  Colmux then sorts the output on a user-specified column</p><p>6 0.75817817 <a title="1625-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-09-Site_Moves_from_PHP_to_Facebook%27s_HipHop%2C_Now_Pages_Load_in_.6_Seconds_Instead_of_Five.html">1561 high scalability-2013-12-09-Site Moves from PHP to Facebook's HipHop, Now Pages Load in .6 Seconds Instead of Five</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: In the era of Web 2.0 traditional approaches to capacity planning are often
difficult to implement. Guerrilla Capacity Planning facilitates rapid
forecasting of capacity requirements based on the opportunistic use of
whatever performance data and tools are available.One unique Guerrilla tool is
Virtual Load Testing, based on Dr. Gunther's "Universal Law of Computational
Scaling", which provides a highly cost-effective method for assessing
application scalability. Neil Gunther, M.Sc., Ph.D. is an internationally
recognized computer system performance consultant who founded Performance
Dynamics Company in 1994.Some reasons why you should understand this law:1. A
lot of people use the term "scalability" without clearly defining it, let
alone defining it quantitatively. Computer system scalability must be
quantified. If you can't quantify it, you can't guarantee it. The universal
law of computational scaling provides that quantification.2. One the greatest

<p>Introduction: How many times have you been called in the middle of the night by your
operation guys telling you that your application throws some odd red alerts?
How many times did you found out that when those issues happens you don't have
enough information to analyze this incident? have you tried to increase the
log level just to find out that your problem became even worse - now your
application throws tons of information in a continues basis most of which is
complete garbage...The current separation between the way we implement our
application and the way we manage it leads to many of this ridicules
situations. Cloud makes those things even worse.Inthis posti suggest an
alternative approach. Why don't we run our application the way we run our
business? I refer to this approach as the "interactive cloud" where our
application behaves just like our project team and the operations just like
our managers. As with our business our application would need to take more
responsibility to the way it runs</p><p>4 0.78162414 <a title="1654-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-04-Hot_Links_for_2009-9-4_.html">694 high scalability-2009-09-04-Hot Links for 2009-9-4 </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday
you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is
technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient
and made the diagnosis. What did they find?Diagnostic team: the Packet Pushers
gang (Greg Ferro,Jan Zorz,Ivan Pepelnjak) in the podcast How We Are Killing
the Internet.Diagnosis: invasive tunnelation. (tubes anyone?)Prognosis: even
Dr. House might not be able to help.Cure: go back to what the Internet was;
kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything;
disrupt the telcos.This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--
but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's
where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder,
tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's
all being carried out on battlefield few get to see: the infrastructure of

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:@davilagrau: Youtube, GitHub,..., Are cloud services
facing a entropic limit to scalability?Async all the way down? The Tyranny of
the Clock: The cost of logic and memory dominated Turing's thinking, but
today, communication rather than logic should dominate our thinking. Clock-
free design uses less than half, about 40%, as much energy per addition as its
clocked counterpart. We can regain the efficiency of local decision making by
revolting against the pervasive beat of an external clock. Why Google Compute
Engine for OpenStack. Smart move. Having OpenStack work inside a super charged
cloud, in private clouds, and as a bridge between the two ought to be quite
attractive to developers looking for some sort of ally for independence. All
it will take are a few victories to cement new alliances.3 Lessons That

<p>Introduction: The introduction of cloud technologies is not a simple evolution of existing
ones, but a real revolution.  Like all revolutions, it changes the points of
views and redefines all the meanings. Nothing is as before.  This post wants
to analyze some key words and concepts, usually used in traditional
architectures, redefining them according the standpoint of the cloud.
Understanding the meaning of new words is crucial to grasp the essence of a
pure cloud architecture.<>THOMAS REID, Essays on the
Intellectual Powers of ManNowadays, it is required to challenge the limits of
traditional architectures that go beyond the normal concepts of scalability
and support millions of users (What's Up 500 Million) billions of transactions
per day (Salesforce 1.3 billion), five 9s of availability (99.999 AOL).  I

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Read/WriteWeb has a good article talking about the scalability
issues of relational databases and how Dynamo solves them:Amazon Dynamo: The
Next Generation Of Virtual Distributed Storage. But since Dynamo is just
another frustrating walled garden protected by barbed wire and guard dogs, its
relevance is somewhat overstated.Update:Greg Lindenhas a take on the paper
where he questions some of Amazon's design choices: emphasizing write
availability over fast reads, a lack of indexing support, use of random
distribution for load balancing, and punting on some scalability issues.Werner
Vogels, Amazon's avuncular CTO, just announced a newpaperon the internal
database technology Amazon uses to handle tens of millions customers. I'll
dive into more details later, but I thought you'd want to read it hot off the
blog. The bad news is it won't be a service. They are keeping this tech not so
secret, but very safe. Happily, it's another real-life example to learn from.

<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and
single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can
finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in
an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly
DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we
don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is
addingElastic IP AddressesandAvailability Zones.Elastic IP addresses are far
better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight withJessica
Albaand they are:breakStatic IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud
computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a
particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to
explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however,
Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures
by programmatically remapping your public</p><p>6 0.91137999 <a title="1654-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-28-Amazon%27s_EC2%3A_Pay_as_You_Grow_Could_Cut_Your_Costs_in_Half.html">195 high scalability-2007-12-28-Amazon's EC2: Pay as You Grow Could Cut Your Costs in Half</a></p>

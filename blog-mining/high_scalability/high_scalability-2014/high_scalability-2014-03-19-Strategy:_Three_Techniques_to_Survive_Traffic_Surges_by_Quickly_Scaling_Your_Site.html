<p>Introduction: Pre-generating static files is an oldy but a goody, and as Thomas Brox RĂ¸st
says, it's probably an underused strategy today. At one time this was the
dominate technique for structuring a web site. Then the age of dynamic web
sites arrived and we spent all our time worrying how to make the database
faster and add more caching to recover the speed we had lost in the transition
from static to dynamic.Static files have the advantage of being very fast to

proxies are used. The issue is how do you bulk generate the initial files, how
do you serve the files, and how do you keep the changed files up to date? This

<p>Introduction: In the articleThe Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us, a lot of
interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from
Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and
work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn
in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting
the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-
in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer
specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed
development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and
reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5 second procedure;
capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git
for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem;
memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10
minutes; videos, articl</p><p>6 0.66454554 <a title="1615-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-03-5_Rockin%27_Tips_for_Scaling_PHP_to_30%2C000_Concurrent_Users_Per_Server.html">1486 high scalability-2013-07-03-5 Rockin' Tips for Scaling PHP to 30,000 Concurrent Users Per Server</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Matthew Might, as a first responder to a surprisetraffic surgeon his
inexpensive linode hosted blog, took emergency steps that you might find
useful in a similar situation:Find the bottleneck. Reloading the page in
firebug showed the first page took 24 seconds to load and after that
everything else loaded quickly. In retrospect this burst meant the site was
thread limited as the CPU was idle.Cut image sizes in halfwith a shell script
using ImageMagick's convert. Load time is now 12 seconds.Turn dynamic content
into static content using a static index.html file  copied using the browser's
"view source" feature. Load time is now 6 seconds.Added threadsto the Apache
configuration file. Load time is now 2 seconds. Crises averted.Because of this
quick thinking and quick action the patient survived to serve pages another
day.And in fine post-mortem tradition some of the future changes are: Run a
cron job to trigger an earlier alert. Email when requests exceed a per second
threshold as calcul</p><p>2 0.82990909 <a title="1615-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-24-Strategy%3A_Eliminate_Unnecessary_SQL.html">995 high scalability-2011-02-24-Strategy: Eliminate Unnecessary SQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: MySQL Expert Ronald Bradford explains how one key way to improve the
scalability of a MySQL server, and undoubtedly nearly every other server, is
toeliminate unnecessary SQL, saying the most efficient way to improve an SQL
statement is to eliminate it:The MySQL kernel can only physically process a
certain number of SQL statements for a given time period (e.g. per second).
Regardless of the type of machine you have, there is a physical limit. If you
eliminate SQL statements that are unwarranted and unnecessary, you
automatically enable more important SQL statements to run. There are numerous
other downstream affects, however this is the simple math. To run more SQL,
reduce the number of SQL you need to run.Ronald shows how to use mk-query-
digest to look at query execution times and determine which ones can be
profitably whacked. Related ArticlesQuora:What are the best methods for
optimizing PHP/MySQL code for speed without caching?</p><p>3 0.82696658 <a title="1615-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Major_Websites_Down%3A_Or_Why_You_Want_to_Run_in_Two_or_More_Data_Centers..html">23 high scalability-2007-07-24-Major Websites Down: Or Why You Want to Run in Two or More Data Centers.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of sites hosted in San Francisco are down because of at least 6 back-to-
back power outages power outages. More details atlaughingsquid.breakSites like
SecondLife, Craigstlist, Technorati, Yelp and all Six Apart properties,
TypePad, LiveJournal and Vox are all down. The cause was an underground
explosion in a transformer vault under a manhole at 560 Mission Street. Flames
shot 6 feet out from the manhole cover. Over PG&E; 30,000 customers are without
power.What's perplexing is the UPS backup and diesel generators didn't kick in
to bring the datacenter back on line. I've never toured that datacenter, but
they usually have massive backup systems. It's probably one of those multiple
simultaneous failure situations that you hope never happen in real life, but
too often do. Or maybe the infrastructure wasn't rolled out completely.Update:
the cause was a cascade of failures in a tightly couples system that could
never happen :-) Details atFailure Happens: A summary of the power outage a</p><p>4 0.82571447 <a title="1615-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-18-Forum_sort_order.html">370 high scalability-2008-08-18-Forum sort order</a></p>
<p>Introduction: G'day,I noticed the default sort order for the forum is to show the posts with
the most replies first. That seems a bit odd for a forum. Would it not make
sense to show the posts with the most recently replies first?It is possible to
re-sort the forum threads that way by clicking on the "Last post" header
(twice). It would seem like a more sensible default.I've checked and I see the
same behaviour as both a registered (logged in) and anonymous user.Cheers

<p>Introduction: Here's a common situation and question from themechanical-sympathyGoogle group
by Avinash Agrawal on the black art of capacity planning:How to get started
with sizing and capacity planning, assuming we don't know the software
behavior and its completely new product to deal with?Gil Tene, Vice President
of Technology and CTO & Co-Founder, wrote a very understandable and useful
answer that is worth highlighting:Start with requirements. I see way too many
"capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some
irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this
thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.There are two key
sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:In the
"How Much" part, you need to establish, based on expected business needs,
Numbers for things (like connections, users, streams, transactions or messages
per second) that you expect to interact with at the peak time of normal
operations, and</p><p>6 0.75546741 <a title="1615-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-13-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_13%2C_2013.html">1516 high scalability-2013-09-13-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 13, 2013</a></p>

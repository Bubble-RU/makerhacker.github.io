  @jimplush : Google spent 2.3 billion on infrastructure in Q1. Remember that when you say you want to be "the Google of something" 
 Clay Shirky: I think one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive, I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of apps, separate from c</p><p>5 0.11237136 <a title="1645-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

  1,966,080 cores : Time Warp synchronization protocol using up to 7.8M MPI tasks on 1,966,080 cores of the {Sequoia} Blue Gene/Q supercomputer system. 33 trillion events processed in 65 seconds yielding a peak event-rate in excess of 504 billion events/second using 120 racks of Sequoia. 
 Quotable Quotes:                             
 
  Thad Starner : the longer accessing a device exceeds 2s, the more its actually usage would decrease exponentially. Thus, he made a claim that wrist watch interface always sitting on one's wrist ready to use should be more successful than mobile phones which have to pulled out of the pocket.  
  @joedevon : We came for scalability but we stayed for agility #NoSQL 
  @jahmailay : "Our user base is exploding. I really wish we spent more time on scalability instead of features customers don't use." - Everybody, always.

  @hackofalltrades : When positive change is only viewed through its scalability, bad things happen. 
  @faizanj : Is it time for #Netflix to move to a hybrid cloud architecture similar to Zynga zCloud? 
  @adrianco : we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy lifting 
  @qui_oui : "scalability": a word that makes me think of how likely you are to have the ability to grow scales. 
  @Ninad_M : The question is, is #antifragile conceptually opposite of #bigdata 
  @pbailis : Batch your disk/network IO, kernel interrupts, customer package shipments -> delay arrival but increase efficiency 
  @Carnage4Life : One lesson that is hard for people to learn. Knowing that something occurred is different from knowing why it occurred

<p>Introduction: The story of driving the  golden spike  to symbolize the completion of the  transcontinental railroad  is famous in the US. What is not so well known is the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that possibly be?
  Telegraph as Internet  
First, let's establish the telegraph and cable systems was an early version of an Internet.
 
As railroad tracks were being laid a  transcontental telegraph  system was also being constructed. Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could ride.
 
With the  transalantic cable system  information could quickly span continents in minutes:
  

The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to 12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to 110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870, 40</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90279233 <a title="1645-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_9th%2C_2014.html">1645 high scalability-2014-05-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 9th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Authored by  Chris Fregly   :  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.  
   Ahead of the upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi’s recent    presentation    at an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few of my recent    Fluxcapacitor.com    consulting engagements, I’ve compiled a list of 10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS. 
    1) Query AWS resource metadata  
      
   Can’t remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?     awsnow.info    is the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.  Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You’re in luck.  There’s now a    REST API   , as well! 
   Note:  These are default soft limits and will vary by account. 
    2) Tame your S3 buckets  
       
   Delete an entire S3 bucket with a single CLI command:</p><p>4 0.87748051 <a title="1645-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-01-Peecho_Architecture_-_scalability_on_a_shoestring.html">1090 high scalability-2011-08-01-Peecho Architecture - scalability on a shoestring</a></p>

Although architecture descriptions are an interesting read, the problems that start-ups face are hardly ever addressed. We would like to change that, so here is our architecture story.

The Amsterdam-based company  Peecho  offers print-as-a-service. Our embeddable  print button  allows you to sell your digital content as professionally printed products, like photo books, magazines or canvases - straight from your own website. There is an API, too.
 
Printcloud is the system that powers the print button. It exists in the cloud only, growing when needed and becoming smaller if it can. The system takes in print orders, magically transforms tough data into print-ready files and routes the orders to the production facility that is closest to the intended recipient.
 
To preserve the environment, Peecho's philosophy is to facilitate global ordering, but to aim for local production on</p><p>5 0.8745833 <a title="1645-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_28th%2C_2014.html">1621 high scalability-2014-03-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 28th, 2014</a></p>

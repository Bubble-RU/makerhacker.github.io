<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation
from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?
Mike Stonebraker, the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world,
hopes you get something like his new database,VoltDB: a pure SQL, pure ACID,
pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory
DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a
second. VoltDBclaims to be100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster
thanCassandra, and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.Will
VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of
ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product
with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component
in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...I first heard the
details about VoltDB at Gluecon, where Mr. Stonebraker presented his highly

Quotes:@jimplush: Google spent 2.3 billion on infrastructure in Q1. Remember
that when you say you want to be "the Google of something"Clay Shirky: I think
one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that
users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so
overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And
because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive,
I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of
apps, separate from current pricing data for energy, cycles, and
storage.@chipchilders: Stop freaking making new projects just for the sake of

<p>Introduction: The Peregrine falcon is a bird of prey, famous for itshigh speed

Kevin Burton of Spinn3r's newPeregrine project--anew FAST modern map reduce
framework optimized for iterative and pipelined map reduce jobs--that feeds on
Hadoops.If you don't know Kevin, he does a lot of excellent technical work
that he's kind enough to share it onhis blog. Only he hasn't been blogging
much lately, he's been heads down working on Peregrine. Now that Peregrine has
been released, here's a short email interview with Kevin on why you might want
to take upfalconry, the ancient sport of MapReduce.What does Spinn3r do that
Peregrine is important to you?Ideally it was designed to execute pagerank but
many iterative applications that we deploy and WANT to deploy (k-means) would
be horribly inefficient under Hadoop as it doesn't have any support for
merging and joining IO between tasks.  It also doesn't support pipeline jobs

<p>Introduction: Lustre速is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system. It
is designed, developed and maintained by Cluster File Systems, Inc.The central
goal is the development of a next-generation cluster file system which can
serve clusters with 10,000's of nodes, provide petabytes of storage, and move
100's of GB/sec with state-of-the-art security and management
infrastructure.Lustre runs on many of the largest Linux clusters in the world,
and is included by CFS's partners as a core component of their cluster
offering (examples include HP StorageWorks SFS, and the Cray XT3 and XD1
supercomputers). Today's users have also demonstrated that Lustre scales down
as well as it scales up, and runs in production on clusters as small as 4 and
as large as 25,000 nodes.The latest version of Lustre is always available from
Cluster File Systems, Inc. Public Open Source releases of Lustre are available
under the GNU General Public License. These releases are found here, and are

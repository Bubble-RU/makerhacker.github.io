  Chris Travers : MySQL is what you get when application developers build an RDBMS. PostgreSQL is what you get when database developers build an application development platform. 
  Hasen : Node.JS is a terrible platform. It’s terribleness stems from a very simple aspect of it, and this aspect happens to be central to how it works: callback-based I/O 
  @cgul : @github nooooooooo say it aint so. But I read all your articles on high scalability! 
  @fhd : It may sound perverse, but I'm really happy to be confronted with scalability issues at Eyeo. I guess I just love tricky stuff :D

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

<p>Introduction: Update 3: InfoQ's  Big Architecture Up Front - A Case of Premature Scalaculation?  twines several different threads on the topic together into a fine noose.     Update 2: Kevin says the  biggest problems he sees with startups is they need to scale  their backend (no, the other one).     Update: My bad.  It's hard to sell scalability  so just forget it.       The premise of   Startups and The Problem Of Premature Scalaculation   and   Donâ&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Mart   is that you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its best chance of survival.

   If 2010 is the year that you’ve decided to kickoff your startup or if you’ve already got something off the ground and are expecting double or triple digit growth, this list is for you.  We all want     the     attention     of user    s     to achieve viral growth but as many     can attest    , too much attention can bring a startup to its knees.      If you’ve used Twitter for any amount of time you’re sure to have seen the “Fail Whale”, which is so often seen that it has its own       fan club      .      Take a look at the graph below from Compete.com showing Twitter’s unique visitors.      One can argue that limitations in the product offering have as much to do with the flattening of growth     over the past six months     as does the availability    ,     but     it’s hard to beli</p><p>4 0.68852502 <a title="1613-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-31-Squarespace_Architecture_-_A_Grid_Handles_Hundreds_of_Millions_of_Requests_a_Month_.html">691 high scalability-2009-08-31-Squarespace Architecture - A Grid Handles Hundreds of Millions of Requests a Month </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I first heard an enthusiastic endorsement of  Squarespace  streaming from the ubiquitous  Leo Laporte  on one of his many Twit Live shows. Squarespace as a  fully hosted, completely managed environment for creating and maintaining a website, blog or portfolio  was of interest to me because they promise scalability and this site doesn't have enough of that. But sadly, since they don't offer a link preserving Drupal import our relationship was not meant to be.  When a fine reader of High Scalability, Brian Egge,  (and all my readers are thrifty, brave, and strong) asked me how Squarespace scaled I said I didn't know, but I would try and find out. I emailed Squarespace a few questions and founder Anthony Casalena and Director of Technical Operations Rolando Berrios were kind enough to reply in some detail. The questions were both from Brian and myself. Answers can be found below.  Two things struck me most about Squarespace's approach:

<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Heroku versus GAE & GAE/J 
 
   Update 3 :   Heroku has gone live! . Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.
 
 Update 2 :  Heroku Architecture . A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors.  Dynos themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware, Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as an application caching layer.
 
 Update : Aaron Worsham   Interview with James Lindenbaum, CEO of Heroku . Aaron nicely sums up their goal: Heroku is</p><p>6 0.67956477 <a title="1613-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-29-How_to_Succeed_at_Capacity_Planning_Without_Really_Trying_%3A__An_Interview_with_Flickr%27s_John_Allspaw_on_His_New_Book.html">643 high scalability-2009-06-29-How to Succeed at Capacity Planning Without Really Trying :  An Interview with Flickr's John Allspaw on His New Book</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi...      I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am building it!  So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking, architecture planning, everything.  I haven't even gotten into the legal aspects yet.......     It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to handle that end of the operation.  I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best.  I'd like to FIND that very best person available, to handle the technical aspects.  For worse or better, I don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.     I've posted a bazillion ads on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses.  I've put out feelers among my own network, same result.  Not sure what else I can do.  Shoestring budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning.  That can actually be a plus, as it forces people to focus.     Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the right person?     Thanks   Jason</p><p>same-blog 2 0.86370319 <a title="1613-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-17-Intuitively_Showing_How_To_Scale_a_Web_Application_Using_a_Coffee_Shop_as_an_Example.html">1613 high scalability-2014-03-17-Intuitively Showing How To Scale a Web Application Using a Coffee Shop as an Example</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a  guest repost  by  Sriram Devadas , Engineer at Vistaprint, Web platform group. A fun and well written analogy of how to scale web applications using a familiar coffee shop as an example. No coffee was harmed during the making of this post. 
 
I own a small coffee shop.   My expense is proportional to resources  100 square feet of built up area with utilities, 1 barista, 1 cup coffee maker.   My shop's capacity  Serves 1 customer at a time, takes 3 minutes to brew a cup of coffee, a total of 5 minutes to serve a customer.   Since my barista works without breaks and the German made coffee maker never breaks down,  my shop's maximum throughput = 12 customers per hour.
       
 
  Web server  
Customers walk away during peak hours. We only serve one customer at a time. There is no space to wait.   I upgrade shop. My new setup is better!

<p>Introduction: Update 3 : Presentation from the  NoSQL conference :  slides ,  video 1 ,  video 2 .
 
 Update 2 : The folks at Hypertable would like you to know that  Hypertable is now officially  sponsored by Baidu , China’s Leading Search Engine.  As a sponsor of Hypertable, Baidu has committed an industrious team of engineers, numerous servers, and support resources to improve the quality and development of the open source technology. 
 
 Update : InfoQ interview on  Hypertable Lead Discusses Hadoop and Distributed Databases . Hypertable differs from HBase in that it is a higher performance implementation of Bigtable.
 
 Skrentablog  gives the heads up on  Hypertable ,  Zvents'  open-source BigTable clone. It's written in C++ and can run on top of either HDFS or KFS. Performance looks encouraging at  28M rows of data inserted at a per-node write rate of 7mb/sec .</p><p>4 0.80820733 <a title="1613-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff_the_Internet_Says_on_Scalability_For_November_12th%2C_2010.html">940 high scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff the Internet Says on Scalability For November 12th, 2010</a></p>

</p><p>5 The mathematical structure of QM, because a wave can be at two places at once, is that the states of QM systems are in fact vectors in high dimensional vector spaces. [sent-30, score-0.147]
</p><p>6 The kind of transformations that happen when particles of light bounce of CDs, for example, are linear transformations on these high dimensional vector spaces. [sent-31, score-0.487]
</p><p>7 Quantum computing is the effort to exploit quantum systems to allow these linear transformations to perform the kind of calculations we want to perform. [sent-32, score-0.323]

</p><p>11 Future archival storage architectures must deliver adequate performance to sustain data-mining as well as low cost. [sent-60, score-0.123]

</p><p>13 Pub-Sub messaging with Zookeeper : Since broadcasting messages means creating a zNode for every consumer which is subscribed to the topic, the performance of the publisher degrades linearly with the number of topic subscribers. [sent-71, score-0.217]

[sent-98, score-0.532]
</p><p>19 And Storm is all about transforming streams of data into new streams of data, you do this by defining what we call a topology where there are basically two things that go into a topology: the first is called a spout and a spout is just a source of streams in a topology.

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: This is one of my favorite posts for a couple of reasons. I think it gives a lot of useful information in an interesting space. And Kyle Vogt was just a real pleasure to talk to. He was very helpful and forthcoming, which makes the whole experience better for everyone. 
 
 
 
The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality augmentation, live crab (fresh and local), and live event publishing. One of the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a  broadcaster  and a consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a time shift war. The resources and the engineering needed to make this happened must be substantial.

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your scaling pleasure: 
  
 Twitterers tweet  200 million tweets  a day. Popular topics are eclectic, ranging from Swine Flu to Rebecca Black. Twitter has a really cool video on the global flow of  tweets in the world . Worth watching. It looks like a rainbow arcing across the northern hemisphere. 
  Amazon Cloud Now Stores 339 Billion Objects , more than doubling last years volume.

  n8foo : My fav part about the new #AWS pricing announcement - 500TB is the level where they say 'contact us'. 
  RoeyYaniv : Scalability guidelines - Technology can and will fail. The business should not.

  @ML_Hipster : A machine learning researcher, a crypto-currency expert, and an Erlang programmer walk into a bar. Facebook buys the bar for $27 billion. 
 OH: Network effects don't happen on toll roads.

<p>Introduction: Update:   Good Vibrations  by Radovan Semančík. Lot's of interesting questions about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.   Google Wave  is a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new, convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users of  Google Wave  and we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to "federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:
  
 Almost 1 Billion Users:  Facebook ; 30,000 connections across 94 locations:  the Olympics Network ; 2.5 quintillion:  bytes of data created each day ; 80K QPS:  MemSQL . 
 In some early results Zencoder found  EC2 was faster than GCE  in their video transcoding tests, saying Google needs larger instances with faster CPUs. Love how  Google's jbeda  said they would take a look at the results. +1 for competition and benchmarks. Something to keep in mind is for  Google a core means :  a hyperthread per virtual CPU. So that means that a n1-standard-8 instance gets 4 physical cores and 8 hyperthreads, not 8 physical cores. 
  Kevin Rose recommends  hiring generalists rather than developers with niche skills; don't give away your company; and thinks advisors should be investors. Founders should also probably stick around and managers shouldn't blame developers. 
 Is  MemSQL  the world's fastest database?

<p>Introduction: In his blog post,  Scaling WSO2 Stratos , Srinath Perera explains the scaling architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure. It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.
 
Overall, WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the paper     WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing .   
  Problem  
 Stratos is   multi-tenanted  . In other words, there are many tenants. Each tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants, where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products (e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, a</p><p>5 0.8800056 <a title="1630-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-21-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_21st%2C_2014.html">1617 high scalability-2014-03-21-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 21st, 2014</a></p>

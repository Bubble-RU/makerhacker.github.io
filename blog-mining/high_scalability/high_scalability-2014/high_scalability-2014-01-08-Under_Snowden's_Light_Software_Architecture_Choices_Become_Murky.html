<p>Introduction: This article is from an interview with    Zuhaib Siddique   , a production engineer at    HipChat   , makers of     group chat and IM for teams.  
   HipChat started in an unusual space, one you might not think would have much promise, enterprise group messaging, but as we are learning there is gold in them there    enterprise hills   . Which is why Atlassian, makers of well thought of tools like JIRA and Confluence,    acquired HipChat in 2012   . 
   And in a tale not often heard, the resources and connections of a larger parent have actually helped HipChat enter an    exponential growth cycle   . Having reached the 1.2 billion message storage mark they are now doubling the number of messages sent, stored, and indexed every few months. 
   That kind of growth puts a lot of pressure on a once adequate infrastructure. HipChat exhibited a common scaling pattern. Start simple, experience traffic spikes, and then think what do we do now?

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

<p>Introduction: Update: :  Eucalyptus Goes Commercial with $5.5M Funding Round .  This removes my objection that it's an academic project only. Go team go!   Rich Wolski , professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, gave a spirited talk on  Eucalyptus  to a large group of very interested cloudsters at the  Eucalyptus Cloud Meetup . If Rich could teach computer science at every school the state of the computer science industry would be stratospheric. Rich is dynamic, smart, passionate, and visionary. It's that vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement Eucalyptus and have been improving it and tracking Amazon's changes ever since.

<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days – you only needed one, but then came along the AS400’s and soon you had ten – but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh sh%# – now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and datacenter operations!
 
 Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path? 
 
As a technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other CIO’s on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context to how they can leverage SpringCM’ s easy, fast and affordable cloud Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud services.
 
 What options do I have?

<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a  meetup  Wednesday on  OpenStack , whose tag line is  the open source, open standards cloud . I was shocked at the large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems to be. 
 
The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:
  
 OpenStack allows any organization to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage</p><p>6 0.78408551 <a title="1575-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-Classifying_XTP_systems_and_how_cloud_changes_which_type_startups_will_use.html">531 high scalability-2009-03-11-Classifying XTP systems and how cloud changes which type startups will use</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A recent   InfoWorld article   claims that "With Cisco expected to enter the blade market and Sun expected to offer networking equipment, things could get interesting awfully fast." How does this effect your infrastructure strategy and decisions?     Would you consider to build scalable web applications on the Cisco Unified Computing System? Or would you consider to build a router out of a server with the use of OpenSolaris and Project Crossbow as the article suggests? Will any of these initiatives change the way we build scalable web infrastructure or are these just attempts to sale these systems?     What do you think?</p><p>same-blog 2 0.93820465 <a title="1575-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-08-Under_Snowden%27s_Light_Software_Architecture_Choices_Become_Murky.html">1575 high scalability-2014-01-08-Under Snowden's Light Software Architecture Choices Become Murky</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adrian Cockcroft on the future of    Cloud, Open Source, SaaS and the End of Enterprise Computing   :  
  
   Most big enterprise companies are actively working on their AWS rollout now. Most of them are also trying to get an in-house cloud to work, with varying amounts of success, but even the best private clouds are still years behind the feature set of public clouds, which is has a big impact on the agility and speed of product development  

    While the    Snowden revelations    have tattered the thin veil of trust secreting Big Brother from We the People, they may also be driving a fascinating new tension in architecture choices between Cloud Native (scale-out, IaaS), Amazon Native (rich service dependencies), and Enterprise Native (raw hardware, scale-up). 
   This tension became evident in a recent    HipChat interview    where HipChat, makers of an AWS based SaaS chat product, were busy creating an on-premises version of their product that could operate behind the firewall in</p><p>3 0.90817261 <a title="1575-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-05-Product%3A_Tungsten_Replicator.html">380 high scalability-2008-09-05-Product: Tungsten Replicator</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model, which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model, networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sunâ&euro;&trade;s VeriScale architecture provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures for more than a decade. The features of these architectures, such as elasticity, ar</p><p>6 0.90434361 <a title="1575-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-06-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_6th%2C_2011.html">1036 high scalability-2011-05-06-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 6th, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: LevelDB  is an exciting new entrant into the pantheon of embedded databases, notable both for its pedigree, being authored by the makers of the now mythical Google MapReduce and BigTable products, and for its emphasis on efficient disk based random access using log-structured-merge (LSM) trees. 
 
The plan is to keep LevelDB fairly low-level. The intention is that it will be a useful building block for higher-level storage systems. Basho is  already investigating  using LevelDB as one if its storage engines.
 
In the past many systems were built around embedded databases, though most developers now use database servers connected to via RPCs. An embedded database is a database distributed as a library and linked directly into your application. The application is responsible for providing a service level API, sharding, backups, initiating consistency checking, initiation rollback,  startup, shutdown, queries, etc. Applications become the container for the database and the manager of the</p><p>3 0.080255002 <a title="1580-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-02-YouPorn_-_Targeting_200_Million_Views_a_Day_and_Beyond.html">1220 high scalability-2012-04-02-YouPorn - Targeting 200 Million Views a Day and Beyond</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update : Here's the  video of the talk .
 
  Erick Pickup  , lead developer at YouPorn.com, presented their architecture in a talk titled   Building a Website To Scale   given at the   ConFoo   conference.  As you might expect, YouPorn is a beast, streaming three full DVDs of video every second, handing 300K queries every second, and generating up to 15GBs of log data per hour.  Unfortunately, all we have are the slides of the talk, so this article isn’t as technical as I might like, there’s no visibility at all on the video handling for example, but we do get some interesting details.  The most interesting takeway is that YouPorn is a pretty conventional LAMP stack, with a NoSQL twist as Redis now replaces MySQL in the live datapath. Reminds me a little of   YouTube   in its simplicity.   The second most interesting takeaway was the  great switchover . Common wisdom says never rewrite, but in 2011 YouPorn rewrote their entire site to use PHP + Redis instead of a complex Perl + MySQL b</p><p>4 0.07381203 <a title="1580-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-26-Reddit%3A_Lessons_Learned_from_Mistakes_Made_Scaling_to_1_Billion_Pageviews_a_Month.html">1507 high scalability-2013-08-26-Reddit: Lessons Learned from Mistakes Made Scaling to 1 Billion Pageviews a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg   , the first paid employee at reddit, teaches us a lot about how to create a successful social site in a really good talk he gave at the RAMP conference. Watch it here at  Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion–Pitfalls and Lessons .  
 
 Jeremy uses a virtue and sin approach. Examples of the mistakes made in scaling reddit are shared and it turns out they did a lot of good stuff too. Somewhat of a shocker is that   Jeremy is now a Reliability Architect at Netflix, so we get a little Netflix perspective thrown in for free. 
 
 Some of the lessons that stood out most for me:  
  
  Think of SSDs as cheap RAM, not expensive disk . When reddit moved from spinning disks to SSDs for the database the number of servers was reduced from 12 to 1 with a ton of headroom. SSDs are 4x more expensive but you get 16x the performance. Worth the cost.  
  Give users a little bit of power, see what they do with it, and turn the good stuff into features .

<p>Introduction: In  How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack  Salvatore 'antirez' Sanfilippo shows how to solve some common problems in Redis by taking advantage of its unique data structure handling capabilities. Common Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these tasks in your framework?
  
  Show latest items listings in your home page . This is a live in-memory cache and is very fast.  LPUSH  is used to insert a content ID at the head of the list stored at a key.  LTRIM  is used to limit the number of items in the list to 5000. If the user needs to page beyond this cache only then are they sent to the database. 
  Deletion and filtering . If a cached article is deleted it can be removed from the cache using  LREM .

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO of  Playtomic . Playtomic is a game analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games played by approximately 20 million people daily. 
 
 Here's a good summary quote by  Ben Lowry on Hacker News : 
  
 Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday 700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated a whole bunch of them very cheaply. 
  
Playtomic began with an almost exclusively Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then spread to second dedicated, then the API server was offloaded to a VPS pro</p><p>3 0.69161212 <a title="1580-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-19-Product%3A_Redis_-_Not_Just_Another_Key-Value_Store.html">545 high scalability-2009-03-19-Product: Redis - Not Just Another Key-Value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the introduction of  Redis  your options in the key-value space just grew and your choice of which to pick just got a lot harder. But when you think about it, that's not a bad position to be in at all.  Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) -  a key-value database. It's similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists and sets with atomic operations to push/pop elements.   The key points are: open source; speed (benchmarked performing 110,000 SET operations, and 81,000 GETs, per second); persistence, but in an asynchronous way taking everything in memory; support for higher level data structures and atomic operations.  The home page is well organized so I'll spare the excessive-copying-to-make-this-post-longer. For a good overview of Redis take a look at Antonio Cangiano's article:  Introducing Redis: a fast key-value database .

<p>Introduction: Func  is used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It  targets easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you know what a total nightmare that can be.  Some example commands:
   Using the command line: func "*.example.org" call yumcmd update  Using the Pthon API: import func.overlord.client as fc client = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com") client.yumcmd.update() client.service.start("acme-server") print client.hardware.info()

I owe High Scalability a great deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used at  Tumblr , and it kicked some ideas into gear.  This article is about what happened from that idea.
 
My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't been good at all three jobs.
 
My other observation (not from the article) was that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of</p><p>6 0.65517491 <a title="1580-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-28-Design_Decisions_for_Scaling_Your_High_Traffic_Feeds.html">1538 high scalability-2013-10-28-Design Decisions for Scaling Your High Traffic Feeds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable, which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.  Abstract:
   The long-running nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across multiple queries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their constituent, stateful operators â&euro;&ldquo; e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators. To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static techniques for partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue to function robustly in the face of these imbalances. To address this challenge, we introduce</p><p>2 0.90877682 <a title="1580-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy%3A_Stop_Using_Linked-Lists.html">1462 high scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy: Stop Using Linked-Lists</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What data structure is more sacred than the link list? If we get rid of it what silly interview questions would we use instead? But not using linked-lists is exactly what Aater Suleman recommends in  Should you ever use Linked-Lists?  
 
In  The Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connections  one of the important strategies is not scribbling data all over memory via pointers because following pointers increases cache misses which  reduces performance . And there’s nothing more iconic of pointers than the link list.
 
Here are Aeter's reasons to be anti-linked-list:
  
 They reduce the benefit of out-of-order execution.  
 They throw off hardware prefetching.  
 They reduce DRAM and TLB locality.  
 They cannot leverage SIMD.  
 They are harder to send to GPUs.  
  
He also demolishes the pros of linked-lists, finding arrays a better option in almost every case. Good discussion in the comment section as not everyone agrees.

<p>Introduction: I don't know about you, but when I first learned about Redis my initial thought was wow, why hasn't anyone done this before? My next thought was why put this functionality in a separate process? Why not just embed it in your own server code and skip the network path completely? Especially in a Service Oriented Architecture there's no need for an extra hop or extra software installation and configuration.
 
Now you can embed Redis-like code directly into your server with  Vedis  - an  embeddable datastore  C library built with over 70 commands similar in concept to Redis but without the networking layer since Vedis run in the same process of the host application. It's transactional, cross platform, thread safe, key-value, supports terabyte sized databases, has a GPL-like license (which isn't great for commercial apps), and supports an on-disk as well as in-memory datastore.

Unlike most other datastores (i.e. memcache, Redis), Vedis does not have a separate server</p><p>4 0.88652003 <a title="1580-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-22-Gear6_Web_cache_-_the_hardware_solution_for_working_with_Memcache.html">577 high scalability-2009-04-22-Gear6 Web cache - the hardware solution for working with Memcache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Gear6 Web Cache hybrid DRAM-flash memory architecture allows for 5-10 times more memcache memory per unit of rack space than DRAM-only configurations, and cuts memory costs by 50%. Other software enhancements include a slab allocator that is more efficient than traditional memcache implementations due to its fine-grained bucket sizing. Gear6 Web Cache also supports object sizes greater than 1 megabyte and manages evictions based on the cost of replacing objects, depending on the size and frequency of object access. It intelligently places cache instances across DRAM and flash, taking into account their different characteristics, while at the same time monitoring their health and detecting and deâ&euro;?allocating faulty or failing memory.  Gear6 Web Cache is a Memcached protocol compliant solution that scales and accelerates web applications, reduces memory footprint, enhances availability and implements comprehensive Memcached management features. Designed to work with all popular memcac</p><p>5 0.86670768 <a title="1580-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-23-Database_Sharding_at_Netlog%2C_with_MySQL_and_PHP.html">519 high scalability-2009-02-23-Database Sharding at Netlog, with MySQL and PHP</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jurriaan Persyn is a Lead Web Developer at Netlog, a social portal site that gets 50 million unique visitors and 5+ billion page views per month. In this paper Jurriaan goes into a lot of excellent nuts and bolts details about how they used sharding to scale their system. If you are pondering sharding as a solution to your scaling problems you'll want to read this paper. As the paper is quite well organized there's no reason to write a summary, but I especially liked this part from the conclusion:       If you can do with simpler solutions (better hardware, more hardware, server tweaking and tuning, vertical partitioning, sql query optimization, ...) that require less development cost, why invest lots of effort in sharding? On the other hand, when your visitor statistics really start blowing through the roof, it is a good direction to go. After all, it worked for us.</p><p>6 0.85654318 <a title="1580-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-15-Strategy%3A_Biggest_Performance_Impact_is_to_Reduce_the_Number_of_HTTP_Requests.html">942 high scalability-2010-11-15-Strategy: Biggest Performance Impact is to Reduce the Number of HTTP Requests</a></p>

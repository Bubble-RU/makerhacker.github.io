Quotes:@jimplush: Google spent 2.3 billion on infrastructure in Q1. Remember
that when you say you want to be "the Google of something"Clay Shirky: I think
one of the things that happened to the P2P market for infrastructure is that
users preference for predictable pricing vs resource-sensitive pricing is so
overwhelming that they will overpay to anyone who can promise flat prices. And
because the logic of centralization vs decentralization is so price sensitive,
I don't think there is any logical reason to assume a broadly stable class of
apps, separate from current pricing data for energy, cycles, and
storage.@chipchilders: Stop freaking making new projects just for the sake of

Istanbul.I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together
with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I
contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.Those were the days
our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and
applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot
of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we
can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml
descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to
use the curse called "XDoclet".On the other side, our company grew steadily,
our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and
ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew
considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of
money.

<p>Introduction: Yes, I just got through watching the Superbowl so chips and salsa are on my
mind and in my stomach. In recreational eating more chips requires downing
more salsa. With mulitcore chips it turns out as cores go up salsa goes down,
salsa obviously being a metaphor for speed.Sandia National Laboratories found
in their simulations:a significant increase in speed going from two to four
multicores, but an insignificant increase from four to eight multicores.
Exceeding eight multicores causes a decrease in speed. Sixteen multicores
perform barely as well as two, and after that, a steep decline is registered
as more cores are added. The problem is the lack of memory bandwidth as well
as contention between processors over the memory bus available to each
processor.The implication for those following a diagonal scaling strategy is
to work like heck to make your system fit within eight multicores. After that
you'll need to consider some sort of partitioning strategy. What's interesting

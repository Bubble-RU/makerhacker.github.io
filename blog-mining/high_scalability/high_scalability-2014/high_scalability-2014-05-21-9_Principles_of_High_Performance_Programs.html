<p>Introduction: Most every programmer who gets sucked into deep performance analysis for long
running processes eventually realizes memory allocation is the heart of evil
at the center of many of their problems. So you replace malloc with something
less worse. Or you tune your garbage collector like a fine ukulele. But
there's a smarter approach brought to you from the folks atRAMCloud, a
Stanford University production, which is a large scale, distributed, in-memory
key-value database.What they've found is that typical memory management
approaches don't work and using a log structured approach yields massive
benefits:Performance measurements of log-structured memory in RAMCloud show
that it enables high client through- put at 80-90% memory utilization, even
with artificially stressful workloads. In the most stressful workload, a
single RAMCloud server can support 270,000-410,000 durable 100-byte writes per
second at 90% memory utilization. The two-level approach to cleaning improves
performance by up</p><p>3 0.13230176 <a title="1652-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Are_Cloud_Based_Memory_Architectures_the_Next_Big_Thing%3F.html">538 high scalability-2009-03-16-Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big Thing?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip

scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's

<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process
level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback
models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple
models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to
make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like
work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.But that's not
all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be
composed across threads of control.Your favorite language may not give you
access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there
has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially
for controlling latency variance, so I think it's time to talk about these
kind of issues. When it was do everything in the thread of a web server thread
pool none of these issues really mattered. But now that developers are

<p>Introduction: It's not often you get so enthusiastic a recommendation for a paper as Sergio
Bossa gives Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers: If you only
want to read one piece about CPUs architecture, cache coherency and memory
barriers, make it this one.It is a clear and well written article. It even has
a quiz. What's it about?So what possessed CPU designers to cause them to
inﬂict memory barriers on poor unsuspecting SMP software designers?In short,
because reordering memory references allows much better performance, and so
memory barriers are needed to force ordering in things like synchronization
primitives whose correct operation depends on ordered memory
references.Getting a more detailed answer to this question requires a good
understanding of how CPU caches work, and especially what is required to make
caches really work well. The following sections:present the structure of a
cache,describe how cache-coherency protocols ensure that CPUs agree on the
value of each location</p><p>3 0.79925776 <a title="1652-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-16-Big_List_of_20_Common_Bottlenecks.html">1246 high scalability-2012-05-16-Big List of 20 Common Bottlenecks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InZen And The Art Of Scaling - A Koan And Epigram Approach,Russell
Sullivanoffered an interesting conjecture: there are 20 classic bottlenecks.
This sounds suspiciously like the idea that there only20 basic story plots.
And depending on how you chunkify things, it may be true, but in practice we
all know bottlenecks come in infinite flavors, all tasting of sour and ash.One
dayAurelien Broszniowskifrom Terracotta emailed me his list of bottlenecks, we
cc'ed Russell in on the conversation, he gave me his list, I have a list, and
here's the resulting stone soup.Russell said this is his "I wish I knew when I
was younger" list and I think that's an enriching way to look at it. The more
experience you have, the more different types of projects you tackle, the more
lessons you'll be able add to a list like this. So when you read this list,
and when you make your own, you are stepping through years of accumulated
experience and more than a little frustration, but in each there is a story

<p>Introduction: Stardog makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can
be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a recent article
StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable,
improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now
handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It
can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. What did they do
that you can also do?Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data
structures. For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue.Use
ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid
synchronization.Batch LRU evictions in a single thread. Triggered by several
LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by
additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times.Move to
SHA1 for hashing URIs, bnodes, and literal values. Making hash collisions

<p>Introduction: Martin Thompson, a high-performance technology geek, has written an awesome
post,Fun with my-Channels Nirvana and Azul Zing. In it Martin shows the
process and techniques he used to take an existing messaging product, written
in Java, and increase throughput by 32X and reduce latency by  20X. The
article is very well written with lots of interesting details that make it
well worth reading.The TechniquesThe techniques are a good mix of Java
independent approaches, things you may have heard of before, things you
probably haven't heard of  before, and Java specific heroics. The obvious
winning technique is to create a lock free flow through the system. This
shouldn't be surprising as Martin teaches what sounds like a really goodlock-
free concurrency course.Do not use locks in the main transaction flow because

<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

<p>Introduction: Update:New Gearman Server & Library in C, MySQL UDFs.Gearmanis an open
sourcemessage queuingsystem that makes it easy to do distributed job
processing using multiple languages. With Gearman you:farm out work to other
machines, dispatching function calls to machines that are better suited to do
work, to do work in parallel, to load balance lots of function calls, to call
functions between languages, spread CPU usage around your network.Gearman is
used by companies like LiveJournal, Yahoo!, and Digg. Digg, for example, runs
300,000 jobs a day through Gearman without any issues. Most large sites use
something similar. Why would anyone ever even need a message queuing
system?breakMessage queuing is a handy way to move work off your web servers
(like image manipulation), to generate thousands of documents in the
background, to run the multiple requests in parallel needed to build a web
page, or to perform tasks that can comfortably be run in the background and

<p>Introduction: Arvid Norbergon thelibtorrent bloghas put together an excellent list
ofprinciples of high performance programs, obviously derived from hard won
experience programming on bittorrent:Two fundamental causes of performance
problems:Memory Latency. A big performance problem on modern computers is the
latency of SDRAM. The CPU waits idle for a read from memory to come
back.Context Switching. When a CPU switches context "the memory it will access
is most likely unrelated to the memory the previous context was accessing.
This often results in significant eviction of the previous cache, and requires
the switched-to context to load much of its data from RAM, which is
slow."Rules to help balance the forces of evil:Batch work. Avoid context
switching by batching work. For example, there are vector versions of system
calls like writev() and readv() that operate on more than one item per call.
An implication is that you want to merge as many writes as possible.Avoid
Magic Numbers. They don't scale.</p><p>5 0.87950391 <a title="1652-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_28th%2C_2014.html">1621 high scalability-2014-03-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 28th, 2014</a></p>

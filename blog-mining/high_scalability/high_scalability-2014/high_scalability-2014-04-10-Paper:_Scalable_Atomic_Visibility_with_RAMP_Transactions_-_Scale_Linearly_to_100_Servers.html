<p>Introduction: A lot of people seem to passionately dislike the termNewSQL, or pretty much
any newly coined term for that matter, but after watching Alex Lloyd, Senior
Staff Software Engineer Google, give a great talkon Building Spanner, that's
the term that fits Spanner best.Spanner wraps the SQL + transaction model of
OldSQL around the reworked bones of a globally distributed NoSQL system. That
seems NewSQL to me.As Spanner is a not so distant cousin of BigTable, the
NoSQL component should be no surprise. Spanner is charged with spanning
millions of machines inside any number of geographically distributed
datacenters. What is surprising is how OldSQL has been embraced. In anearlier
2011 talkgiven by Alex at the HotStorage conference, the reason for embracing
OldSQL was the desire to make it easier and faster for programmers to build
applications. The main ideas will seem quite familiar:There's a false
dichotomy between little complicated databases and huge, scalable, simple
ones. We can have featur</p><p>3 0.13051505 <a title="1629-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-16-Paper%3A_Warp%3A_Multi-Key_Transactions_for_Key-Value_Stores.html">1459 high scalability-2013-05-16-Paper: Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency

architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by

<p>Introduction: We've seen a lot ofNoSQLaction lately built around distributed hash tables.
Btrees are getting jealous. Btrees, once the king of the database world, want
their throne back.Paul Buchheitsurfaced a paper:A practical scalable
distributed B-treeby Marcos K. Aguilera and Wojciech Golab, that might help
spark a revolution.From the Abstract:We propose a new algorithm for a
practical, fault tolerant, and scalable B-tree distributed over a set of
servers. Our algorithm supports practical features not present in prior work:
transactions that allow atomic execution of multiple operations over multiple
B-trees, online migration of B-tree nodes between servers, and dynamic
addition and removal of servers. Moreover, our algorithm is conceptually
simple: we use transactions to manipulate B-tree nodes so that clients need
not use complicated concurrency and locking protocols used in prior work. To
execute these transactions quickly, we rely on three techniques: (1) We use
optimistic concurrency contro</p><p>5 0.10861956 <a title="1629-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Dealing_with_multi-partition_transactions_in_a_distributed_KV_solution.html">623 high scalability-2009-06-10-Dealing with multi-partition transactions in a distributed KV solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've been getting asked about this a lot lately so I figured I'd just blog
about it. Products like WebSphere eXtreme Scale work by taking a dataset,
partitioning it using a key and then assigning those partitions to a number of
JVMs. Each partition usually has a primary and a replica. These 'shards' are
assigned to JVMs. A transactional application typically interacts with the
data on a single partition at a time. This means the transaction is executed
in a single JVM. A server box will be able to do M of those transactions per
second and it scales because N boxes does MN (M multiplied by N) transactions
per second. Increase N, you get more transactions per second. Availability is
very good because a transaction only depends on 1 of the N servers that are
currently online. Any of the other (N-1) servers can go down or fail with no
impact on the transaction. So, single partition transactions can scale
indefinitely from a throughput point of view, offer very consistent response
times and</p><p>6 0.10615636 <a title="1629-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">191 high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Can you have your ACID cake and eat your distributed database too? Yes
explains Daniel Abadi, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Yale
University, in an epic post,The problems with ACID, and how to fix them
without going NoSQL, coauthored with Alexander Thomson, on their paperThe Case
for Determinism in Database Systems. We've already seenVoltDBoffer the best of
both worlds, this sounds like a completely different approach.The solution,
they propose, is: ...an architecture and execution model that avoids deadlock,
copes with failures without aborting transactions, and achieves high
concurrency. The paper contains full details, but the basic idea is to use
ordered locking coupled with optimistic lock location prediction, while
exploiting deterministic systems' nice replication properties in the case of
failures.The problem they are trying to solve is:In our opinion, the NoSQL
decision to give up on ACID is the lazy solution to these scalability and
replication issues.

<p>Introduction: Distributed transactions are costly because they useagreement protocols.
Calvin says, surprisingly, that using a deterministic database allows you to
avoid the use of agreement protocols. The approach is to use a deterministic
transaction layer that does all the hard work before acquiring locks and the
beginning of transaction execution.Overview:Many distributed storage systems
achieve high data access throughput via partitioning and replication, each
system with its own advantages and tradeoffs. In order to achieve high
scalability, however, today's systems generally reduce transactional support,
disallowing single transactions from spanning multiple partitions. Calvin is a
practical transaction scheduling and data replication layer that uses a
deterministic ordering guarantee to signiďŹ cantly reduce the normally
prohibitive contention costs associated with distributed transactions. Unlike
previous deterministic database system prototypes, Calvin supports disk-based

<p>Introduction: How does Facebook handle the massive New Year's Eve traffic spike? Thanks to
Mike Swift, in Facebook gets ready for New Year's Eve, we get a little insight
as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still
interesting.Problem SetupFacebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be
shared on New Year's eve.Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the
world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average
of 130 friends.Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a
homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those
requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then
rendered.Different events put different stresses on different parts of
Facebook. Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of
capacity News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve
Jobs drive user status updatesCoping StrategiesTry to predictthe surge in

<p>Introduction: We are not yet at the End of History for database theory asPeter Bailisand
theDatabase Groupat UC Berkeley continue to prove with a greatcompanion blog
post to their new paper: Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions. I
like the approach of pairing a blog post with a paper. A paper almost by
definition is formal, but a blog post can help put a paper in context and give
it some heart.From the abstract:Databases can provide scalability by
partitioning data across several servers. However, multi-partition, multi-
operation transactional access is often expensive, employing coordination-
intensive locking, validation, or scheduling mechanisms. Accordingly, many
real-world systems avoid mechanisms that provide useful semantics formulti-
partition operations. This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of
applications including secondary indexing,foreign key enforcement, and
materialized view maintenance. In this work, we identify a new isolation model

<p>Introduction: I have a few apache servers ( arround 11 atm ) serving a small amount of data
( arround 44 gigs right now ).For some time I have been using rsync to keep
all the content equal on all servers, but the amount of data has been growing,
and rsync takes a few too much time to "compare" all data from source to
destination, and create a lot of I/O.I have been taking a look at MogileFS, it
seems a good and reliable option, but as the fuse module is not finished, we
should have to rewrite all our apps, and its not an option atm.Any ideas?I
just want a "real time, non resource-hungry" solution alternative for rsync.
If I get more features on the way, then they are welcome :)Why I prefer to use
a Distributed File System instead of using NAS + NFS?- I need 2 NAS, if I dont
want a point of failure, and NAS hard is expensive.- Non-shared hardware, all
server has their own local disks.- As files are replicated, I can save a lot
of money, RAID is not a MUST.Thnx in advance for your help and sorry for</p><p>4 0.87606865 <a title="1629-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-10-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_28%2C_2011.html">1134 high scalability-2011-10-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 28, 2011</a></p>

Redis. Not quite honest to say no cache was used as everything is RAM, but
maybe that's the point. Use a lot of automation. Inactive users are archived.

<p>Introduction: Think of building websites as engineeringcomposite materials. A composite
material is when two or more materials are combined to create a third material
that does something useful that the components couldn't do on their own.
Composites like reinforced concrete have revolutionized design and
construction. When building websites we usually bring different component
materials together, like creating a composite, to get the features we need
rather than building a completely new thing from scratch that does everything
we want.This approach has been seen as a hack because it leads to inelegancies
like data duplication; great gobs of component glue; consistency issues; and
messy operations. But what if the the composite approach is really a strength,
not a hack, but a messy part of the world that needs to be embraced rather
than belittled?They key is tosee data as a material. Right now we are arguing
which is the best single material to build with. Is itNoSQL, relational,
massively parallel,</p><p>6 0.87259132 <a title="1629-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-25-StubHub_Architecture%3A_The_Surprising_Complexity_Behind_the_World%E2%80%99s_Largest_Ticket_Marketplace.html">1271 high scalability-2012-06-25-StubHub Architecture: The Surprising Complexity Behind the World’s Largest Ticket Marketplace</a></p>

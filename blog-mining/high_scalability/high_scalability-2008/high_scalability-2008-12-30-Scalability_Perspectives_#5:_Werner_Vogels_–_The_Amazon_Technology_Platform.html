<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

SXSW and features some energetic trash talking by: Stu Hood from Cassandra,
Jan Lehnardt from CouchDB, Wynn Netherland from The Changelog, subbing for
MongoDB, Werner Vogels CTO at Amazon. It's fun hearing these guys step out of
their sober advocacy roles and let loose a little with why they are great and
the other products suck, hard.Algorithmic Graph Theory. It's FREE!A GNU-FDL

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: Update::Eucalyptus Goes Commercial with $5.5M Funding Round. This removes my
objection that it's an academic project only. Go team go!Rich Wolski,
professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
gave a spirited talk onEucalyptusto a large group of very interested
cloudsters at theEucalyptus Cloud Meetup. If Rich could teach computer science
at every school the state of the computer science industry would be
stratospheric. Rich is dynamic, smart, passionate, and visionary. It's that
vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his
group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and
glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he
decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as
a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement
Eucalyptus and have been improving it and tracking Amazon's changes ever
since.The question I had going into t</p><p>4 0.79223013 <a title="480-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-08-Under_Snowden%27s_Light_Software_Architecture_Choices_Become_Murky.html">1575 high scalability-2014-01-08-Under Snowden's Light Software Architecture Choices Become Murky</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adrian Cockcroft on the future ofCloud, Open Source, SaaS and the End of
Enterprise Computing:Most big enterprise companies are actively working on
their AWS rollout now. Most of them are also trying to get an in-house cloud
to work, with varying amounts of success, but even the best private clouds are
still years behind the feature set of public clouds, which is has a big impact
on the agility and speed of product developmentWhile theSnowden
revelationshave tattered the thin veil of trust secreting Big Brother from We
the People, they may also be driving a fascinating new tension in architecture
choices between Cloud Native (scale-out, IaaS), Amazon Native (rich service
dependencies), and Enterprise Native (raw hardware, scale-up).This tension
became evident in a recentHipChat interviewwhere HipChat, makers of an AWS
based SaaS chat product, were busy creating an on-premises version of their
product that could operate behind the firewall in enterprise datacenters. This

services interface to create and store multiple data sets, query your data
easily, and return the results. Together with the Simple Storage Service (S3),

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Werner VogelsDr. Werner Vogels is Vice President & Chief
Technology Officer at Amazon.com where he is responsible for driving the
company’s technology vision, which is to continuously enhance the innovation
on behalf of Amazon’s customers at a global scale. Prior to joining Amazon, he
worked as a researcher at Cornell University where he was a principal
investigator in several research projects that target the scalability and
robustness of mission-critical enterprise computing systems. He is regarded as
one of the world's top experts on ultra-scalable systems and he uses his
weblog to educate the community about issues such as eventual consistency.

<p>Introduction: An interesting and different implementation approach: Tempest: Scalable Time-
Critical Web Services Platform: Tempest is a new framework for developing
time-critical web services. Tempest enables developers to build scalable,
fault-tolerant services that can then be automatically replicated and deployed
across clusters of computing nodes. The platform automatically adapts to load
ďŹ&sbquo;uctuations, reacts when components fail, and ensures consistency between
replicas by repairing when inconsistencies do occur. Tempest relies on a
family of epidemic protocols and on Ricochet, a reliable time critical
multicast protocol with probabilistic guarantees.Tempest is built around a
novel storage abstraction called the TempestCollection in which application
developers store the state of a service. Our platform handles the replication
of this state across clones of the service, persistence, and failure handling.

developer, th</p><p>5 0.85272419 <a title="480-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-11-Facebook%2C_Hadoop%2C_and_Hive.html">596 high scalability-2009-05-11-Facebook, Hadoop, and Hive</a></p>

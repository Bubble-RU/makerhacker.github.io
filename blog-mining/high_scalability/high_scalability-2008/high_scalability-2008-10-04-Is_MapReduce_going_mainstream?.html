<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:
 
Now that we have a new computing paradigm, Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds? Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space, and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are a number of issues driving this uncertainty.

<p>Introduction: Art of Distributed   Part 1: Rethinking about distributed computing models  
I â&euro;&tilde;m getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability, and distributed storage systems.   Download the article in PDF format.   Download the article in MS Word format.   I wait for your comments, and questions, and I will answer it in part two.</p><p>4 0.1207296 <a title="401-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-04-Paper%3A_MapReduce%3A_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters.html">483 high scalability-2009-01-04-Paper: MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   MapReduce and PageRank Notes from Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau's Fall 2008 class  . Collects interesting facts about MapReduce and PageRank. For example, the history of the solution to searching for the term "flu" is traced through multiple generations of technology.   With Google entering the cloud space with  Google AppEngine  and a maturing  Hadoop  product, the MapReduce scaling approach might finally become a standard programmer practice. This is the best paper on the subject and is an excellent primer on a content-addressable memory future.  Some interesting stats from the paper: Google executes 100k MapReduce jobs each day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.  One common criticism ex-Googlers have is that it takes months to get up and be productive in the Google environment. Hopefully a way will be found to lower the learning curve a</p><p>5 0.10250118 <a title="401-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-04-Dremel%3A_Interactive_Analysis_of_Web-Scale_Datasets_-_Data_as_a_Programming_Paradigm.html">871 high scalability-2010-08-04-Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets - Data as a Programming Paradigm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If Google was a boxer then MapReduce would be a probing right hand that sets up the massive left hook that is  Dremel , Google's—scalable (thousands of CPUs, petabytes of data, trillions of rows), SQL based, columnar, interactive (results returned in seconds), ad-hoc—analytics system. If Google was a magician then MapReduce would be the shiny thing that distracts the mind while the trick goes unnoticed. I say that because even though Dremel has been around internally at Google since 2006, we have not heard a whisper about it. All we've heard about is MapReduce, clones of which have inspired entire new industries.  Tricky .
 
Dremel, according to Brian Bershad, Director of Engineering at Google, is targeted at solving  BigData class problems :

<p>Introduction: Disco  is an open-source implementation of the MapReduce framework for distributed computing.  It was started at  Nokia Research Center  as a lightweight framework for rapid scripting of distributed data processing tasks.   The Disco core is written in Erlang. The MapReduce jobs in Disco are natively described as Python programs, which makes it possible to express complex algorithmic and data processing tasks often only in tens of lines of code.</p><p>6 0.67203683 <a title="401-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-01-Scale-out_vs_Scale-up.html">891 high scalability-2010-09-01-Scale-out vs Scale-up</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yahoo has developed a new language called Pig Latin that fit in a sweet spot between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level, procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.  The accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined Hadoop as a subproject.  The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo! are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and execution of their data analysis tasks, compared to using Hadoop directly.

<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming your business – reports are out of date, your batch processing window is nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database consolidation – remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware, OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are clear,  what now?﻿

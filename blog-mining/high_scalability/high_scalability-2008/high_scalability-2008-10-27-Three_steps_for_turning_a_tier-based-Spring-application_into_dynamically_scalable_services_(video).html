<p>Introduction: Today GigaSpaceslaunchedtheOpenSpaces Developer Challenge, which will award
$25,000 in prizes to developers who build the most unique and innovative
applications or plug-ins for theOpenSpaces Framework. OpenSpaces is an open
source development solution fromGigaSpacesfor building linearly scalable
software applications. It is widely used in a variety of industries, such as
Wall Street trading applications, telecommunications platforms and online
gaming.The Challenge is designed to encourage innovation around OpenSpaces and
support the developer community. Prizes ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 will be
awarded to those who submit the most promising applications that were built
using OpenSpaces, or plug-ins, and other components that extend OpenSpaces in
pioneering ways.The OpenSpaces development framework is designed to simply and

<p>Introduction: An unstated assumption is that clouds are scalable. But are they? Stick
thousands upon thousands of machines together and there are a lot of potential
bottlenecks just waiting to choke off your scalability supply. And if the
cloud is scalable what are the chances that your application is really
linearly scalable? At 10 machines all may be well. Even at 50 machines the
seas look calm. But at 100, 200, or 500 machines all hell might break loose.
How do you know?You know through real life testing. These kinds of tests are
brutally hard and complicated. who wants to do all the incredibly precise and
difficult work of producing cloud scalability tests?GridDynamicshas stepped up
to the challenge and has just released theirCloud Performance Reports.The
report is quite detailed so I'll just cover what I found most interesting.

<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of
Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of
the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data
servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective,
flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute- and data-intensive
applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of
systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory,
and delivers 47.38 trillion1 floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS)
of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to
users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment
architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future. This
Sun BluePrints article provides an overview of the Tokyo Tech grid, named
TSUBAME. The third in a series of Sun BluePrints articles on the TSUBAME grid,

<p>Introduction: It started out innocently enough with a simple question, "What exactly *is*
the model for PaaS services scalability? If based on HTTP/REST API
integration, fairly easy. If native middleware… input?" You'll forgive the odd
phrasing - Twitter's limitations sometimes make conversations of this nature …
interesting.The discussion culminated in what appeared to be the sentiment
that middleware was mostly obsolete with respect to PaaS.THE OLD WAYVery
briefly for those of you who are more infrastructure / network minded than
application architecture fluent, let's review the traditional middleware-based
application architecture.Generally speaking, middleware - a.k.a. JMS, MQ
Series and most recently, ESB - is leveraged as means to enable a publish-
subscribe model of sharing data. Basically, it's an integration pattern, but
no one really likes to admit that because of the connotations associated with
the evil word "integration" in the enterprise. But that's what it's used for -

<p>Introduction: GridGainwas kind enough to present at the September 17th instance of
theSilicon Valley Cloud Computing Group. I've been curious about GridGain so I
was glad to see them there. In short GridGain is:an open source computational
grid framework that enables Java developers to improve general performance of
processing intensive applications by splitting and parallelizing the workload.
GridGain can also be thought of as a set of middleware primitives for building
applications. GridGain's peer group of competitors includes GigaSpaces,
Terracotta, Coherence, and Hadoop.The speaker for GridGain was the President
and Founder, Nikita Ivanov. He has a very pleasant down-to-earth way about him
that contrasts nicely with a field given to religious discussions of complex
taxomic definitions. Nikita first talked about cloud computing in general. He
feels Java is the perfect gateway for cloud computing. Which is good
becauseGridGain only works with Java. The Java centricity of GridGain may be

<p>Introduction: SummaryIn this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing
stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services
application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out
model.BioNati Shalom is the CTO and Founder ofGigaSpacesand responsible for
the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed
technology and architecture namely CORBA, Jini, J2EE, Grid and SOA. Nati is
the Head of the Israeli Grid consortium and an evangelist of Space Based
Architecture and Data Grid patterns. Blog:Gigaspaces BlogRead the rest of the

<p>Introduction: Varnishis a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is
targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take
full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered
by these operating systems.Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high
performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be
configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like
computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.Varnish is reported to
be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>4 0.56482089 <a title="432-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-27-Comet_-_An_Example_of_the_New_Key-Code_Databases.html">979 high scalability-2011-01-27-Comet - An Example of the New Key-Code Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Comet is anactive distributed key-value storebuilt at the University of
Washington. The paper describing Comet is Comet: An active distributed key-
value store, there are also slides, and a MP3 of a presentation given atOSDI
'10. Here's a succinct overview of Comet:Today's cloud storage services, such
as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety
of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes,
fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility
first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption
keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage
service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their
data's behavior inside the storage service.I found this paper quite
interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-
value store, which turns it into what might called a key-code store. This is
something</p><p>5 0.56415051 <a title="432-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-09-No_to_SQL%3F_Anti-database_movement_gains_steam_%E2%80%93_My_Take.html">654 high scalability-2009-07-09-No to SQL? Anti-database movement gains steam – My Take</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Inthis posti wrote my view on the anti SQL database movement and where the
alternative approach fits in:- SQL databases are not going away anytime soon.-
The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.- There
is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions
alongside traditional SQL databases.In addition to the options that was
mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative
approach and how that fits into the puzzle. I used a real life scenario:

approach was the only option they could scale and meet their application

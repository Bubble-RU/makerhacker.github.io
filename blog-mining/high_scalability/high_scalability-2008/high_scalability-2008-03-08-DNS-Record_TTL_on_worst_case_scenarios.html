<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byDave HaglerSystems Architect at AOL.The AOL homepages
receive more than8 million visitors per day.  That's more daily viewers than
Good Morning America or the Today Show on television.  Over a billion page
views are served each month.  AOL.com has been a major internet destination
since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.The architecture
for AOL.com is in it's 5th generation.  It has essentially been rebuilt from
scratch 5 times over two decades.  The current architecture was designed 6
years ago.  Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along
the way, but the overall design remains largely intact.  The code, tools,
development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of
continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very
stable.The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations
andtotals around 25 people.  The majority are in Dulles, Virginia with a

<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and
single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can
finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in
an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly
DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we
don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is
addingElastic IP AddressesandAvailability Zones.Elastic IP addresses are far
better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight withJessica
Albaand they are:breakStatic IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud
computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a
particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to
explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however,
Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures
by programmatically remapping your public</p><p>4 0.087173775 <a title="270-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-06-GEO-aware_traffic_load_balancing_and_caching_at_CNBC.com.html">773 high scalability-2010-02-06-GEO-aware traffic load balancing and caching at CNBC.com</a></p>
<p>Introduction: CNBC, like many large web sites, relied  on a CDN for content delivery.
Recently, we started looking  to see if we could improve this model.  Our
criteria was:- improve response time- have better control over traffic (real
time reporting, change management and alerting)- better utilize internal
datacenters and their infrastructure- shield users from any troubles at the
origin infrastructure- cost outAfter researching the market, we turned to two
vendors: Dyn (Dynamic Network Services) andaiScaler. We' have had   about a
year worth of experience withaiScaler (search for "CNBC" to see my previous
post ), but Dyn was a new vendor for us.  We started building our relationship
at Velocity conference in the summer of 2009.Dyn has recently started offering

<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak, in his short and information packed REDUNDANT DATA CENTER
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY video, shows why networking as played at the highest
levels is something you want to leave to professionals, like alarge animal
country vetenariandelivering a stuck foal at 2AM on a dark and stormy night.
There are always a lot questions about the black art of building redundant
datacenter networks and there's a shortage of accessible explanations. What I
liked about Ivan's video is how effortlessly he explains the issues and
tradeoffs you can expect in designing your own solution, as well as giving
creative solutions to those problems. A lot of years of experience are boiled
down to a 17 minute video.Ivan begins by showing what a canonical fully
redundant datacenter would look like:It's like an ark where everything goes
two by two. You have two datacenters, each datacenter has redundant core
switches, redundant servers, redundant disk arrays, redundant links between
datacenters (for synchro</p><p>4 0.64198232 <a title="270-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-06-Super_Bowl_Advertisers_Ready_for_the_Traffic%3F_Nope..It%27s_Lights_Out..html">1401 high scalability-2013-02-06-Super Bowl Advertisers Ready for the Traffic?

you gotta figure advertisers are ready for the traffic bursts generated by
their expensive ads? Not exactly...Yottaareports an amazing 13 advertiser

asking viewers to vote for the ending of a commercial, but load times went to
62 seconds. SodaStream, Calvin Klein, Axe, Got Milk? The Walking Dead, many
movie sites, and many car sites, all were flagged with delay of fame
penalties.Lots of time, money, and creative energy is spent lovingly
perfecting every detail of these commercials. It won't be a surprise to any
programmer that this can't usually be said of the follow through on the
backend.So what can you do? Yottaa has some good tips and Michael Hamrah has a

<p>Introduction: The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the
hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming
reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality
augmentation, live crab (fresh and local), and live event publishing. One of
the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video
broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a broadcaster and a
consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you
can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a
time shift war. The resources and the engineering needed to make this happened
must be substantial. How do you do that?To find out I talked to Kyle Vogt,
Justin.tv Founder and VP of Engineering. Justin.tv certainly has the numbers.

<p>Introduction: i didnt find a nearly good solution for this problem yet:imagine, you're
responsible for a small CDN network (static images), with two different
datacenter. the balancing for the two DC is done with a anycast nameservice (a
nameserver in every DC, user gets on nearest location). so, one of the
scenario is that one of the datacenters goes down completly. you can do a
monitoring on the nameserver and only route to the dc which is still alive, no
problem. But what about the TTL from the DNS-Records? Tiny TTLs like 2 min.
are often ignored by several ISP (e.g. AOL). so, the client doesn't get the IP
from the other Datacenter. what could be a solution in this scenario?</p><p>2 0.53260249 <a title="270-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler%2C_Cheaper%2C_Faster%3A_Playtomic%27s_Move_from_.NET_to_Node_and_Heroku.html">1340 high scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler, Cheaper, Faster: Playtomic's Move from .NET to Node and Heroku</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO ofPlaytomic. Playtomic is a game
analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games
played by approximately 20 million people daily.Here's a good summary quote by
Ben Lowry on Hacker News:Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday
700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is
integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just
yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people
operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated
a whole bunch of them very cheaply.Playtomic began with an almost exclusively
Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being
replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire
platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then
spread to second dedicated, then the API server was offloaded to a VPS
provider and 4 - 6 fairl</p><p>3 0.51052308 <a title="270-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-09-Paper%3A_Container-based_Operating_System_Virtualization%3A_A_Scalable%2C_High-performance_Alternative_to_Hypervisors.html">147 high scalability-2007-11-09-Paper: Container-based Operating System Virtualization: A Scalable, High-performance Alternative to Hypervisors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One stumbling block of the the great march towards virtualization is the
relatively poor performance of resource hungry applications like databases. We
are told to develop and test using VMs, but deploy without them. Which kind of
sucks IMHO. Maybe better virtualization technology can remove this split. This
paper talks about a different approach to virtualization called "container-
based" virtualization that can reportedly double the performance of
traditional hypervisor systems like Xen. It does this by trading isolation for
efficiency. Rather than maintaining complete isolation between VMs the
container approach shares resources between VMs and thus gives higher
performance while still guaranteeing strong fault, resource, and security
isolation. It's yet another battle in computing's endless war of creating and
destroying abstraction layers. I learned a lot from from this paper because of
how it compared and contrasted traditional hypervisor and container based
virtualization strate</p><p>4 0.48777682 <a title="270-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-19-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_March_19%2C_2010.html">797 high scalability-2010-03-19-Hot Scalability Links for March 19, 2010</a></p>

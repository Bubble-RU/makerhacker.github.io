<p>Introduction: Update 2: SummizeComputes Computing Resources for a Startup. Lots of nice
graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost
efficient for well used larger machines. Long term storage costs may eat your
saving away. And out of cloud bandwidth costs are high.Update:
viaProductionScale, a nice Digital Web article onhow to setup S3 to store
media filesand how Blue Origin was able to handle 3.5 million requests and 758
GBs in bandwidth in a single day for very little $$$. Also a Right Scale
article onNetwork performance within Amazon EC2 and to Amazon S3. 75MB/s
between EC2 instances, 10.2MB/s between EC2 and S3 for download, 6.9MB/s
upload.Now that Amazon's S3 (storage service) isout of betaand EC2 (elastic
compute cloud) has added newinstance types(the class of machine you can rent)
with more CPU and more RAM, I thought it would be interesting to take a look
out how their pricing stacks up.The quick conclusion:the more you scale the
more you save.

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Sorting 1 PB with MapReduce. PB is not peanut-butter-and-jelly
misspelled. It's 1 petabyte or 1000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes.It took
six hours and two minutes to sort 1PB (10 trillion 100-byte records) on 4,000
computersand the results were replicated thrice on 48,000 disks.Update:Greg
Lindenpoints to a new Google articleMapReduce: simplified data processing on

<p>Introduction: From Greg Linden on a talk Google Fellow Jeff Dean gave last week at
University of Washington Computer Science titled "Research Challenges Inspired
by Large-Scale Computing at Google" :Coming away from the talk, the biggest
points for me were the considerable interest in reducing costs (especially
reducing power costs), the suggestion that the Google cluster may eventually
contain 10M machines at 1k locations, and the call to action for researchers
on distributed systems and databases to think orders of magnitude bigger than
they often are, not about running on hundreds of machines in one location, but
hundreds of thousands of machines across many locations.</p><p>5 0.70530534 <a title="211-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-04-Dremel%3A_Interactive_Analysis_of_Web-Scale_Datasets_-_Data_as_a_Programming_Paradigm.html">871 high scalability-2010-08-04-Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets - Data as a Programming Paradigm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If Google was a boxer then MapReduce would be a probing right hand that sets
up the massive left hook that is Dremel, Google's--scalable (thousands of
CPUs, petabytes of data, trillions of rows), SQL based, columnar, interactive
(results returned in seconds), ad-hoc--analytics system. If Google was a
magician then MapReduce would be the shiny thing that distracts the mind while
the trick goes unnoticed. I say that because even though Dremel has been
around internally at Google since 2006, we have not heard a whisper about it.
All we've heard about is MapReduce, clones of which have inspired entire new
industries.Tricky.Dremel, according to Brian Bershad, Director of Engineering
at Google, is targeted at solvingBigData class problems:While we all know that
systems are huge and will get even huger, the implications of this size on
programmability, manageability, power, etc. is hard to comprehend. Alfred

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>2 0.86604917 <a title="211-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-15-Paper%3A_It%27s_Time_for_Low_Latency_-_Inventing_the_1_Microsecond_Datacenter.html">1116 high scalability-2011-09-15-Paper: It's Time for Low Latency - Inventing the 1 Microsecond Datacenter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In It's Time for Low Latency  Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's
time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency
datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for
programarchitectures will be revolutionary.  Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished
Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer
resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are
interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter
into single computer. Abstract from the paper:The operating systems community
has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays
in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs
round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will
be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation
delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it
will be up to us to ﬁnish the job and see</p><p>3 0.86051404 <a title="211-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-17-Steve_Ballmer_Says_Microsoft_has_Over_1_Million_Servers_-_What_Does_that_Really_Mean%3F.html">1493 high scalability-2013-07-17-Steve Ballmer Says Microsoft has Over 1 Million Servers - What Does that Really Mean?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:Anatomy of a crash in a new part of Yandex written in Django. Writing
to a magic session variable caused an unexpected write into an InnoDB database
on every request. Writes took 6-7 seconds because of index rebuilding. Lots of
useful details on the sizing of their system, what went wrong, and how they
fixed it.Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their
search index. We only know a few fun facts about how they do things, nothing
at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I
thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with
Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:3.5 billion pages in the search
index.Over several thousand servers.35 million searches a day.Several data
centers around Russia.Two-layer architecture.The database is split in pieces
and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database
servers and brings it together for the user.Languages used: c++, perl, some

<p>Introduction: The Google Operating System blog has aninteresting poston Google's scale based
on an updated version of Google's paper about MapReduce.The input data for
some of the MapReduce jobs run in September 2007 was 403,152 TB (terabytes),
the average number of machines allocated for a MapReduce job was 394, while
the average completion time was 6 minutes and a half. The paper mentions that
Google's indexing system processes more than 20 TB of raw data.breakNiall
Kennedy calculates that the average MapReduce job runs across a $1 million
hardware infrastructure, assuming that Google still uses the same cluster
configurations from 2004: two 2 GHz Intel Xeon processors with Hyper-Threading
enabled, 4 GB of memory, two 160 GB IDE hard drives and a gigabit Ethernet
link.Greg Linden notices that Google's infrastructure is an important
competitive advantage. "Anyone at Google can process terabytes of data. And
they can get their results back in about 10 minutes, so they can iterate on it
and try somet</p><p>6 0.83116436 <a title="211-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_17%2C_2012.html">1195 high scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 17, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hello everybody!     I am a developer of a website with a lot of traffic. Right now we are managing the whole website using perl + postgresql + fastcgi + memcached + mogileFS + lighttpd + roundrobin DNS distributed over 5 servers and I must say it works like a charm, load is stable and everything works very fast and we are recording about 8 million pageviews per day.     The only problem is with postgres database since we have it installed only on one server and if this server goes down, the whole "cluster" goes down. That's why we have a master2slave replication so we still have a backup database except that when the master goes down, all inserts/updates are disabled so the whole website is just read only.     But this is not a problem since this configuration is working for us and we don't have any problems with it.     Right now we are planning to build our own analytics service that would be customized for our needs. We tried various different software packages but were not satisfi</p><p>3 0.13599908 <a title="276-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-28-Scaling_Early_Stage_Startups.html">136 high scalability-2007-10-28-Scaling Early Stage Startups</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,  I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was taking too much load.  There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain PHP/HTML coding is used.  Technology:  PHP -- 5.2 MYSQL -- 5.0 Apache -- 2.0 Linux  Following is all the server details of my site:   CPU :  Single Socket Dual Core AMD Opteron 1212HE Memory: 2GB DDR RAM Hard Drive: 250GB SATA Ethernet: 100Mb Primary Ethernet Card  (/var/log) # uname -a Linux 2.6.9-67.0.15.ELsmp #1 SMP Tue Apr 22 13:50:33 EDT 2008 i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux  kernel version: 2.6.9-67.0.15.ELsmp  (/var/log) # free -m  total       used</p><p>3 0.73214507 <a title="276-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-13-Design_Preparations_for_Scaling.html">91 high scalability-2007-09-13-Design Preparations for Scaling</a></p>

With this in mind, what would be the best approach to launch the site?

<p>Introduction: Find out with Builtwith.com. It scans a site and guesses how the site is built. I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows,  PHP, Adsense, RSS, CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which AJAX library is used. Though it's kind of cool to see which sites use PHP and other technologies.</p><p>6 0.70781219 <a title="276-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-MONO_ASP.NET._Will_it_make_the_web%3F%3F%3F.html">206 high scalability-2008-01-10-MONO ASP.NET.

<p>Introduction: Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies (Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers . The benefit of this approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA loadbalancing on the perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users). Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has MySQL support. What we also liked about this approach was that it had no dependency on a distributed or networked filesystem, so less chance of corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches capacity, we just off load users to a less used server. If any server goes offline, it only affects the fraction of users</p><p>2 0.97523856 <a title="276-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling_IMAP_and_POP3.html">81 high scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling IMAP and POP3</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Terrastore  is a new-born document store which provides advanced scalability and elasticity features without sacrificing consistency.   Here are a few highlights:
  
 Ubiquitous: based on the universally supported HTTP protocol.  
 Distributed: nodes can run and live everywhere on your network.  
 Elastic: you can add and remove nodes dynamically to/from your running cluster with no downtime and no changes at all to your configuration.  
 Scalable at the data layer: documents are partitioned and distributed among your nodes, with automatic and transparent re-balancing when nodes join and leave.  
 Scalable at the computational layer: query and update operations are distributed to the nodes which actually holds the queried/updated data, minimizing network traffic and spreading computational load.  
 Consistent: providing per-document consistency, you're guaranteed to always get the latest value of a single document, with read committed isolation for concurrent modifications.

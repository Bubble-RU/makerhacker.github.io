<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and
single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can
finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in
an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly
DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we
don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is
addingElastic IP AddressesandAvailability Zones.Elastic IP addresses are far
better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight withJessica
Albaand they are:breakStatic IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud
computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a
particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to
explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however,
Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures

of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-

<p>Introduction: CNBC, like many large web sites, relied  on a CDN for content delivery.
Recently, we started looking  to see if we could improve this model.  Our
criteria was:- improve response time- have better control over traffic (real
time reporting, change management and alerting)- better utilize internal
datacenters and their infrastructure- shield users from any troubles at the
origin infrastructure- cost outAfter researching the market, we turned to two
vendors: Dyn (Dynamic Network Services) andaiScaler. We' have had   about a
year worth of experience withaiScaler (search for "CNBC" to see my previous
post ), but Dyn was a new vendor for us.  We started building our relationship
at Velocity conference in the summer of 2009.Dyn has recently started offering
a geo-aware DNS load balancing solution, using Anycast and the distributed
nature of their DNS presence to enable a key component of what we were trying
to achieve: steer users to geographically closest origin point. The traffic

<p>Introduction: FromFRESH Portsand their website:ISPmanis an ISP management software written
in perl, using an LDAPbackend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP. It can be
used to manage,DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration,
cyrusmail boxes, proftpd etc.ISPMan was written as a management tool for the
network at 4unet wherebetween 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is
crazily growing.Managing these domains and their users was a little time
consuming,and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these
daemonsfluently. Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and
users.LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server canbe
scaled from 1 to n as required. An LDAP entry called maildroptells the SMTP
server (postfix) where to deliver the mail. The SMTPservers can be
loadbalanced with one of many load balancingtechniques. The program is written
with scalability and Highavailability in mind.This may not be the right
software for you if you want to run a sm</p><p>4 0.66937029 <a title="290-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy%3A_Efficiently_Geo-referencing_IPs.html">168 high scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy: Efficiently Geo-referencing IPs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers
podcastShow 15 - Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls. The
conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can
be processed by a WAF (Web Application Firewall), which inspects HTTP for
security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much
was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be
necessary, but I digress.Toterminate SSLmost shops run SSL connections into
Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for
developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of
the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.Load
balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very
efficiently in hardware. Efficiently enough that if you are willing to get rid
of the general purpose Linux boxes and use your big iron load balancers, your
server count can be decreased</p><p>6 0.66316193 <a title="290-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-06-GEO-aware_traffic_load_balancing_and_caching_at_CNBC.com.html">773 high scalability-2010-02-06-GEO-aware traffic load balancing and caching at CNBC.com</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the
DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that
will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains
mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web
server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server,
e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use
reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to
get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been
reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on
how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but
I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.The problem is that I'm
still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some
company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my questio</p><p>2 0.91939324 <a title="290-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-14-Sun_Storage_and_Archive_Solution_for_HPC.html">413 high scalability-2008-10-14-Sun Storage and Archive Solution for HPC</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When designing data storage solutions for High Performance Computing (HPC)
environments, IT architects strive to balance complex and often conflicting
requirements. The need to manage a skyrocketing amount of data, along with the
goals of controlling cost and immediate data availability, can make it
difficult to meet HPC application demands within the constraints of today's IT
budgets. To help customers address an almost bewildering set of architectural
challenges, Sun has developed the Sun Storage and Archive Solution for HPC, a
reference architecture that can be easily customized to meet specific
application goals and business requirements.This article is intended for IT
managers and storage architects familiar with HPC applications and data
requirements in the organization. It assumes that the audience has a technical
background and some familiarity with issues surrounding the task of
configuring systems and storage.</p><p>3 0.91287977 <a title="290-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Web_Consolidation_on_the_Sun_Fire_T1000_using_Solaris_Containers__.html">458 high scalability-2008-12-01-Web Consolidation on the Sun Fire T1000 using Solaris Containers  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Reducing the costs of IT infrastructure and improving the manageability and
efficiency of web services pose significant challenges for many organizations
in today's economic climate. Recent studies describe the challenges IT
managers face administering the proliferation of x86-based servers used to run
web services applications. Those reports reveal that using large number of
x86-based systems can increase space and power consumption, as well as cost
and asset management overhead. In addition, many of these x86-based systems
run a mixture of operating system and application software leading to
increased management complexity and potential security concerns.Faced with
these challenges, many organizations are attracted by the idea of
consolidating web and application services from multiple x86-based servers to
a smaller number of high-performance servers. This approach strives to help
simplify management, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of
delivering web services. The co</p><p>4 0.90908241 <a title="290-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-07-Sun_Acquires_Q-layer_in_Cloud_Computing_Play.html">486 high scalability-2009-01-07-Sun Acquires Q-layer in Cloud Computing Play</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Google App Engine (GAE) is focused on making development easy, but limits your
options. Amazon Web Services is focused on making development flexible, but
complicates the development process. Real enterprise applications require both
of these paradigms to achieve successâ&euro;Ś What we really want is the flexibility
of AWS and the simplicity of GAE.For the rest of the post see

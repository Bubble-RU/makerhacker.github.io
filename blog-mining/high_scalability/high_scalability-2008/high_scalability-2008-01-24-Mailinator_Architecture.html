<p>Introduction: hi,the website i work for is looking to build a email system that can handle a
fair few emails (up to a hundred thousand a day).These comprise emails like
registration emails, newsletters, lots of user triggered emails and overnight
emails.At present we queue them in SQL and feed them into an smtp server on
one of our web servers when the queue drops below a certain level.this has
caused our mail system to crash as well as hammer our DB server (shared!!!).We
have got an architecture of what we want to build but thought there might be
something we could buy off the shelf that allowed us to keep templated emails,
lists of recipients, schedule sends etc and report on it. We can't find
anythingWhat do big websites like amazon etc use or people a little smaller
but who still send loads of mail (flickr, ebuyer, or other ecommerce
sites)Cheerstarqs</p><p>3 0.28806248 <a title="221-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis_-_Scaling_an_Email-based_App_from_Scratch.html">1269 high scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis - Scaling an Email-based App from Scratch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO ofiDoneThis, which makes status
reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch.iDoneThisis
a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day
to ask, "What'd you get done today?" Just reply with a few lines of what you
got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what
the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and
kickstart another awesome day.Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a
weekend in the most rudimentary way possible. I kid you not, we sent the first
few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox. The upshot
is that we've had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.We've gone
from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by
hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming
emails per month. In total, customers have recorded over 1.7 million

for?Lavabit is a mid-sized email service provider. We currently have about
140,000 registered users with more than 260,000 email addresses. While most of
our accounts belong to individual users, we also provide corporate email
services to approximately 70 companies.Why did you decide to build this
system?We built the system to compete against the other large free email
providers, with an emphasis on serving the privacy conscious and technically

<p>Introduction: Ladar Levison of Lavabit has written anincredible article on howthey took a
centralized off-the-shelf email server that could handle only few thousand
users and built their own custom distributed infrastructure for handling
hundreds of thousands of email users. Lavabit processes 70 gigabytes of data
per day, is made up of 26 servers, hosts 260,000 email addresses, and
processes 600,000 emails a day. That's a lot of email.Lavabit's mission has a
little edge to it too:Lavabit was founded as a direct reaction to the larger
free e-mail services available. We felt it was possible to create an e-mail
service that was fast, reliable, feature rich and didn't achieve profitability
by prostituting its user base to marketers.What I really like about this
article is that Lavabit has some challenging elements in dealing with
different email protocols while being able to scale to a lot of users. There's
more going on than just trying to scale out a database. Many products contain
complicated bits li</p><p>3 0.77369088 <a title="221-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-18-Scaling_Mailbox_-_From_0_to_One_Million_Users_in_6_Weeks_and_100_Million_Messages_Per_Day.html">1477 high scalability-2013-06-18-Scaling Mailbox - From 0 to One Million Users in 6 Weeks and 100 Million Messages Per Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You know your product is doing well when most of yourearly blog postsdeal with
the status of the waiting list of hundreds of thousands of users eagerly
waiting to download your product. That's the enviable positionMailbox, a free
mobile email management app, found themselves early in their release cycle.
Hasn't email been done already? Apparently not. Mailbox scaled to one million
users in a paltry six weeks with a team ofabout 14 people. As of April they
were delivering over100 million messages per day.How did they do it? Mailbox
engineering lead,Sean Beausoleil, gave an informative interview on
readwrite.comon how Mailbox planned to scale... Gather signals early. A pre-
release launch video helped generate interest, but it also allowed them to
gauge early interest before even releasing. From the overwhelming response
they knew they would need to have to scale and scale quickly. Have something
unique. The average person might not think a mailbox app would be a fertile
product space. T</p><p>4 0.77132553 <a title="221-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-19-Building_a_email_communication_system.html">253 high scalability-2008-02-19-Building a email communication system</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:A fun exploration of applied searching inHow to search for the word
"pen1s" in 185 emails every second. When indexOf doesn't cut it you just trie
harder.Has a drunken friend ever inspired you to create a first of its kind
internet service that is loved by millions, deemed subversive by thousands,
all while handling over 1.2 billion emails a year on onerickityold server?
That's how Paul Tyma came to build Mailinator.Mailinator is a free no-setup
web service for thwarting evil spammers by creating throw-away registration
email addresses. If you don't give web sites you real email address they can't
spam you. They spam Mailinator instead :-)I love design with a point-of-view
and Mailinator has a big giant harry one: performance first, second, and last.
Why? Because Mailinator is free and that allows Paul to showcase his different
perspective on design. While competitors buy big Iron to handle load, Paul
uses a big idea instead: pick the right problem and create a design to fit the</p><p>2 0.95699096 <a title="221-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_8%2C_2012.html">1261 high scalability-2012-06-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 8, 2012</a></p>

Potter would have some sort of scaling spell, but no, he has to rely on
themuggle powered Azure. Pottermore uses Azure to handle 110 million page
impressions a day. Ian Bogost in What Should We Do for a Living? brings up a
sobering idea from the Facebook Illusion, the Internet economy will not save
us, it sucks at scaling jobs and exists because it is subsidized by surpluses
from the old economy it was supposed to replace. Where is that replicator when
we need it?In Praise of Idleness. Bruce Dawson argues against busy waiting and
for locks, in most cases. Couldn't agree more, that's a lot of CPU doing
nothing and programmers quickly lose track of the overall flow of the program,

<p>Introduction: Counting at scale in a distributed environment issurprisingly hard. And it's a
subject we've covered before in various ways:Big Data Counting: How to count a
billion distinct objects using only 1.5KB of Memory,How to update video views
count effectively?,Numbers Everyone Should Know (sharded
counters).Kellabyte(which is an excellent blog) inScalable Eventually
Consistent Counterstalks about how the Cassandra counter implementation scores
well on the scalability and high availability front, but in so doing has "over
and under counting problem in partitioned environments."Which is often fine.
But if you want more accuracy there's a PN-counter, which is aCRDT (convergent
replicated data type)where "all the changes made to a counter on each node
rather than storing and modifying a single value so that you can merge all the
values into the proper final value. Of course the trade-off here is additional
storage and processing but there are ways to optimize this."And there's a
paper you can co</p><p>4 0.94789052 <a title="221-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-27-Heroku_Emergency_Strategy%3A_Incident_Command_System_and_8_Hour_Ops_Rotations_for_Fresh_Minds.html">1030 high scalability-2011-04-27-Heroku Emergency Strategy: Incident Command System and 8 Hour Ops Rotations for Fresh Minds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In Resolved: Widespread Application Outage, Herokutells their story of how
they dealt with theAmazon outage. While taking 100% responsibility for the
downtime, they also shared a number of the strategies they used to bring their
service back to full working order.One ofHeroku'smost interesting strategies
wasn't a technical hack at all, but how they consciously went about deploying
their Ops personnel in response to the emergency. An outline of their strategy
is: Monitoring systems immediately alerted Ops to the problem. An on-call
engineer applied triage logic to the problem and classified it as serious,
which caused the on-callIncident Commanderto be woken out of restful slumber.

<p>Introduction: We talked about 42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase. And inThe
Aggregation Collection we talked about the value of prioritizing work and
making smart queues as a way of absorbing and not reflecting traffic
spikes.Now we move on to our next batch of strategies where the theme
isconditioning, which is the idea of shaping and controlling flows of work
within your application...Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed LimitThis is
probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an
application. What it means:Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you
know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of
objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of
objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion.Devise ways of tying
what you need to do to the individual resources.Some examples:Keep a list of
purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of
the line items because t</p><p>6 0.94246417 <a title="221-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-12-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_12%2C_2013.html">1439 high scalability-2013-04-12-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 12, 2013</a></p>

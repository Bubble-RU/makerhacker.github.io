<p>Introduction: What have bunch of applications which run on Debian servers, which processes
huge amount of data stored in a shared NFS drive.we have 3 applications
working as a pipeline, which process data stored in the NFS drive. The first
application processes the data and store the output in some folder in the NFS
drive, the second app in the pipeline process the data from the previous step
and so on.The data load to the pipeline is like 1 GBytes per minute. I think
the NFS drive is the bottleneck here.Would buying a specialized file server
improve the performance of data read write from the disk ?</p><p>3 0.18540061 <a title="308-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-21-Paper%3A_Standardizing_Storage_Clusters_%28with_pNFS%29.html">128 high scalability-2007-10-21-Paper: Standardizing Storage Clusters (with pNFS)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: pNFS (parallel NFS) is the next generation of NFS and its main claim to fame
is that it's clustered, which "enables clients to directly access file data
spread over multiple storage servers in parallel. As a result, each client can
leverage the full aggregate bandwidth of a clustered storage service at the
granularity of an individual file." About pNFSStorageMojosays:pNFS is going to
commoditize parallel data access. In 5 years we won't know how we got along
without it. Something to watch.</p><p>4 0.17531599 <a title="308-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-09-Lots_of_questions_for_high_scalability_-_high_availability.html">63 high scalability-2007-08-09-Lots of questions for high scalability - high availability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey,I do have a website that I would like to scale. Right now we have 10
servers but this does not scale well.I know how to deal with my apache web
servers but have problems with sql servers.I would like to use the "scale out"
system and add servers when we need. We have over 100Gb of data for mysql and
we tried to have around 20G per server. It works well except that if a server
goes down then 1/5 of the user can't access the website. We could use
replication but we would need to at least double sql servers to replicate each
server. And maybe in the future it's not gonna be enough we would need maybe 3
slaves per master ... well I don't really like this idea.I would prefer to
have 8 servers that all deal with data from the 5 servers we have right now
and then we could add new servers when we need. I looked at NFS but that does
not seem to be a good idea for SQL servers ? Can you confirm?</p><p>5 0.17443193 <a title="308-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-14-MongoDB_and_GridFS_for_Inter_and_Intra_Datacenter_Data_Replication_.html">1386 high scalability-2013-01-14-MongoDB and GridFS for Inter and Intra Datacenter Data Replication </a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeff Behl, VP Ops @ LogicMonitor. Jeffhas been a bit
herder for the last 20 years, architecting and overseeing the infrastructure
for a number of SaaS based companies.  Data Replication for Disaster
RecoveryAn inevitable part of disaster recovery planning is making sure
customer data exists in multiple locations.  In the case of LogicMonitor, a
SaaS-based monitoring solution for physical, virtual, and cloud environments,
we wanted copies of customer data files both within a data center and outside
of it.  The former was to protect against the loss of individual servers
within a facility, and the latter for recovery in the event of the complete
loss of a data center.Where we were:  RsyncLike most everyone who starts off
in a Linux environment, we used our trusty friend rsync to copy data around.
Rsync is tried, true and tested, and works well when the number of servers,
the amount of data, and the number of files is not horrendous.  When any of
these are no longer</p><p>6 0.16353579 <a title="308-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am planning the scaling of a hosted service, similar to typepad etc. and
would appreciate feedback on my plan so far.Looking into scaling storage, I
have come accross MogileFS and OpenAFS. My concern with these is I am not at
all experienced with them and as the sole tech guy I don't want to build
something into this hosting service that proves complex to update and
adminster.So, I'm thinking of building replication and scalability right into
the application, in a similar but simplified way to how MogileFS works (I
think).So, for our database table of uploaded files, here's how it currently
looks (simplified):fileid (pkey)filenameowneridFor adding the replication and
scalability, I would add a few more
columns:serveroneidservertwoidserverthreeids3At the time the user uploads a
file, it will go to a specific server (managed by the application) and the id
of that server will be placed in the "serverone" column. Then hourly or so, a
cron job will run through the "files" table, and copy</p><p>3 0.73159385 <a title="308-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Sync_data_on_all_servers.html">98 high scalability-2007-09-18-Sync data on all servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have a few apache servers ( arround 11 atm ) serving a small amount of data
( arround 44 gigs right now ).For some time I have been using rsync to keep
all the content equal on all servers, but the amount of data has been growing,
and rsync takes a few too much time to "compare" all data from source to
destination, and create a lot of I/O.I have been taking a look at MogileFS, it
seems a good and reliable option, but as the fuse module is not finished, we
should have to rewrite all our apps, and its not an option atm.Any ideas?I
just want a "real time, non resource-hungry" solution alternative for rsync.
If I get more features on the way, then they are welcome :)Why I prefer to use
a Distributed File System instead of using NAS + NFS?- I need 2 NAS, if I dont
want a point of failure, and NAS hard is expensive.- Non-shared hardware, all
server has their own local disks.- As files are replicated, I can save a lot
of money, RAID is not a MUST.Thnx in advance for your help and sorry for</p><p>4 0.71153671 <a title="308-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-09-Lots_of_questions_for_high_scalability_-_high_availability.html">63 high scalability-2007-08-09-Lots of questions for high scalability - high availability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,We are running a backup solution that uploads every night the files our
clients worked on during the day (Cabonite-like).We have currently about 10GB
of data per night, via http PUT requests (1 per file), and the files are
written as-is on a NAS.Our architecture is basically compound of a load
balancer (hardware, sticky sessions), 5 servers (Tomcat under RHEL4/5, ) and a
NAS (nfs 3).Since our number of clients is rising, (as is our system load) how
would you recommend we could scale our infrastructure? hardware and software?
Should we go towards NAS sharding, more servers, NIO on tomcat...?Thanks for
your inputs!</p><p>6 0.70142227 <a title="308-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-14-MongoDB_and_GridFS_for_Inter_and_Intra_Datacenter_Data_Replication_.html">1386 high scalability-2013-01-14-MongoDB and GridFS for Inter and Intra Datacenter Data Replication </a></p>

Can JSPs cause issue with scalability?Thanks,Unmesh</p><p>2 0.95727319 <a title="308-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-16-Paper%3A_An_Experimental_Investigation_of_the_Akamai_Adaptive_Video_Streaming.html">991 high scalability-2011-02-16-Paper: An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading
retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent
applications. Furthermore, over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are
more likely to make a purchase after "liking" a brand they find online.

they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex
relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:the architectural
considerations behind their solutionwhy they chose memory over diskhow they
partitioned the data to gain scalabilitywhy they chose to execute code with
the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution frameworkhow they integrated
with Facebookwhy they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-
memory caching and scaleIn this post I tried to summarize the main takeaway

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>6 0.91108334 <a title="308-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Book%3A_High_Performance_MySQL.html">16 high scalability-2007-07-16-Book: High Performance MySQL</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The GigaOM Network today announces its second Structure conference after the runaway success of the 2008 event. The Structure 09 conference returns to San Francisco, Calif., on June 25th, 2009.     Structure 09 (http://structureconf.com) is a conference designed to explore the next generations of Internet infrastructure. Over a year ago, The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik saw that the platforms on which we have done business for over a decade were starting to provide diminishing returns, and smart money was seeking new options.  Structure 09 looks at the changing needs and rapid growth in the Internet infrastructure sector, and this year's event will consider the impact of the global economy. "I cannot remember a time when a new technology had so much relevance to our industry as cloud computing does in the current economic climate," said The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik. "We all need to find ways to leverage what we have and cut costs without compromising future options.

<p>Introduction: Jumping around the social mediasphere, it's not uncommon to feel the heat generated in praise of a favorite this or that over all the clearly inferior alternatives. Whilst human nature may never cool, I think Old Will had some insight worth considering the next time a flame threatens to flicker forth:
 
  My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130)  
  
 
 
 

 My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red ; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damask, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground: And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare.

<p>Introduction: The GigaOM Network today announces its second Structure conference after the runaway success of the 2008 event. The Structure 09 conference returns to San Francisco, Calif., on June 25th, 2009.     Structure 09 (http://structureconf.com) is a conference designed to explore the next generations of Internet infrastructure. Over a year ago, The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik saw that the platforms on which we have done business for over a decade were starting to provide diminishing returns, and smart money was seeking new options.  Structure 09 looks at the changing needs and rapid growth in the Internet infrastructure sector, and this year's event will consider the impact of the global economy.

<p>Introduction: Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please comment on that too.
 
Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work. Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not. Taking all that wisdom and stuffing it into a presentations is surprisingly hard</p><p>5 0.5615589 <a title="341-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-17-Sun_to_Announce_Open_Cloud_APIs_at_CommunityOne.html">543 high scalability-2009-03-17-Sun to Announce Open Cloud APIs at CommunityOne</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be squashed.     To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer 2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtai</p><p>same-blog 2 0.87681752 <a title="341-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-06-GigaOm_Structure_08_Conference_on_June_25th_in_San_Francisco.html">341 high scalability-2008-06-06-GigaOm Structure 08 Conference on June 25th in San Francisco</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you just can't get enough high scalability talk you might want to take a look GigaOm's Structure 08 conference. The slate of speakers looks appropriately interesting and San Francisco is truly magical this time of year. High Scalability readers even get a price break is you use the HIGHSCALE discount code! I'll be on vacation so I won't see you there, but it looks like a good time. For a nice change of pace consider visiting   MoMA   next door.  Here's a blurb on the conference:   A reminder to our readers about Structure 08, GigaOm's upcoming conference dedicated to web infrastructure. In addition to keynotes from leaders like Jim Crowe, chairman and CEO of Level 3 Communications and Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon, the event will feature workshops from Google App Engine, Microsoft and a special workshop from Fenwick and West who will cover how to raise money for an infrastructure start up.

<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important.  Jim Scheinman,  former Bebo and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to scale as why they lost the social networking race:   VB  : Can you tell me a bit about what you learned in your time at Friendster? 
 
     JS  :  For me, it basically came down to failed execution on the technology side — we had millions of Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling us that if we didn’t get our site working better soon, they’d be ‘forced to join’ a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpace…the rest is history. To be fair to Friendster’s technology team at the time, they were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites simply hadn’t had to deal with prior to Friendster.

<p>Introduction: Neil Conway  from Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk at  a meetup today  in San Francisco on a new paper:  Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming  - extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. 
 
The description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the paper:
  Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability. Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of strong consistency can be very challenging.

 


In this talk, I'll discuss work from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a broader range of</p><p>6 0.76580924 <a title="341-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_GridLayer._Utility_computing_for_online_application.html">42 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: GridLayer.

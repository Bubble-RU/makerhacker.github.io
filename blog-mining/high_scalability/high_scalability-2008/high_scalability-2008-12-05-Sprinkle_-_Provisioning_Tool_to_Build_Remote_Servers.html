<p>Introduction: Update:Digg on their choice and use of Puppet. They chose puppet over
cfengine, and bcfg2 because they liked Puppet's resource abstraction layer
(RAL), the ability to implement configuration management incrementally,
support for bundles, and the overall design philosophy.Puppetimplements a
declarative (what not how) configuration language for automating common
administration tasks. It's the system every large site writes for themselves
and it's already made for you! Ilike was able to "easily" scale from0 to
hundreds of serversusing Puppet. I can't believe I've never seen this before.
It looks really cool. What is Puppet and how can it help you scale your
website operations?breakFrom the Puppet website:Puppet has been developed to
help the sysadmin community move to building and sharing mature tools that
avoid the duplication of everyone solving the same problem. It does so in two
ways:* It provides a powerful framework to simplify the majority of the

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Urbandiveis an immersive view service launched by theFrench
YellowPageswhich allows you to travel in cities in France thanks to a 360Â°
view. Urbandive focuses on providing high definition pictures and accurate
professional and social content. One of the biggest jobs was to enable a fast
scalable architecture, because it was really difficult to forecast the traffic
load at production time. Traffic load may be influenced if the service
receives attention from users as a result of advertising.Below you will find a
summary of the goals we achieve by using a Ruby scheduler built on top
ofPuppetonAWSto create a complete infrastructure.Workflow & XTR-LucidOur
scalability combo is : a home-made Ruby scheduler (XTR-Lucid) to deal with AWS
APIs + the Puppet Master to install services and configure EC2 instances and
keep them up-to-date during all the production time. This leads to full
automation.Here is</p><p>5 0.12029576 <a title="461-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Product%3A_3_PAR_REMOTE_COPY.html">27 high scalability-2007-07-25-Product: 3 PAR REMOTE COPY</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 3PAR Remote Copyis a uniquely simple and efficient replication technology that
allows customers to protect and share any application data affordably. Built
upon 3PAR Thin Copy technology, Remote Copy lowers the total cost of storage
by addressing the cost and complexity of remote replication.Common Uses of
3PAR Remote Copy:Affordable Disaster Recovery: Mirror data cost-effectively
across town or across the world.Centralized Archive: Replicate data from
multiple 3PAR InServs located in multiple data centers to a centralized data
archive location.Resilient Pod Architecture: Mutually replicate tier 1 or 2
data to tier 3 capacity between two InServs (application pods).Remote Data
Access: Replicate data to a remote location for sharing of data with remote
users.</p><p>6 0.11384109 <a title="461-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling_an_AWS_infrastructure_-_Tools_and_Patterns.html">881 high scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling an AWS infrastructure - Tools and Patterns</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>4 0.81300497 <a title="461-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible_-__A_Simple_Model-Driven_Configuration_Management_and_Command_Execution_Framework.html">1230 high scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible -  A Simple Model-Driven Configuration Management and Command Execution Framework</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is guest post byMichael DeHaan(@laserllama), a software developer and
architect, on Ansible, a simple deployment, model-driven configuration
management, and command execution framework.I owe High Scalability a great
deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>5 0.74971789 <a title="461-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-25-Product%3A_Puppet_the_Automated_Administration_System.html">429 high scalability-2008-10-25-Product: Puppet the Automated Administration System</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At37 SignalsJoshua Sierles describes how 37 Signals usesSprinkleto configure
their servers within EC2. Sprinkledefines a domain specific meta-language for
describing and processing the installation of software. You can find an
interesting discussion of Sprinkle's creation story by the creator himself,
Marcus Crafter, inSprinkle Some Powder!.Marcus divides provisioning tools into
two categories:Task Based- the tool issues a list of commands to run on the
remote system, either remotely via a network connection or smart
client.Policy/state Based- the tool determines what needs to be run on the
remote system by examining its current and final state.Sprinkle combines both
models together in a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter approach using normal Ruby
code as the DSL (domain specific language) to declaratively describe remote
system configurations. 37 Signals likes the use of Ruby as the DSL because it
makes learning a separate syntax unnecessary. I've successfully done similar
things in Perl.</p><p>2 0.92070919 <a title="461-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay_history_and_architecture.html">550 high scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay history and architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ebay[1]Starts in 1995, initial name AuctionWeb (V1) :- very simple
architecture- based on perl- no database, for data persistence they used plain
filesBecause of rapid growth they needed to improve their architecture and so
V2 (clever name) was born:- replaced perl with C/C++- started using a database
in a master-slave configuration- C++ back-end- XSLT front-endAny request will
lead to an XML file being created in C++ and the XLST processor will transform
that into html.*pretty sophisticated architecture for the 90s, XLST was
cutting-edge back then*breakThat hold out pretty well for a while but in the
late 90s ebay experienced an exponential growth.They started having some
trouble with outages and needed improvements, so V3 was developed:- based on
java- search engine still used C++- proof that relational databases can scale
(aggressive caching)- developed a messaging layer for making a lot of
asyncronious calls, they actually ended up being sued because of the delay in

sharing 4 billion items daily;Yahoo: 42,000 Hadoop nodes storing 180-200
petabytes; Formspring hits 25 million users.Zynga's Cadir Lee: It's not the
amount of hardware that matters. It's the architecture of the application. You
have to work at making your app architecture so that it takes advantage of
Amazon. You have to have complete fluidity with the storage tier, the web
tier. We are running our own data centers. We are looking more at doing our
own data centers with more of a private cloud.Love the sensing making

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>5 0.89250493 <a title="461-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-07-What_CDN_would_you_recommend%3F.html">144 high scalability-2007-11-07-What CDN would you recommend?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all, aI run a site that after a complete redesign have gotten a lot more
traffic. The site provides free flash games, so the biggest traffic share goes
to serving flash files (from about 100K and up to several megabytes in size
each.)I currently host the entire site on a hosting provider that have no
traffic limits. But since they are very cheap (yet have served me very well
all the time with at least 99,9% uptime), I don't trust them in allowing me to
continue consuming more and more bandwidth. I just guess I'm going to reach
some internal limit they have on day, so I'm looking into moving all the flash
content over to a content delivery network of some sort.Some recent traffic
stats:August: 12 GBSeptember: 22 GBOctober: 55 GBNovember: Currently 2,3 GB pr
day on average, but it's rising..I've been looking into Amazon S3, but have
not decided on anything yet. So therefor I'm asking if there are any other
provides I should consider, that operates within the same price range as
Amazon</p><p>6 0.8914687 <a title="461-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_11th%2C_2013.html">1530 high scalability-2013-10-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 11th, 2013</a></p>

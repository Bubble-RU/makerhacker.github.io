thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The
network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching
elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up
the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP
switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate
bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring
tremendous cost. Nonuniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates
application design and limits overall system performance.In this paper, we

<p>Introduction: TheEuroSys 2012system conference has an excellent live blog summary of their
talks for:Day 1,Day 2,Day 3(thanksHenry at the Paper Trail blog). Summaries
for each of the accepted papers arehere.One of the more interesting papers
from a NoSQL perspective wasCache Craftiness for Fast Multicore Key-Value
Storage, a wonderfully detailed description of the low level techniques used
to implement Masstree:A storage system specialized for key-value data in which
all data ﬁts in memory, but must persist across server restarts. It supports
arbitrary, variable-length keys. It allows range queries over those keys:
clients can traverse subsets of the database, or the whole database, in sorted
order by key. On a 16-core machine Masstree achieves six to ten million
operations per second on parts A-C of the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark
benchmark, more than 30 as fast as VoltDB [5] or MongoDB [2].If you are

<p>Introduction: In the scalability is specialization department here is an interesting paper
presented atHotNets '13on high performance networking: Network Stack
Specialization for Performance.The idea is generalizing a service so it fits
in the kernel comes at a high performance cost. So move TCP into user space.
The result is a web server with ~3.5x the throughput of Nginx "while
experiencing low CPU utilization, linear scaling on multicore systems, and
saturating current NIC hardware."Here's a good description of the paper
publishedon Layer 9:Traditionally, servers and OSes have been built to be
general purpose. However now we have a high degree of specialization. In fact,
in a big web service, you might have thousands of machines dedicated to one
function. Therefore, there's scope for specialization. This paper looks at a
specific opportunity in that space. Network stacks today are good for high
throughput with large transfers, but not small files (which are common in web
browsing).

<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing
network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:
Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework by Luigi Rizzo. As commodity
networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all
those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen? Abstract:Today
10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On
these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern
operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between
the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful
hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the
design of device drivers and network stacks.The netmap framework is a
promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the
engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary
overhead and moves traffic up to 40</p><p>6 0.6673733 <a title="374-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-25-The_Cloud_and_The_Consumer%3A_The_Impact_on_Bandwidth_and_Broadband.html">1105 high scalability-2011-08-25-The Cloud and The Consumer: The Impact on Bandwidth and Broadband</a></p>

in mid October. I won't be posting, so we'll all have a break. Disappointing,
I know. If you've ever wanted to write an article for HighScalability, this
would be a great time :-) I especially need help on writingStuff the Internet
Says on Scalabilityas I won't even be reading the Interwebs. Shock! Horror! So
if the spirit moves you, please write something. My connectivity in South
Africa is unknown, but I will check in and approve articles when I can. See
you on down the road...</p><p>2 0.85024452 <a title="374-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-29-Gone_Fishin%27_Two.html">1350 high scalability-2012-10-29-Gone Fishin' Two</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I found the discussion of the available bandwidth of tree vs higher
dimensional virtual networks topologies quite, to quote Spock,fascinating:A
mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developersof
Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that
theGnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,
theNapster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network
isseverely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a
millionpeers. In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have
overlooked theintrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the
Gnutella network:a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the
definition).Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher
dimensionaltopologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of
interconnectiontopologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware
implementations(see, e.g., Culler et al. 1996; Buyya 1999</p><p>4 0.7733776 <a title="374-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-23-Gone_Fishin%27_2014.html">1653 high scalability-2014-05-23-Gone Fishin' 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy thatthe best method to analyse spam is to become a
spammer, this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely
researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part
Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that
their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they
figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales
they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.Two different spam campaigns were
run on aStormbotnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-
peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide
computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit
new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to
download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the
executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon. The
downloaded compone</p><p>6 0.67400444 <a title="374-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-05-5_Ways_to_Make_Cloud_Failure_Not_an_Option.html">1367 high scalability-2012-12-05-5 Ways to Make Cloud Failure Not an Option</a></p>

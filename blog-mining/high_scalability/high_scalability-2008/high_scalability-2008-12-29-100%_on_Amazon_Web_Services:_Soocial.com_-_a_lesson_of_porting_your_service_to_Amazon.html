<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Frédéric Faure   (architect at  Ysance )  on the differences between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frédéric was kind enough to translate the original French version of this article into English. 
 
I’ve been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such as  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) and a traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you. Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure. I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100 using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that would otherwise take an eternity to make,  a pile of money to create, and an unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of services. The battle for the future is on.

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives  is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.     Werner Vogels    Dr. Werner Vogels is Vice President & Chief Technology Officer at Amazon.com where he is responsible for driving the company’s technology vision, which is to continuously enhance the innovation on behalf of Amazon’s customers at a global scale. Prior to joining Amazon, he worked as a researcher at Cornell University where he was a principal investigator in several research projects that target the scalability and robustness of mission-critical enterprise computing systems. He is regarded as one of the world's top experts on ultra-scalable systems and he uses his weblog to educate the community about issues such as eventual consistency.

<p>Introduction: Amazon has announced the limited beta of Amazon SimpleDB - a simple web services interface to create and store multiple data sets, query your data easily, and return the results. Together with the Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and other web services Amazon offers a complete utility computing platform. SimpleDB was the missing piece of AWS - the scalable structured database.

<p>Introduction: Hello, I am new to the back end side of things. Love this web site.   Read all comments about Amazon hosting, actually I really like Amazon S3 but concerned that it may not be sufficient for my computing needs. And E3 just not too sure.     What about hosting sites like host monster? Their prices seem amazing. Are they too good to be true? What are the cons and what are the things I should be considering? I am concerned about costs, but I want user experience to be world class.     I am creating a media sharing site.     Any help will be great.     Thanks     Fahad</p><p>5 0.73594242 <a title="477-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-02-The_Updated_Big_List_of_Articles_on_the_Amazon_Outage.html">1033 high scalability-2011-05-02-The Updated Big List of Articles on the Amazon Outage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since  The Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  was published we've a had few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their  Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East Region . Netlix shared their  Lessons Learned from the AWS Outage  as did Heroku ( How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage ), Smug Mug ( How SmugMug survived the Amazonpocalypse ), and SimpleGeo ( How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS Downtime ). 
 
The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to talk about the event itself.
 
 Lesson for crisis handlers : deep dive post-mortems that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention.</p><p>6 0.73105067 <a title="477-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud.html">40 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Munin  the monitoring tool surveys all your computers and remembers what it saw. It presents all the information in graphs through a web interface. Its emphasis is on plug and play capabilities. After completing a installation a high number of monitoring plugins will be playing with no more effort.  Using Munin you can easily monitor the performance of your computers, networks, SANs, applications, weather measurements and whatever comes to mind. It makes it easy to determine "what's different today" when a performance problem crops up. It makes it easy to see how you're doing capacity-wise on any resources.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.80930173 <a title="477-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-29-100%25_on_Amazon_Web_Services%3A_Soocial.com_-_a_lesson_of_porting_your_service_to_Amazon.html">477 high scalability-2008-12-29-100% on Amazon Web Services: Soocial.com - a lesson of porting your service to Amazon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Simone Brunozzi, technology evangelist for Amazon Web Services in Europe, describes how Soocial.com was fully ported to Amazon web services.         ----------------   This period of the year I decided to dedicate some time to better understand how our customers use AWS, therefore I spent some online time with Stefan Fountain and the nice guys at Soocial.com, a "one address book solution to contact management", and I would like to share with you some details of their IT infrastructure, which now runs 100% on Amazon Web Services!    In the last few months, they've been working hard to cope with tens of thousands of users and to get ready to easily scale to millions. To make this possible, they decided to move ALL their architecture to Amazon Web Services. Despite the fact that they were quite happy with their previous hosting provider, Amazon proved to be the way to go.    -----------------           Read the rest of the article here .</p><p>3 0.78351092 <a title="477-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-12-4_Strategies_for_Punching_Down_Traffic_Spikes.html">1282 high scalability-2012-07-12-4 Strategies for Punching Down Traffic Spikes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Travis Reeder in  Spikability - An Application's Ability to Handle Unknown and/or Inconsistent Load  gives four good ways of handling spikey loads:
  
  Have more resources than you'll ever need . Estimate the maximum traffic you'll need and keep that many servers running. Downside is you are paying for capacity you aren't using. 
  Disable features during high loads . Reduce load by disabling features or substituting in lighter weight features. Downside is users to have access to features. 
  Auto scaling . Launch new servers in response to load. Downsides are it's complicated to setup and slow to respond. Random spikes will cause cycling of instances going up and down. 
  Use message queues . Queues soak up work requests during traffic spikes. More servers can be started to process work from the queue. Resources aren't wasted and features are disabled. Downside is increased latency.</p><p>4 0.73275059 <a title="477-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-The_7_Stages_of_Scaling_Web_Apps.html">391 high scalability-2008-09-23-The 7 Stages of Scaling Web Apps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical successful website goes through: 
 
 Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture, low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers, database server, and internal storage. 
 Stage 2 - More of the same, just bigger. 
 Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding. 
 Stage 4 - The Pain Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content, significant re-architecting for DB. 
 Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters, using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster. 
 Stage 6 - Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again, op</p><p>5 0.73241144 <a title="477-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-11-Have_We_Reached_the_End_of_Scaling%3F.html">758 high scalability-2010-01-11-Have We Reached the End of Scaling?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.  
 
Have we reached the end of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The End of" headlines. We've reached  The End of History  because the Western liberal democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government."  We've reached  The End of Science  because of the "fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions." We've even reached  The End of Theory  because all answers can be found in the continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're at  The End of the World ?
 
Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?
 
For a while I thought this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is because of the slow down of potential articles at m</p><p>6 0.72918737 <a title="477-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-29-Second_Hand_Seizure_%3A_A_New_Cause_of_Site_Death.html">1070 high scalability-2011-06-29-Second Hand Seizure : A New Cause of Site Death</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 3:Always Refer to Your V1 As a Prototype. You really do have to plan to
throw one away.Update 2:Lessons Learned Scaling the Audiogalaxy Search Engine.
Things he should have done and fun things he couldn’t justify
doing.Update:Design details of Audiogalaxy.com’s high performance MySQL search
engine. At peak times, the search engine needed to handle 1500-2000 searches
every second against a MySQL database with about 200 million rows.Search was
one of most interesting problems at Audiogalaxy. It was one of the core
functions of the site, and somewhere between 50 to 70 million searches were
performed every day. At peak times, the search engine needed to handle
1500-2000 searches every second against a MySQL database with about 200
million rows.</p><p>4 0.17700855 <a title="332-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-28-DuckDuckGo_Architecture_-_1_Million_Deep_Searches_a_Day_and_Growing.html">1395 high scalability-2013-01-28-DuckDuckGo Architecture - 1 Million Deep Searches a Day and Growing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an interview with Gabriel Weinberg, founder of Duck Duck Go and
general all around startup guru, on what DDG's architecture looks like in
2012.Innovative search engine upstart DuckDuckGo had30 million searchesin
February 2012 and averages over 1 million searches a day. It's being
positioned bysuper investor Fred Wilsonas a clean, private, impartial and fast
search engine. After talking with Gabriel I like what Fred Wilson said
earlier, it seems closer to the heart of the matter:We invested in DuckDuckGo
for the Reddit, Hacker News anarchists.                  Choosing DuckDuckGo
can be thought of as not just a technical choice, but a vote for revolution.
In an age when knowing your essence is not about about love or friendship, but
about more effectively selling you to advertisers, DDG is positioning
themselves as thedo not track alternative, keepers of theprivacy flame. You
will still be monetized of course, but in a more civilized and anonymous way.

<p>Introduction: Update:Anatomy of a crash in a new part of Yandex written in Django. Writing
to a magic session variable caused an unexpected write into an InnoDB database
on every request. Writes took 6-7 seconds because of index rebuilding. Lots of
useful details on the sizing of their system, what went wrong, and how they
fixed it.Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their
search index. We only know a few fun facts about how they do things, nothing
at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I
thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with
Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:3.5 billion pages in the search
index.Over several thousand servers.35 million searches a day.Several data
centers around Russia.Two-layer architecture.The database is split in pieces
and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database
servers and brings it together for the user.Languages used: c++, perl, some
java.FreeBSD</p><p>6 0.16292354 <a title="332-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-08-Search_fast_in_million_rows.html">342 high scalability-2008-06-08-Search fast in million rows</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have a table .This table has many columns but search performed based on 1
columns ,this table can have more than million rows.The data in these columns
is something like funny,new york,hollywoodUser can search with parameters as
funny hollywood .I need to take this 2 words and then search on column whether
that column contain this words and how many times .It is not possible to index
here .If the results return say 1200 results then without comparing each and
every column i can't determine no of results.I need to compare for each and
every column.This query is very frequent .How can i approach for this
problem.What type of architecture,tools is helpful.I just know that this can
be accomplished with distributed system but how can i make this system. I also
see in this website that LinkedIn uses Lucene for search .Is Lucene is helpful
in my case.My table has also lots of insertion ,however updation in not very
frequent.</p><p>4 0.83606058 <a title="332-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-14-kngine_%27Knowledge_Engine%27_milestone_2.html">630 high scalability-2009-06-14-kngine 'Knowledge Engine' milestone 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kngine is Knowledge Web search engine designed to provide meaningful search
results, such as: semantic information about the keywords/concepts, answer the
user's questions, discover the relations between the keywords/concepts, and
link the different kind of data together, such as: Movies, Subtitles, Photos,
Price at sale store, User reviews, and Influenced storyGoalsKngine long-term
goal is to make all human beings systematic knowledge and experience
accessible to everyone. I aim to collect and organize all objective data, and
make it possible and easy to access. Our goal is to build on the advances of
Web search engine, semantic web, data representation technologies a new form
of Web search engine that will unleash a revolution of new
possibilities.Kngine tries to combine the power of Web search engines with the
power of Semantic search and the data representation to provide meaningful
search results compromising user needs.StatusKngine starts as a research
project in October 2008. Ov</p><p>5 0.77991176 <a title="332-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-12-Search_the_tags_across_all_post.html">246 high scalability-2008-02-12-Search the tags across all post</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,I want to implement a search engine with lucene.To be scalable, I would
like to execute search jobs asynchronously (with a job queuing system).But i
don't know if it is a good design... Why ?Search results can be large ! (eg:
100+ pages with 25 documents per page)With asynchronous sytem, I need to store
results for each search job.I can set a short expiration time (~5 min) for
each search result, but it's still large.What do you think about it ?Which
design would you use for that ?ThanksMat</p><p>2 0.81388104 <a title="332-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-Conference%3A_Infoscale_2008_in_Italy_%28June_4-6%29.html">322 high scalability-2008-05-19-Conference: Infoscale 2008 in Italy (June 4-6)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Third International Conference on Scalable Information Systems will focus
on a wide array of scalability issues and investigate new approaches to tackle
problems arising from the ever-growing size and complexity of information of
all kinds.Looking at theirtechnical programa lot of interesting topics will be
covered. I see sensor networks, a subject I'm really interested in, has a
number of sessions. That's unusual. And it's in Italy!</p><p>3 0.8085289 <a title="332-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-11-FTP_Sanity%3A_Redundancy%2C_archiving%2C_consolidation..html">208 high scalability-2008-01-11-FTP Sanity: Redundancy, archiving, consolidation.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Easy FTP redundancy and consolidation with the Open Source project Generic-
FTP. Works with probably any Linux FTP Server (ProFTPD only one tested). Get
rid of some single points of failure. A very easy to set up solution using
scripts written in PHP. Tested thoroughly in a production environment.</p><p>4 0.80662298 <a title="332-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-30-Behind_the_scenes_of_an_online_marketplace.html">818 high scalability-2010-04-30-Behind the scenes of an online marketplace</a></p>

spoke about the technology at a large online marketplace in Germany

<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most
of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to
the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez
introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide
web of data.Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on
the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10
billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for
applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, withthe
Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible
to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge
structure. This talk will discuss graph databases, their underlying data
model, their querying mechanisms, and the benefits of the graph data structure
for modeling and analysis.</p><p>6 0.79605591 <a title="332-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-20-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_20%2C_2012.html">1287 high scalability-2012-07-20-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 20, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100 using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that would otherwise take an eternity to make,  a pile of money to create, and an unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of services. The battle for the future is on.

<p>Introduction: With cloud SLAs generally being worth what you don't pay for them, what can you do to protect yourself? Sean Hull in  AirBNB didn’t have to fail   has some solid advice on how to deal with outages:
  
  Use Redundancy . Make database and webserver tiers redundant using multi-az or alternately read-replicas.  
  Have a browsing only mode . Give users a read-only version of your site. Users may not even notice failures as they will only see problems when they need to perform a write operation. 
  Web Applications need Feature Flags . Build in the ability to turn off and on major parts of your site and flip the switch when problems arise. 
  Consider Netflix’s Simian . By randomly causing outages in your application you can continually test your failover and redundancy infrastructure. 
  Use multiple clouds . Use Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Clouds as a way of surviving outages in any one particular cloud. 
  
None of these are easy and it's worth considering that your application may</p><p>4 0.092295609 <a title="475-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-12-Report_from_OpenSocial_Meetup_at_Google.html">183 high scalability-2007-12-12-Report from OpenSocial Meetup at Google</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Facebook pulls a Microsoft and embraces and extends by opening their platform to other social sites like Bebo. Very smart and unexpected. More info at  Facebook to let other sites access platform code .      This month's regular Facebook   Meetup   was held at Google and the topic of the day was   OpenSocial  . For those of you with real lives, OpenSocial "provides a common set of APIs for social applications across multiple websites." Over 200 excited people, hoping to do very exciting things, and dreaming of making an exciting pile of money, watched an OpenSocial presentation put on by a couple of appropriately knowledgeable evangelists. I could feel my social graph being more successfully monetized with each passing minute.      Normally the meetings are much smaller, but Google puts on a very nice spread, so I think people may have showed up to dine :-) Or they could have showed up to learn why and how they should code to the new uber social API.

<p>Introduction: Hi,      We're running a enterprise SaaS solution that currently holds about 700 customers with up to 50.000 users per customer (growing quickly). Our customers have SLA agreements with us that contains guaranteed uptimes, response times and other performance counters. With an increasing number of customers and traffic we find it difficult to provide our customer with actual SLA data. We could set up external probes that monitors certain parts of the application, but this is time consuming with 700 customers (we do it today for our biggest clients). We can also extract data from web logs but they are now approaching about 30-40 GB a day.      What we really need is monitoring software that not only focuses on the internal performance counters but also lets us see the application from the customers viewpoint and allows us to aggregate data in different ways. Would the best approach be to develop a custom solution (for instance a distributed app that aggregates data from different logs e</p><p>6 0.086070508 <a title="475-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-08-Google_AppEngine_-_A_First_Look.html">301 high scalability-2008-04-08-Google AppEngine - A First Look</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Rumor no more.  Google Jumps Head First Into Web Services With Google App Engine . The quick and dirty of it: developers simply upload their Python code to Google, launch the application, and can monitor usage and other metrics via a multi-platform desktop application.  There were 10,000 developer slots open and of course I was too late. More as the cobra strikes.      Update: TechCrunch reports  Google To Launch BigTable As Web Service  next week. It competes with Amazon's SimpleDB. Though it won't be truly comparable until they also release an EC2 and S3 equivalent. An internet hit for each data access is a little painful. As Jimmy says in Goodfellas, "That's the way. You don't take no sh*t from nobody. "      First   Dave Winer   hallucinates a pig on the mean streets of Walnut Creek that told him Google's long foretold cloud offering will be free for bloggers of "modest needs." GigaOM then says a free cloud service is how Google could eat   Amazon's bacon for lunch  .</p><p>3 0.67806333 <a title="475-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-29-Google_App_Engine_plus_Amazon_AWS%3A_Best_of_both_worlds.html">641 high scalability-2009-06-29-Google App Engine plus Amazon AWS: Best of both worlds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Google App Engine (GAE) is focused on making development easy, but limits your options. Amazon Web Services is focused on making development flexible, but complicates the development process. Real enterprise applications require both of these paradigms to achieve success… What we really want is the flexibility of AWS and the simplicity of GAE.

<p>Introduction: Adrian Cockcroft on the future of    Cloud, Open Source, SaaS and the End of Enterprise Computing   :  
  
   Most big enterprise companies are actively working on their AWS rollout now. Most of them are also trying to get an in-house cloud to work, with varying amounts of success, but even the best private clouds are still years behind the feature set of public clouds, which is has a big impact on the agility and speed of product development  

    While the    Snowden revelations    have tattered the thin veil of trust secreting Big Brother from We the People, they may also be driving a fascinating new tension in architecture choices between Cloud Native (scale-out, IaaS), Amazon Native (rich service dependencies), and Enterprise Native (raw hardware, scale-up). 
   This tension became evident in a recent    HipChat interview    where HipChat, makers of an AWS based SaaS chat product, were busy creating an on-premises version of their product that could operate behind the firewall in</p><p>5 0.64423442 <a title="475-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-Google_App_Engine_-_what_about_existing_applications%3F.html">305 high scalability-2008-04-21-Google App Engine - what about existing applications?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently, Google announced Google App Engine, another announcement in the rapidly growing world of cloud computing. This brings up some very serious questions:      1. If we want to take advantage of one of the clouds, are we doomed to be locked-in for life?    2. Must we re-write our existing applications to use the cloud?    3. Do we need to learn a brand new technology or language for the cloud?      This post presents a pattern that will enable us to abstract our application code from the underlying cloud provider infrastructure. This will enable us to easily migrate our EXISTING applications to cloud based environment thus avoiding the need for a complete re-write.</p><p>6 0.6419223 <a title="475-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_22%2C_2011.html">1084 high scalability-2011-07-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 22, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This may be a bit higher level then the general discussion here, but I think this is an important issue in how it relates to reliability and uptime. What kind of SLAs should we be expecting from SaaS services and platforms (e.g. AWS, Google App Engine, Google Premium Apps, salesforce.com, etc.)? Up to today, most SaaS services either have no SLAs or offer very weak penalties. What will it take to get these services up to the point where they can offer the SLAs that users (and more importantly, businesses) require? I presume most of the members here want to see more movement into the cloud and to SaaS services, and I'm thinking that until we see more substantial SLA guarantees, most businesses will continue to shy away as long as they can.     Would love to hear what others think. Or am I totally off base?</p><p>2 0.76087397 <a title="475-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-10-Kill_the_Telcos_Save_the_Internet_-_The_Unsocial_Network.html">1140 high scalability-2011-11-10-Kill the Telcos Save the Internet - The Unsocial Network</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient and made the diagnosis. What did they find?
  
  Diagnostic team : the  Packet Pushers  gang ( Greg Ferro ,  Jan Zorz ,  Ivan Pepelnjak ) in the podcast  How We Are Killing the Internet .  
  Diagnosis : invasive tunnelation. ( tubes anyone? ) 
  Prognosis : even Dr. House might not be able to help. 
  Cure : go back to what the Internet was; kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything; disrupt the telcos. 
  
This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder, tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's all being carried out on battlefield few get</p><p>3 0.75172132 <a title="475-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-19-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_19%2C_2012.html">1344 high scalability-2012-10-19-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 19, 2012</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:
  
  @davilagrau : Youtube, GitHub,..., Are cloud services facing a entropic limit to scalability? 
 Async all the way down?  The Tyranny of the Clock : The cost of logic and memory dominated Turing's thinking, but today, communication rather than logic should dominate our thinking. Clock-free design uses less than half, about 40%, as much energy per addition as its clocked counterpart. We can regain the efficiency of local decision making by revolting against the pervasive beat of an external clock.  
  Why Google Compute Engine for OpenStack . Smart move. Having OpenStack work inside a super charged cloud, in private clouds, and as a bridge between the two ought to be quite attractive to developers looking for some sort of ally for independence. All it will take are a few victories to cement new alliances.

<p>Introduction: We will be developing an RIA that will have a lot of database access.  Think something like a QuickBooks but with about 50 transactions entered per hour per user.  Users will be in the system for 7 to 9 hours a day and there will be around 20,000 users, all logged in at the same time.     Reporting will be done just like a QuickBooks style app plus a lot of extra things you don't do in QuickBooks.     Our operations is familiar with W2003 Server and MS SQL Server so they are recommending we stick with that.  I originally requested Linux and PostgreSQL.     How far can a single database server get me?  If we have a 4 processor, 8 core, 128gb server, how far am I going to get before I need to shard or do something else?  I know there are a lot of factors involved but in general for this size of a site, what should the strategy be?       I've read almost all articles on this website but most of the applications are not RIA type of apps with this type of usage or they are architectures for</p><p>5 0.74269068 <a title="475-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Paper%3A_Dynamo%3A_Amazon%E2%80%99s_Highly_Available_Key-value_Store.html">139 high scalability-2007-10-30-Paper: Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2 : Read/WriteWeb  has a good article talking about the scalability issues of relational databases and how Dynamo solves them:  Amazon Dynamo: The Next Generation Of Virtual Distributed Storage . But since Dynamo is just another frustrating walled garden protected by barbed wire and guard dogs, its relevance is somewhat overstated.   Update :  Greg Linden  has a take on the paper where he questions some of Amazon's design choices: emphasizing write availability over fast reads, a lack of indexing support, use of random distribution for load balancing,  and punting on some scalability issues.  Werner Vogels, Amazon's avuncular CTO, just announced a new  paper  on the internal database technology Amazon uses to handle tens of millions customers. I'll dive into more details later, but I thought you'd want to read it hot off the blog. The bad news is it won't be a service. They are keeping this tech not so secret, but very safe. Happily, it's another real-life example to learn from.</p><p>6 0.72021878 <a title="475-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-10-How_do_we_make_a_large_real-time_search_engine%3F.html">64 high scalability-2007-08-10-How do we make a large real-time search engine?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Erasure codesare one of those seemingly magical mathematical creations that
with the developments described in the paper XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure
Codes for Big Data, are set to replace triple replication as the data storage
protection mechanism of choice.The result says Robin Harris (StorageMojo) in
an excellent article, Facebook's advanced erasure codes: "WebCos will be able
to store massive amounts of data more efficiently than ever before. Bad news:
so will anyone else."Robin says with cheap disks triple replication made sense
and was economical. With ever bigger BigData the overhead has become costly.
But erasure codes have always suffered from unacceptably long time to repair
times. This paper describes new Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) that are
efficiently repairable in disk I/O and bandwidth requirements:These systems
are now designed to survive the loss of up to four storage elements - disks,
servers, nodes or even entire data centers - without losing any data.

<p>Introduction: Comet is anactive distributed key-value storebuilt at the University of
Washington. The paper describing Comet is Comet: An active distributed key-
value store, there are also slides, and a MP3 of a presentation given atOSDI
'10. Here's a succinct overview of Comet:Today's cloud storage services, such
as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety
of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes,
fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility
first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption
keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage
service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their
data's behavior inside the storage service.I found this paper quite
interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-
value store, which turns it into what might called a key-code store. This is

<p>Introduction: pNFS (parallel NFS) is the next generation of NFS and its main claim to fame
is that it's clustered, which "enables clients to directly access file data
spread over multiple storage servers in parallel. As a result, each client can
leverage the full aggregate bandwidth of a clustered storage service at the
granularity of an individual file." About pNFSStorageMojosays:pNFS is going to
commoditize parallel data access. In 5 years we won't know how we got along
without it. Something to watch.</p><p>6 0.73004329 <a title="368-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-27-Paper%3A_XORing_Elephants%3A_Novel_Erasure_Codes_for_Big_Data.html">1483 high scalability-2013-06-27-Paper: XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure Codes for Big Data</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected
availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P
systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show
you how! They havelaunched Wuala, the social online storage service which
scales as new nodes join the P2P network.The goal ofWua.lais to provide
distributed online storage that is:largescalablereliablesecureby harnessing
the idle resources of participating computers.This challenge is an old dream
of computer science. In fact asAndrew Tanenbaumwrote in 1995:"The design of a
world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by
millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise
for the reader"After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich,
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system,
Caleido is ready to unveil the result: Wuala. Wuala is a new way of storing,

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like?
Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing.
Specifically the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group(IPNSIG
).Ansible-likefaster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical
warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning
telegraph system.It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more
interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that
was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances
and with muchlonger delays:The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also
called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a
set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2]
Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances,
so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to
large delays and errors.[2] While the In</p><p>6 0.71009517 <a title="368-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL_and_Memcached%3A_End_of_an_Era%3F.html">785 high scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL and Memcached: End of an Era?</a></p>

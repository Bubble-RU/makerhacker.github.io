<p>Introduction: The first meeting of this Online Gaming High Scalability SIG will be on the
9th of July 2009 in central London, starting at 10 AM and finishing around
5PM.The main topic of this meeting will be potentials for using cloud and grid
technologies in online gaming systems. In addition to experience reports from
the community, we have invited some of the leading cloud experts in the UK to
discuss the benefits such as resource elasticity and challenges such as
storage and security that companies from other industries have experienced. We
will have a track for IT managers focused on business opportunities and issues
and a track for architects and developers more focused on implementation
issues.The event is free but up-front registration is required for capacity
planning, so please let us know in advance, if you are planning to attend by
completing the registration form on this pageTo propose a talk or for

<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the
Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that
provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It
also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke
about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week - here is the summary
of that presentation.ďťżhttp://gojko.net/2010/01/25/designing-applications-for-

<p>Introduction: CloudCampis an interesting unconference where early adapters of Cloud
Computing technologies exchange ideas. With the rapid change occurring in the
industry, we need a place we can meet to share our experiences, challenges and
solutions. At CloudCamp, you are encouraged you to share your thoughts in
several open discussions, as we strive for the advancement of Cloud Computing.
End users, IT professionals and vendors are all encouraged to
participate.CloudCamp Silicon Valley 08is scheduled for Tuesday, September 30,
2008 from 06:00 PM - 10:00 PM in Sun Microsystems' EBC Briefing Center15
Network CircleMenlo Park, CA 94025CloudCamp follows an interactive, unscripted
unconference format. You can propose your own session or you can attend a
session proposed by someone else. Either way, you are encouraged to engage in
the discussion and “Vote with your feet”, which means … “find another session
if you don’t find the session helpful”. Pick and choose from the
conversations; rant and rave, or</p><p>6 0.13564569 <a title="354-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-14-Big_List_of_Scalabilty_Conferences.html">1115 high scalability-2011-09-14-Big List of Scalabilty Conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The GigaOM Network today announces its second Structure conference after the
runaway success of the 2008 event. The Structure 09 conference returns to San
Francisco, Calif., on June 25th, 2009.Structure 09 (http://structureconf.com)
is a conference designed to explore the next generations of Internet
infrastructure. Over a year ago, The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik saw that
the platforms on which we have done business for over a decade were starting
to provide diminishing returns, and smart money was seeking new options.
Structure 09 looks at the changing needs and rapid growth in the Internet
infrastructure sector, and this year's event will consider the impact of the
global economy. "I cannot remember a time when a new technology had so much
relevance to our industry as cloud computing does in the current economic
climate," said The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik. "We all need to find ways
to leverage what we have and cut costs without compromising future options.

<p>Introduction: From their website:FAIis an automated installation tool to install or deploy
Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a
Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat,
autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used
for configuration management of a running system.You can take one or more
virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction
necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your
computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized
management system for your Linux deployment.breakFAI's target group are system
administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of
computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general
purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a
rendering farm, a web server</p><p>4 0.60613537 <a title="354-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-13-un-article%3A_the_setup_behind_microsoft.com.html">186 high scalability-2007-12-13-un-article: the setup behind microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On the blogs.technet.com article on microsoft.com's infrastructure:The article
reads like a blatant ad for it's own products, and is light on the technical
side.The juicy bits are here, so you know what the fuss is about:Cytrix
Netscaler (= loadbalancer with various optimizations)W2K8 + IIS7 and antivirus
software on the webservers650GB/day ISS log files8-9GBit/s (unknown if CDN's
are included)Simple network filtering: stateless access lists blocking
unwanted ports on the routers/switches (hence the debated "no firewalls"
claim).Note that this information may not reflect present reality very well;
the spokesman appears to be reciting others words.</p><p>5 0.56981182 <a title="354-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-26-Database_Optimize_patterns.html">607 high scalability-2009-05-26-Database Optimize patterns</a></p>

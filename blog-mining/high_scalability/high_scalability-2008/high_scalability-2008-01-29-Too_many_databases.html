<p>Introduction: Drupal 7 is having a scalability makeover. Karoly Negyesi, Drupal Core Developer and Public Development Team Lead, explains the process in this video:  Drupal 7 APIs, scalability mindset . Karoly states the general theme of the changes as:  You give up some control and you get back scalability . An interesting comment on the politics of scalability?
 
Makeover may not be quite the right word though. A makeover implies a cosmetic change, looking better by changing the surface. Drupal's changes will go deeper than that, right to Drupal's core. It's a genuine and authentic change that will hopefully allow one of the Internet's most venerable Content Management Systems (CMSs) to compete with a constant stream of younger and sexier models.
 
Drupal is based on an older LAMP stack approach where PHP modules are scooped up and merged together each time a request is made to Drupal. Drupal's most intriguing idea is how it is built, expands, and changes by  weaving together a single system  out</p><p>4 0.21828926 <a title="231-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-18-limit_on_the_number_of_databases_open.html">252 high scalability-2008-02-18-limit on the number of databases open</a></p>

<p>Introduction: the authors of drupal have paid considerable attention to performance and scalability. consequently even a default install running on modest hardware can easily handle the demands a small website.     if you are lucky, eventually the time comes when you need to service more users than your system can handle. at some point, you'll start looking at your hardware and network deployment.

<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is  indeed the case:
 
 Research  conducted by HP   found that the majority of businesses in the EMEA region  are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the cloud. Of the 940  respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-critical apps at some  point over the next two to five years.
 
A more recent  survey, by research firm  MeriTalk   and sponsored by VMware and EMC (NYSE: EMC  ), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to  move some mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within  two years, the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their  mission-critical apps to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of  their mission-critical apps to run in the cloud.

<p>Introduction: Here's my template for describing the architecture of a system. The idea is to have people fill out this template and that then becomes the basis for a profile. This is how the   Friends for Sale   post was created and I think that turned out well. People always want more detail, but realistically you can only expect so much.     The template is definitely too long, but it's more just a series of questions to jog people's memories and then they can answer whatever they think is important.

<p>Introduction: Here's my template for describing the architecture of a system. The idea is to have people fill out this template and that then becomes the basis for a profile.

<p>Introduction: Hi,         I am using drupal for my clients website, and was thinking is it possible to host all ( about 500) of them on the same server(maybe VPS or dedicated).       Here is the situation..... Each clients website has a database with about 50 tables each, all the databases are small in size about 2-5 MB .... and the websites are low traffic websites with say.. 50 hits/day on avg.... that means about 2000 queries/db/day ..... (avg 40 queries per hit)....         Wanted to know if it is possible to have so many databases about 500 on the same server?         what are the things that i should look into if i should make this happen?</p><p>5 0.9466666 <a title="231-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-16-The_5_Biggest_Ways_to_Boost_MySQL_Scalability.html">1099 high scalability-2011-08-16-The 5 Biggest Ways to Boost MySQL Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sean Hall  with some really good  MySQL advice : 
  
  Tune those queries . Biggest bang for your buck. Enable the slow query log and watch it. Once you've found a heavy resource intensive query, optimize it! Tune what receives real-world traffic.  
  Employ Master-Master Replication . Immediately have a read-only slave for your application to hit as well. 
  Use Your Memory . Set innodb_buffer_pool_size, key_buffer_size and other key options. 
  RAID Your Disk I/O . Use RAID 10 mirroring and striping. On EC2 striping across a number of EBS volumes using the Linux md software raid. 
  Tune Key Parameters . speeds up inserts & updates with innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2; create a tablespace and underlying datafile for each table with innodb_file_per_table.

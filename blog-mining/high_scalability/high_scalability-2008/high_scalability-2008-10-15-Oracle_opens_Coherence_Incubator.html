<p>Introduction: Space-based architectures are an alternative to the traditional n-tier model
for enterprise applications. Instead of a vertical tier partitioning, space
based applications are partitioned horizontally into self-sufficient units.
This leads to almost linear scalability of stateful, high-performance
applications.This is arecording of a talk I did last monthwhere I introduce
space based programming and demonstrate how that works in practice on the .NET
platform using Oracle Coherence and GigaSpaces.</p><p>5 0.13734061 <a title="416-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-13-CloudCamp_London_2%3A_private_clouds_and_standardisation.html">441 high scalability-2008-11-13-CloudCamp London 2: private clouds and standardisation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jumping around the social mediasphere, it's not uncommon to feel the heat
generated in praise of a favorite this or that over all the clearly inferior
alternatives. Whilst human nature may never cool, I think Old Will had some
insight worth considering the next time a flame threatens to flicker forth:My
mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130)My mistress' eyes are
nothing like the sun;Coral is far more red than her lips' red ;If snow be
white, why then her breasts are dun;If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her
head.I have seen roses damask, red and white,But no such roses see I in her
cheeks;And in some perfumes is there more delightThan in the breath that from
my mistress reeks.I love to hear her speak, yet well I knowThat music hath a
far more pleasing sound;I grant I never saw a goddess go;My mistress, when she
walks, treads on the ground:And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rareAs any
she belied with false compare.-William Shakespeare</p><p>3 0.52339447 <a title="416-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-16-TechDev_Stages.html">681 high scalability-2009-08-16-TechDev Stages</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey guys,There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy
vmware...everywhere.I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when
it comes to resources.What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of
using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.Today we get lots
of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well. 40x HP blades,
apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's. (20
servers in 2 datacentres).The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including
the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our
internal networks. This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have
ever lived by while working on the inet. No airgaps from the unknown to the
known!I am interested in feedback on this scenario.From a resource
perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time
due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.Do

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byPeter Offringa, VP of engineering atZoosk. Zoosk is a
50 million member romantic social network.Our members get the most rewarding
experience from Zoosk when they can interact in real-time. After all, a future
relationship is potentially at the other end of every connection a user makes.
The excitement and richness of this situation can only be fully realized in
real-time. The suite of Zoosk services facilitating these interactions are
referred to by the general description of real-time communications (RTC).
These communications are delivered using the XMPP protocol, which also powers
other popular instant messaging products. Zoosk members experience real-time
communications within three distinct interactions:Presence.  When a member is

<p>Introduction: Drupal 7 is having a scalability makeover. Karoly Negyesi, Drupal Core
Developer and Public Development Team Lead, explains the process in this
video:Drupal 7 APIs, scalability mindset. Karoly states the general theme of
the changes as:You give up some control and you get back scalability. An
interesting comment on the politics of scalability?Makeover may not be quite
the right word though. A makeover implies a cosmetic change, looking better by
changing the surface. Drupal's changes will go deeper than that, right to
Drupal's core. It's a genuine and authentic change that will hopefully allow
one of the Internet's most venerable Content Management Systems (CMSs) to
compete with a constant stream of younger and sexier models.Drupal is based on
an older LAMP stack approach where PHP modules are scooped up and merged
together each time a request is made to Drupal. Drupal's most intriguing idea

<p>Introduction: If you just can't get enough high scalability talk you might want to take a
look GigaOm's Structure 08 conference. The slate of speakers looks
appropriately interesting and San Francisco is truly magical this time of

discount code! I'll be on vacation so I won't see you there, but it looks like
a good time. For a nice change of pace consider visitingMoMAnext door. Here's
a blurb on the conference:A reminder to our readers about Structure 08,
GigaOm's upcomingconference dedicated to web infrastructure. In addition to

<p>Introduction: It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just let the random
chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting content." #fail.
While someone says this I imagine them flicking their hair back in a "I can't

like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts

<p>Introduction: I fully and enthusiastically encourage anyone who wants to share a relevant
topic to register and post. People have added a lot of good and useful
content. Don't be shy. It's been asked how a teaser is created when posting so
the full article doesn't display on the front page. A teaser is a paragraph
interesting enough to convince readers to click on the "read more" link to get
the full article.breakCreating a teaser in Drupal is accomplished by inserting
< ! -- break -- > on a separate line directly after the text you want to be
the teaser. Only DO NOT include the spaces. So your post looks like:Teaser
Content< ! -- break -- > (no spaces in real life)Rest of ContentIt's a bit
kludgey, but it works.</p><p>2 0.85547471 <a title="210-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-30-Expandability%3A_Steve_Wozniak%27s_Biggest_Success_and_Nolan_Bushnell%27s_Biggest_Regret.html">1524 high scalability-2013-09-30-Expandability: Steve Wozniak's Biggest Success and Nolan Bushnell's Biggest Regret</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder Steve
Wozniakand Atari founderNolan Bushnell, had a chance to sit down for a chat at
the C2SVconference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can
decide futures.  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability  Steve talked about
how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years
of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was
expandable. It hadeight expansion slotsand the RAM was also expandable
(starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility
orexpansion capabilities. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the
Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak
won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They
published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer
community. So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh all failed,
the Apple II kept roll</p><p>3 0.71052241 <a title="210-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis_-_Scaling_an_Email-based_App_from_Scratch.html">1269 high scalability-2012-06-20-iDoneThis - Scaling an Email-based App from Scratch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO ofiDoneThis, which makes status
reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch.iDoneThisis
a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day
to ask, "What'd you get done today?" Just reply with a few lines of what you
got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what
the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and
kickstart another awesome day.Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a
weekend in the most rudimentary way possible. I kid you not, we sent the first
few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox. The upshot
is that we've had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.We've gone
from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by
hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming
emails per month. In total, customers have recorded over 1.7 million

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:Quotable Quotes:@rodos: With so much manure in the
room of #BigData the must be a pony in here somewhere!@adron: #ricon2012 OH
"it isn't cloud, nosql or whatever, it's distributed systems... That is the
change!" Smartest thing stated at a conf in ages.@justinesherry: First lesson
watching @eric_brewer's keynote at #ricon2012 -- distributed systems make you
go bald. (Both audience and speaker!)@adron: OH "What's the hello world of
distributed systems?" "Twitter."Mikael Ronstrom: A long career on distributed
systems has learnt me that it is extremely important to do proper partitioning
of data sets to achieve scalability on network level. But it is still
extremely important to make each node in the distributed system as large as
possible. Greg Linden: Surprising: "It can be three to four times the cost for
the retailer to pick items and pack them from a store versus having a really
efficient, automated process back in a distribution center."Dan Rayburn: CDNs

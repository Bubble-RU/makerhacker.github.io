<p>Introduction: Benjamin Erb  ( @b_erb ) from Ulm University recently published his diploma thesis on  "Concurrent Programming for Scalable Web Architectures" . The thesis provides a comprehensive survey on different concepts and techniques of concurrency inside web  architectures, including web servers, application logic and storage backends. It incorporates research publications, hands-on reports  and also regards popular programming languages, frameworks and  databases.
 
 Abstract:  
  

Web architectures are an important asset for various large-scale web applications, such as social networks or e-commerce sites. Being able to handle huge numbers of users concurrently is essential, thus scalability is one of the most important features of these architectures. Multi-core processors, highly distributed backend architectures and new web technologies force us to reconsider approaches for concurrent programming in order to implement web applications and fulfil scalability demands.

<p>Introduction: Hi,      We're running a enterprise SaaS solution that currently holds about 700 customers with up to 50.000 users per customer (growing quickly). Our customers have SLA agreements with us that contains guaranteed uptimes, response times and other performance counters. With an increasing number of customers and traffic we find it difficult to provide our customer with actual SLA data. We could set up external probes that monitors certain parts of the application, but this is time consuming with 700 customers (we do it today for our biggest clients). We can also extract data from web logs but they are now approaching about 30-40 GB a day.      What we really need is monitoring software that not only focuses on the internal performance counters but also lets us see the application from the customers viewpoint and allows us to aggregate data in different ways. Would the best approach be to develop a custom solution (for instance a distributed app that aggregates data from different logs e</p><p>4 0.083913147 <a title="236-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-13-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_13th%2C_2013.html">1564 high scalability-2013-12-13-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 13th, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Virtualization offers a lot of benefits, but it also comes with a  cost  (memory, CPU, network, IO, licensing). If you are in or running a cloud then some form of virtualization may not even be an option. But if you are running your own string of servers you can choose to go without. Free will and all that. Should you or shouldn't you?  In a detailed comparison the folks at  37signals  found that  running their Rails application servers without virtualization  resulted in  A 66% reduction in the response time while handling multiples of the traffic is beyond what I expected .   As is common 37signals runs their big database servers without virtualization. They use a scale-up approach at the database tier so extracting every bit of performance out of those servers is key. Application servers typically use a scale-out approach for scalability, which is virtualization friendly, but that says nothing about performance.   Finding performance increases, especially when you are running on a d</p><p>6 0.076440245 <a title="236-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-06-Paper%3A_High-Performance_Concurrency_Control_Mechanisms_for_Main-Memory_Databases.html">1299 high scalability-2012-08-06-Paper: High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for Main-Memory Databases</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Douglas Wilson, EMEA Field Application Engineer at Raima, based on insights from biulding their  Raima Database Manager . 
   Scalability and Hardware   
 Scalability is the ability to maintain performance as demands on the system increase, by adding further resources. Normally those resources will be in the form of hardware. Since processor speeds are no longer increasing much, scaling up the hardware normally means adding extra processors or cores, and more memory. 
   Scalability and Software   
 However, scalability requires software that can utilize the extra hardware effectively. The software must be designed to allow parallel processing. In the context of a database engine this means that the server component must be   multi-threaded  , to allow the operating system to schedule parallel tasks on all the cores that are available. Not only that, but the database engine must provide an efficient way to break its workload into as many parallel tasks as there</p><p>3 0.67138398 <a title="236-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-31-Paper%3A_Everything_You_Always_Wanted_to_Know_About_Synchronization_but_Were_Afraid_to_Ask.html">1541 high scalability-2013-10-31-Paper: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but Were Afraid to Ask</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core architectures:  Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but Were Afraid to Ask .
 
The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't appear to be generically possible:
  
 None of the nine locking schemes we consider consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality,  a lock algorithm should thus be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload .  
  
Abstract:
  

This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures, from single-socket – uniform and nonuniform – to multi-socket – directory and broadcastbased – many-cores. We draw a set of observations t</p><p>4 0.66070867 <a title="236-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-25-Application_Database_and_DAL_Architecture.html">222 high scalability-2008-01-25-Application Database and DAL Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups (this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day, let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>5 0.65440381 <a title="236-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-21-Running_TPC-C_on_MySQL-RDS.html">1065 high scalability-2011-06-21-Running TPC-C on MySQL-RDS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently came across a TPC-C benchmark results held on MySQL based RDS databases. You can see it  here . I think the results may bring light to many questions concerning MySQL scalability in general and RDS scalability in particular. (For disclosure, I'm working for  ScaleBase  where we run an internal scale out TPC-C benchmark these days, and will publish results soon).
  TPC-C  
TPC-C is a standard database benchmark, used to measure databases. The database vendors invest big bucks in running this test, and showing off which database is faster, and can scale better.
 
It is a write intensive test, so it doesn’t necessarily reflect the behavior of the database in your application. But it does give some very important insights on what you can expect from your database under heavy load.
  The Benchmark Process  
First of all, I have some comments for the benchmark method itself.
  
 Generally - the benchmarks were held in an orderly fashion and in a rather methodological way – which i</p><p>6 0.65427202 <a title="236-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-25-How_To_Make_an_Infinitely_Scalable_Relational_Database_Management_System_%28RDBMS%29.html">1553 high scalability-2013-11-25-How To Make an Infinitely Scalable Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We have a database today that holds all of our shared inventory. How do we scale out ? We run into concurrency issues today as mutliple users may want to access the same inventory,etc.      Im sure its a common problem.. So how do folks implement this while also having faster response to available inventory and also ensuring no downtime     Thanks</p><p>2 0.80027819 <a title="236-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-Speed_up_%28Oracle%29_database_code_with_result_caching.html">230 high scalability-2008-01-29-Speed up (Oracle) database code with result caching</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the most interesting new features of Oracle 11 is the new function result caching mechanism. Until now, making sure that a PL/SQL function gets executed only as many times as necessary was a black art. The new caching system makes that quite easy -- here is how it works.</p><p>3 0.78784364 <a title="236-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-23-Paper%3A_CRDTs%3A_Consistency_without_concurrency_control.html">963 high scalability-2010-12-23-Paper: CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For a great Christmas read forget  The Night Before Christmas , a heart warming poem written by Clement Moore for his children, that created the modern idea of Santa Clause we all know and anticipate each Christmas eve. Instead, curl up with a some potentÂ  eggnog , nog being any drink made with rum, and readÂ  CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control Â by Mihai Letia, Nuno PreguiĂ§a, and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),  a data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent .
 
From the introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed consistency issues:
  

Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach [</p><p>4 0.787449 <a title="236-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-02-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_2%2C_2012.html">1203 high scalability-2012-03-02-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 2, 2012</a></p>

 Quotable quotes:             
 
  @karmafile : "Scalability" is a much more evil word than we make it out to be 
  @ostaquet : More hardware won't solve #SQL resp. time issues; proper indexing does. 
  @datachick : All computing technology is the rearrangement of data. Data is the center of the universe 
 ‏ @jamesurquhart : "Complexity is a characteristic of the system, not of the parts in it." 
 
 
 Data is the star of the cat walk, looking fierce in Ilya Katsov's impeccably constructed post on  NoSQL Data Modeling Techniques : In this article I provide a short comparison of NoSQL system families from the data modeling point of view and digest several common modeling techniques.  
 Peter Burns  talks computer nanosecond time scales  as a human might experience them. Your memory == computer registers , L1 cache == papers kept close by, L2 cache == books, RAM == the library down the street, and going to disk is a 3 year odessy for data.

<p>Introduction: At Monday's  Cloud Computing Meetup ,  Paco Nathan  gave an excellent   Getting Started on Hadoop   talk ( slides ). I found one of Paco's strategies particularly interesting: consider when a service starts charging in cost calculations. Depending on your use case it may be cheaper to go with a more expensive service that charges only for work accomplished rather than charging for both work + startup time.
 
The example is comparing the cost of running Hadoop on AWS yourself versus using Amazon's prepackaged Hadoop service,  Elastic MapReduce  (EMR). The thought may have gone through your mind as it did mine that it doesn't necessarily make sense to use Amazon's Hadoop service. Why pay a premium for EMR when Hadoop will run directly on AWS?
 
One reason is that Amazon has made significant changes to Hadoop to make it run more efficiently and easily on AWS. The other more surprising reason is cost.
 
When starting a 500 node Hadoop cluster, for example, you have to wait for all the node</p><p>6 0.77789915 <a title="236-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-18-Google_on_Latency_Tolerant_Systems%3A_Making_a_Predictable_Whole_Out_of_Unpredictable_Parts___.html">1266 high scalability-2012-06-18-Google on Latency Tolerant Systems: Making a Predictable Whole Out of Unpredictable Parts   </a></p>

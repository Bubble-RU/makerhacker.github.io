  Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love: SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards. 
  Flexible sharding strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific logic.

<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Why you don’t want to shard.  by Morgon on the MySQL Performance Blog.  Optimize everything else first, and then if performance still isn’t good enough, it’s time to take a very bitter medicine.    Update 3:   Building Scalable Databases: Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemes  by Dare Obasanjo. Excellent discussion of why and when you would choose a sharding architecture, how to shard, and problems with sharding.  Update 2:   Mr. Moore gets to punt on sharding  by Alan Rimm-Kaufman of 37signals. Insightful article on design tradeoffs and the evils of premature optimization. With more memory, more CPU, and new tech like SSD,  problems can be avoided before more exotic architectures like sharding are needed.  Add features not infrastructure.  Jeremy Zawodny  says he's wrong wrong wrong. we're running multi-core CPUs at slower clock speeds. Moore won't save you.

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>5 0.21969399 <a title="358-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr_Architecture.html">152 high scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've been interested in sharding concepts since first hearing the term "shard" a few years back. My interest had been piqued earlier, the first time I read about Google's original approach to distributed search. It was described as a hashtable-like system in which independent physical machines play the role of the buckets. More recently, I needed the capacity and performance of a Sharded system, but did not find helpful libraries or toolkits which would assist with the configuration for my language of preference these days, which is Python. And, since I had a few weeks on my hands, I decided I would begin the work of creating these tools.       The result of my initial work the Pyshards project, a still-incomplete python and MySQL based horizontal partitioning and sharding toolkit. HighScalability.com readers will already know that horizontal partitioning is a data segmenting pattern in which distinct groups of physical row-based datasets are distributed across multiple partitions.

<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all shards.     There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys across a shard cluster. Each has its pro’s and con’s and the one chosen should be specific to the problems you’re trying to solve.</p><p>5 0.69618315 <a title="358-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Sharding_with_Cookie-Based_Session_Storage.html">207 high scalability-2008-01-10-Sharding with Cookie-Based Session Storage</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update :  A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview with  Google engineer Max Ross on Hibernate Shards . Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to Google AppEngine (not much).   To scale you are supposed to partition your data. Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all the details it’s not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff in the right way and it’s very much worth looking at, especially if you us</p><p>2 0.97598737 <a title="358-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling_Pinterest_-_From_0_to_10s_of_Billions_of_Page_Views_a_Month_in_Two_Years.html">1440 high scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling Pinterest - From 0 to 10s of Billions of Page Views a Month in Two Years</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>3 0.97287738 <a title="358-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay_history_and_architecture.html">550 high scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay history and architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ebay  [1]     Starts in 1995, initial name AuctionWeb (V1) :   - very simple architecture    - based on perl   - no database, for data persistence they used plain files     Because of rapid growth they needed to improve their architecture and so  V2 (clever name) was born:   - replaced perl with C/C++   - started using a database in a master-slave configuration   - C++ back-end    - XSLT  front-end    Any request will lead to an XML file being created in C++ and the XLST processor will transform that into html.   *pretty sophisticated architecture for the 90s, XLST was cutting-edge back then*             That hold out pretty well for a while but in the late 90s ebay experienced an exponential growth.   They started having some trouble with outages and needed improvements, so V3 was developed:   - based on java   - search engine still used C++   - proof that relational databases can scale (aggressive caching)   - developed a messaging layer for making a lot of asyncronious calls, they a</p><p>4 0.97220981 <a title="358-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_11th%2C_2013.html">1530 high scalability-2013-10-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 11th, 2013</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time:
    In honor of Twitter's Cha-Ching moment, here's  Twitter By the Numbers    
 Quotable Quotes:                                             
 
  @BrandonBloom : Mutable data structures are only faster b/c they have fewer features: ie no persistence. You must manually recover that feature w/ copying. 
  @hayesdrumwright : Scale breaks hardware Speed breaks software Scale and speed breaks everything Adrian Cockcroft - Netflix #TechSummit 
   Gladwell, Malcolm : Saul thinks of power in terms of physical might. He doesn’t appreciate that power can come in other forms as well— in breaking rules, in substituting speed and surprise for strength.  
 
 
 Now here's an irony. The East India Company established a major trading post at Bantam in Java. They called their trading posts "factories." Get it? Java. Factories. That's stranger than fiction.

<p>Introduction: Pork. The Other HighScalability:
  
 PlentyOfFish:  6 Billion Page Views ; World:  info doubling every 2 years ; 2015:  7,910 exabytes of global digital data ; Khan Academy:  4 million uniques ; G+:  62 million users ; Zynga:   leased 9 megawatts of capacity ; Heroku:  billions of page views a month  
 Quoteable quotes:        
 
  Udi Dhan  : Scalability is not boolean. 
 John Boyd: Look at the mission, not the technology. And if you do look at the mission, don't look at the most fashionable mission of the day. 
  @BigDataClouds  : I think the fear of change is the biggest challenge that companies are facing 
  @cjzero  : If you were wondering, the #Mythbusters scalability test of a Newton's Cradle using wrecking balls? Busted. 
  @Xorlev  : Scalability is really really hard. That's why it's fun. It pushes the limits of engineering talent.

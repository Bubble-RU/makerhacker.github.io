<p>Introduction: If you started out building a dating site and instead ended up  building a
video sharing site (YouTube) that handles 4 billion views a day, then it's
just possible you learned something along the way. And indeed, Mike Solomon,
one of the original engineers at YouTube, did learn a lot and he has given a
talk about it atPyCon:Scalability at YouTube.This isn't an architecture driven
talk where we are led through a description of how a lot of boxes connect to
each other. Mike could give that sort of talk. He has worked on building
YouTube's servlet infrastructure, video indexing feature, video transcoding
system, their full text search, a CDN, and much more. But instead, he's taken
a step back, took a long look around at what time has wrought, and shared some
deep lessons, obviously hard won from experience.The key takeaway away of the
talk for me was doinga lot with really simple tools. While many teams are
moving on to more complex ecosystems, YouTube really does keep it simple. They

<p>Introduction: Limelight says 95% of Mobile Video Views Take Place in First 90 Days and 88.8
percent of views take place in the first 30 days.Since a lot of people are
working with video, which is expensive to store and serve, the implication:
there's little need to keep your video close to the user or on a CDN after 30
days.</p><p>6 0.24148735 <a title="274-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-21-What_CDN_would_you_recommend%3F.html">576 high scalability-2009-04-21-What CDN would you recommend?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Viddler is in the high quality Video as a Service business for a customer who
wants to pay a fixed cost, be done with it, and just have it work. Similar to
Blip and Ooyala, more focussed on business than YouTube. They serve thousands
of business customers, including high traffic websites like FailBlog,
Engadget, and Gawker.Viddler is a good case to learn from because they are a
small company trying to provide a challenging service in a crowded field. We
are catching them just as they transitioning from a startup that began in one
direction, as a YouTube competitor, and pivoted into a slightly larger company
focussed on paying business customers.Transition is the key word for Viddler:
transitioning from a free YouTube clone to a high quality paid service.
Transitioning from a few colo sites that didn't work well to a new higher
quality datacenter. Transitioning from an architecture that was typical of a
startup to one that features redundancy, high availability, and automation.

<p>Introduction: Harish Ganesan CTO of8KMiles has a very helpful blog, Cloud, Big Data and
Mobile, where he shows a nice analytical bent which leads to a lot of
practical advice and cost saving tips:Use SQS Batch Requests to reduce the
number of requests hitting SQS which saves costs. Sending 10 messages in a
single batch request which in the example save $30/month.Use SQS Long Polling
to reduce extra polling requests, cutting down empty receives, which in the
example saves ~$600 in empty receive leakage costs.Choose the right search
technology choice to save costs in AWS by matching your activity pattern to
the technology. For a small application with constant load or a heavily
utilized search tier or seasonal loads Amazon Cloud Search looks like the cost
efficient play. Use Amazon CloudFront Price Class to minimize costs by
selecting the right Price Class for your audience to potentially reduce
delivery costs by excluding Amazon CloudFront's more expensive edge
locations.Optimize ElastiCache Cluster</p><p>2 0.97579789 <a title="274-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-06-Building_a_Unique_Data_Warehouse.html">716 high scalability-2009-10-06-Building a Unique Data Warehouse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are many reasons to roll your own data storage solution on top of
existing technologies. We've seen stories on HighScalability about custom
databases for very large sets of individual data(like Twitter) and large
amounts of binary data (like Facebook pictures). However, I recently ran into
a unique type of problem. I was tasked with recording and storing bandwidth
information for more than 20,000 servers and their associated networking
equipment. This data needed to be accessed in real-time, with less than a 5
minute delay between the data being recorded and the datashowing up on
customer bandwidth graphs on our customer portal.After numerous false starts
with off the shelf components and existing database clustering technology, we
decided we must roll our own system. The real key to our problem (literally)
was the ratio of the size of the key to the size of the actual data. Because
the tracked metric was so small (a 64-bit counter) compared to the unique
identifier (32-bit netwo</p><p>3 0.97524005 <a title="274-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-02-The_Data-Scope_Project_-_6PB_storage%2C_500GBytes-sec_sequential_IO%2C_20M_IOPS%2C_130TFlops.html">1186 high scalability-2012-02-02-The Data-Scope Project - 6PB storage, 500GBytes-sec sequential IO, 20M IOPS, 130TFlops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Data is everywhere, never be at a single location. Not scalable, not
maintainable."-Alex SzalayWhile Galileo played life and death doctrinal games
over the mysteries revealed by the telescope, another revolution went
unnoticed, the microscope gave up mystery after mystery and nobody yet
understood how subversive would be what it revealed. For the first time these
new tools of perceptual augmentation allowed humans to peek behind the veil of
appearance. A new new eye driving human invention and discovery for hundreds
of years.Data is anothermaterialthat hides, revealing itself only when we look
at different scales and investigate its underlying patterns. If the universe
is trulymade of information, then we are looking into truly primal stuff. A
new eye is needed for Data and an ambitious project calledData-scopeaims to be
the lens.A detailedpaperon the Data-Scope tells more about what it is:The

volumes of data fr</p><p>same-blog 4 0.97430193 <a title="274-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-12-YouTube_Architecture.html">274 high scalability-2008-03-12-YouTube Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: YouTube Reaches One Billion Views Per Day.That's at least 11,574
views per second, 694,444 views per minute, and 41,666,667 views per
hour.Update:YouTube: The Platform. YouTube adds a new rich set of APIs in
order to become your video platform leader--all for free. Upload, edit, watch,
search, and comment on video from your own site without visiting YouTube.
Compose your site internally from APIs because you'll need to expose them
later anyway.YouTube grew incredibly fast, to over 100 million video views per
day, with only a handful of people responsible for scaling the site. How did
they manage to deliver all that video to all those users? And how have they
evolved since being acquired by Google?Information SourcesGoogle

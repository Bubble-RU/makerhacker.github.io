<p>Introduction: Comet is an  active distributed key-value store  built at the University of Washington. The paper describing Comet is  Comet: An active distributed key-value store , there are also  slides , and a  MP3  of a presentation given at  OSDI '10 . Here's a succinct  overview of Comet :
  

Today's cloud storage services, such as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes, fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their data's behavior inside the storage service.

  
I found this paper quite interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-value store, which turns it into what might called a  key-code</p><p>3 0.13411541 <a title="296-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-12-Technology_behind_mediatemple_grid_service_.html">90 high scalability-2007-09-12-Technology behind mediatemple grid service </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Comet has popularized asynchronous non-blocking HTTP programming, making it practically indistinguishable from reverse Ajax, also known as server push. This JavaWorld article takes a wider view of asynchronous HTTP, explaining its role in developing high-performance HTTP proxies and non-blocking HTTP clients, as well as the long-lived HTTP connections associated with Comet.</p><p>5 0.105571 <a title="296-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Letting_Clients_Know_What%27s_Changed%3A_Push_Me_or_Pull_Me%3F.html">205 high scalability-2008-01-10-Letting Clients Know What's Changed: Push Me or Pull Me?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a false belief I thought I came here to stay We're all just visiting All just breaking like waves The oceans made me, but who came up with me? Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out .     So true Perl Jam   (Push me Pull me lyrics)  , so true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes. Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.       To pull events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server. This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has changed and makes those changes available to you.  Knowing what has changed can be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state on what I client still needs to see.     Polling is heavy man.</p><p>6 0.10175665 <a title="296-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-24-Sponsored_Post%3A_deviantART%2C_Okta%2C_EzRez%2C_Cloud_Sigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">887 high scalability-2010-08-24-Sponsored Post: deviantART, Okta, EzRez, Cloud Sigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It seems that HTTP calls have become a default way to think about distributed systems. HTTP and Web services definitely have a lot to offer, but they are not the only way to do things and there are definitely cases where web is not the right choice.  Unfortunately, lots of people just stick with web services and hack on, trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. In cases such as these, a different distribution paradigm can save us quite a lot of time and effort both in development and later in maintenance. One of those different paradigms is messaging.</p><p>3 0.69836122 <a title="296-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-Scalable_virus_scanning_for_web-applications.html">328 high scalability-2008-05-27-Scalable virus scanning for web-applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     We're looking for a highly scalable way of scanning documents being uploaded and downloaded from our web application. I believe services like gmail and hotmail are using bespoke solutions from companies like Trend, but are there some quality "off the shelf" products out there that can easily be scaled out and have a "loose" API (HTTP based) for application integration?

<p>Introduction: Simone Brunozzi, technology evangelist for Amazon Web Services in Europe, describes how Soocial.com was fully ported to Amazon web services.         ----------------   This period of the year I decided to dedicate some time to better understand how our customers use AWS, therefore I spent some online time with Stefan Fountain and the nice guys at Soocial.com, a "one address book solution to contact management", and I would like to share with you some details of their IT infrastructure, which now runs 100% on Amazon Web Services!    In the last few months, they've been working hard to cope with tens of thousands of users and to get ready to easily scale to millions. To make this possible, they decided to move ALL their architecture to Amazon Web Services. Despite the fact that they were quite happy with their previous hosting provider, Amazon proved to be the way to go.    -----------------           Read the rest of the article here .</p><p>5 0.6480661 <a title="296-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-28-How_to_Get_DNS_Names_of_a_Web_Server.html">290 high scalability-2008-03-28-How to Get DNS Names of a Web Server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server, e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.     The problem is that I'm still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my qu</p><p>6 0.64614344 <a title="296-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-10-The_technology_behind_Tornado%2C_FriendFeed%27s_web_server.html">700 high scalability-2009-09-10-The technology behind Tornado, FriendFeed's web server</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Edward Capriolo has a really interesting article on his dramatic performance expanding experience of   turning on compression for Cassandra   .   The idea: 
  
  Enabling compression shrunk 71GB of data down to  31GB, which caused more data to fit in RAM, which reduced disk IO to nearly nothing.  
  Compression means more data can be stored, which is like buying more machines without having to spend more money.  
  Compression means serving more data out of RAM, which means clients are happier because of the performance improvements.  
  The cost is higher CPU usage to perform the encrypt/decrypt. But disk IO is orders of magnitude slower than decompression and most servers have CPU to burn.  
  
 Edward's article is well written, has the specifics on how to turn on compression for Cassandra, pretty graphs, and lots more details.</p><p>4 0.73615718 <a title="296-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-12-Technology_behind_mediatemple_grid_service_.html">90 high scalability-2007-09-12-Technology behind mediatemple grid service </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle , infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made a  really interesting statement  about the economics of scale in the datacenter:
  

Weâ&euro;&trade;ve shown that when you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.

  
My first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>6 0.7273131 <a title="296-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-26-Sponsored_Post%3A_BetterWorks%2C_New_Relic%2C_eHarmony%2C_TripAdvisor%2C_NoSQL_Now%21%2C_Surge%2C_Tungsten%2C_Aconex%2C_Mathworks%2C_AppDynamics%2C__ScaleOut%2C_Couchbase%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1086 high scalability-2011-07-26-Sponsored Post: BetterWorks, New Relic, eHarmony, TripAdvisor, NoSQL Now!, Surge, Tungsten, Aconex, Mathworks, AppDynamics,  ScaleOut, Couchbase, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

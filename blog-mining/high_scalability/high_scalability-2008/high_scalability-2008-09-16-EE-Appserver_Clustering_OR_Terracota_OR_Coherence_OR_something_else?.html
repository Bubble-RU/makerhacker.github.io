challenges that developers face today when deploying their existing JEE

Java VMs. It provides up to a terabyte of virtual heap for Java applications
that spans hundreds of connected JVMs.NAM is best suited for storing what they
call scratch data. Scratch data is defined as object oriented data that is
critical to the execution of a series of Java operations inside the JVM, but
may not be critical once a business transaction is complete.The Terracotta

<p>Introduction: Let me begin by saying that I have used and continue to use various ORM
frameworks such as hibernate, ibatis, propel and activerecord in applications
and websites that have a user base ranging from a couple hundred to 500k
users. Especially for projects that have to be up and running in a short
duration of time, ORM frameworks significantly reduce the effort required to
manipulate and persist OOP objects by providing time saving facilities such as
automatically generated model objects, integrated unit testing, secure
variable substitution, etc. Hibernate even supports horizontal data
partitioning via Hibernate Shards.However, the lay of the land is
significantly different in the rarefied space occupied by applications needing
to support millions of users. Profiling an application at this level and
paying particular attention to the operations needed to move data to and from
the database, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the operations
are API related, whereby the ORM fr</p><p>3 0.72970217 <a title="384-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-03-Java_World_Interview_on_Scalability_and_Other_Java_Scalability_Secrets.html">459 high scalability-2008-12-03-Java World Interview on Scalability and Other Java Scalability Secrets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK, thisinterview is with meon Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger
idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java
World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them
:-)The interview went an interesting direction, but there's more I'd like add
and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have
popped out at me:Java - It's the platform stupid. Java the language isn't the
big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM,
libraries, and toolsets.Java - It's the community stupid. A lot of creativity
is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability
challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing
Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.The fecundity of
the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our
multi-core future. There's a multi-core crisis going in case you haven't
heard. It's all you'll</p><p>4 0.71007848 <a title="384-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-19-Space_Based_Programming_in_.NET.html">709 high scalability-2009-09-19-Space Based Programming in .NET</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Space-based architectures are an alternative to the traditional n-tier model
for enterprise applications. Instead of a vertical tier partitioning, space
based applications are partitioned horizontally into self-sufficient units.
This leads to almost linear scalability of stateful, high-performance
applications.This is arecording of a talk I did last monthwhere I introduce
space based programming and demonstrate how that works in practice on the .NET
platform using Oracle Coherence and GigaSpaces.</p><p>5 0.70407045 <a title="384-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-11-Using_Node.js_PayPal_Doubles_RPS%2C_Lowers_Latency%2C_with_Fewer_Developers%2C_but_Where_Do_the_Improvements_Really_Come_From%3F.html">1563 high scalability-2013-12-11-Using Node.js PayPal Doubles RPS, Lowers Latency, with Fewer Developers, but Where Do the Improvements Really Come From?</a></p>

Disappointing, I know, but fear not, I will be posting some oldies for your

<p>Introduction: I found the discussion of the available bandwidth of tree vs higher
dimensional virtual networks topologies quite, to quote Spock,fascinating:A
mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developersof
Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that
theGnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,
theNapster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network
isseverely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a
millionpeers. In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have
overlooked theintrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the
Gnutella network:a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the
definition).Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher
dimensionaltopologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of
interconnectiontopologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware
implementations(see, e.g., Culler et al. 1996; Buyya 1999</p><p>5 0.87112665 <a title="384-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-29-Paper%3A_Spamalytics%3A_An_Empirical_Analysisof_Spam_Marketing_Conversion.html">478 high scalability-2008-12-29-Paper: Spamalytics: An Empirical Analysisof Spam Marketing Conversion</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy thatthe best method to analyse spam is to become a
spammer, this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely
researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part
Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that
their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they
figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales
they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.Two different spam campaigns were
run on aStormbotnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-
peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide
computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit
new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to
download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the
executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon. The
downloaded compone</p><p>6 0.84193701 <a title="384-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-05-5_Ways_to_Make_Cloud_Failure_Not_an_Option.html">1367 high scalability-2012-12-05-5 Ways to Make Cloud Failure Not an Option</a></p>

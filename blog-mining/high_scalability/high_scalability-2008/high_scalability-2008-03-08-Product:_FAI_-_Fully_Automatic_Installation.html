<p>Introduction: From their website:SystemImageris software that makes the installation of
Linux to masses of similar machines relatively easy. It makes software
distribution, configuration, and operating system updates easy, and can also
be used for content distribution.SystemImager makes it easy to do automated
installs (clones), software distribution, content or data distribution,
configuration changes, and operating system updates to your network of Linux
machines. You can even update from one Linux release version to
another!breakIt can also be used to ensure safe production deployments. By
saving your current production image before updating to your new production
image, you have a highly reliable contingency mechanism. If the new production
enviroment is found to be flawed, simply roll-back to the last production
image with a simple update command!Some typical environments include: Internet

<p>Introduction: MySQL™ database, an open source database, delivers high performance and
reliability while keeping costs low by eliminating licensing fees. The
Solaris™ Cluster product is an integrated hardware and software environment
that can be used to create highly-available data services. This article
explains how to deploy the MySQL database in a Solaris Cluster environment.
The article addresses the following topics:* "Advantages of Deploying MySQL
Database with Solaris Cluster" on page 1 discusses the benefits provided by a
Solaris Cluster deployment of the MySQL database.* "Overview of Solaris
Cluster" on page 2 provides a high-level description of the hardware and
software components of the Solaris Cluster.* "Installation and Configuration"
on page 8 explains the procedure for deploying the MySQL database on a Solaris
Cluster.This article assumes that readers have a basic understanding of
Solaris Cluster and MySQL database installation and administration.</p><p>4 0.10951215 <a title="272-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-11-Facebook%2C_Hadoop%2C_and_Hive.html">596 high scalability-2009-05-11-Facebook, Hadoop, and Hive</a></p>

interesting discussion of Sprinkle's creation story by the creator himself,

two categories:Task Based- the tool issues a list of commands to run on the
remote system, either remotely via a network connection or smart
client.Policy/state Based- the tool determines what needs to be run on the
remote system by examining its current and final state.Sprinkle combines both
models together in a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter approach using normal Ruby
code as the DSL (domain specific language) to declaratively describe remote
system configurations. 37 Signals likes the use of Ruby as the DSL because it
makes learning a separate syntax unnecessary. I've successfully done similar

<p>Introduction: Lustre速is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system. It
is designed, developed and maintained by Cluster File Systems, Inc.The central
goal is the development of a next-generation cluster file system which can
serve clusters with 10,000's of nodes, provide petabytes of storage, and move
100's of GB/sec with state-of-the-art security and management
infrastructure.Lustre runs on many of the largest Linux clusters in the world,
and is included by CFS's partners as a core component of their cluster
offering (examples include HP StorageWorks SFS, and the Cray XT3 and XD1
supercomputers). Today's users have also demonstrated that Lustre scales down
as well as it scales up, and runs in production on clusters as small as 4 and
as large as 25,000 nodes.The latest version of Lustre is always available from
Cluster File Systems, Inc. Public Open Source releases of Lustre are available
under the GNU General Public License. These releases are found here, and are
used in produ</p><p>4 0.6155771 <a title="272-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-16-Product%3A_Func_-_Fedora_Unified_Network_Controller.html">385 high scalability-2008-09-16-Product: Func - Fedora Unified Network Controller</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print

<p>Introduction: From their website:FAIis an automated installation tool to install or deploy
Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a
Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat,
autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used
for configuration management of a running system.You can take one or more
virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction
necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your
computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized
management system for your Linux deployment.breakFAI's target group are system
administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of
computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general
purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a
rendering farm, a web server</p><p>3 0.78823054 <a title="272-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-13-un-article%3A_the_setup_behind_microsoft.com.html">186 high scalability-2007-12-13-un-article: the setup behind microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On the blogs.technet.com article on microsoft.com's infrastructure:The article
reads like a blatant ad for it's own products, and is light on the technical
side.The juicy bits are here, so you know what the fuss is about:Cytrix
Netscaler (= loadbalancer with various optimizations)W2K8 + IIS7 and antivirus
software on the webservers650GB/day ISS log files8-9GBit/s (unknown if CDN's
are included)Simple network filtering: stateless access lists blocking
unwanted ports on the routers/switches (hence the debated "no firewalls"
claim).Note that this information may not reflect present reality very well;
the spokesman appears to be reciting others words.</p><p>4 0.7262646 <a title="272-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-10-Paper%3A_Paxos_Made_Moderately_Complex.html">1243 high scalability-2012-05-10-Paper: Paxos Made Moderately Complex</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are a normal human being and find thePaxos protocolconfusing, then this
paper, Paxos Made Moderately Complex, is a great find. Robbert van Renesse
from Cornell University has written a clear and well written paper with
excellent explanations.The Abstract:For anybody who has ever tried to
implement it, Paxos is by no means a simple protocol, even though it is based
on relatively simple invariants. This paper provides imperative pseudo-code
for the full Paxos (or Multi-Paxos) protocol without shying away from
discussing various implementation details. The initial description avoids
optimizations that complicate comprehension. Next we discuss liveness, and
list various optimizations that make the protocol practical.Related

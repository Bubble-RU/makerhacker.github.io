<p>Introduction: Update:   New Gearman Server & Library in C, MySQL UDFs .   Gearman  is an open source  message queuing  system that makes it easy to do distributed job processing using multiple languages.  With Gearman you:  farm out work to other machines, dispatching function calls to machines that are better suited to do work, to do work in parallel, to load balance lots of function calls, to call functions between languages, spread CPU usage around your network .   Gearman is used by companies like LiveJournal, Yahoo!, and Digg. Digg, for example, runs 300,000 jobs a day through Gearman without any issues. Most large sites use something similar. Why would anyone ever even need a message queuing system?
   
 Message queuing is a handy way to move work off your web servers (like image manipulation),  to generate thousands of documents in the background, to run the multiple requests in parallel needed to build a web page, or to perform tasks that can comfortably be run in the background and not part</p><p>3 0.20659164 <a title="406-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Letting_Clients_Know_What%27s_Changed%3A_Push_Me_or_Pull_Me%3F.html">205 high scalability-2008-01-10-Letting Clients Know What's Changed: Push Me or Pull Me?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a false belief I thought I came here to stay We're all just visiting All just breaking like waves The oceans made me, but who came up with me? Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out .     So true Perl Jam   (Push me Pull me lyrics)  , so true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes. Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.       To pull events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server. This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has changed and makes those changes available to you.  Knowing what has changed can be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state on what I client still needs to see.     Polling is heavy man.</p><p>4 0.20581624 <a title="406-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-06-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Aggregation_Collection.html">1418 high scalability-2013-03-06-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Aggregation Collection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What good are problems without solutions? In  42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase  we talked about problems. In this first post (OK, there was an earlier post, but I'm doing some reorganizing), we'll cover what I call  aggregation  strategies.
 
Keep in mind these are low level architecture type suggestions of how to structure the components of your code and how they interact. We're not talking about massive scale-out clusters here, but of what your applications might like like internally, way below the service level interface level. There's a lot more to the world than evented architectures.
 
Aggregation simply means we aren't using stupid queues. Our queues will be smart. We are deeply aware of queues as containers of work that eventually dictate how the entire system performs. As work containers we know intimately what requests and data sit in our queues and we can use that intelligence to our great advantage.
  Prioritize Work  
The key idea to it all is an almost mi</p><p>5 0.20090646 <a title="406-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-18-Beyond_Threads_and_Callbacks_-_Application_Architecture_Pros_and_Cons.html">1425 high scalability-2013-03-18-Beyond Threads and Callbacks - Application Architecture Pros and Cons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.
 
But that's not all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be composed across threads of control.
 
Your favorite language may not give you access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially for controlling  latency variance , so I think it's time to talk about these kind of issues. When it was do everything in the thread of a web server thread pool none of these issues really mattered.

<p>Introduction: It's a little known fact that Santa Clause was an early queue innovator. Faced with the problem of delivering a planet full of presents in one night, Santa, in his hacker's workshop, created a Present Distribution System using thousands of region based priority present queues for continuous delivery by the Rudolphs. Rudolphs? You didn't think there was only one Rudolph did you? Presents are delivered in parallel by a cluster of sleighs, each with redundant reindeer in a master-master configuration. Each Rudolph is a cluster leader and they coordinate work using an early and more magical version of the ZooKeeper protocol.
 
Programmers have followed Santa's lead and you can find a  message queue  in nearly every major architecture profile on  HighScalability . Historically they may have been introduced after a first generation architecture needed to scale up from their two tier system into something a little more capable (asynchronicity, work dispatch, load buffering, database offloadin</p><p>4 0.83938855 <a title="406-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-11-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Conditioning_Collection.html">1421 high scalability-2013-03-11-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Conditioning Collection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We talked about  42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase . And in  The Aggregation Collection  we talked about the value of prioritizing work and making smart queues as a way of absorbing and not reflecting traffic spikes.
 
Now we move on to our next batch of strategies where the theme is  conditioning , which is the idea of shaping and controlling flows of work within your application...
  Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed Limit  
This is probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an application. What it means:
  
 Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion. 
 Devise ways of tying what you need to do to the individual resources. 
  
Some examples:
  
 Keep a list of purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep</p><p>5 0.83043939 <a title="406-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-25-AppBackplane_-_A_Framework_for_Supporting_Multiple_Application_Architectures.html">1429 high scalability-2013-03-25-AppBackplane - A Framework for Supporting Multiple Application Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hidden in every computer is a hardware backplane for moving signals around. Hidden in every application are ways of moving messages around and giving code CPU time to process them. Unhiding those capabilities and making them first class facilities for the programmer to control is the idea behind AppBackplane.
 
This goes directly against the trend of hiding everything from the programmer and doing it all automagically. Which is great, until it doesn't work. Then it sucks. And the approach of giving the programmer all the power also sucks, until it's tuned to work together and performance is incredible even under increasing loads. Then it's great.

<p>Introduction: Update 3: InfoQ's  Big Architecture Up Front - A Case of Premature Scalaculation?  twines several different threads on the topic together into a fine noose.     Update 2: Kevin says the  biggest problems he sees with startups is they need to scale  their backend (no, the other one).     Update: My bad.  It's hard to sell scalability  so just forget it.       The premise of   Startups and The Problem Of Premature Scalaculation   and   Donâ&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Mart   is that you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?     If I ever believed this I certainly don't believe it anymore.

<p>Introduction: This strategy is stated perfectly by Flickr's Myles Grant:   The Flickr engineering team is obsessed with making pages load as quickly as possible. To that end, weâ&euro;&trade;re refactoring large amounts of our code to do only the essential work up front, and rely on our queuing system to do the rest.   Flickr uses a queuing system to process 11 million tasks a day. Leslie Michael Orchard also does a great job explaining the queuing meme in his excellent post   Queue everything and delight everyone  . Asynchronous work queues are how you scalably solve problems that are too big to handle in real-time.     The process:     Identify the minimum feedback the client (UI, API) needs to know an operation succeeded . It's enough, for example, to update a client's view when a posting a message to a microblogging service. The client probably isn't aware of all the other steps that happen when a message is added and doesn't really care when they happen as long as the obvious cases happen in an appropariate</p><p>3 0.97050273 <a title="406-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution_of_queries_per_second.html">622 high scalability-2009-06-08-Distribution of queries per second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We need to measure the number of queries-per-second our site gets for capacity planning purposes.  Obviously, we need to provision the site based on the peak QPS, not average QPS. There will always be some spikes in traffic, though, where for one particular second we get a really huge number of queries. It's ok if site performance slightly degrades during that time. So what I'd really like to do is estimate the *near* peak QPS based on average or median QPS. Near peak might be defined as the QPS that I get at the 95th percentile of the busiest seconds during the day.  My guess is that this is similar to what ISPs do when they measure your bandwidth usage and then charge for usage over the 95th percentile.  What we've done is analyzed our logs, counted the queries executed during each second during the day, sorted from the busiest seconds to the least busy ones, and graphed it. What you get is a histogram that  steeply declines and flattens out near zero.

<p>Introduction: We've referenced this  189 slide masterpiece  by Ask Bjorn Hansen before, but it was hidden without its own first class link. He describes his presentation as 3 hours of 5 minute lightening talks and that sounds about right.   The presentation covers:  overall platform and architecture considerations involved in tuning applications from a holistic perspective. Youâ&euro;&trade;ll be shown design scalable architectures for dynamic, high-volume web sites. Topics covered include caching, scalable database design, replication architecture, load-balancing, and architectural decisions derived from many years of experience.    His prime directive of scaling:  Think Horizontally  at every point in your architecture, not just at the web tier.   You may not agree with everything, but there's a lot of useful advice. Here's a summary of some of what is covered:

<p>Introduction: Hi everyone, I'm researching on Scalability for a college paper, and found this site great, but it has too many tips, articles and the like, but I can't see a hierarchical organization of subjects, I would need something like a checklist of things or fields, or technologies to take into account when assesing scalability.     So far I've identified these:     - Hardware scalability:    - scale out    - scale up     - Cache    What types of cache are there? app-level, os-level, network-level, I/O-level?   - Load Balancing   - DB Clustering     Am I missing something important? (I'm sure I am)   I don't expect you to give a lecture here, but maybe point some things out, give me some useful links...   Thanks!</p><p>6 0.95863789 <a title="406-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-17-Scaling_Django_Web_Apps_by_Mike_Malone.html">602 high scalability-2009-05-17-Scaling Django Web Apps by Mike Malone</a></p>

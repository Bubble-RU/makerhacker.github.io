<p>Introduction: on Wiki someone posted"...For relatively small installations, pub/sub provides
the opportunity for better scalability than traditional client-server, through
parallel operation, message caching, tree-based or network-based routing,
etc.However, as systems scale up to become datacenters with thousands of
servers sharing the pub/sub infrastructure, this benefit is often lost; in
fact, scalability for pub/sub products under high load in large deployments is
very much a research challenge."Does anyone have something to say regarding
scaling Publish/subscribe models?</p><p>4 0.13379721 <a title="455-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL_clustering_strategies_and_comparisions.html">196 high scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL clustering strategies and comparisions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: WordPress.com hosts 300 servers in 5 different data centers. It's always
useful to learn how large installations manage all their unruly
children:Currently we Nagios for server health monitoring, Munin for graphing
various server metrics, and a wiki to keep track of all the server hardware
specs, IPs, vendor IDs, etc. All of these tools have suited us well up until
now, but there have been some scaling issues.The post covers how these
different tools are working for them and the comment section has some
interesting discussions too.</p><p>6 0.097933032 <a title="455-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-29-Event%3A_MySQL_Conference_%26_Expo_2009.html">504 high scalability-2009-01-29-Event: MySQL Conference & Expo 2009</a></p>

<p>Introduction: MySQL™ database, an open source database, delivers high performance and
reliability while keeping costs low by eliminating licensing fees. The
Solaris™ Cluster product is an integrated hardware and software environment
that can be used to create highly-available data services. This article
explains how to deploy the MySQL database in a Solaris Cluster environment.
The article addresses the following topics:* "Advantages of Deploying MySQL
Database with Solaris Cluster" on page 1 discusses the benefits provided by a
Solaris Cluster deployment of the MySQL database.* "Overview of Solaris
Cluster" on page 2 provides a high-level description of the hardware and
software components of the Solaris Cluster.* "Installation and Configuration"
on page 8 explains the procedure for deploying the MySQL database on a Solaris
Cluster.This article assumes that readers have a basic understanding of
Solaris Cluster and MySQL database installation and administration.</p><p>6 0.805399 <a title="455-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-29-Event%3A_MySQL_Conference_%26_Expo_2009.html">504 high scalability-2009-01-29-Event: MySQL Conference & Expo 2009</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites tocache everything? Caching, if
not thesecret sauceof many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But
not so fast says Peter Zaitsev inBeyond great cache hit ratio. The point Peter
makes is that we read about websites likeAmazonandFacebook that can literally
make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome
cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all
those requests takes time. The solution is toremove requests all together. You
do this bycaching larger blocksso you have to make fewer requests. The post
has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small
as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control
invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>3 0.99926716 <a title="455-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers
podcastShow 15 - Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls. The
conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can
be processed by a WAF (Web Application Firewall), which inspects HTTP for
security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much
was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be
necessary, but I digress.Toterminate SSLmost shops run SSL connections into
Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for
developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of
the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.Load
balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very
efficiently in hardware. Efficiently enough that if you are willing to get rid
of the general purpose Linux boxes and use your big iron load balancers, your
server count can be decreased</p><p>4 0.99897408 <a title="455-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-30-More_Troubles_with_Caching.html">911 high scalability-2010-09-30-More Troubles with Caching</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a tasty pairing withFacebook And Site Failures Caused By Complex, Weakly
Interacting, Layered Systems, is another excellent tale of caching gone wrong
by Peter Zaitsev, in an exciting twin billing:Cache Miss Stormand More on
dangers of the caches. This is fascinating case where the cause turned out to
be software upgrade that ran long because it had to be rolled back. During the
long recovery time many of the cache entries timed out. When the database came
back, slam, all the clients queried the database to repopulate the cache and
bad things happened to the database. The solution was equally interesting: So
the immediate solution to bring the system up was surprisingly simple. We just
had to get traffic on the system in stages allowing Memcache to be warmed up.
There were no code which would allow to do it on application side so we did it
on MySQL side instead. "SET GLOBAL max_connections=20" to limit number of
connections to MySQL and so let application to err when it tries to put</p><p>5 0.99860269 <a title="455-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy%3A_How_to_Manage_Sessions_Using_Memcached.html">436 high scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy: How to Manage Sessions Using Memcached</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>6 0.99751413 <a title="455-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-03-Running_Hadoop_MapReduce_on_Amazon_EC2_and_Amazon_S3.html">56 high scalability-2007-08-03-Running Hadoop MapReduce on Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Reducing the costs of IT infrastructure and improving the manageability and
efficiency of web services pose significant challenges for many organizations
in today's economic climate. Recent studies describe the challenges IT
managers face administering the proliferation of x86-based servers used to run
web services applications. Those reports reveal that using large number of
x86-based systems can increase space and power consumption, as well as cost
and asset management overhead. In addition, many of these x86-based systems
run a mixture of operating system and application software leading to
increased management complexity and potential security concerns.Faced with
these challenges, many organizations are attracted by the idea of
consolidating web and application services from multiple x86-based servers to
a smaller number of high-performance servers. This approach strives to help
simplify management, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of
delivering web services.

<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage
of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with
CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable
solution that</p><p>2 0.76251179 <a title="456-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-25-Not_All_Regions_are_Created_Equal_-_South_America_Es_Bueno.html">1347 high scalability-2012-10-25-Not All Regions are Created Equal - South America Es Bueno</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rodrigo Camposshared some interesting benchmark resultsfor AWS instances in
the South America Region (Sao Paulo) and US East Region (North Virginia). He
summarized the results in this thread on theGuerrilla Capacity
Planninglist:The same instance type shows a different behavior depending on
the region that it is running, this is particularly critical if you depend on
multiple regions for disaster recovery or geographical load balancingGenerally
speaking performance is better and more consistent in the South America region
when compared to Virginia, this is probably due to the fact that SA region was
the latest to be deployed. Maybe the SA datacenter uses new server models or
it is just underutilized, but this is a wild guessWrite performance for the
medium instance type in Virginia abruptly decays, dropping from almost 400
call/s to something around 300 calls/s, this is not very clear in the scatter
plot but if you draw a time-based chart you can clearly see this pattern. This

<p>Introduction: By George Palmer of 3dogsbark.com. Covers:* How you start out: shared hosting,
web server DB on same machine. Move two 2 machines. Minimal code changes.*
Scaling the database. Add read slaves on their own machines. Then master-
master setup. Still minimal code changes.* Scaling the web server. Load
balance against multiple application servers. Application servers scale but
the database doesn't.* User clusters. Partition and allocate users to their
own dedicated cluster. Requires substantial code changes.* Caching. A large
percentage of hits are read only. Use reverse proxy, memcached, and language
specific cache.* Elastic architectures. Based on Amazon EC2. Start and stop
instances on demand. For global applications keep a cache on each continent,
assign users to clusters by location, maintain app servers on each continent,
use transaction replication software if you must replicate your site globally.</p><p>4 0.71542299 <a title="456-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-21-Product%3A_Capistrano_-_Automate_Remote_Tasks_Via_SSH.html">255 high scalability-2008-02-21-Product: Capistrano - Automate Remote Tasks Via SSH</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Deployment with Capistrano  by Charles Max Wood.  Nice simple step-by-
step for using Capistrano for deployment.From their website:Simply
put,Capistranois a tool for automating tasks on one or more remote servers. It
executes commands in parallel on all targeted machines, and provides a
mechanism for rolling back changes across multiple machines. It is ideal for
anyone doing any kind of system administration, either professionally or
incidentally.* Great for automating tasks via SSH on remote servers, like
software installation, application deployment, configuration management, ad
hoc server monitoring, and more.* Ideal for system administrators, whether
professional or incidental.* Easy to customize. Its configuration files use
the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know Ruby to do
most things with Capistrano.* Easy to extend. Capistrano is written in the
Ruby programming language, and may be extended easily by writing additional
Ruby modules.breakOne of t</p><p>5 0.67282677 <a title="456-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-04-New_Book%3A_Even_Faster_Web_Sites%3A_Performance_Best_Practices_for_Web_Developers.html">617 high scalability-2009-06-04-New Book: Even Faster Web Sites: Performance Best Practices for Web Developers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Performance is critical to the success of any web site, and yet today's web
applications push browsers to their limits with increasing amounts of rich
content and heavy use of Ajax. In his new bookEven Faster Web Sites:
Performance Best Practices for Web Developers, Steve Souders, web performance
evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable
techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.Souders' previous
book, the bestsellingHigh Performance Web Sites, shocked the web development
world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on
the client side. In Even Faster Web Sites, Souders and eight expert
contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your
site's performance in three critical categories:JavaScript- Get advice for
understanding Ajax performance, writing efficient JavaScript, creating
responsive applications, loading scripts without blocking other components,
and more.Network- Learn to shar</p><p>6 0.6721341 <a title="456-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-11-Facebook%2C_Hadoop%2C_and_Hive.html">596 high scalability-2009-05-11-Facebook, Hadoop, and Hive</a></p>

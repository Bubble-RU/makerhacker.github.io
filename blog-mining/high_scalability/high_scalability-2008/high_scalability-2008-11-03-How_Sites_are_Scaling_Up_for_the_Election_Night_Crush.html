<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300 thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?

<p>Introduction: Hi,     We are running a backup solution that uploads every night the files our clients worked on during the day (Cabonite-like).   We have currently about 10GB of data per night, via http PUT requests (1 per file), and the files are written as-is on a NAS.   Our architecture is basically compound of a load balancer (hardware, sticky sessions), 5 servers (Tomcat under RHEL4/5, ) and a NAS (nfs 3).     Since our number of clients is rising, (as is our system load) how would you recommend we could scale our infrastructure? hardware and software? Should we go towards NAS sharding, more servers, NIO on tomcat...?       Thanks for your inputs!</p><p>5 0.073212929 <a title="437-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-04-A_Bunch_of_Great_Strategies_for_Using_Memcached_and_MySQL_Better_Together.html">360 high scalability-2008-08-04-A Bunch of Great Strategies for Using Memcached and MySQL Better Together</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case. Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on Fotolog in  Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success , which was one of my personal favorites.  Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding performance and scaling requirements.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture for  Poppen.de , a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new, using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached, RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.
  What is Poppen.de?  
Poppen.de (NSFW) is the top dating website in  Germany, and while it may be a small site compared to giants like Flickr  or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to learn from if you  are starting to get some scaling problems.
  The  Stats   
 2.000.000 users 
 20.000  concurrent users 
 300.000 private messages per day 
 250.000  logins per day 
 We have a team  of  eleven developers, two designers and two sysadmins for this project. 
   Business Model  
The site works with a  freemium model, where users can do for free things like:

<p>Introduction: Several months ago I attended a Joyent presentation where the spokesman hinted that Joyent had the chops to support a one billion page per month Facebook Ruby on Rails application. Even under a few seconds of merciless grilling he would not give up the name of the application. Now we have the big reveal: it was LinkedIn's  Bumper Sticker  app. For those not currently sticking things on bumps, Bumper Sticker is quite surprisingly a  viral media sharing application that allows users to express their individuality by sticking small virtual stickers on Facebook profiles . At the time I was quite curious how Joyent's cloud approach could be leveraged for this kind of app. Now that they've released a few details, we get to find out.

<p>Introduction: Advertising for the Super Bowl is bigger than the game for many viewers. So you gotta figure advertisers are ready for the traffic bursts generated by their expensive ads? Not exactly...
 
Yottaa  reports an amazing 13 advertiser websites crashed  during the Super Bowl. Coke was interactively au currant, asking viewers to vote for the ending of a commercial, but load times went to 62 seconds. SodaStream, Calvin Klein, Axe, Got Milk? The Walking Dead, many movie sites, and many car sites, all were flagged with delay of fame penalties.
 
Lots of time, money, and creative energy is spent lovingly perfecting every detail of these commercials. It won't be a surprise to any programmer that this can't usually be said of the follow through on the backend.
 
So what can you do? Yottaa has some good tips and Michael Hamrah has a wonderful post on dealing with the Super Bowl Burst Problem:

<p>Introduction: Election night is a big traffic boost for news and social sites. Yahoo expects up to 400 million page views on Election Day. Data Center Knowledge has an  excellent article how various sites  are preparing to handle spikes in election night traffic. Some interesting bits:
   Prepare ahead . Don't wait to handle spikes, plan and prepare before the blessed event.    Use a CDN . Daily Kos puts images on a CDN, but the dynamic nature of their site means the can't use CDN for their other content.    Scale up . Daily Kos "to handle the traffic better, we moved to a cluster of six quad core Xeons with 8GB RAM for webheads that all boot off a central NFS (Network File System) root, with the capability of adding more webheads as needed,” . They also "added two 16GB eight-core Xeons and a 6×73GB RAID-10 array for database files running a MySQL master/slave setup."    Add Cache . Daily Kos added 1GB instances memcached to each webhead.    Change Caching Strategy .

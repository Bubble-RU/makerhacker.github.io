<p>Introduction: CDNs ( content delivery networks ) are the secret shadow super powers behind the web and Dan Rayburn at   streamingmedia.com    is the go to investigative reporter for quality information on CDNs. Every year Dan has a Content Delivery Summit on all things CDN and those videos are    now available   . Dan also gives a kind of    state of the industry talk    where he does something wonderful, he gives real numbers and prices. Dan really knows his stuff and is an excellent speaker, so watch the video, but here’s my gloss on the state of the CDN so far this year: 
  
  Massive growth . Large customers are expecting 126% growth in video traffic over last year; medium size customers are seeing 48% traffic growth, small sized customer are seeing 73.3% traffic growth. 
   More traffic != More profit   . Traffic growth doesn’t lead to more profit because the traffic growth is concentrated in larger customers that can make the best deals.

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100 using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that would otherwise take an eternity to make,  a pile of money to create, and an unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of services. The battle for the future is on.

<p>Introduction: Hi,      We're running a enterprise SaaS solution that currently holds about 700 customers with up to 50.000 users per customer (growing quickly). Our customers have SLA agreements with us that contains guaranteed uptimes, response times and other performance counters. With an increasing number of customers and traffic we find it difficult to provide our customer with actual SLA data. We could set up external probes that monitors certain parts of the application, but this is time consuming with 700 customers (we do it today for our biggest clients). We can also extract data from web logs but they are now approaching about 30-40 GB a day.      What we really need is monitoring software that not only focuses on the internal performance counters but also lets us see the application from the customers viewpoint and allows us to aggregate data in different ways.

<p>Introduction: Remember  when the iPhone launched? Remember the complaints about the device not  maintaining calls well? Was it really the hardware? Or was it the  service provider network, overwhelmed by not just the call volume but  millions of hyper-customers experimenting with their new toy? Look – a  video! Look a video  and a call.  Hey, I’m on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and streaming audio at the same time I’m making a call! How awesome is that?
 
Meanwhile,  there’s an entire army of operators at a service provider’s NOC who are  stalking through the data center with scissors because it’s the only  way to stop the madness.
 
Service providers, probably better  than any other, understand “services”. For longer than the enterprise  has been talking about them, service providers have been implementing  them. They’ve got their own set of standards and reference architectures  and even language to describe them, but in a nutshell that’s what a  service provider does: offers services.

<p>Introduction: Update 7:   Basecamp, now with more vroom . Basecamp application servers running Ruby code were upgraded and virtualization was removed. The result:  A 66 % reduction in the response time while handling multiples of the traffic is beyond what I expected . They still use virtualization (Linux KVM), just less of it now.  Update 6:   Things We’ve Learned at 37Signals . Themes: less is more; don't worry be happy.  Update 5:   Nuts & Bolts: HAproxy  . Nice explanation (post, screencast) by Mark Imbriaco of why HAProxy (load balancing proxy server) is their favorite (fast, efficient, graceful configuration, queues requests when Mongrels are busy) for spreading dynamic content between Apache web servers and Mongrel application servers.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Marcel Panse  and  Sander Nagtegaal  from  Peecho . 
 
Although architecture descriptions are an interesting read, the problems that start-ups face are hardly ever addressed. We would like to change that, so here is our architecture story.
  Introducing a start-up  
 
 
The Amsterdam-based company  Peecho  offers print-as-a-service. Our embeddable  print button  allows you to sell your digital content as professionally printed products, like photo books, magazines or canvases - straight from your own website. There is an API, too.
 
Printcloud is the system that powers the print button. It exists in the cloud only, growing when needed and becoming smaller if it can. The system takes in print orders, magically transforms tough data into print-ready files and routes the orders to the production facility that is closest to the intended recipient.
 
To preserve the environment, Peecho's philosophy is to facilitate global ordering, but to aim for local production on</p><p>6 0.64846152 <a title="241-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-02-Evolution_of_Bazaarvoice%E2%80%99s_Architecture_to_500M_Unique_Users_Per_Month.html">1557 high scalability-2013-12-02-Evolution of Bazaarvoice’s Architecture to 500M Unique Users Per Month</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200 M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the switches.     These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are only available through Sun's factory integration.

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1 copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random server to serve the file as a temp fix...     It's a small video streaming service. I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's psuedo streaming, but it works.     I have been looking at MogileFS, which would solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar). However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth % usage?     Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>4 0.9652704 <a title="241-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-07-Using_ThreadLocal_to_pass_context_information_around_in_web_applications.html">115 high scalability-2007-10-07-Using ThreadLocal to pass context information around in web applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought is   class ReferenceIdGenerator {   public static setReferenceId(String login) {      threadLocal.set(login + System.currentMillis());   }     public static String getReferenceId() {     return threadLocal.get();   }   private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =       new ThreadLocal();       }     class MySevlet {     void service(.....) {       HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);      String userId = session.get("userId");          ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId</p><p>5 0.92296982 <a title="241-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-16-Paper%3A_A_Provably_Correct_Scalable_Concurrent_Skip_List.html">1305 high scalability-2012-08-16-Paper: A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  MemSQL Architecture  we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps eliminate contention and make writes fast. 
 
If this all sounds a little pie-in-the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it clearer:  A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List .
 
From the abstract:
  We propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization, searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms, this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that</p><p>6 0.91336036 <a title="241-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-25-Peter_Norvig%27s_9_Master_Steps_to_Improving_a_Program.html">1601 high scalability-2014-02-25-Peter Norvig's 9 Master Steps to Improving a Program</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for
"CloudAPIportability," which implies a series of misconceptions.If we break
away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud
portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly
simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without
settling on a common CloudAPI.In this post i'll be covering five common
misconceptions people haveWRTto cloud portability.Cloud portability = Cloud
API portability. API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.The
main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in.Cloud
portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-
in.Cloud portability isn't for startups. Every startup that is expecting rapid
growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability
rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared
to do so.Cloud portability = Compromising on t</p><p>5 0.18615246 <a title="355-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-25-How_do_you_explain_cloud_computing_to_your_grandma%3F.html">325 high scalability-2008-05-25-How do you explain cloud computing to your grandma?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a meetup Wednesday onOpenStack,
whose tag line isthe open source, open standards cloud. I was shocked at the
large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of
them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free
t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are
really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud
doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from
Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems
to be. The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:OpenStack allows any organization
to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software
running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically
creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack
Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage using

<p>Introduction: InA Brief History of the Internetit was revealed that the Internet wasbased on
the idea that there would be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary
design. The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying technical
idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In this approach, the
choice of any individual network technology was not dictated by a particular
network architecture but rather could be selected freely by a provider and
made to interwork with the other networks through a meta-level
"Internetworking Architecture".  With the cloud we are in the same situation
today, just a layer or two higher up the stack. We have independent clouds
that we would like to connect and work seamlessly together, preferably with
the ease at which we currently connect nodes to a network and networks to the
Internet. This technology seems to be called theIntercloud: an interconnected
global "cloud ofclouds" as apposed to theInternetwhich is a "network of
networks."Vinton Cerf,p</p><p>6 0.81395936 <a title="355-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-12-The_CIO%E2%80%99s_Problem%3A_Cloud_%E2%80%9CMess%E2%80%9D_or_Cloud_%E2%80%9CMash%E2%80%9D.html">918 high scalability-2010-10-12-The CIO’s Problem: Cloud “Mess” or Cloud “Mash”</a></p>

Eucalyptus: Open Source Cloud Computing.Eucalyptusis generating some
excitement on theCloud Computinggroup as a potential vendor neutral EC2
compatible cloud platform. Two reasons why Eucalyptus is potentially
important: private clouds and cloud portability:breakPrivate clouds. Let's say
you want a cloud like infrastructure for architectural purposes but you want
it to run on your own hardware in your own secure environment. How would you
do this today? Hm....Cloud portability. With the number of cloud offerings
increasing how can you maintain some level of vendor neutrality among this
"swarm" of different options? Portability is a key capability for cloud
customers as the only real power customers have is in where they take their
business and the only way you can change suppliers is if there's a ready

CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control by Mihai Letia, Nuno Preguiรงa,
and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),a
data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent.From the
introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed
consistency issues:Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-
understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large
scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two
approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up
consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach

<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a meetup Wednesday onOpenStack,
whose tag line isthe open source, open standards cloud. I was shocked at the
large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of
them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free
t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are
really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud
doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from
Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems
to be. The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:OpenStack allows any organization
to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software
running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically
creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack
Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage using

<p>Introduction: Hello everybody!I am a developer of a website with a lot of traffic. Right now
we are managing the whole website using perl + postgresql + fastcgi +
memcached + mogileFS + lighttpd + roundrobin DNS distributed over 5 servers
and I must say it works like a charm, load is stable and everything works very
fast and we are recording about 8 million pageviews per day.The only problem
is with postgres database since we have it installed only on one server and if
this server goes down, the whole "cluster" goes down. That's why we have a
master2slave replication so we still have a backup database except that when
the master goes down, all inserts/updates are disabled so the whole website is
just read only.But this is not a problem since this configuration is working
for us and we don't have any problems with it.Right now we are planning to
build our own analytics service that would be customized for our needs. We
tried various different software packages but were not satisfied with any of
them.</p><p>5 0.86573339 <a title="355-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-16-The_VeriScale_Architecture_-_Elasticity_and_efficiency_for_private_clouds.html">706 high scalability-2009-09-16-The VeriScale Architecture - Elasticity and efficiency for private clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model,
which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model,
networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as
services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the
datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed
application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing
sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the
datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to
scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt
easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sun's VeriScale architecture
provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun
Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures
for more than a decade. The features of these architectures, such as
elasticity, ar</p><p>6 0.8657282 <a title="355-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-Profiling_WEB_applications.html">71 high scalability-2007-08-22-Profiling WEB applications</a></p>

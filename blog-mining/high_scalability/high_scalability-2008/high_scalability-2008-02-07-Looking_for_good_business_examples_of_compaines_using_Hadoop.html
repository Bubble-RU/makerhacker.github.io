<p>Introduction: The Google Operating System blog has an   interesting post   on Google's scale based on an updated version of Google's paper about MapReduce.      The input data for some of the MapReduce jobs run in September 2007 was 403,152 TB (terabytes), the average number of machines allocated for a MapReduce job was 394, while the average completion time was 6 minutes and a half. The paper mentions that Google's indexing system processes more than 20 TB of raw data.               Niall Kennedy calculates that the average MapReduce job runs across a $1 million hardware infrastructure, assuming that Google still uses the same cluster configurations from 2004: two 2 GHz Intel Xeon processors with Hyper-Threading enabled, 4 GB of memory, two 160 GB IDE hard drives and a gigabit Ethernet link.       Greg Linden notices that Google's infrastructure is an important competitive advantage. "Anyone at Google can process terabytes of data. And they can get their results back in about 10 minutes, so they ca</p><p>6 0.13245834 <a title="242-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-07-clusteradmin.blogspot.com_-_blog_about_building_and_administering_clusters.html">243 high scalability-2008-02-07-clusteradmin.blogspot.com - blog about building and administering clusters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:   Good Vibrations  by Radovan Semančík. Lot's of interesting questions about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.   Google Wave  is a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new, convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users of  Google Wave  and we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to "federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.

<p>Introduction: In a strange case of synchronicity, Google just published  Instant Previews: Under the hood , a very well written blog post by Matías Pelenur of the Instant Previews team, giving some fascinating inside details on how Google implemented  Instant Previews . It's syncronicty because I had just posted  Strategy: Biggest Performance Impact Is To Reduce The Number Of HTTP Requests  and one of the major ideas behind the design Instant Previews is to reduce the number of HTTP requests through a few well chosen tricks. Cosmic!
 
Some of what Google does to reduce HTTP requests:
  
  Data URIs , which are are base64 encodings of image data, are used instead of static images that are served from the server. This means the whole preview can be pieced together from image slices in one request as both the data and the image are returned in the same request. Google found that  even though base64 encoding adds about 33% to the size of the image, tests showed that gzip-compressed data URIs are compara</p><p>6 0.66566885 <a title="242-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-21-Google%27s_Sanjay_Ghemawat_on_What_Made_Google_Google_and_Great_Big_Data_Career_Advice.html">1535 high scalability-2013-10-21-Google's Sanjay Ghemawat on What Made Google Google and Great Big Data Career Advice</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,     I am an owner of an large community website and currently we are having problems with our database architecture. We are using 2 database servers and spread tables across them to divide read/writes. We have about 90% reads and 10% writes. We use Memcached on all our webservers to cache as much as we can, traffic is load balanced between webservers. We have 2 extra servers ready to put to use!      We have looked into a couple of solution so far:   Continuent Uni/Cluster aka Sequoia -> Commercial version way too expensive and Java isn't as fast as it suppose to be.   MySQL Proxy -> We couldn't find any good example on how to create a master - master with failover scenario.   MySQL Clustering -> Seems to be not mature enough, had a lot of performance issues when we tried to go online with it.    MySQL DRDB HA -> Only good for failover, cannot be scaled!   MySQL Replication -> Well don't get me started ;)     So now I turn to you guys to help me out, I am with my hands in my hair a</p><p>4 0.96142805 <a title="242-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-26-Paper%3A_Scalability_by_Design_-_Coding_for_Systems_With_Large_CPU_Counts.html">502 high scalability-2009-01-26-Paper: Scalability by Design - Coding for Systems With Large CPU Counts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The multi-cores are coming and software designed for fewer cores usually doesn't work on more cores without substantial redesign. For a taste of the issues take a look at  No new global mutexes! (and how to make the thread/connection pool work) , which shows some of the difficulties of making MySQL perform on SMP servers.  In this paper, Richard Smith, a â&euro;&ldquo;Staff Engineer at Sun, goes into some nice detail on multi-core issues. His take home lessons are:
  Use fine-grained locking or lock-free strategy   Document the strategy, including correctness criteria (invariants)   Keep critical sections short   Profile the code at both light and heavy load   Collect HW performance counter data   Identify bottleneck resource (there's always at least one!)   Eliminate or ameliorate it</p><p>5 0.95747364 <a title="242-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-30-Log_Everything_All_the_Time.html">77 high scalability-2007-08-30-Log Everything All the Time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This JoelOnSoftware  thread  asks the age old question of what and how to log. The usual trace/error/warning/info advice is totally useless in a large scale distributed system. Instead, you need to  log everything all the time  so you can solve problems that have already happened across a potentially huge range of servers. Yes, it can be done.  To see why the typical logging approach is broken,  imagine this scenario: Your site has been up and running great for weeks. No problems. A foreshadowing beeper goes off at 2AM. It seems some users can no longer add comments to threads. Then you hear the debugging deathknell: it's an intermittent problem and customers are pissed. Fix it. Now.  So how are you going to debug this? The monitoring system doesn't show any obvious problems or errors. You quickly post a comment and it works fine. This won't be easy. So you think. Commenting involves a bunch of servers and networks. There's the load balancer, spam filter,  web server, database server,</p><p>6 0.95540798 <a title="242-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-20-Sponsored_Post%3A__ezRez%2C_VoltDB_and_Digg_are_Hiring.html">861 high scalability-2010-07-20-Sponsored Post:  ezRez, VoltDB and Digg are Hiring</a></p>

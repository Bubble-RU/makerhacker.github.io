<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>3 0.1668762 <a title="476-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-06-An_Unorthodox_Approach_to_Database_Design_%3A_The_Coming_of_the_Shard.html">672 high scalability-2009-08-06-An Unorthodox Approach to Database Design : The Coming of the Shard</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Why you don’t want to shard.  by Morgon on the MySQL Performance Blog.  Optimize everything else first, and then if performance still isn’t good enough, it’s time to take a very bitter medicine.    Update 3:   Building Scalable Databases: Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemes  by Dare Obasanjo. Excellent discussion of why and when you would choose a sharding architecture, how to shard, and problems with sharding.  Update 2:   Mr. Moore gets to punt on sharding  by Alan Rimm-Kaufman of 37signals. Insightful article on design tradeoffs and the evils of premature optimization. With more memory, more CPU, and new tech like SSD,  problems can be avoided before more exotic architectures like sharding are needed.  Add features not infrastructure.  Jeremy Zawodny  says he's wrong wrong wrong. we're running multi-core CPUs at slower clock speeds. Moore won't save you.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Zardosht Kasheff , Software Developer at  Tokutek , a storage engine company that delivers 21st-Century capabilities to the leading open source data management platforms. 
 
As software developers, we value abstraction. The simpler the API, the more attractive it becomes. Arguably, MongoDB’s greatest strengths are its elegant API and its   agility  , which let developers simply code.
 
But when  MongoDB  runs into scalability problems on  big data , developers need to peek underneath the covers to understand the underlying issues and how to fix them. Without understanding, one may end up with an inefficient solution that costs time and money. For example, one may shard prematurely, increasing hardware and management costs, when a simpler replication setup would do. Or, one may increase the size of a replica set when upgrading to SSDs would suffice.

Just as in a normal single server database setup where you have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all shards.

<p>Introduction: Update :  A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview with  Google engineer Max Ross on Hibernate Shards . Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to Google AppEngine (not much).   To scale you are supposed to partition your data. Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all the details it’s not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff in the right way and it’s very much worth looking at, especially if you us</p><p>3 0.78641188 <a title="476-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Product%3A__Hibernate_Shards.html">24 high scalability-2007-07-24-Product:  Hibernate Shards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.
 
Hibernate Shards is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.   Hibernate Shards  key features:
  
  Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love: SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards. 
  Flexible sharding strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific logic. 
  Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your</p><p>4 0.76342791 <a title="476-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-20-Alternate_strategy_for_database_sharding.html">546 high scalability-2009-03-20-Alternate strategy for database sharding</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've been interested in sharding concepts since first hearing the term "shard" a few years back. My interest had been piqued earlier, the first time I read about Google's original approach to distributed search. It was described as a hashtable-like system in which independent physical machines play the role of the buckets. More recently, I needed the capacity and performance of a Sharded system, but did not find helpful libraries or toolkits which would assist with the configuration for my language of preference these days, which is Python. And, since I had a few weeks on my hands, I decided I would begin the work of creating these tools.       The result of my initial work the Pyshards project, a still-incomplete python and MySQL based horizontal partitioning and sharding toolkit. HighScalability.com readers will already know that horizontal partitioning is a data segmenting pattern in which distinct groups of physical row-based datasets are distributed across multiple partitions.

<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week – here is the summary of that presentation.﻿

<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all shards.     There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys across a shard cluster. Each has its pro’s and con’s and the one chosen should be specific to the problems you’re trying to solve.</p><p>3 0.73782033 <a title="476-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-24-Scalability_Perspectives_%236%3A_Lew_Tucker_%E2%80%93_Virtual_Data_Centers_in_the_Open_Cloud.html">547 high scalability-2009-03-24-Scalability Perspectives #6: Lew Tucker – Virtual Data Centers in the Open Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Searching around the HS website I noticed that there are no articles regarding db2, which has an express edition, free of charge and from what I know there aren't any restrictions.   Being a powerful database system I thought it could make be an alternative to MySQL, PostgreSQL databases.     Here is the IBM statement:   "DB2 Express Edition for Community (DB2 Express-C) is a no charge data server for use in development and deployment. DB2 Express-C supports a full range of APIs, drivers, and interfaces for application development including PHP, C/C++, and .NET. In addition, DB2 Express-C V9 contains advanced XML features. DB2 Express-C provides ISVs an ideal starting database server for Web, enterprise, and eBusiness applications.     This IBM Redbook provides fundamentals of DB2 application development with DB2 Express-C. It covers the DB2 Express-C installation and configuration for application development and skills and techniques for building DB2 applications with XML, PHP, C/C++,</p><p>5 0.69921011 <a title="476-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-31-Paper%3A_Everything_You_Always_Wanted_to_Know_About_Synchronization_but_Were_Afraid_to_Ask.html">1541 high scalability-2013-10-31-Paper: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but Were Afraid to Ask</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core architectures:  Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but Were Afraid to Ask .
 
The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't appear to be generically possible:
  
 None of the nine locking schemes we consider consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality,  a lock algorithm should thus be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload .  
  
Abstract:
  

This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures, from single-socket – uniform and nonuniform – to multi-socket – directory and broadcastbased – many-cores. We draw a set of observations t</p><p>6 0.69672334 <a title="476-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-29-Google_App_Engine_plus_Amazon_AWS%3A_Best_of_both_worlds.html">641 high scalability-2009-06-29-Google App Engine plus Amazon AWS: Best of both worlds</a></p>

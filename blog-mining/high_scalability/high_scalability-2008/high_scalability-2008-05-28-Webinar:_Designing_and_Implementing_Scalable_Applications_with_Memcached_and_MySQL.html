<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case. Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on Fotolog in  Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success , which was one of my personal favorites.  Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've developed a</p><p>3 0.21946527 <a title="333-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-06-Scalability_for_Startups%3A_How_to_Grow_Up_without_Blowing_Up.html">404 high scalability-2008-10-06-Scalability for Startups: How to Grow Up without Blowing Up</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a useful post by Frank Mashraqi, Director of Business Operations & Technical Strategy for a top 50 website that delivers billions of page views per month.          Since scalability is considered a non-functional requirement, it is often overlooked in the hopes of decreasing time to market. Adding scalability down the road can decrease the time to market but only after assuming significant technical debt.         Balancing performance and scalability vs. fast iteration and cost efficiency can be a significant challenge for startups. The good news is that achieving this balance is not impossible.

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200 M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the switches.     These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are only available through Sun's factory integration.

<p>Introduction: Sun FireTM X4540 Server as Backup Server for Zmanda's Amanda Enterprise 2.6 Software     by Thomas Hanvey (Sun Microsystems) and Dmitri Joukovski and Ken Crandall (Zmanda)   September, 2008     Explosive data growth, combined with demanding requirements for data availability, has placed a tremendous burden on IT operations staff at businesses of all sizes. Yet, many organizations do not have the staff or budget to purchase and manage complex and expensive backup and recovery software products.     The Sun FireTM X4540 server can deliver massive storage capacity and remarkable throughput so it is well-suited as a nearline storage platform for backup and restore applications. Combining the power of the SolarisTM 10 Operating System with the data integrity and simplified administration of ZFS, the Sun Fire X4540 server can be an ideal candidate for streamlining and improving backup and restore operations.     Amanda Enterprise Edition from Zmanda was designed to address these challenges,</p><p>5 0.70446771 <a title="333-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-07-Sun_Acquires_Q-layer_in_Cloud_Computing_Play.html">486 high scalability-2009-01-07-Sun Acquires Q-layer in Cloud Computing Play</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++ to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and platform independence (Java Bytecode). They may even have gotten better throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution, you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor. Why? Because of the unpredictable pauses introduced by the garbage collector which result in significant jitter (variance of execution time).      In this post Frederic Pariente  Engineering Manager at Sun Microsystems posted a summary of a case study on how the use of Sun Real Time JVM and  GigaSpaces was used in the context of of a customer proof-of-concept this summer to ensure   guaranteed latency per m</p><p>4 0.63366818 <a title="333-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-15-Blog%3A_Occam%E2%80%99s_Razor_by_Avinash_Kaushik.html">9 high scalability-2007-07-15-Blog: Occam’s Razor by Avinash Kaushik</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The transport-level server load balancing architectures described in   the first half of this article   are more than adequate for many Web sites, but more complex and dynamic sites can't depend on them. Applications that rely on cache or session data must be able to handle a sequence of requests from the same client accurately and efficiently, without failing. In this follow up to his introduction to server load balancing, Gregor Roth discusses various application-level load balancing architectures, helping you decide which one will best meet the business requirements of your Web site.           The first half of this article   describes transport-level server load balancing solutions, such as TCP/IP-based load balancers, and analyzes their benefits and disadvantages. Load balancing on the TCP/IP level spreads incoming TCP connections over the real servers in a server farm. It is sufficient in most cases, especially for static Web sites. However, support for dynamic Web sites often re</p><p>3 0.16680174 <a title="426-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-19-The_4_Building_Blocks_of_Architecting_Systems_for_Scale.html">1325 high scalability-2012-09-19-The 4 Building Blocks of Architecting Systems for Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture principles then take a look at Will Larson's  Introduction to Architecting Systems for Scale . Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:
  
    Load Balancing: Scalability & Redundancy . Horizontal scalability and redundancy are usually achieved via load balancing, the spreading of requests across multiple resources.    
 
    Smart Clients . The   client has a list of hosts and load balances across that list of hosts. Upside is simple for programmers. Downside is it's hard to update and change. 
    Hardware Load Balancers . Targeted at larger companies, this is dedicated load balancing hardware. Upside is performance. Downside is cost and complexity. 
    Software Load Balancers . The recommended approach, it's  software that handles load balancing, health checks, etc. 
 
 
    Caching . Make better use of resources you already have.

<p>Introduction: In   Client Side Load Balancing for Web 2.0 Applications   author Lei Zhu suggests a very interesting approach to load balancing: forget DNS round robbin, toss your expensive load balancer, and make your client do the load balancing for you. Your client maintains a list of possible servers and cycles through them. All the details are explained in the article, but it's an intriguing idea, especially for the budget conscious startup.</p><p>5 0.11790946 <a title="426-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-05-Product%3A_HAProxy_-_The_Reliable%2C_High_Performance_TCP-HTTP_Load_Balancer.html">509 high scalability-2009-02-05-Product: HAProxy - The Reliable, High Performance TCP-HTTP Load Balancer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Load Balancing in Amazon EC2 with HAProxy.  Grig Gheorghiu writes a nice post  on HAProxy functionality and configuration: Emulating virtual servers, Logging, SSL, Load balancing algorithms, Session persistence with cookies, Server health checks, etc.  Adapted From the website:    HAProxy  is a free, very fast and reliable solution offering high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It is particularly suited for web sites crawling under very high loads while needing persistence or Layer7 processing. Supporting tens of thousands of connections is clearly realistic with todays hardware. Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing architectures very easy and riskless, while still offering the possibility not to expose fragile web servers to the Net.

<p>Introduction: Hi all!  So nice to start discussing cool things in this even cooler forum :)  I am having a problem .. which i believe is already solved but i would love someone confirming actual experience with the same topic.  We are building a client / server architecture, consisting of a web server part and many clients.  Transport will be provided as either XML-RPC / SOAP / JSON or all at once. All of the communication has to be encrypted and passed within SSL3.  We expect a high load when the application starts (> 2000 concurrent requests). Combine this with xml parsing for the rpc api, things really look ugly :) So it's a big mess :)  It will not be that much database bound behind the api - mostly files will be transferred from the server to the clients and simple api for control.  So it's pretty much a matter of 'what-to-do-with-ssl'.  I was thinking of hardware - NetApp or a similar application accelerator.  Can anyone give examples of a hardware piece that combines: Load balancer / SSL acce</p><p>6 0.77700937 <a title="426-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Simone Brunozzi, technology evangelist for Amazon Web Services in Europe, describes how Soocial.com was fully ported to Amazon web services.         ----------------   This period of the year I decided to dedicate some time to better understand how our customers use AWS, therefore I spent some online time with Stefan Fountain and the nice guys at Soocial.com, a "one address book solution to contact management", and I would like to share with you some details of their IT infrastructure, which now runs 100% on Amazon Web Services!    In the last few months, they've been working hard to cope with tens of thousands of users and to get ready to easily scale to millions. To make this possible, they decided to move ALL their architecture to Amazon Web Services. Despite the fact that they were quite happy with their previous hosting provider, Amazon proved to be the way to go.    -----------------           Read the rest of the article here .</p><p>3 0.92771715 <a title="426-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-The_7_Stages_of_Scaling_Web_Apps.html">391 high scalability-2008-09-23-The 7 Stages of Scaling Web Apps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical successful website goes through: 
 
 Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture, low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers, database server, and internal storage. 
 Stage 2 - More of the same, just bigger. 
 Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding. 
 Stage 4 - The Pain Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content, significant re-architecting for DB. 
 Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters, using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster. 
 Stage 6 - Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again, op</p><p>same-blog 4 0.90969682 <a title="426-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-22-Server_load_balancing_architectures%2C_Part_1%3A_Transport-level_load_balancing.html">426 high scalability-2008-10-22-Server load balancing architectures, Part 1: Transport-level load balancing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Server farms achieve high scalability and high availability through server load balancing, a technique that makes the server farm appear to clients as a single server. In this two-part article, Gregor Roth explores server load balancing architectures, with a focus on open source solutions. Part 1 covers server load balancing basics and discusses the pros and cons of transport-level server load balancing.         The barrier to entry for many Internet companies is low. Anyone with a good idea can develop a small application, purchase a domain name, and set up a few PC-based servers to handle incoming traffic. The initial investment is small, so the start-up risk is minimal. But a successful low-cost infrastructure can become a serious problem quickly. A single server that handles all the incoming requests may not have the capacity to handle high traffic volumes once the business becomes popular. In such a situations companies often start to scale up: they upgrade the existing infrastruc</p><p>5 0.90710723 <a title="426-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-11-Have_We_Reached_the_End_of_Scaling%3F.html">758 high scalability-2010-01-11-Have We Reached the End of Scaling?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.  
 
Have we reached the end of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The End of" headlines. We've reached  The End of History  because the Western liberal democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government."  We've reached  The End of Science  because of the "fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions." We've even reached  The End of Theory  because all answers can be found in the continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're at  The End of the World ?
 
Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?
 
For a while I thought this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is because of the slow down of potential articles at m</p><p>6 0.89749372 <a title="426-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-29-Strategy%3A_Devirtualize_for_More_Vroom.html">664 high scalability-2009-07-29-Strategy: Devirtualize for More Vroom</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is one of my favorite posts for a couple of reasons. I think it gives a
lot of useful information in an interesting space. And Kyle Vogt was just a
real pleasure to talk to. He was very helpful and forthcoming, which makes the
whole experience better for everyone.The future is live. The future is real-
time. The future is now. That's the hype anyway. And as it has a habit of
doing, the hype is slowly becoming reality. We are seeing live searches, live
tweets, live location, live reality augmentation, live crab (fresh and local),
and live event publishing. One of the most challenging of all live
technologies is that of live video broadcasting. Imagine a world in which
everyone becomes a broadcaster and a consumer of video streams, all in real-
time (< 250 msec latency), all so you can talk and interact directly without
feeling like you are in the middle of a time shift war. The resources and the
engineering needed to make this happened must be substantial. How do you do

<p>Introduction: How do you scale an inbox that has multiple highly volatile feeds? That's a
problem faced by social networks like Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter. Follow a
few hundred event sources and it's hard to scalably order an inbox so that you
see a correct view as event sources continually publish new events.This can be
considered like aview materializationproblem in a database. In a database a
view is a virtual table defined by a query that can be accessed like a table.
Materialization refers to when the data behind the view is created. If a view
is a join on several tables and that join is performed when the view is
accessed, then performance will be slow. If the view is precomputed access to
the view will be fast, but more resources are used, especially considering
that the view may never be accessed.Your wall/inbox/stream is a view on all
the people/things you follow. If you never look at your inbox then
materializing the view in your inbox is a waste of resources, yet you'll be

<p>Introduction: OK,I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any
sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll
ask here.Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application"
that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good
consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen
sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but
no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server"
when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously
useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-
alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.The
normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page
like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy
page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let a user
"in" a</p><p>5 0.70354646 <a title="265-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in_Architecture_-_Pay_to_Play_to_Keep_a_System_Small__.html">965 high scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in Architecture - Pay to Play to Keep a System Small  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you keep a system small enough, while still being successful, that a
simple scale-up strategy becomes the preferred architecture?StackOverflow, for
example, could stick with a tool chain they were comfortable with because they
had a natural brake on how fast they could grow: there are only so many
programmers in the world. If this doesn't work for you, here's another natural
braking strategy to consider:charge for your service.Paul Houlesummarized this
nicely as:avoid scaling problems by building a service that's profitable at a
small scale.This interesting point, one I hadn't properly considered before,
was brought up by Maciej Ceglowski, co-founder ofPinboard.in, in an interview
with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their theirnet@nightshow.Pinboard is a
lean, mean, pay for bookmarking machine, a timely replacement for the nearly
departed Delicious. And as a self professed anti-social bookmarking site, it
emphasizes speed over socializing. Maciej considers Pinboard a persona</p><p>6 0.69170761 <a title="265-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-15-Book%3A_Building_Scalable_Web_Sites.html">10 high scalability-2007-07-15-Book: Building Scalable Web Sites</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the most important architectural decisions that must be done early on
in a scalable web site project issplitting the data flow into two streams: one
that is user specific and one that is generic. If this is done properly, the
system will be able to grow easily. On the other hand, if the data streams are
not separated from the start, then the growth options will be severely
limited. Trying to make such a web site scale will be just painting the
corpse, and this change will cost a whole lot more when you need to introduce
it later (and it is "when" in this case, not "if").</p><p>2 0.8677057 <a title="265-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-03-Paper%3A_Brewer%27s_Conjecture_and_the_Feasibility_of_Consistent_Available_Partition-Tolerant_Web_Services.html">108 high scalability-2007-10-03-Paper: Brewer's Conjecture and the Feasibility of Consistent Available Partition-Tolerant Web Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Abstract: When designing distributed web services, there are three properties
that are commonly desired: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
It is impossible to achieve all three. In this note, we prove this conjecture
in the asynchronous network model, and then discuss solutions to this dilemma
in the partially synchronous model.</p><p>3 0.79767257 <a title="265-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-27-Paper%3A_XORing_Elephants%3A_Novel_Erasure_Codes_for_Big_Data.html">1483 high scalability-2013-06-27-Paper: XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure Codes for Big Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Erasure codesare one of those seemingly magical mathematical creations that
with the developments described in the paper XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure
Codes for Big Data, are set to replace triple replication as the data storage
protection mechanism of choice.The result says Robin Harris (StorageMojo) in
an excellent article, Facebook's advanced erasure codes: "WebCos will be able
to store massive amounts of data more efficiently than ever before. Bad news:
so will anyone else."Robin says with cheap disks triple replication made sense
and was economical. With ever bigger BigData the overhead has become costly.
But erasure codes have always suffered from unacceptably long time to repair
times. This paper describes new Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) that are
efficiently repairable in disk I/O and bandwidth requirements:These systems
are now designed to survive the loss of up to four storage elements - disks,
servers, nodes or even entire data centers - without losing any data.

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

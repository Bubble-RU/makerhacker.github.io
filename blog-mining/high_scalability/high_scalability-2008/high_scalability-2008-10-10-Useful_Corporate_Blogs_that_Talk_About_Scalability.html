<p>Introduction: It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just let the random
chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting content." #fail.
While someone says this I imagine them flicking their hair back in a "I can't
be bothered with true understanding" disdain. And where does random chance get

like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts
that you may not know about and that I've found interesting:DevOps Cafe. With

<p>Introduction: Shanti Braforddetails how his Ruby on Railsbased website survived a 24 hour
550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup
details, so there's not much I can add.Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web
server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR,
nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved
performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of
the performance boost.Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a

<p>Introduction: An alternate strategy for database sharding which avoids queries across
different shards and merging results. A central repository of data is
maintained for some tables along with other shards. Can be used in calculating
top users, recent users, most read etc.</p><p>5 0.69086111 <a title="408-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-14-Sun_N1_Grid_Engine_Software_and_the_Tokyo_Institute_of_Technology_Super_Computer_Grid.html">412 high scalability-2008-10-14-Sun N1 Grid Engine Software and the Tokyo Institute of Technology Super Computer Grid</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of
Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of
the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data
servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective,
flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute- and data-intensive
applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of
systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory,
and delivers 47.38 trillion1 floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS)
of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to
users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment
architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future. This
Sun BluePrints article provides an overview of the Tokyo Tech grid, named
TSUBAME. The third in a series of Sun BluePrints articles on the TSUBAME grid,

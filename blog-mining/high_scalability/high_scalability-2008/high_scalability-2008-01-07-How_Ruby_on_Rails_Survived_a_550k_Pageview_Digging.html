<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: Update 6:nginx_http_push_module. Turn nginx into a long-polling message

WordPress.com moved from Pound to Nginx and are now "regularly serving about
8-9k requests/second and about 1.2Gbit/sec through a few Nginx instances and
have plenty of room to grow!".Update 4:Nginx better than Pound for load
balancing.Pound spikes at 80% CPU, Nginx uses 3% and is easier to understand
and better documented.Update 3: igvita.com combines two cool tools together
for better performance inNginx and Memcached, a 400% boost!.Update 2: Software
Project onInstalling Nginx Web Server w/ PHP and SSL. Breaking away from
mother Apache can be a scary proposition and this kind of getting started
article really helps easy the separation.Update:Slicehost has some

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived
processes) and why they moved toScalato program against it (high level

Brought to you straight from Digg's blog. A very succinct explanation of the
major elements of the Digg architecture while tracing a request through the
system. I've updated this profile with the new information.Update:Digg now
receives 230 million plus page views per month and 26 million unique visitors
- traffic that necessitated major internal upgrades.Traffic generated by
Digg's over 22 million famously info-hungry users and 230 million page views
can crash an unsuspecting website head-on into its CPU, memory, and bandwidth
limits. How does Digg handle billions of requests a month?Site:

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block, CTO atRockThePost.com, a crowdfunding company, haswritten a
nice set of tipsfor smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a
small two person development team. Their service has a typical small scale
structure:PHP's Zend Framework 2Two m1.medium for web serversELB to split the

that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: Use PHP's APC feature.
APC is opcode cache that is "really a requirement in order for a website to
have a chance at performing well."Put everything that's not a .php request on
a CDN. Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on
S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused
them to serve directly from S3.Don't make connections to other servers in your
PHP code. Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down
processing. Use the APC key/value store for data storage and Varnish for

<p>Introduction: ProfessorDavid Malangives a very good lecture on scalability for dynamic
websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a
great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching
style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible
explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal
scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load
balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high
availability.Watch it onAcademic EarthThis is one lecture in a series of 13
lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to: build dynamic
websites with Ajax and with Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP); set up
domain names with DNS; structure pages with XHTML and CSS how to program in
JavaScript and PHP; configure Apacheand MySQL; design and query databases with
SQL; use Ajax with both XML andJSON;  build mashups.For thelecture notesgo to

<p>Introduction: Shanti Braforddetails how his Ruby on Railsbased website survived a 24 hour
550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup
details, so there's not much I can add.Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web
server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR,
nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved
performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of
the performance boost.Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a
very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>2 0.78564262 <a title="203-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-10-Useful_Corporate_Blogs_that_Talk_About_Scalability.html">408 high scalability-2008-10-10-Useful Corporate Blogs that Talk About Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of
Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of
the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data
servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective,
flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute- and data-intensive
applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of
systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory,
and delivers 47.38 trillion1 floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS)
of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to
users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment
architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future. This
Sun BluePrints article provides an overview of the Tokyo Tech grid, named
TSUBAME. The third in a series of Sun BluePrints articles on the TSUBAME grid,

<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak, in his short and information packed REDUNDANT DATA CENTER
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY video, shows why networking as played at the highest
levels is something you want to leave to professionals, like alarge animal
country vetenariandelivering a stuck foal at 2AM on a dark and stormy night.
There are always a lot questions about the black art of building redundant
datacenter networks and there's a shortage of accessible explanations. What I
liked about Ivan's video is how effortlessly he explains the issues and
tradeoffs you can expect in designing your own solution, as well as giving
creative solutions to those problems. A lot of years of experience are boiled
down to a 17 minute video.Ivan begins by showing what a canonical fully
redundant datacenter would look like:It's like an ark where everything goes
two by two. You have two datacenters, each datacenter has redundant core
switches, redundant servers, redundant disk arrays, redundant links between
datacenters (for synchro</p><p>3 0.16162765 <a title="284-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-24-How_Google_Serves_Data_from_Multiple_Datacenters.html">687 high scalability-2009-08-24-How Google Serves Data from Multiple Datacenters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Streamy Explains CAP and HBase's Approach to CAP.We plan to employ
inter-cluster replication, with each cluster located in a single DC. Remote
replication will introduce some eventual consistency into the system, but each
cluster will continue to be strongly consistent.Ryan Barrett, Google App
Engine datastore lead, gave this talkTransactions Across Datacenters (and
Other Weekend Projects)at the Google I/O 2009 conference.While the talk
doesn't necessarily break new technical ground, Ryan does an excellent job
explaining and evaluating the different options you have when architecting a
system to work across multiple datacenters. This is calledmultihoming,
operating from multiple datacenters simultaneously.As multihoming is one of
the most challenging tasks in all computing, Ryan's clear and thoughtful style
comfortably leads you through the various options. On the trip you learn:The
differentmulti-homing optionsare: Backups, Master-Slave, Multi-Master, 2PC,

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking The
Datacenter as a Computer book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I
would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!John Fries in aG+
commenthas what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the
book:It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by
interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the
entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and
realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter
anymoreIt's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize
simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to
warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware;
datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to
deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key
challenges, which include ra</p><p>3 0.79404974 <a title="284-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-07-Google_Finds%3A_Centralized_Control%2C_Distributed_Data_Architectures_Work_Better_than_Fully_Decentralized_Architectures.html">1627 high scalability-2014-04-07-Google Finds: Centralized Control, Distributed Data Architectures Work Better than Fully Decentralized Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For years a war has been fought in the software architecture trenches between
the ideal of decentralized services and the power and practicality of
centralized services. Centralized architectures, at least at themanagement and
control planelevel, are winning. And Google not only agrees, they are
enthusiastic adopters of this model, even in places you don't think it should
work.Here's an excerpt from Google Lifts Veil On "Andromeda" Virtual
Networking, an excellent article by Timothy Morgan, that includes a money
quote fromAmin Vahdat, distinguished engineer and technical lead for
networking at Google:Like many of the massive services that Google has
created, the Andromeda network has centralized control. By the way, so did the
Google File System and the MapReduce scheduler that gave rise to Hadoop when
it was mimicked, so did the BigTable NoSQL data store that has spawned a
number of quasi-clones, and even the B4 WAN and the Spanner distributed file
system that have yet to be cloned.

<p>Introduction: If you were going to design a next generation Internet at the physical layer
that routes around the current Internet, what would it look like? What should
it do? How should it work? Who should own it? How should it be paid for? How
would you access it?It has long been said the Internet routes around
obstacles. Snowden has revealed some major obstacles. The beauty of the
current current app and web system is the physical network doesn't matter. We
can just replace it with something else. Something that doesn't flow through
choke points like backhaul networks,under sea cables, andcell towers. What
might that something else look like?Google's Loon ProjectProject Loonwas so
named because the idea was thought to be loony. Maybe not.The idea is to float
high-altitude balloons 20 miles in the air to create an aerial wireless
network with up to 3G-like speeds. Signals travel through the balloon network

<p>Introduction: How do we scale datacenters? Should we build a few mammoth million machine
datacenters or many smaller micro datacenters? Intuitively we usually go with
a bigger is better economies of scale type argument, but it may not be so.
What works for Walmart may not work for White Box World. Mega datacenters may
actually exhibit diseconomies of scale. It may be better to run applications
over many distributed micro datacenters instead of one large one.This paper by
Ken Church, Albert Greenberg, and James Hamilton, all from Microsoft, takes a
look at the different issues and concludes:Putting it all together, the micro
model offers a design point with attractive performance, reliability, scale
and cost. Given how much the industry is currently investing in the mega
model, the industry would do well to consider the micro alternative. break

<p>Introduction: The RAD Lab (Reliable Adaptive Distributed Systems Laboratory) wants to
leapfrog the Big Switch and create The Next Big Switch, skipping the
cloud/utility evolutionary stage altogether. This hyper-evolutionary niche
buster develops technology so advanced the cloud disperses and you can go back
to building your own personal datacenters again. Where Google took years to
create their datacenters, using a prefab Datacenter Operating System you might
create your own in a long holiday weekend. Not St. Patrick's of course.Their
vision:Enable one person to invent and run the next revolutionary IT service,
operationally expressing a new business idea as a multi-million-user service
over the course of a long weekend. By doing so we hope to enable an Internet
"Fortune 1 million".How? By wizardry in the form of a “datacenter operating
system” created from a pinch of "statistical machine learning (SML)" and a
tincture of "recent insights from networking and distributed systems." But

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++
to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development
productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and
platform independence (Java Bytecode). They may even have gotten better
throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and
application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking
applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution,
you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor.
Why? Because of the unpredictable pauses introduced by the garbage collector
which result in significant jitter (variance of execution time).In this post
Frederic Pariente Engineering Manager at Sun Microsystems posted a summary of
a case study on how the use of Sun Real Time JVM and GigaSpaces was used in
the context of of a customer proof-of-concept this summer to ensureguaranteed

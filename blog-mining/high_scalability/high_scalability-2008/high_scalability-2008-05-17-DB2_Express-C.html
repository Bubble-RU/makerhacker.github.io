<p>Introduction: How do you evaluate and decide which web technologies (and there are myriads out there) to use for your new web application, which one potentially gives you the best performance, which one will likely give you the shortest time-to-market? The Apache incubator project   Olio   might help.     Olio is a is an open source web 2.0 toolkit to help evaluate the suitability, functionality and performance of web technologies. Olio defines an example web2.0 application (an events site somewhat like yahoo.com/upcoming) and provides three initial implementations : PHP, Java EE and RubyOnRails (ROR). The toolkit also defines ways to drive load against the application in order to measure performance.     Apache Olio could be used to     Understand how to use various web 2.0 technologies such as AJAX, memcached, mogileFS etc. Use the code in the application to understand the subtle complexities involved and how to get around issues with these technologies.

<p>Introduction: This presentation by Michael Radwin describes why Yahoo! had standardized on PHP going forward. It describes how after reviewing all the web technologies including their own internal ones, PHP was choosen. It shows that not only technical reasons , but also business and development processes were taken into account.</p><p>5 0.64174825 <a title="320-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-18-Code_deployment_tools.html">369 high scalability-2008-08-18-Code deployment tools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: G'day,     I'm building an application to manage WordPress PHP code on many servers. Our application will push down code updates to each server, as well as performing backups and testing.     I'm considering different methods of pushing updated code onto the individual servers. I'm considering something like Capistrano (I've no experience in Ruby though). I've also considered using subversion and then remotely calling svn commands via SSH.     Are there any other tools specifically for this purpose? The servers will have persistent data (the WordPress databases) so I don't want to re-image them every update. Plus, they will each have a different set of plugins / themes, so building many images would be too complex.     If there are any papers on code deployment, or other recommended reading, please point the links my way.     Likewise, if anyone has any suggestions, or would like more details, just let me know.     Cheers -   Callum  .</p><p>6 0.64034563 <a title="320-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-02-The_case_against_ORM_Frameworks_in_High_Scalability_Architectures.html">235 high scalability-2008-02-02-The case against ORM Frameworks in High Scalability Architectures</a></p>

<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week – here is the summary of that presentation.﻿

<p>Introduction: Searching around the HS website I noticed that there are no articles regarding db2, which has an express edition, free of charge and from what I know there aren't any restrictions.   Being a powerful database system I thought it could make be an alternative to MySQL, PostgreSQL databases.     Here is the IBM statement:   "DB2 Express Edition for Community (DB2 Express-C) is a no charge data server for use in development and deployment. DB2 Express-C supports a full range of APIs, drivers, and interfaces for application development including PHP, C/C++, and .NET. In addition, DB2 Express-C V9 contains advanced XML features. DB2 Express-C provides ISVs an ideal starting database server for Web, enterprise, and eBusiness applications.     This IBM Redbook provides fundamentals of DB2 application development with DB2 Express-C.

After all, this isn't a blog about really important stuff like investing, acne cures, or cheap natural cleansing products.   But the secrets are real.

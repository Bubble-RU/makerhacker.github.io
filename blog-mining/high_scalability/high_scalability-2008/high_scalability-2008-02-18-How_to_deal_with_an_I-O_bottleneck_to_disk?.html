<p>Introduction: One of the best projects I've ever worked on was creating a large scale web
site publishing system that was almost entirely static. A large team of very
talented creatives made the art work, writers penned the content, and
designers generated templates. All assets were controlled in a database. Then
all that was extracted, after applying many different filters, to a static
site that was uploaded via ftp to dozens of web servers. It worked great.
Reliable, fast, cheap, and simple. Updates were a bit of a pain as it required
pushing a lot of files to a lot of servers, and that took time, but otherwise
a solid system.Alas, this elegant system was replaced with a new fangled
dynamic database based system. Content was pulled from a database using a
dynamic language generated front-end. With a recent series of posts from
Amazon's Werner Vogels, chronicling his experience of transforming his All
Things Distributed blog into a static site using S3's ability to serve web
pages, I get the pleasu</p><p>3 0.13648242 <a title="251-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-12-P2P_server_technology%3F.html">598 high scalability-2009-05-12-P2P server technology?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>5 0.09103559 <a title="251-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-30-Pomegranate_-_Storing_Billions_and_Billions_of_Tiny_Little_Files.html">889 high scalability-2010-08-30-Pomegranate - Storing Billions and Billions of Tiny Little Files</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pomegranateis a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular
storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at
increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support
applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high
concurrency, high throughput, and low latency. Their tests seem to indicate it
works:We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well
for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observedlinearly
increased more than100,000aggregate read and write requests served per second
(RPS). Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V
store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system
API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use.
Every application could use it out of the box.The features of Pomegranate
are:It handles billions of small files efficiently, even in one directory;It

<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if anyone has found any information on how to architect a
system to support high availability file uploads. My scenario: I have an
Apache server proxying requests to a bunch of Tomcat Java application servers.
When I need to upgrade my site, I stop and upgrade each of the Tomcat servers
one at a time. This seems to work well as Apache automatically routes
subsequent requests for the stopped app server to the remaining app servers
that are up. The problem is that if a user is uploading a file when the app
server is stopped, the upload fails and the user has to upload the file again.
This is problematic as uploading files is an integral feature of the site and
it's frustrating for the users to have to restart their uploads every time I
upgrade the site (which I want to be able to do frequently).Has anyone seen
any information on how this can be done or have ideas on how this can be
architected? I imagine sites like Flickr must have a solution to this problem
as I have</p><p>3 0.77344024 <a title="251-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:My
recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget
with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid
expiration headers) is employ areverse proxyas mentioned in this article.In
the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a
single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a
single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max
server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.It's trivial to implement for
anyone interested...</p><p>4 0.76121217 <a title="251-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-12-P2P_server_technology%3F.html">598 high scalability-2009-05-12-P2P server technology?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,First of all I want to to say that this is an extremely interesting and
informative website. i have enjoyed reading the various posts on how the big
sites scale to meet the needs of their customers.The service we are developing
is a webcam service. The client application sends images to the server via
HTTP POST and they are saved in folder specified by the users id. When a new
image is sent to the server it will overwrite the current image.Users can then
view the images via our web server.Ideally we want the images to upload as
quickly as possible and allow users to view them as quickly as possible.Would
I be correct to assume that when the number of uploading clients exceeds the
capability of the server the only way to scale is to add more hardware.Also I
assume that to use HTTP accelerator caches will not speed up viewing the
images as the new images will invalidate the cache.I appreciate any input on
the subject.</p><p>6 0.73815721 <a title="251-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Paper%3A_Lightweight_Web_servers.html">26 high scalability-2007-07-25-Paper: Lightweight Web servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose
limits (GAE Quotas,Fotolog,Facebook) as a means of protecting a website
against service destroyingtraffic spikes. Twitter will reportedlylimit the
number followersto 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow
Twitter to make some bank bygoing freemiumand charging for adding more
followers.Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting
aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established
ecosystem?One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let
everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is,
however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are
will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service.
Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.Now in Twitter's
case the people with the most followers tend to be opinion leaderswho shape

<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.They're using a static server to
deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that
the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on
serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.I'm curious how other
people have dealt with this situation.Seperating into two different servers
would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the
premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created
in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>4 0.75325936 <a title="251-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-It_Must_be_Crap_on_Relational_Dabases_Week_.html">648 high scalability-2009-07-02-It Must be Crap on Relational Dabases Week </a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's hard to be a relational database lately. After years of faithful service
everywhere you look the world is turning against you:Recently at theNoSQL
conference150 revolutionaries met with their new anti-RDBMS arms suppliers.
And you know what happens when revolutionaries are motivated, educated,
funded, and well armed.The revolution has gone mainstream when Computerworld
writesNo to SQL? Anti-database movement gains steam. It's not just whispers
anymore, it's everywhere.And perennial revolutionary Michael Stonebraker runs
from blog to blog shouting theThe End of a DBMS Era (Might be Upon Us).
Relational vendors are selling legacy software, are 50x slower than other
alternatives, and that can not stand.The Greek Chorus onHacker Newssings of
anger and lies.Certainly some say stick with the past. It's your fault, you
aren't doing it right, give us another chance and all will be as it ever was.
Some smirk saying this is nothing but a return to a more ancient time when IBM
was King.But i</p><p>5 0.74088478 <a title="251-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise.html">287 high scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise</a></p>

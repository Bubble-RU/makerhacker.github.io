<p>Introduction: The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the
hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming
reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality

the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video
broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a broadcaster and a
consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you
can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a
time shift war. The resources and the engineering needed to make this happened
must be substantial. How do you do that?To find out I talked to Kyle Vogt,

<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t
be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems
Laboratories* The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds
is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the
high-tech industry.* The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome
of the evolution of these games.* Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore
the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.* The game server is used both to
discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating
(by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the
client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might
seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role
means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the
server component.* Using multiple servers is a basic mechanism for scaling th</p><p>6 0.10192198 <a title="473-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-22-Google_Architecture.html">448 high scalability-2008-11-22-Google Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: ESPN went on airin 1978. In those 30+ years think of the wonders we've seen!
When I think of ESPN I think of a world wide brand that is the very definition
of prime time. And it shows in their stats. ESPN.com peaks at 100,000 requests
per second. Their peak event is, not surprisingly, the World Cup. But would
you be surprised to learn ESPN is powered by only a few hundred servers and a
couple of dozen engineers? I was.And would you be surprised to learn ESPN is
undergoing a fundamental transition from an Enterprise architecture to one
capable of handling web scale loads driven by increasing mobile usage,
personalization, and a service orientation? Again, thinking ESPN was just
about watching sports on TV, I was surprised. ESPN is becoming much more than
that. ESPN is becoming a sports platform. How does ESPN handle all of this
complexity, responsibility, change, and load? Unlike most every other profile

Radio Waves as a Low-Power Source. "Silicon technology has advanced to the
point where even tiny amounts of energy can do useful work." No batteries ==

the effects of the NUMA architecture. Jeremy Cole with a spectacular article
on the differences between NUMA and SMP/UMA systems and the mostly
unsatisfactory tricks required to get MySQL to perform on NUMA systems. There
are really two issues: the evils of an OS controlled swap and NUMA performance
effects due to a single node (in the NUMA sense) running out of memory. This
is the kind of stuff you only see when you push your systems to the edge.

Engineering, describes the architecture used by the popular game named Second
Life. Ian presents how the architecture was at its debut and how it evolved
over years as users and features have been added.Second Lifeis a 3-D virtual
world created by its Residents. Virtual Worlds are expected to be more and
more popular on the internet so their architecture might be of interest.
Especially important is the appearance of open virtual worlds or

<p>Introduction: John McCutchan,after a long career spent working on the Linux kernel and being
hired out as a code optimization guru, joined Google's Dart team. A curious
hire until you watch Bringing SIMD to the Web via Dart, where John makes a
programmer accessible explanation of why he likes Dart: performance,
performance, performance.Dartis an open-source Web programming
languagedeveloped by Google. The motivation for Dart is twofold: provide a
language capable of scaling up to the complex web applications that are
becoming the norm. Think Gmail. And provide a single language capable of
working on both the client and server. Towards those ends Dart is a complete
language, full tool environment, and provides an advanced Web UI framework for
building web applications at a high level of abstraction.Why isn't JavaScript
good enough? The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts
crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause web
apps to lose out to mobile apps.</p><p>6 0.78744376 <a title="473-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-16-Paper%3A_The_End_of_an_Architectural_Era_%28It%E2%80%99s_Time_for_a_Complete_Rewrite%29.html">572 high scalability-2009-04-16-Paper: The End of an Architectural Era (It’s Time for a Complete Rewrite)</a></p>

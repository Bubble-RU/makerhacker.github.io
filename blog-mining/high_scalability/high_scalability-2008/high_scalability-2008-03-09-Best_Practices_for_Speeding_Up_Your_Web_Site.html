<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do
something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one
Ilya Grigorik, Developer Advocate,Make the Web Fastat Google, and author of a
great new book:High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer
should know about networking and web performance. That's a big topic you might
be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed
pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It's like
a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.In case you are not familiar
with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For
years Ilya has been producing excellent content onhis blog and if yousearch
YouTube you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the
book. Authority established.Reading the book I was struck by what a
complicated beast or little World Wide Web has become. That's clear from just

<p>Introduction: If you have a lot of static content to store and you aren't looking forward to
setting up and maintaining your own giganto SAN, maybe you can push off a lot
of the hard lifting to a CDN?Jesse Robbins at O'Reilly Radar posts that you
have a lot more options now because the number ofContent Distribution Networks
have doubled since last year. In fact, Dan Rayburn says there are now28
CDNproviders in the market. Hopefully you can find reasonable pricing at one
of them.Other than easing your burden, why might a CDN work for you? Because
it makes your site faster and customers like that. How can a CDN so
dramatically improve your site's performance?breakSteve Saunders, author
ofHigh Performance Web Sites: Essential Knowledge for Front-End Engineers, has
using a CDN has one of his "Thirteen Simple Rules for Speeding Up Your Web
Site."About CDNs Steve says:Remember that 80-90% of the end-user response time

<p>Introduction: The Exceptional Performance group at Yahoo! has identified 14 best practices
for making web pages faster. These best practices have proven to reduce
response times of Yahoo! properties by 25-50%. They focus on the front-end,
for example, why it's bad to use "@import" for including stylesheets and why
ETags disable browser caching.This google tech talk features these best
practices and demonstrate YSlow.Relevant links:14 Rules for Exceptional Web

<p>Introduction: Data mining and fast queries are always in that bin of hard to do things where
doing something smarter can yield big results. Bloom Filters are one such do
it smarter strategy, compressed bitmap indexes are another. In one application
"FastBit outruns other search indexes by a factor of 10 to 100 and doesn't
require much more room than the original data size." The data size is an
interesting metric. Our old standard b-trees can be two to four times larger
than the original data. In a test searching an Enron email database FastBit
outran MySQL by 10 to 1,000 times.FastBit is a software tool for searching
large read-only datasets. It organizes user data in a column-oriented
structure which is efficient for on-line analytical processing (OLAP), and
utilizes compressed bitmap indices to further speed up query processing.
Analyses have proven the compressed bitmap index used in FastBit to be
theoretically optimal for one-dimensional queries. Compared with other optimal
indexing methods, bit</p><p>3 0.79398549 <a title="273-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-03-Storage_Systems_for_High_Scalable_Systems_presentation.html">693 high scalability-2009-09-03-Storage Systems for High Scalable Systems presentation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The High Scalable Systems (i.e. Websites) such as: Google, Facebook, Amazon,
etc. need high scalable storage system that can deal with huge amount of data
with high availability and reliability. Building large systems on top of a
traditional RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This
presentation explores the landscape of new technologies available today to
augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability.Remember: All

<p>Introduction: A bit over a month ago Amazon experienced its infamous AWS outage in the US
East Region. As a cloud evangelist, I was intrigued by the history of the
outage as it occurred. There were great posts during and after the outage from
those who went down. But more interestingly for me as architect were the
detailed posts of those who managed to survive the outage relatively unharmed,
such as SimpleGeo, Netflix,SmugMug, SmugMug's CTO, Twilio, Bizo and
others.Reading through the experience of others, I tried to summarize
thepatterns, principles and best practicesthat emerged from these posts, as I
believe we can learn a lot from them on how to design our business
applications to truly leverage on the benefits that the cloud offers in high
availability and scalability.The main principles, patterns and best practices
are:Design for failureStateless and autonomous servicesRedundant hot copies

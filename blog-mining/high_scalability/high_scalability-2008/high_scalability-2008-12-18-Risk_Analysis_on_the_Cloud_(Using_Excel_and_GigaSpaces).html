<p>Introduction: Constructing a scalable  risk analysis  solution is a fascinating architectural challenge. If you come from Financial Services you are sure to appreciate that. But even architects from other domains are bound to find the challenges fascinating, and the architectural patterns of my suggested solution highly useful in other domains.
 
Recently I held an interesting webinar  around architecting solutions for scalable and near-real-time   risk analysis   solutions based on experience gathered with Financial Services customers. Seeing the vast interest in the webinar, I would like to share the highlights with you here. 
 
 From an architectural point of view, risk analysis is a data-intensive and a compute-intensive process, which also has an elaborate orchestration logic. volumes in this domain are massive and ever-increasing, together with an ever-increasing demand to reduce response time. These trends are aggravated by   global financial regulatory reforms   set following the late-2000s</p><p>3 0.095875986 <a title="470-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-04-Paper%3A_MapReduce%3A_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters.html">483 high scalability-2009-01-04-Paper: MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   MapReduce and PageRank Notes from Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau's Fall 2008 class  . Collects interesting facts about MapReduce and PageRank. For example, the history of the solution to searching for the term "flu" is traced through multiple generations of technology.   With Google entering the cloud space with  Google AppEngine  and a maturing  Hadoop  product, the MapReduce scaling approach might finally become a standard programmer practice. This is the best paper on the subject and is an excellent primer on a content-addressable memory future.  Some interesting stats from the paper: Google executes 100k MapReduce jobs each day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.  One common criticism ex-Googlers have is that it takes months to get up and be productive in the Google environment. Hopefully a way will be found to lower the learning curve a</p><p>4 0.090214416 <a title="470-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-Art_of_Distributed.html">590 high scalability-2009-05-06-Art of Distributed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Art of Distributed   Part 1: Rethinking about distributed computing models  
I â&euro;&tilde;m getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability, and distributed storage systems.   Download the article in PDF format.   Download the article in MS Word format.   I wait for your comments, and questions, and I will answer it in part two.</p><p>5 0.080303907 <a title="470-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-06-Big_Data_Application_Platform.html">1110 high scalability-2011-09-06-Big Data Application Platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's time to think of the architecture and application platforms surrounding "Big Data" databases. Big Data is often centered  around new database technologies mostly from the emerging NoSQL world.  The main challenge that these databases solve is how to handle massive amount of data at a reasonable cost and without poor performanc - distributed databases emerged to address this challenge and today we're seeing  high adoption rate   and quite impressive success stories such as the  Netflix use of Cassandra/DataStax solution  .  All that indicate the speed in which this market evolves.
 
  The need for a Big Data Application Platform  
 
Application platforms provide a framework for making the development of applications simpler. They do this by carving out the generic parts of applications such as security, scalability, and reliability (which  are  attributes of a 'good' application) from the parts of the applications that are specific to our business domain.

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.     Nicholas Carr    A former executive editor of the Harvard Business Review, Nicholas Carr writes and speaks on technology, business, and culture. His provocative 2004 book Does IT Matter? set off a worldwide debate about the role of computers in business.    The Big Switch – Rewiring the World, From Edison to Google    Carr's core insight is that the development of the computer and the Internet remarkably parallels that of the last radically disruptive technology, electricity. He traces the rapid morphing of electrification from an in-house competitive advantage to a ubiquitous utility, and how the business advantage rapidly shifted from the innovators and early adop</p><p>3 0.66967046 <a title="470-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-18-The_Missing_Piece_in_the_Virtualization_Stack_%28Part_1%29.html">762 high scalability-2010-01-18-The Missing Piece in the Virtualization Stack (Part 1)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This and the next post will discuss how virtualization and cloud computing, as we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today’s IT inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core inefficiencies lie. Virtualization principles must be extended to higher levels of the application stack, to make it easier for all of us to manage, tune and integrate applications. Otherwise we will continue to spend most of our time on things that don’t provide real value to the business.

<p>Introduction: In  A Brief History of the Internet  it was revealed that the Internet was  based on the idea that there would be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary design. The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying  technical idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In this  approach, the choice of any individual network technology was not  dictated  by a particular network architecture but rather could be selected freely   by a provider and made to interwork with the other networks through  a meta-level "Internetworking Architecture".   
 
With the cloud we are in the same situation today, just a layer or two higher up the stack. We have independent clouds that we would like to connect and work seamlessly together, preferably with the ease at which we currently connect nodes to a network and networks to the Internet. This technology seems to be called the  Intercloud : an interconnected global "cloud of  clouds " as apposed to the  Internet  which is a "network</p><p>5 0.64182979 <a title="470-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-25-GridGain%3A__One_Compute_Grid%2C_Many_Data_Grids.html">393 high scalability-2008-09-25-GridGain:  One Compute Grid, Many Data Grids</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GridGain   was kind enough to present at the September 17th instance of  the   Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group  . I've been curious about GridGain so I was glad to see them there. In short GridGain is:   an open source computational grid framework that enables Java developers to improve general performance of processing intensive applications by splitting and parallelizing the workload  . GridGain can also be thought of as a set of middleware primitives for building applications. GridGain's peer group of competitors includes GigaSpaces, Terracotta, Coherence, and Hadoop.     The speaker for GridGain was the President and Founder, Nikita Ivanov. He has a very pleasant down-to-earth way about him that contrasts nicely with a field given to religious discussions of complex taxomic definitions. Nikita first talked about cloud computing in general. He feels Java is the perfect gateway for cloud computing. Which is good because   GridGain only works with Java  .

<p>Introduction: Yes, I just got through watching the Superbowl so chips and salsa are on my mind and in my stomach. In recreational eating more chips requires downing more salsa. With mulitcore chips it turns out as cores go up salsa goes down, salsa obviously being a metaphor for speed.     Sandia National Laboratories found in their simulations:   a significant increase in speed going from two to four multicores, but an insignificant increase from four to eight multicores. Exceeding eight multicores causes a decrease in speed. Sixteen multicores perform barely as well as two, and after that, a steep decline is registered as more cores are added. The problem is the lack of memory bandwidth as well as contention between processors over the memory bus available to each processor.      The implication for those following a diagonal scaling strategy is to work like heck to make your system fit within eight multicores. After that you'll need to consider some sort of partitioning strategy.

<p>Introduction: Every day brings news of either more failures of the financial systems or out-right fraud, with the $50 billion Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme being the latest, breaking all records. This post provide a technical overview of a solution that was implemented for one of the largest banks in China. The solution illustrate how one can use Excel as a front end client and at the same time leverage cloud computing model and mapreduce as well as other patterns to scale-out risk calculations. I'm hoping that this type of approach will reduce the chances for seeing this type of fraud from happening in the future.</p><p>3 0.88977158 <a title="470-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-03-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Sep_3%2C_2010.html">893 high scalability-2010-09-03-Hot Scalability Links For Sep 3, 2010</a></p>

  lenidot : with 12 staff, @ tumblr  serves 1.5billion pageviews/month and 25,000 signups/day. Now that's scalability! 
  jmtan24 : Funny that whenever a high scalability article comes out, it always mention the shared nothing approach 
  mfeathers : When life gives you lemons, you can have decades-long conquest to convert lemons to oranges, or you can make lemonade. 
  OyvindIsene : Met an old man with mustache today, he had no opinion on  #noSQL . Note to myself: Don't grow a mustache, now or later.  
  vlad003 : Isn't it interesting how P2P distributes data while Cloud Computing centralizes it? And they're both said to be the future.

  9nm  : IBM's carbon nanotube transistor that outperforms silicon;  YouTube : 4 Billion Views/Day;  864GB RAM : 37signals Memcache,  $12K  
 Quotable Quotes:                 
 
  Chad Dickerson : You can only get growth by feeding opportunities. 
  @launchany : It amazes me how many NoSQL database vendors spend more time detailing their scalability and no time detailing the data model and design 
  Google : Let's make TCP faster. 
  WhatsApp : we are now able to easily push our systems to over 2 million tcp connections! 
  Sidney Dekker : In a complex system…doing the same thing twice will not predictably or necessarily lead to the same results. 
  @Rasmusfjord : Just heard about an Umbraco site running on Azure that handles 20.000 requests /*second*

I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.
  Those were the days our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to use the curse called “XDoclet”.  On the other side, our company grew steadily, our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of money.

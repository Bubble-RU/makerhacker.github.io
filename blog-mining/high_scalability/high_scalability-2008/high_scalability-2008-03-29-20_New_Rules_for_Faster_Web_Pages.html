<p>Introduction: Hi,First of all I want to to say that this is an extremely interesting and
informative website. i have enjoyed reading the various posts on how the big
sites scale to meet the needs of their customers.The service we are developing
is a webcam service. The client application sends images to the server via
HTTP POST and they are saved in folder specified by the users id. When a new
image is sent to the server it will overwrite the current image.Users can then
view the images via our web server.Ideally we want the images to upload as
quickly as possible and allow users to view them as quickly as possible.Would
I be correct to assume that when the number of uploading clients exceeds the
capability of the server the only way to scale is to add more hardware.Also I
assume that to use HTTP accelerator caches will not speed up viewing the
images as the new images will invalidate the cache.I appreciate any input on
the subject.</p><p>3 0.1633199 <a title="291-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-03-10_More_Rules_for_Even_Faster_Websites.html">506 high scalability-2009-02-03-10 More Rules for Even Faster Websites</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Cal Hendersonwrites at thinkvitamin.com: "With our so-called "Web 2.0'
applications and their rich content and interaction, we expect our
applications to increasingly make use of CSS and JavaScript. To make sure
these applications are nice and snappy to use, we need to optimize the size
and nature of content required to render the page, making sure we're
delivering the optimum experience. In practice, this means a combination of
making our content as small and fast to download as possible, while avoiding
unnecessarily refetching unmodified resources." A lot of good comments too.</p><p>5 0.15658796 <a title="291-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-25-Make_Your_Site_Run_10_Times_Faster.html">261 high scalability-2008-02-25-Make Your Site Run 10 Times Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is whatMike Peters says he can do: make your site run 10 times faster.
His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40
IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50
concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively
handling 500 concurrent connections per second with CPU at 8% and no
degradation in performance."Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:Database
write access (read is cheaper)Database read accessPHP, ASP, JSP and any other
server side scriptingClient side JavaScriptMultiple/Fat Images, scripts or css
files from different domains on your pageSlow keep-alive client connections,
clogging your available socketsMike's solutions:breakSwitch all database
writes to offline processingMinimize number of database read access to the
bare minimum. No more than two queries per page.Denormalize your database and

<p>Introduction: If you have a lot of static content to store and you aren't looking forward to
setting up and maintaining your own giganto SAN, maybe you can push off a lot
of the hard lifting to a CDN?Jesse Robbins at O'Reilly Radar posts that you
have a lot more options now because the number ofContent Distribution Networks
have doubled since last year. In fact, Dan Rayburn says there are now28
CDNproviders in the market. Hopefully you can find reasonable pricing at one
of them.Other than easing your burden, why might a CDN work for you? Because
it makes your site faster and customers like that. How can a CDN so
dramatically improve your site's performance?breakSteve Saunders, author
ofHigh Performance Web Sites: Essential Knowledge for Front-End Engineers, has
using a CDN has one of his "Thirteen Simple Rules for Speeding Up Your Web
Site."About CDNs Steve says:Remember that 80-90% of the end-user response time

<p>Introduction: Am I mad to consider using .Net2 and AJAX for a high-scalability application?
In case you wonder why, it's the legacy of a website built on IIS and .Net
1.1, and we're looking for ways to make the content more attractive and
interactive. In this case, it's a medical image library being shared by a few
Wikis and online coursework for medicalstudents ( < 15K users) and doctors ( <
150K users)But I'm worried about the performance overhead. We already have a
performance problem because of personalising the content for users according
to their type (student or doctor), and for doctors, their grade and
speciality.</p><p>6 0.65110332 <a title="291-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-14-Scaling_an_image_upload_service.html">319 high scalability-2008-05-14-Scaling an image upload service</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:Nice explanation inThe importance of bandwidth versus latencyof how
long latencies cause cascading delays in resource loading.Dolototries to
optimize how resources are loaded.Twenty new ruleshave been added to
theoriginal 14 rulesfor sizzling web performance. Part of scalability is
worrying about performance too. The front-end is where 80-90% of end-user
response time is spent and following these best practices improved the
performance of Yahoo! properties by 25-50%. The rules are divided into server,
content, cookie, JavaScript, CSS, images, and mobile categories. The new rules
are:Flush the buffer early [server]Use GET for AJAX requests [server]Post-load
components [content]Preload components [content]Reduce the number of DOM
elements [content]Split components across domains [content]Minimize the number
of iframes [content]No 404s [content]Reduce cookie size [cookie]Use cookie-
free domains for components [cookie]Minimize DOM access [javascript]Develop

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose
limits (GAE Quotas,Fotolog,Facebook) as a means of protecting a website
against service destroyingtraffic spikes. Twitter will reportedlylimit the
number followersto 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow
Twitter to make some bank bygoing freemiumand charging for adding more
followers.Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting
aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established
ecosystem?One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let
everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is,
however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are
will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service.
Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.Now in Twitter's
case the people with the most followers tend to be opinion leaderswho shape
much of the blognet echo</p><p>3 0.82877898 <a title="291-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise.html">287 high scalability-2008-03-24-Advertise</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.They're using a static server to
deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that
the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on
serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.I'm curious how other
people have dealt with this situation.Seperating into two different servers
would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the
premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created
in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>5 0.80086797 <a title="291-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-16-A_Short_on_the_Pinterest_Stack_for_Handling_3%2B_Million_Users.html">1193 high scalability-2012-02-16-A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling 3+ Million Users</a></p>

+ heavily-modified Django at the application layerTornado and (very
selectively) node.js as web-servers.  Memcached and membase / redis for
object- and logical-caching, respectively.  RabbitMQ as a message queue.
Nginx, HAproxy and Varnish for static-delivery and load-balancing.Persistent
data storage using MySQL.  MrJob on EMR for map-reduce.Git.Alex Popescu

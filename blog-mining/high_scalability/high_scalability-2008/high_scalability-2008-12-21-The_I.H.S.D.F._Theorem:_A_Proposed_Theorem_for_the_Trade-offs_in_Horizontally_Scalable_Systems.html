<p>Introduction: Brian Zimmer, architect at travel startup Yapta, highlights some worst practices jeopardizing the growth and scalability of a system:   * The Golden Hammer. Forcing a particular technology to work in ways it was not intended is sometimes counter-productive. Using a database to store key-value pairs is one example. Another example is using threads to program for concurrency.   * Resource Abuse. Manage the availability of shared resources because when they fail, by definition, their failure is experienced pervasively rather than in isolation. For example, connection management to the database through a thread pool.   * Big Ball of Mud. Failure to manage dependencies inhibits agility and scalability.   * Everything or Something. In both code and application dependency management, the worst practice is not understanding the relationships and formulating a model to facilitate their management. Failure to enforce diligent control is a contributing scalability inhibiter.   * Forgetting to che</p><p>4 0.079088919 <a title="474-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-28-How_to_Organize_a_Database_Table%E2%80%99s_Keys_for_Scalability.html">476 high scalability-2008-12-28-How to Organize a Database Table’s Keys for Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all shards.     There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys across a shard cluster. Each has its pro’s and con’s and the one chosen should be specific to the problems you’re trying to solve.</p><p>5 0.071999937 <a title="474-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-02-Total_Cost_of_Ownership_for_different_web_development_frameworks.html">338 high scalability-2008-06-02-Total Cost of Ownership for different web development frameworks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see how!     Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed in a format called   Alexandrian form which draws on constructs used by Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:     The pattern name   The problem the pattern is trying to solve     Context   Solution   Examples   Design rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why experts use it       Patterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context, and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next ‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied.

<p>Introduction: In many of the recent discussions on the design of large scale systems (a.k.a. Web Scale) it was argued that the right set of tradeoffs for building large scale systems would be to give away  C onsistency for  A vailability and  P artition tolerance. Those arguments relied on the foundation of the CAP theorem developed in early 2000-2002. One of the core principals behind the CAP theorem is that you must choose two out of the three CAP properties. In many of the transactional systems giving away consistency is either impossible or yields a huge complexity in the design of those systems. In this series of posts, I've tried to suggest a different set of tradeoffs in which we could achieve scalability without compromising on consistency. I also argued that rather than choosing only two out of the three CAP properties we could choose various degrees of all three. The degrees would be determined by the most likely availability and partition tolerance scenarios in our specific application.</p><p>4 0.70713377 <a title="474-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-16-EE-Appserver_Clustering_OR_Terracota_OR_Coherence_OR_something_else%3F.html">384 high scalability-2008-09-16-EE-Appserver Clustering OR Terracota OR Coherence OR something else?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     I am very glad that this site exists, as I have learned more about clustering on this site than for quite some time reading stuff elsewhere. Oftentimes, one can find lots of material about clustering, but the practical real-life information is missing. Not so wih this site.     I am currently planning the development of an application which has a lot of enterprise features and requirements. On the other side (if the tiny chance of success might strike us), this application would not be an in-house application of a financial institution, or something like that, but some kind of communit/web 2.0 web site. Thus it is an enterprise application with (hopefully, but surely unlikely) the user numbers of a social networking site. Each user initiated transaction involves huge resssources business logic wise (including insane amounts of encryption oprations).     Of course, I do not intend to induldge into premature scaling, but to invest every minute I have into the implementation of bu</p><p>5 0.70701945 <a title="474-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-22-Heterogeneous_vs._Homogeneous_System_Architectures.html">500 high scalability-2009-01-22-Heterogeneous vs. Homogeneous System Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I follow a certain philosophy when developing system architectures. I assume that very few systems will ever exist in a consistent form for more than a short period of time. What constitutes a “short period of time” differs depending on the specifics of each system, but in an effort to quantify it, I generally find that it falls somewhere between a week and a month.     The driving forces behind the need for an ever changing architecture are largely business requirement based. This is a side effect of the reality that software development, in most cases, is used as a supporting role within the business unit it serves. As business requirements (i.e. additional features, new products, etc.) pour forth, it is the developer’s job to evolve their software system to accommodate these requirements and provide a software based solution to whatever problems lay ahead.     Given that many businesses can be identified as having the above characteristics, I can now begin to explain why I believe t</p><p>6 0.6992622 <a title="474-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-08-Microservices_-_Not_a_free_lunch%21.html">1628 high scalability-2014-04-08-Microservices - Not a free lunch!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: James Hamilton in  Counting Servers is Hard  has an awesome breakdown of what  one million plus servers  really means in terms of resource usage. The summary from his calculations are eye popping:   
 
 Facilities: 15 to 30 large datacenters 
 Capital expense: $4.25 Billion 
 Total power: 300MW 
 Power Consumption: 2.6TWh annually 
 
  
The power consumption is about the same as  used by Nicaragua  and the capital cost is about a third of what Americans  spent on video games  in 2012. Now that's web scale.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.85448682 <a title="474-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-21-The_I.H.S.D.F._Theorem%3A_A_Proposed_Theorem_for_the_Trade-offs_in_Horizontally_Scalable_Systems.html">474 high scalability-2008-12-21-The I.H.S.D.F.

<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a “silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring situation.</p><p>3 0.75549132 <a title="474-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex_Architecture.html">258 high scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Anatomy of a crash in a new part of Yandex written in Django . Writing to a magic session variable caused an unexpected write into an InnoDB database on every request. Writes took 6-7 seconds because of index rebuilding. Lots of useful details on the sizing of their system, what went wrong, and how they fixed it.   Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their search index. We only know a few fun facts about how they do things, nothing at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:
   3.5 billion pages in the search index.    Over several thousand servers.    35 million searches a day.    Several data centers around Russia.    Two-layer architecture.    The database is split in pieces and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database servers and brings it together for the user.

<p>Introduction: In  It's Time for Low Latency   Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for program  architectures will be revolutionary .   Luiz André Barroso , Distinguished Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter into single computer.
 
 Abstract from the paper:
  

The operating systems community has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it will be up to us to ﬁnish</p><p>5 0.72358483 <a title="474-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-26-Product%3A_HyperGraphDB_-_A_Graph_Database.html">766 high scalability-2010-01-26-Product: HyperGraphDB - A Graph Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the success of  Neo4j  as a graph database in the NoSQL revolution, it's interesting to see another graph database,   HyperGraphDB , in the mix. Their quick blurb on HyperGraphDB says it is a:   general purpose, extensible, portable, distributed, embeddable, open-source data storage mechanism. It is a graph database designed specifically for artificial intelligence and semantic web projects, it can also be used as an embedded object-oriented database for projects of all sizes. 
 
From the  NoSQL Archive  the summary on HyperGraphDB is: API:  Java  (and Java Langs), Written in: Java ,  Query Method:  Java  or P2P, Replication:  P2P , Concurrency:  STM , Misc: Open-Source, Especially for AI and Semantic Web.
 
So it has some interesting features, like software transactional memory and     P2P   for data distribution  , but I found that my first and most obvious question was not answered: what the heck is a  hypergraph  and why do I care? Buried in the tutorial was:

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1 copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random server to serve the file as a temp fix...     It's a small video streaming service. I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's psuedo streaming, but it works.     I have been looking at MogileFS, which would solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar). However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth % usage?     Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>4 0.10215694 <a title="434-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability_vs_Performance_vs_Availability_vs_Reliability.._Also_scale_up_vs_scale_out_%3F%3F%3F.html">224 high scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability vs Performance vs Availability vs Reliability..

<p>Introduction: Searching around the HS website I noticed that there are no articles regarding db2, which has an express edition, free of charge and from what I know there aren't any restrictions.   Being a powerful database system I thought it could make be an alternative to MySQL, PostgreSQL databases.     Here is the IBM statement:   "DB2 Express Edition for Community (DB2 Express-C) is a no charge data server for use in development and deployment. DB2 Express-C supports a full range of APIs, drivers, and interfaces for application development including PHP, C/C++, and .NET. In addition, DB2 Express-C V9 contains advanced XML features. DB2 Express-C provides ISVs an ideal starting database server for Web, enterprise, and eBusiness applications.

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++ to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and platform independence (Java Bytecode). They may even have gotten better throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution, you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor. Why? Because of the unpredictable pauses introduced by the garbage collector which result in significant jitter (variance of execution time).      In this post Frederic Pariente  Engineering Manager at Sun Microsystems posted a summary of a case study on how the use of Sun Real Time JVM and  GigaSpaces was used in the context of of a customer proof-of-concept this summer to ensure   guaranteed latency per m</p><p>5 0.647672 <a title="434-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-03-5_Rockin%27_Tips_for_Scaling_PHP_to_30%2C000_Concurrent_Users_Per_Server.html">1486 high scalability-2013-07-03-5 Rockin' Tips for Scaling PHP to 30,000 Concurrent Users Per Server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block , CTO at  RockThePost.com , a crowdfunding company, has  written a nice set of tips  for smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a small two person development team. 
 
Their service has a typical small scale structure:
  
 PHP's Zend Framework 2 
 Two m1.medium for web servers 
 ELB to split the load 
 master/slave MySQL database 
 Siege for load testing 
  
The very sensible tips that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: 
  
  Use PHP's APC feature . APC is opcode cache that is " really a requirement in order for a website to have a chance at performing well."  
  Put everything that's not a .php request on a CDN . Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused them to serve directly from S3.

<p>Introduction: How do you evaluate and decide which web technologies (and there are myriads out there) to use for your new web application, which one potentially gives you the best performance, which one will likely give you the shortest time-to-market? The Apache incubator project   Olio   might help.     Olio is a is an open source web 2.0 toolkit to help evaluate the suitability, functionality and performance of web technologies. Olio defines an example web2.0 application (an events site somewhat like yahoo.com/upcoming) and provides three initial implementations : PHP, Java EE and RubyOnRails (ROR). The toolkit also defines ways to drive load against the application in order to measure performance.     Apache Olio could be used to     Understand how to use various web 2.0 technologies such as AJAX, memcached, mogileFS etc. Use the code in the application to understand the subtle complexities involved and how to get around issues with these technologies.

<p>Introduction: The story of driving the  golden spike  to symbolize the completion of the  transcontinental railroad  is famous in the US. What is not so well known is the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that possibly be?
  Telegraph as Internet  
First, let's establish the telegraph and cable systems was an early version of an Internet.
 
As railroad tracks were being laid a  transcontental telegraph  system was also being constructed. Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could ride.
 
With the  transalantic cable system  information could quickly span continents in minutes:
  

The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to 12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to 110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870, 40</p><p>4 0.83520925 <a title="434-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-16-The_VeriScale_Architecture_-_Elasticity_and_efficiency_for_private_clouds.html">706 high scalability-2009-09-16-The VeriScale Architecture - Elasticity and efficiency for private clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model, which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model, networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sunâ&euro;&trade;s VeriScale architecture provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures for more than a decade. The features of these architectures, such as elasticity, ar</p><p>5 0.80346876 <a title="434-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-01-Peecho_Architecture_-_scalability_on_a_shoestring.html">1090 high scalability-2011-08-01-Peecho Architecture - scalability on a shoestring</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Marcel Panse  and  Sander Nagtegaal  from  Peecho . 
 
Although architecture descriptions are an interesting read, the problems that start-ups face are hardly ever addressed. We would like to change that, so here is our architecture story.
  Introducing a start-up  
 
 
The Amsterdam-based company  Peecho  offers print-as-a-service. Our embeddable  print button  allows you to sell your digital content as professionally printed products, like photo books, magazines or canvases - straight from your own website. There is an API, too.
 
Printcloud is the system that powers the print button. It exists in the cloud only, growing when needed and becoming smaller if it can. The system takes in print orders, magically transforms tough data into print-ready files and routes the orders to the production facility that is closest to the intended recipient.
 
To preserve the environment, Peecho's philosophy is to facilitate global ordering, but to aim for local production on</p><p>6 0.79924577 <a title="434-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_9th%2C_2014.html">1645 high scalability-2014-05-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 9th, 2014</a></p>

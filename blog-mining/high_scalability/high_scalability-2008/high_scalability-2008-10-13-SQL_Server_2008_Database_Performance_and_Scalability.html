<p>Introduction: MySQL Expert Ronald Bradford explains how one key way to improve the scalability of a MySQL server, and undoubtedly nearly every other server, is to  eliminate unnecessary SQL , saying  the most efficient way to improve an SQL statement is to eliminate it :
  

The MySQL kernel can only physically process a certain number of SQL statements for a given time period (e.g. per second). Regardless of the type of machine you have, there is a physical limit. If you eliminate SQL statements that are unwarranted and unnecessary, you automatically enable more important SQL statements to run. There are numerous other downstream affects, however this is the simple math. To run more SQL, reduce the number of SQL you need to run.

  
Ronald shows how to use  mk-query-digest  to look at query execution times and determine which ones can be profitably whacked.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by     Frédéric Faure      (architect at    Ysance   ), you can follow him on    twitter   .  
 
Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it’s true that the marketing wave of NoSQL has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that’s been around for quite a while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all, everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very p</p><p>5 0.1437093 <a title="410-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-09-Lots_of_questions_for_high_scalability_-_high_availability.html">63 high scalability-2007-08-09-Lots of questions for high scalability - high availability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey,      I do have a website that I would like to scale. Right now we have 10 servers but this does not scale well.     I know how to deal with my apache web servers but have problems with sql servers.     I would like to use the "scale out" system and add servers when we need. We have over 100Gb of data for mysql and we tried to have around 20G per server. It works well except that if a server goes down then 1/5 of the user can't access the website. We could use replication but we would need to at least double sql servers to replicate each server. And maybe in the future it's not gonna be enough we would need maybe 3 slaves per master ... well I don't really like this idea.     I would prefer to have 8 servers that all deal with data from the 5 servers we have right now and then we could add new servers when we need. I looked at NFS but that does not seem to be a good idea for SQL servers ? Can you confirm?</p><p>6 0.13940644 <a title="410-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-17-Microsoft%27s_New_Database_Cloud_Ready_to_Rumble_with_Amazon.html">279 high scalability-2008-03-17-Microsoft's New Database Cloud Ready to Rumble with Amazon</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  this post  i wrote my view on the anti SQL database movement and where the alternative approach fits in:  - SQL databases are not going away anytime soon.  - The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.  - There is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions alongside traditional SQL databases.  In addition to the options that was mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative approach and how that fits into the puzzle.

<p>Introduction: Launched in 2001 by Microsoft, since then this platform is widely popular among organizations to increase the efficiency of their business and productive volume. As we all know the importance of communication mode in every organization and by keeping in the mind this fact, Microsoft SharePoint communicates over all barriers and spread the required information within a company.
 
Microsoft SharePoint is an ideal solution for companies who have multiple offices and staff members who are on the move. Using SharePoint, documents and other materials can be easily shared with both colleagues and managers. Other features include advanced document management, which allows users to virtually check out a document, modify it or just read it, then check in the document again. This allows managers/company owners to see exactly when their staff members are working and just what they are doing.

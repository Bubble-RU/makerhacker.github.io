[sent-42, score-0.443]
</p><p>2 Increased garbage collection latencies make Java less useful for application that use heart beats, make real-time trades, etc. [sent-44, score-0.351]
</p><p>3 Real Time Java API extensions were developed as a way of addressing garbage collection problems. [sent-45, score-0.266]
</p><p>4 Greg Frank weighs in with some excellent points:Java language itself has nothing to do with scalability. [sent-46, score-0.164]
</p><p>5 Ron's comments about garbage collection don't apply to post 1. [sent-47, score-0.168]
</p><p>6 The true force pushing scalability is the java community itself. [sent-51, score-0.562]
</p><p>7 Java is merely a convenient and commonly spoken language that allows for the formation of a global community. [sent-52, score-0.164]
</p><p>8 We should stop debating language internals and start debating sophisticated design patterns that promote scalability. [sent-53, score-0.302]
</p><p>9 Scalability was increased along a number of dimensions (quoted from their article):Thread count: Initially the application was artificially limiting the number of threads that were allowed to execute. [sent-87, score-0.242]
</p><p>10 Memory locks: When many threads access the same piece of memory, traditional systems force developers to serialize the threads to make sure two threads do not simultaneously change the same memory location (similar to how airlines make sure the same seat is not assigned to two different people. [sent-89, score-0.479]
</p><p>11 The removal of two such "hot locks" and a further increase in the number of threads and heap size achieved a new peak of 115,000 OPS. [sent-91, score-0.193]
</p><p>12 X10 is also:A type-safe, modern, parallel, distributed object-oriented language intended to be very easily accessible to Java(TM) programmers. [sent-101, score-0.164]
</p><p>13 STM may not turn out to be the savior of the multi-core world, but Clojure explores some very new Java territory:Clojure is a dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine. [sent-120, score-0.278]
</p><p>14 It is designed to be a general-purpose language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. [sent-121, score-0.212]
</p><p>15 Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. [sent-122, score-0.164]
</p><p>16 When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs. [sent-127, score-0.168]
</p><p>17 Clojure's use of Java threads makes latency difficult to control. [sent-133, score-0.159]
</p><p>18 And I'm not sure a S-expression based language can ever become popular. [sent-134, score-0.164]
</p><p>19 We've seen how the excesses of old J2EE scalability failures can be routed around with ease using a number of different scalability patterns. [sent-210, score-0.209]
</p><p>20 by Keith AdamsFortress- Fortress is a new programming language designed for high-performance computing (HPC) with high programmability. [sent-224, score-0.228]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,EhcacheTerracotta Inc.Note:
this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are
still generally valid and useful.The legendary Moore's Law, which states that
the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every two years, has held true since 1965. It
follows that integrated circuits will continue to get smaller, with chip
fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm process (1). Users of big iron
hardware, or servers that are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity,
benefit from this trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful
over time. At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum
mechanics will preclude further density increases.At the same time, low-cost
commodity hardware influences enterprise architects to scale their
applications horizontally, where processing is spread across clusters of low-
cost commodity serv</p><p>3 0.2546984 <a title="459-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-11-Using_Node.js_PayPal_Doubles_RPS%2C_Lowers_Latency%2C_with_Fewer_Developers%2C_but_Where_Do_the_Improvements_Really_Come_From%3F.html">1563 high scalability-2013-12-11-Using Node.js PayPal Doubles RPS, Lowers Latency, with Fewer Developers, but Where Do the Improvements Really Come From?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++
to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development
productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and

throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and
application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking
applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution,
you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,EhcacheTerracotta Inc.Note:
this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are
still generally valid and useful.The legendary Moore's Law, which states that
the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every two years, has held true since 1965. It
follows that integrated circuits will continue to get smaller, with chip
fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm process (1). Users of big iron
hardware, or servers that are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity,
benefit from this trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful
over time. At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum
mechanics will preclude further density increases.At the same time, low-cost
commodity hardware influences enterprise architects to scale their
applications horizontally, where processing is spread across clusters of low-
cost commodity serv</p><p>6 0.77621919 <a title="459-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay_history_and_architecture.html">550 high scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay history and architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: OK, thisinterview is with meon Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger
idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java
World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them
:-)The interview went an interesting direction, but there's more I'd like add
and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have
popped out at me:Java - It's the platform stupid. Java the language isn't the
big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM,
libraries, and toolsets.Java - It's the community stupid. A lot of creativity
is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability
challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing
Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.The fecundity of
the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our
multi-core future. There's a multi-core crisis going in case you haven't
heard. It's all you'll</p><p>3 0.95876414 <a title="459-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_29%2C_2013.html">1431 high scalability-2013-03-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 29, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My impression of DynamoDB before attending aAmazon DynamoDB for Developerstalk
is that it's the usual quality service produced by Amazon: simple, fast,
scalable, geographically redundant, expensive enough to make you think twice
about using it, and delightfully NoOp.After the talk my impression has become
more nuanced. The quality impression still stands. Look at theforumsand you'll
see the typical issues every product has, but no real surprises. And as a
SimpleDB++, DynamoDB seems to have avoided second system syndrome and produced
a more elegant design.What was surprising is how un-cloudy DynamoDB appears to
be. The cloud pillars of pay for what you use and quick elastic response to
bursty traffic have been abandoned, for some understandable reasons, but the
result is you really have to consider your use cases before making DynamoDB
the default choice.Here are some of my impressions from the talk...DynamoDB is

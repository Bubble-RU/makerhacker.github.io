<p>Introduction: Mollomis one of those cool SaaS companies every developer dreams of creating
when they wrack their brains looking for a viable software-as-a-service
startup. Mollom profitably runs a useful service--spam filtering--with a small
group of geographically distributed developers. Mollom helps protect nearly
40,000 websites from spam, includingone of mine, which is where I first
learned about Mollom. In a desperate attempt to stop spam on a Drupal site,
where every other form of CAPTCHA had failed miserably, I installed Mollom in
about 10 minutes and it immediately started working. That's the out of the box
experience I was looking for.From the time Mollom opened its digital
inspection system they've rejected over 373 million spams and in the process
they've learned that a stunning 90% of all messages are spam. This spam
torrent is handled by only two geographically distributed machines that handle
100 requests/ second, each running a Java application server and Cassandra. So

<p>Introduction: Update:A fun exploration of applied searching inHow to search for the word
"pen1s" in 185 emails every second. When indexOf doesn't cut it you just trie
harder.Has a drunken friend ever inspired you to create a first of its kind
internet service that is loved by millions, deemed subversive by thousands,
all while handling over 1.2 billion emails a year on onerickityold server?
That's how Paul Tyma came to build Mailinator.Mailinator is a free no-setup
web service for thwarting evil spammers by creating throw-away registration
email addresses. If you don't give web sites you real email address they can't
spam you. They spam Mailinator instead :-)I love design with a point-of-view
and Mailinator has a big giant harry one: performance first, second, and last.
Why? Because Mailinator is free and that allows Paul to showcase his different
perspective on design. While competitors buy big Iron to handle load, Paul
uses a big idea instead: pick the right problem and create a design to fit the</p><p>4 0.12197119 <a title="478-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-17-Scaling_Spam_Eradication_Using_Purposeful_Games%3A_Die_Spammer_Die%21.html">422 high scalability-2008-10-17-Scaling Spam Eradication Using Purposeful Games: Die Spammer Die!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to
dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change.
What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's
link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better
yesterday and a better tomorrow.CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make
CAPTCHA work (Spammers Choose GMail). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't
really work because CAPTCHA solving markets (Inside India's CAPTCHA solving
economy) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken
CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game
over :-)Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the
CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is
with humans.Using Games to Get Humans to Do Work (like CAPTCHA) for FreeHow do
we harness the power of humans to do battle with the CAPTCHA solving networ</p><p>5 0.10723116 <a title="478-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A conjunction of a few new technologies may trigger disruptive changes in the
future. This observation was prompted by a talkSteve Perlmangave at the
Columbia Engineering School: Benjamin Button, Cloud Everything and Why
Shannon's Law Isn't. In it he covers a set of technologies that at first may
seem unrelated, but turn out to be deeply related after all, culminating in a
realization of the long talked about vision of an application utility, where
all applications are hosted and run out of the cloud. First Perlman talks
about the realistic human rendering technology developed at Rearden, his
research incubator company. This technology was developed over many years and
is the secret behind the wonderful effects found in movies likeBenjamin
Button. It is now being used in many other films, and promises to
revolutionize film making, possibly even replacing actors with computers, in
real-time.The next invention at Rearden isOnLive, a cloud based gaming

<p>Introduction: What's cool about starting a new project is you finally have a chance to do it
right. You of course eventually mess everything up in your own way, but for
that one moment the world has a perfect order, a rightness that feels
satisfying and good. Arne Claassen, the CTO of notify.me, a brand new real
time notification delivery service, is in this honeymoon period now.Arne has
been gracious enough to share with us his philosophy of how to build a
notification service. I think you'll find it fascinating because Arne goes
into a lot of useful detail about how his system works.His main design
philosophy is to minimize the bottlenecks that form around synchronous access,
that is whensome resource is requested and the requestor ties up more
resources, waiting for a response. If the requested resource can't be
delivered in a timely manner, more and more requests pile up until the server
can't accept any new ones. Nobody gets what they want and you have an outage.

<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing.
Specifically the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group(IPNSIG
).Ansible-likefaster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical
warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning
telegraph system.It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more
interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that
was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances
and with muchlonger delays:The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also
called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a
set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2]
Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances,
so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to
large delays and errors.[2] While the In</p><p>6 0.69407177 <a title="478-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-02-RFC_1925_-_The_Twelve_%28Timeless%29_Networking_Truths.html">1526 high scalability-2013-10-02-RFC 1925 - The Twelve (Timeless) Networking Truths</a></p>

I know. If you've ever wanted to write an article for HighScalability, this
would be a great time :-) I especially need help on writingStuff the Internet

<p>Introduction: I found the discussion of the available bandwidth of tree vs higher
dimensional virtual networks topologies quite, to quote Spock,fascinating:A
mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developersof
Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that
theGnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,
theNapster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network
isseverely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a
millionpeers. In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have
overlooked theintrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the
Gnutella network:a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the
definition).Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher
dimensionaltopologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of
interconnectiontopologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware
implementations(see, e.g., Culler et al. 1996; Buyya 1999</p><p>same-blog 4 0.88030344 <a title="478-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-29-Paper%3A_Spamalytics%3A_An_Empirical_Analysisof_Spam_Marketing_Conversion.html">478 high scalability-2008-12-29-Paper: Spamalytics: An Empirical Analysisof Spam Marketing Conversion</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy thatthe best method to analyse spam is to become a
spammer, this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely
researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part
Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that
their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they
figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales
they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.Two different spam campaigns were
run on aStormbotnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-
peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide
computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit
new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to
download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the
executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon. The
downloaded compone</p><p>5 0.8369233 <a title="478-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-23-Working_With_Large_Data_Sets.html">907 high scalability-2010-09-23-Working With Large Data Sets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my blogpostWorking With Large Data Sets...For the past
18 months I've moved from working on the SMTP proxy to working on our other
systems, all of which make use of the data we collect from each connection.
It's a fair amount of data and it can be up to 2Kb in size for each
connection. Our servers receive approximately 1000 of these pieces of data per
second, which is fairly sustained due to our global distribution of customers.
If you compare that toTwitter's peak of 3,283 tweets per second (maximum of
140 characters), you can see it's not a small amount of data that we are
dealing with here.I recently set out to scientifically prove the benefits of
throttling, which is our technology for slowing down connections in order to
detect spambots, who are kind enough to disconnect quite quickly when they see
a slow connection. Due to the nature of the data we had, I needed to work with
a long range of data to show evidence that an IP that appeared on Spamhaus had

<p>Introduction: All,     I'm just new to this and have a basic understanding how CDN works? My questions are:     1. How does CDN sync data with web servers for video/images? If I have a user to upload a video to my site, will it get stored directly in CDN or it comes to my webserver first and then sync-ed with cache server?     2. How to have only the dynamic video/image delivered through CDN while the rest is served by a webserver?   3. How sync happens and who pays for the bandwidth for sync?       I'd appreciate if someone could explain this.

<p>Introduction: Hello highscalability world. I just discovered this site yesterday in a search for a scalability resource and was very pleased to find such useful information. I have some questions regarding distributed caching that I was hoping the scalability intelligentsia trafficking this forum could answer. I apologize for my lack of technical knowledge; I'm hoping this site will increase said knowledge! Feel free to answer all or as much as you want. Thank you in advance for your responses and thank you for a great resource!     1.) What are the standard benchmarks used to measure the performance of memcached or mySQL/memcached working together (from web 2.0 companies etc)?     2.) The little research I've conducted on this site suggests that most web 2.0 companies use a combination of mySQL and a hacked memcached (and potentially sharding). Does anyone know if any of these companies use an enterprise vendor for their distributed caching layer? (At this point in time I've only heard of Jive soft</p><p>6 0.098019034 <a title="226-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-04-Streaming_Video_on_Amazon_EC2%3F.html">239 high scalability-2008-02-04-Streaming Video on Amazon EC2?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We're looking to implement a framework to do Dependency Injection and AOP for a new solution we're working on.  It will likely get hit pretty hard, so we'd like to chose a framework that's proven to scale well, and operates well under pressure.  Right now, we're looking closely at Spring.NET, Castle Project's Windsor framework, and Unity.

<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple (any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and how you resolved it?

The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers. I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.     Could anyone share their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube etc..?     Thank you,   Regards,   Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>3 0.97114354 <a title="226-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-UK_Based_CDN.html">324 high scalability-2008-05-19-UK Based CDN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,    I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK.  If they're outside the UK but have decent support then also include.  The service must be cheap and not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?     Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space.  Would S3 be a good starting point?  What is the service like?  I hear mixed reviews about it.     Many thanks,   Jim</p><p>4 0.96435845 <a title="226-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the application that will become critical over time.</p><p>5 0.94740778 <a title="226-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

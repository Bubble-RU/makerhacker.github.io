<p>Introduction: I was looking at the pingdom infrastructure matrix (http://royal.pingdom.com/royalfiles/0702_infrastructure_matrix.pdf) and I saw that no sites are using Postgresql, and then I searched through highscalability.com and saw very few mentions of postgresql. Are there any examples of high-traffic sites that use postgresql? Does anyone have any experience with it?

The study was just released to the public and it was conducted by Ric Sheves from Water & Stone web development company.     At 50 pages, there is a significant amount of data in this study that should be of use to developers or to anyone who is looking to commit to a web publishing system (also known as a Content Management System).

<p>Introduction: All,     I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers. I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.     Could anyone share their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube etc..?

<p>Introduction: We're looking to implement a framework to do Dependency Injection and AOP for a new solution we're working on.  It will likely get hit pretty hard, so we'd like to chose a framework that's proven to scale well, and operates well under pressure.  Right now, we're looking closely at Spring.NET, Castle Project's Windsor framework, and Unity.  Does anyone have any feedback on implementing any of these in large, high traffic environments?</p><p>4 0.5683319 <a title="338-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-07-Paper%3A_Architecture_of_a_Highly_Scalable_NIO-Based_Server.html">113 high scalability-2007-10-07-Paper: Architecture of a Highly Scalable NIO-Based Server</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple (any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and how you resolved it?

<p>Introduction: 3PAR Remote Copy  is a uniquely simple and efficient replication technology that allows customers to protect and share any application data affordably. Built upon 3PAR Thin Copy technology, Remote Copy lowers the total cost of storage by addressing the cost and complexity of remote replication.  Common Uses of 3PAR Remote Copy:  Affordable Disaster Recovery: Mirror data cost-effectively across town or across the world.  Centralized Archive: Replicate data from multiple 3PAR InServs located in multiple data centers to a centralized data archive location.  Resilient Pod Architecture: Mutually replicate tier 1 or 2 data to tier 3 capacity between two InServs (application pods).  Remote Data Access: Replicate data to a remote location for sharing of data with remote users.</p><p>3 0.72117174 <a title="338-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-05-Paper%3A_Scalability_Design_Patterns.html">402 high scalability-2008-10-05-Paper: Scalability Design Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have introduced pattern languages in my earlier post on  The Pattern Bible for Distributed Computing .  Achieving highest possible scalability is a complex combination of many factors. This PLoP 2007  paper  presents a pattern language that can be used to make a system highly scalable.  The Scalability Pattern Language introduced by Kanwardeep Singh Ahluwalia includes patterns to:
  
 Introduce Scalability 
 
 Optimize Algorithm 
 
 Add Hardware 
 
 Add Parallelism 
 
 Add Intra-Process Parallelism 
 Add Inter-Porcess Parallelism 
 Add Hybrid Parallelism 
 
 
 
 Optimize Decentralization 
 
 Control Shared Resources

<p>Introduction: If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will. --  Steve Jobs   
 
       
 
 
America as the New World has a long history of inspiring  Utopian communities . Early experiments were famously religious. But there have been many others as new waves of thought have inspired people to organize and try something different.
 
In the 1840s Transcendentalists, believing the true path lay in the perfection of the individual, created intentional communities like  Brook Farm . We've also seen  socialist ,  anarchist ,  hippy , and virtually every other kind of Utopia in-between. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote an infamous book,  Walden Two , with a more "scientific" take on creating a Utopian community and Ayn Rand in  Atlas Shrugged  had her free market version.
 
I believe in startup organizations we see the modern version of Utopian energy in action. We now call it by names like "culture hacking", but the goal is the same: to create a new form of human community to achieve a profound go</p><p>5 0.66252089 <a title="338-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-07-It%27s_a_VM_Wasteland_-_A_Near_Optimal_Packing_of_VMs_to_Machines_Reduces_TCO_by_22%25.html">1419 high scalability-2013-03-07-It's a VM Wasteland - A Near Optimal Packing of VMs to Machines Reduces TCO by 22%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation  we learn some shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):
  
  Average server utilization in many data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.  
 Surely that's just for old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade. 
  
It's a VM wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same server.
 
It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithm</p><p>6 0.66152906 <a title="338-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-17-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_17%2C_2010.html">860 high scalability-2010-07-17-Hot Scalability Links for July 17, 2010</a></p>

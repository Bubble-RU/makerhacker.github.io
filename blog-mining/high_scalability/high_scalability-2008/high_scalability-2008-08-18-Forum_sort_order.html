<p>Introduction: I'm moving this from the forum section to the front page. Just FYI, any
registered user can Submit a Link to this blog. You don't have to use the
forums.In The Architectures You've Always Wondered About track at the Qcon
conference, Second Life, eBay, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Orbitz presented how they
dealt with different aspects of their applications, such as scalability. There
were quite a few lessons that I learned that day that I thought were worth
sharing.</p><p>4 0.10866807 <a title="370-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability_has_Moved_to_Squarespace.com%21_.html">714 high scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability has Moved to Squarespace.com! </a></p>
<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting
HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting
services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary.
Thanks for the thought though.It's been a long long long process. Importing a
largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like
dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the
site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm
betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things.I'll
explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia
that needs to be handled to make the move complete:If you have a user account
and have posted on HighScalability before then you have a user account, but
since I don't know your passwords I had to make new passwords up for you. So

<p>Introduction: I have some experience with a very large OLTP system that is 7+ TB in size and
performs very well for 30K+ concurrent users. It is built using Intersystems
Cache based on the very old but very scalable MUMPS platform. Why don't I see
more discussions about archiectures such as these in this forum? I am curious

<p>Introduction: It's being reportedYahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion. You may
recallInstagram was profiled on HighScalabilityand they were also bought by
Facebook for a ton of money. A coincidence? You be the judge.Just what is
Yahoo buying? The business acumen of the deal is not something I can judge,
but if you are doing due diligence on the technology then Tumblr would
probably get a big thumbs up. To see why, please keep on reading...With over
15 billion page views a month Tumblr has become an insanely popular blogging
platform. Users may like Tumblr for its simplicity, its beauty, its strong
focus on user experience, or its friendly and engaged community, but like it
they do.Growing at over 30% a month has not been without challenges. Some
reliability problems among them. It helps to realize that Tumblr operates at
surprisingly huge scales: 500 million page views a day, a peak rate of ~40k
requests per second, ~3TB of new data to store a day, all running on 1000+
servers.One of the common patt</p><p>5 0.5376054 <a title="370-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-Should_Twitter_be_an_All-You-Can-Eat_Buffet_or_a_Vending_Machine%3F.html">330 high scalability-2008-05-27-Should Twitter be an All-You-Can-Eat Buffet or a Vending Machine?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Om proposes one solution to theTwitter Problemis tolimit followersto three
square meals a day. The reasonable idea being that lower limits should mean
fewer scaling problems. And as a kicker raising those limits is a good way to
raise much needed revenue.Scoble thinks users shouldconsume without limitand
will drive to another buffet if all-you-can-eat privileges are revoked. The
reasonable idea being that if an internet service can't solve internet scale
problems then there's not much use for it.Dave sayscomp power users a top
floor suiteand shower them with free passes to the buffet. Let the good times
roll! The reasonable idea being that power users help create popular
restaurants, er, services in the first place and limiting them starves users
and starved users won't come back.So, should web services like Twitter be a
buffet, a fixed eight course fine dining experience, a small plate restaurant,
a family style joint, or a vending machine? Or something else entirely?In a

<p>Introduction: G'day,I noticed the default sort order for the forum is to show the posts with
the most replies first. That seems a bit odd for a forum. Would it not make
sense to show the posts with the most recently replies first?It is possible to
re-sort the forum threads that way by clicking on the "Last post" header
(twice). It would seem like a more sensible default.I've checked and I see the
same behaviour as both a registered (logged in) and anonymous user.Cheers

<p>Introduction: A lot of sites hosted in San Francisco are down because of at least 6 back-to-
back power outages power outages. More details atlaughingsquid.breakSites like
SecondLife, Craigstlist, Technorati, Yelp and all Six Apart properties,
TypePad, LiveJournal and Vox are all down. The cause was an underground
explosion in a transformer vault under a manhole at 560 Mission Street. Flames
shot 6 feet out from the manhole cover. Over PG&E; 30,000 customers are without
power.What's perplexing is the UPS backup and diesel generators didn't kick in
to bring the datacenter back on line. I've never toured that datacenter, but
they usually have massive backup systems. It's probably one of those multiple
simultaneous failure situations that you hope never happen in real life, but
too often do. Or maybe the infrastructure wasn't rolled out completely.Update:
the cause was a cascade of failures in a tightly couples system that could
never happen :-) Details atFailure Happens: A summary of the power outage a</p><p>4 0.56497037 <a title="370-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-24-Strategy%3A_Eliminate_Unnecessary_SQL.html">995 high scalability-2011-02-24-Strategy: Eliminate Unnecessary SQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: MySQL Expert Ronald Bradford explains how one key way to improve the
scalability of a MySQL server, and undoubtedly nearly every other server, is
toeliminate unnecessary SQL, saying the most efficient way to improve an SQL
statement is to eliminate it:The MySQL kernel can only physically process a
certain number of SQL statements for a given time period (e.g. per second).
Regardless of the type of machine you have, there is a physical limit. If you
eliminate SQL statements that are unwarranted and unnecessary, you
automatically enable more important SQL statements to run. There are numerous
other downstream affects, however this is the simple math. To run more SQL,
reduce the number of SQL you need to run.Ronald shows how to use mk-query-
digest to look at query execution times and determine which ones can be
profitably whacked. Related ArticlesQuora:What are the best methods for

<p>Introduction: Amazon has a very will written account of their 8/8/2011 downtime:Summary of
the Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon RDS Service Event in the EU West
Region. Power failed, backup generators failed to kick in, there weren't
enough resources for EBS volumes to recover, API servers where overwhelmed, a
DNS failure caused failovers to alternate availability zones to fail, a double
fault occurred as the power event interrupted the repair of a different bug.
All kind of typical stuff that just seems to happen.Considering the previous
outage, the big question for programmers is: what does this mean? What does it
mean for how systems should be structured? Have we learned something that
can't be unlearned?The Amazon post has lots of good insights into how EBS and
RDS work, plus lessons learned. The short of the problem is large + complex =
high probability of failure. The immediate fixes are adding more resources,
more redundancy, more isolation between components, more automation, reduce

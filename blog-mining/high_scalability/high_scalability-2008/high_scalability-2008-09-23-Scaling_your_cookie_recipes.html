<p>Introduction: This is a guest post fromPer Buer, founder and CEO of Varnish Software,
provider of Varnish Cache, an open source web application accelerator freely
available at varnish-cache.org. Varnish powers a lot of really big websites
worldwide.We at Varnish Software are all about speed. Varnish Cache is built
for speed. It executes its policy code more or less a thousand times faster
than your typical Java or PHP based application servers, mostly due to the
fact that the configuration is compiled into system call free machine
code.System calls require expensive context switches, stall the CPU and wreck
havoc in the CPU cache so avoiding them makes the code fly. There are strong
limitations on what kind of logic you can move into Varnish Cache, but the
logic that you do move there will run very fast.An example is using Varnish
for access control to serve access controlled content from the caching edge
layer.The Varnish PaywallWho gets to access your content? In a traditional

<p>Introduction: This a guest post byRajkumar Iyer, a Member of Technical Staff at
Aerospike.About a year ago, Aerospike embarked upon a quest to increase in-
memory database performance - 1 Million TPS on a single inexpensive commodity
server. NoSQL has the reputation of speed, and we saw great benefit from
improving latency and throughput of cacheless architectures. At that time, we
took a version of Aerospike delivering about 200K TPS, improved a few things -
performance went to 500k TPS - and published the Aerospike 2.0 Community
Edition. We then used kernel tuning techniques and published therecipefor how
we achieved 1 M TPS on $5k of hardware.This year we continued the quest. Our
goal was to achieve 1 Million database transactions per second per server;
more than doubling previous performance. This compares to Cassandra's boast of
1M TPS on over 300 servers in Google Compute Engine - at a cost of $2 million
dollars per year. Weachieved thiswithout kernel tuning. This article describes

<p>Introduction: Update:Arjenlinks to videoSupporting Scalable Online Statistical
Processingwhich shows"rather than doing complete aggregates, use statistical
sampling to provide a reasonable estimate (unbiased guess) of the result."When
you have a lot of data,samplingallows you to draw conclusions from a much
smaller amount of data. That's why sampling is a scalability solution. If you
don't have to process all your data to get the information you need then
you've made the problem smaller and you'll need fewer resources and you'll get
more timely results.breakSampling is not useful when you need a complete list
that matches a specific criteria. If you need to know the exact set of people
who bought a car in the last week then sampling won't help.But, if you want to
know many people bought a car then you could take a sample and then create
estimate of the full data-set. The difference is you won't really know the
exact car count. You'll have a confidence interval saying how confident you

an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of

<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsayis a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on
software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant,
but it applies to software development too.You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on
one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying
to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show
Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few
heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant
owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is
there to help.If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay
is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say"
means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses,
belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he
does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence at

normative rules of an idealized world in algorithms. Second those algorithms
help enforce those expectations by nudging humans in to acting accordingly. A
fun example is the story of Ed Bolian's Record-Breaking Drive. Ed raced from
New York to L.A. at speeds of up to 158 mph, "breaking countless laws - and
the previous record, by more than two hours." His approach is one that any
nerd would love. He had three radar detectors, two laser jammers, two nav
systems, a CB radio, a scanner, two iPhones and two iPads running applications
like Waze, lookouts in the back seat scanning for cops, and someone scouting
ahead. Awesome! For the moral of the story, they were going so fast Ed said

<p>Introduction: The ever amazingslime moldis not the only way to solve complex compute
problems without performing calculations. There is another:soap film.
Unfortunately for soap film it isn't nearly as photogenic as slime mold, all
we get are boring looking pictures, but the underlying idea is still
fascinating and ten times less spooky.As a quick introduction we'll lean on
Long Ouyang, who has really straightforward  explanation of how soap film
works inApproaching P=NP: Can Soap Bubbles Solve The Steiner Tree Problem In
Polynomial.It's computers, so playing the role of the motivating graph problem
we have theSteiner tree problem, which Ouyang explains as:Find the minimum
spanning tree for a bunch of vertices, given that you can add additional
points.Soap helps solve this problem because:Soap, in water, acts a
surfactant, which decreases the surface tension in water.This acts to minimize
the surface energy of the liquid.This should minimize surface area (graph
weight), and solve the problem.Dip two</p><p>2 0.89312196 <a title="390-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-13-High_Performance_Web_Pages_%E2%80%93_Real_World_Examples%3A_Netflix_Case_Study.html">566 high scalability-2009-04-13-High Performance Web Pages – Real World Examples: Netflix Case Study</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word
alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and
the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world
is:the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more
dough for many more cookies. It’s the difference between making enough dough
in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.Hey, pretty close to
the website notion. Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be
tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed
to do (quoted from the article):Be Patient- When making large batches of
cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.Use
Fresh Ingredients- This is always an important thing to keep in mind.Don’t use
as much leavening- When you’re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember
to scale down the amount of baking powder that you use.Watch the spice- As a

<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund put together an excellent list of four general scalability
patterns and four subpatterns in his postScalability patterns and an
interesting story:Load distribution- Spread the system load across multiple
processing unitsLoad balancing / load sharing- Spreading the load across many
components with equal properties for handling the requestPartitioning-
Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to
a component that owns that data specificVertical partitioning- Spreading the
load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions
being handled by different processing unitsHorizontal partitioning- Spreading
a single type of data element across many instances, according to some
partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation,
etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.Queuing and batch \- Achieve
efficiencies of scale by processing batches of data, usually because the
overhead of an operation is am</p><p>6 0.66180074 <a title="390-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-01-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_April_1%2C_2010.html">802 high scalability-2010-04-01-Hot Scalability Links for April 1, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,EhcacheTerracotta Inc.Note:
this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are
still generally valid and useful.The legendary Moore's Law, which states that
the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every two years, has held true since 1965. It
follows that integrated circuits will continue to get smaller, with chip
fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm process (1). Users of big iron
hardware, or servers that are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity,
benefit from this trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful
over time. At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum
mechanics will preclude further density increases.At the same time, low-cost
commodity hardware influences enterprise architects to scale their
applications horizontally, where processing is spread across clusters of low-
cost commodity serv</p><p>4 0.17887495 <a title="359-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-04-A_Bunch_of_Great_Strategies_for_Using_Memcached_and_MySQL_Better_Together.html">360 high scalability-2008-08-04-A Bunch of Great Strategies for Using Memcached and MySQL Better Together</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've
developed a soph</p><p>5 0.16148674 <a title="359-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-26-Golden_rule_of_web_caching.html">194 high scalability-2007-12-26-Golden rule of web caching</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a paper delivered at HotCloud '12 by a group from CMU and Intel Labs,
Saving Cash by Using Less Cache (slides,  pdf), they show it may be possible
to use less DRAM under low load conditions to save on operational costs. There
are some issues with this idea, but in a give me more cache era, it could be
an interesting source of cost savings for your product. Caching is used
to:Reduce load on the database.Reduce latency.Problem:RAM in the cloud is
quite expensive. A third of costs can come from the caching tier.Solution:
Shrink your cache when the load is lower. Their work shows when the load drops
below a certain point you can throw away 50% of your cache while still
maintaining performance.A few popular items often account for most of your
hits, implying can remove the cache for the long tail. Use two tiers of
servers, the Retiring Group, which is the group of servers you want to get rid
of. The Primary Group is the group of servers you are keeping. A cache request
goes to both serve</p><p>3 0.85160482 <a title="359-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-05-Product%3A_Tugela_Cache.html">174 high scalability-2007-12-05-Product: Tugela Cache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tugela Cacheis a cache system like memecached, but instead of storing data
just in RAM, it stores data in the file system using a b-tree. You trade
latency in order to have a very large cache. It's useful for sites that have
caching requirements that exceed their available memory. It uses the same wire
protocol asmemcachedso it can be dropped in without a hassle. From the
website:As large MediaWiki deployments may gain performance using Memcached,
at some level cost of RAM to store all objects becomes too high. In order to
balance resource usage and make more use of our Apache server disks, Tugela,
the distributed cached on-disk hash database, has arrived.Tugela Cache is
derived from Memcached. Much of the code remains the same, but notably, these
changes:Internal slab allocator replaced by BerkeleyDB B-Tree database.Expiry
policy management moved to external program tugela-expireMuch statistics code
made obsolete.An interesting point brought up in the comments is using

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>5 0.83075899 <a title="359-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy%3A_Break_Up_the_Memcache_Dog_Pile_.html">673 high scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy: Break Up the Memcache Dog Pile </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog
PileEffectinDog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails. Glenn
Franxman also has a Django solution inMintCache.Data is usually cached because
it's too expensive to calculate for every hit. Maybe it's a gnarly SQL query

<p>Introduction: Ehcacheis a pure Java cache with the following features: fast, simple, small
foot print, minimal dependencies, provides memory and disk stores for
scalability into gigabytes, scalable to hundreds of cachesis a pluggable cache
for Hibernate, tuned for high concurrent load on large multi-cpu servers,
provides LRU, LFU and FIFO cache eviction policies, and is production tested.
Ehcache is used byLinkedInto cache member profiles. The user guide says it's
possible to get at 2.5 times system speedup for persistent Object Relational
Caching, a 1000 times system speedup for Web Page Caching, and a 1.6 times
system speedup Web Page Fragment Caching.From the
website:breakIntroductionEhcache is a cache library. Before getting into
ehcache, it is worth stepping back and thinking about caching generally.About
CachesWiktionary defines a cache as A store of things that will be required in
future, and can be retrieved rapidly . That is the nub of it.In computer

<p>Introduction: Scientists are doing it for themselves. Doing what? Databases. The idea is
that most databases are designed to meet the needs of businesses, not science,
so scientists are banding together atscidb.orgto create their own Domain
Specific Database, for science. The goal is to be able to handle datasets in
the 100PB range and larger.SciDB, Inc. is building an open source database
technology product designed specifically to satisfy the demands of data-
intensive scientific problems. With the advice of the world's leading
scientists across a variety of disciplines including astronomy, biology,
physics, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and climatology, our computer
scientists are currently designing and prototyping this technologyThe
scientists that are participating in our open source project believe that the
SciDB database -- when completed -- will dramatically impact their ability to
conduct their experiments faster and more efficiently and further improve the

<p>Introduction: There have been reports thatsoftware engineering is dead. Maybe, like the
future, software engineering is simply not evenly distributed? When you read
this paper I think you'll agree there is some real engineering going on, it's
just that most of the things we need to build do not require real engineering.
Much like my old childhood tree fort could be patched together and was "good
enough." This brings to mind the old joke: If a software tree falls in the
woods would anyone hear it fall? Only if it tweeted on the way down...What
this paper really showed me is we need not only to change programming
practices and constructs, but we also need to design solutions that allow for
deep parallelism to begin with. Grafting parallelism on later is difficult.
Parallel execution requires knowing precisely how components are dependent on
each other and that level of precision tends to go far beyond the human
attention span.In particular this paper deals with how to parallelize the

<p>Introduction: For solutions take a look at:7 Life Saving Scalability Defenses Against Load
Monster Attacks.This is a look at all the bad things that can happen to your
carefully crafted program as loads increase: all hell breaks lose. Sure, you
can scale out or scale up, but you can also choose to program better. Make
your system handle larger loads. This saves money because fewer boxes are
needed and it will make the entire application more reliable and have better
response times. And it can be quite satisfying as a programmer.Large Number Of
ObjectsWe usually get into scaling problems when the number of objects gets
larger. Clearly resource usage of all types is stressed as the number of
objects grow.Continuous Failures Makes An Infinite Event StreamDuring large
network failure scenarios there is never time for the system recover. We are
in a continual state of stress.Lots of High Priority WorkFor example,
rerouting is a high priority activity. If there is a large amount of rerouting

<p>Introduction: Colin Scott, a Berkeley researcher, updated Jeff Dean's famousNumbers Everyone
Should Knowwith hisLatency Numbers Every Programmer Should Knowinteractive
graphic. The interactive aspect is cool because it has a slider that let's you
see numbers back from as early as 1990 to the far far future of 2020. Colin
explained hismotivation for updating the numbers:The other day, a friend
mentioned a latency number to me, and I realized that it was an order of
magnitude smaller than what I had memorized from Jeff's talk. The problem, of
course, is that hardware performance increases exponentially! After some
digging, I actually found that the numbers Jeff quotes are over a decade
oldSince numbers without interpretation are simply data, take a look atGoogle

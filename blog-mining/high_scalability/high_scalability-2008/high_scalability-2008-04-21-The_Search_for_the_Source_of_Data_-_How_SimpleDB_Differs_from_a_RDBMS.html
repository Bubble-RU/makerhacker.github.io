</p><p>2 In these circumstances you just want a database that works and that you never have to worry about again. [sent-19, score-0.214]
</p><p>3 And from a business perspective your database becomes a variable cost rather than a high fixed cost, which is excellent for the angel food funding. [sent-25, score-0.223]
</p><p>4 But for those with a relational database background there are some major differences that take getting used to. [sent-27, score-0.243]
</p><p>5 In SimpleDB attribute values can have multiple values so there's no need to do a join to recover all the values. [sent-38, score-0.342]
</p><p>6 In a query SimpleDB just returns back a record ID, not the values of the record. [sent-49, score-0.51]
</p><p>7 You need to make another trip to the database to get the record contents. [sent-50, score-0.389]
</p><p>8 Values for multi-value attribute fields are not returned in sorted order. [sent-55, score-0.337]
</p><p>9 That means if you want sorted results you must do the sorting. [sent-56, score-0.286]
</p><p>10 And it also means you must get all the results back before you can do the sorting. [sent-57, score-0.225]
</p><p>11 SimpleDB only returns back 250 results at a time. [sent-60, score-0.231]
</p><p>12 When there are more results you cursor through the result set using a token mechanism. [sent-61, score-0.204]
</p><p>13 The kicker is you must iterate through the result set sequentially. [sent-62, score-0.214]
</p><p>14 Alex tested retrieving 10 record ids from 3 different database sizes. [sent-67, score-0.389]
</p><p>15 Using a 1K record database it took an average of 141 msecs to retrieve the 10 record ids. [sent-68, score-0.934]
</p><p>16 For a 100K record database it took 266 msecs on average. [sent-69, score-0.613]
</p><p>17 For a 1000K record database it took an average of 433 msecs to retrieve the 10 record ids. [sent-70, score-0.934]
</p><p>18 SimpleDB shifts work out of the database and onto programmers which is why the SimpleDB programming model sucks: it requires a lot more programming to do simple things. [sent-78, score-0.364]
</p><p>19 What programmers can't do is make the database scalable through more programming. [sent-83, score-0.288]
</p><p>20 A scalable database you don't have to worry about for more programming work you already know how to do. [sent-86, score-0.29]

services interface to create and store multiple data sets, query your data
easily, and return the results. Together with the Simple Storage Service (S3),
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and other web services Amazon offers a complete
utility computing platform. SimpleDB was the missing piece of AWS - the

<p>Introduction: In an audacious move for such an established property, Netflix is moving their
website out of the comfort of their own datacenter and into the wilds of the
Amazon cloud. This paper by Netflix's Siddharth "Sid" Anand,Netflix's
Transition to High-Availability Storage Systems, gives a detailed look at this
transition and does a deep dive on SimpleDB best practices, focussing
especially on techniques useful to those who are making the move from a
RDBMS.Sid is going to give a talk at QCon based on this paper and he would
appreciate your feedback. So if you have any comments or thoughts please
comment here or email Sid atr39132@hotmail.com or Twitter at @r39132 Here's
the introduction from the paper:Circa late 2008, Netflix had a single data
center. This single data center raised a few concerns. As a single-point-of-
failure (a.k.a. SPOF), it represented a liability - data center outages meant
interruptions to service and negative customer impact. Additionally, with

<p>Introduction: With so many database options available these days, like for the rest of life,
it's natural to wonder how it allfits together. Amazon complicated, or rather
expanded the available options by introducing RDS, theirrelational database
service. RDS is MySQL safely cocooned as a manageable cloud element, resting
boldly within an energy providing elasticCPU pool, supported by a
virtuallyinfinite supplyof verycapable virtualized storage.MySQL in AWS isnow
easyto start, stop, monitor, backup, snapshot, expand, and effortlessly move
up and down the instance hierarchy. What it's not, contrary to what you might
expect, is a scale-out solution, it's a scale-up solution. You get more by
buying a bigger instance, not by horizontally adding more instances. There's
alimit. Admittedly a larger limit now with Amazon's newhigh memory
instances.That's OK, well maybe not for people who helped grow Amazon's
ecosystem by offering a similar product, but so many projects use MySQL that
this is a big win for a</p><p>5 0.67190689 <a title="306-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-10-Hitting_300_SimbleDB_Requests_Per_Second_on_a_Small_EC2_Instance.html">317 high scalability-2008-05-10-Hitting 300 SimbleDB Requests Per Second on a Small EC2 Instance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDBis a great follow up
to the idea inHow SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMSthat more programming is the
price paid for performance in SimpleDB. It shows how much work and
infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of
SimpleDB.Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you
want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests.
Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to
parallelize. Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a
little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.Parallelization is the
approach taken by Haakon@AWS in his Java code example of how to get the most
out of SimpleDB. You can find the code atIndexing and Querying Amazon S3

<p>Introduction: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores, by a number of MIT
researchers, is a refreshingly practical paper on what it takes to scale Linux
and common applications like Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake,
Psearchy, and MapReduce to run on 48 core systems. A very timely paper given
moderately massive multicore systems are reportedly the near future of
computing.This paper must have taken a lot of work. They both tracked down
bottlenecks in a number of applications and the Linux kernel and they also
tried to fix them. Modestly speaking the authors said they made "modest"
changes to the kernel and applications, but there's nothing modest about what
they did. It's excellent work.After the next bit, which is the abstract, there
is a list of the problems they found and how they fixed them.The abstract:This
paper analyzes the scalability of seven system applications (Exim, memcached,
Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce) running on Linux on a

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Yurii responds with theTop 10 Reasons to Avoid Document Databases
FUD.Update:Top 10 Reasons to Avoid the SimpleDB Hypeby Ryan Park provides a
well written counter take. Am I really that fawning? If so, doesn't that make
me a dear?All your life you've used a relational database. At the tender age
of five you banged out your first SQL query to track your allowance. Your
RDBMS allegiance was just assumed, like your politics or religion would have
been assumed 100 years ago. They now say--you know them--that relations won't
scale and we have to do things differently. New databases like SimpleDB and
BigTable are what's different. As a long time RDBMS user what can you expect
of SimpleDB? That's what Alex Tolley of MyMeemz.com set out to discover. Like
many brave explorers before him, Alex gave a report of his adventures to the
Royal Society of theAWS Meetup. Alex told a wild almost unbelievable tale of
cultures and practices so different from our own you almost could not believe

<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood

<p>Introduction: There are so many architectural ideas swirling in the bit wind these days. Two
of the biggest battles are cloud vs. bare metal and RAM vs. disk vs. SSD.
37signals has published two solid articles that are counter hype cycle in
their message:Technologists who grew up when RAM cost $1,000 per megabyte can
have a hard time dealing with the luxury of RAM being virtually free.The
progress of technology is throwing an ever greater number of optimizations
into the "premature evil" bucket never to be seen again.37signals made quite a
stir with their money shot of the864GB of RAM they bought for a mere $12Kas
part of their caching layer for Basecamp. That's a lot of memory for not a lot
of money. There's nothing like actually seeing it in the flesh to bring the
point home. Does that makeMemory Based Architecturesa little more
appealing?37signals then followed up with another provocative article:Three
years later, Mr. Moore is still letting us punt on database sharding. The gist
is scaling up is</p><p>5 0.89027148 <a title="306-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical_Scaling_Ascendant_-_How_are_SSDs_Changing__Architectures%3F.html">1291 high scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical Scaling Ascendant - How are SSDs Changing  Architectures?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom
for Vertical Scaling Simplifies EverythingThe beauty of higher hardware
performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This
has always been the allure ofvertical scalingand is well realized by SSDs
through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as
important, high densities.We have a few early examples showing the performance

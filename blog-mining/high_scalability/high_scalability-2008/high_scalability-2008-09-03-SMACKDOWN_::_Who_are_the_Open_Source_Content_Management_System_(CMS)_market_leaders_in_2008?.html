<p>Introduction: We build web applications…and there are plenty of them around. Now, if we hit
the jackpot and our application becomes very popular, traffic goes up, and our
servers are brought down by the hordes of people coming to our website. What
do we do in that situation?Of course, I am not talking here about the kind of
traffic Digg, Yahoo Buzz or other social media sites can bring to a website,
which is temporary overnight traffic, or a website which uses cloud computing
like Amazon EC2 service, MediaTemple Grid Service or Mosso Hosting Cloud
service.I am talking about traffic that consistently increases over time as
the service achieves success. Google.com, Yahoo.com, Myspace.com,
Facebook.com, Plentyoffish.com, Linkedin.com, Youtube.com and others are
examples of services which have constant high traffic.Knowing that users want
speed from their applications, these services will always use a Content

<p>Introduction: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 incorporates the tools and technologies that are
necessary to implement relational databases, reporting systems, and data
warehouses of enterprise scale, and provides optimal performance and
responsiveness.With SQL Server 2008, you can take advantage of the latest
hardware technologies while scaling up your servers to support server
consolidation. SQL Server 2008 also enables you to scale out your largest data
solutions.This white paper describes the performance and scalability
capabilities of Microsoft速 SQL Server速 2008 and explains how you can use these
capabilities to:* Optimize performance for any size of database with the tools
and features that are available for the database engine, analysis services,
reporting services, and integration services.* Scale up your servers to take
full advantage of new hardware capabilities.* Scale out your database
environment to optimize responsiveness and to move your data closer to your
users.Read the entire article abou</p><p>6 0.098962106 <a title="377-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-28-Aztec_Empire_Strategy%3A_Use_Dual_Pipes_in_Your_Aqueduct_for_High_Availability.html">1012 high scalability-2011-03-28-Aztec Empire Strategy: Use Dual Pipes in Your Aqueduct for High Availability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Cal Hendersonwrites at thinkvitamin.com: "With our so-called "Web 2.0'
applications and their rich content and interaction, we expect our
applications to increasingly make use of CSS and JavaScript. To make sure
these applications are nice and snappy to use, we need to optimize the size
and nature of content required to render the page, making sure we're
delivering the optimum experience. In practice, this means a combination of
making our content as small and fast to download as possible, while avoiding
unnecessarily refetching unmodified resources." A lot of good comments too.</p><p>3 0.63874888 <a title="377-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-09-Content_Delivery_Networks_%28CDN%29_%E2%80%93_a_comprehensive_list_of_providers.html">382 high scalability-2008-09-09-Content Delivery Networks (CDN) – a comprehensive list of providers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Am I mad to consider using .Net2 and AJAX for a high-scalability application?
In case you wonder why, it's the legacy of a website built on IIS and .Net
1.1, and we're looking for ways to make the content more attractive and
interactive. In this case, it's a medical image library being shared by a few
Wikis and online coursework for medicalstudents ( < 15K users) and doctors ( <
150K users)But I'm worried about the performance overhead. We already have a
performance problem because of personalising the content for users according
to their type (student or doctor), and for doctors, their grade and
speciality.</p><p>6 0.60414511 <a title="377-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-26-Use_a_CDN_to_Instantly_Improve_Your_Website%27s_Performance_by_20%25_or_More_.html">100 high scalability-2007-09-26-Use a CDN to Instantly Improve Your Website's Performance by 20% or More </a></p>

<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle
traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch
or other very popular websites frontpage).Regular hosting companies
(especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get
crushed under the load in short time.But there is hope. A new breed of hosting
companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability
you need at a fraction of the cost.Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!”
(or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same
thing).Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting
companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of
them).Read the entire article aboutCloud computing, grid computing, utility

<p>Introduction: Michael Stonebraker sure knows how to stir up a storm. Unlike for others, that
doesn't make him a troll in my mind, he'sway too accomplishedin the field to
be that, but he does have a bit of Barnum & Bailey in him, which serves to get
the discussion flowing, and that's a good thing. A lot of previously hidden
wisdom and passion unlocks, which we'll try to capture here.This disturbance
in the force is over OldSQL vs NoSQL vsNewSQL. Warning, these are not crisp
categories, there's leakage all over the place, watch your step:OldSQL
(Oracle, MySQL, etc) refers to what some want to term as legacy relational
database like MySQL, that don't scale out horizontally with aplomb.NoSQL
(CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, Riak, Neo4j, etc) refers to, well,
a collection of technologies that aren't OldSQL, these often are designed to
scale out horizontally, aren't on ACID, and use schemaless non-relational
datamodels.NewSQL  (Xeround, Clustrix, NimbusDB, GenieDB, ScaleBase, VoltDB)

<p>Introduction: If using a DB to store session(used by some app server, ex.. websphere), how
would an enterprise class site that is housed in 2 different data centers(that
are live/live) maintain the session between both data centers.The problem as I
see it is that since each data center has their own session database, if I was
to flip the users to only access Data Center 1(by changing the DNS records for
the site or some other Load balancing technique) then that would cause all
previous Data Center 2 users to lose their session. What would be some pure
hardware based solutions to this that are being used now? That way the
applications supporting the web site can be abstracted from this.As I see now,
a solution is to possibly have the session databases in both centers some how
replicate the data to each other. I just don't see the best way to even
accomplish this you are not even guraunteed that the session ID's will be
unique since it's 2 different Application Server tiers(again websphere). Not

<p>Introduction: Hi,Every application server has its own session management implementations for
supporting high scalability. But an application architect/developer has to
design and implement the application to make the best use of it.What are the
guiding principles and pattern for session state management?Websphere System
management red book mentions that "Session management performance is optimum
when session data per user is around 2Kb. It degrades if session data is more
than that".I have following questions.1. How do you measure session data per
user?2. It is generally recommended that you should keep all the session state
in database and keep only the keys in HttpSession object. Then everytime a web
request is processed, session data is fetched from the database. This way all
the data remains in memory only till the request is processed and actual data
in HttpSession is very less. (Only few keys).What is the general practice?At
what point you should be switching from keeping data in HttpSession t</p><p>5 0.10963133 <a title="207-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-06-An_Unorthodox_Approach_to_Database_Design_%3A_The_Coming_of_the_Shard.html">672 high scalability-2009-08-06-An Unorthodox Approach to Database Design : The Coming of the Shard</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from
scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.Hibernate Shards
is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by
adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.Hibernate
Shardskey features:Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards
allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love:
SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use
Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards.Flexible sharding
strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of
the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific

<p>Introduction: Update:A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview withGoogle engineer Max Ross on
Hibernate Shards. Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how
it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in
the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to
Google AppEngine (not much).To scale you are supposed to partition your data.
Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all
the details it's not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate
shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for
horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the
shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core
group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although
there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff
in the right way and it's very much worth looking at, especially if you use
Hiberna</p><p>4 0.62948191 <a title="207-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-28-How_to_Organize_a_Database_Table%E2%80%99s_Keys_for_Scalability.html">476 high scalability-2008-12-28-How to Organize a Database Tableâ€™s Keys for Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your datasetâ€™s data
is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large
singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you
have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each
individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all
shards.There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys
across a shard cluster. Each has its proâ€™s and conâ€™s and the one chosen should
be specific to the problems youâ€™re trying to solve.</p><p>5 0.55923319 <a title="207-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-11-Pyshards_aspires_to_build_sharding_toolkit_for_Python.html">345 high scalability-2008-06-11-Pyshards aspires to build sharding toolkit for Python</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've been interested in sharding concepts since first hearing the term "shard"
a few years back. My interest had been piqued earlier, the first time I read
about Google's original approach to distributed search. It was described as a
hashtable-like system in which independent physical machines play the role of
the buckets. More recently, I needed the capacity and performance of a Sharded
system, but did not find helpful libraries or toolkits which would assist with
the configuration for my language of preference these days, which is Python.
And, since I had a few weeks on my hands, I decided I would begin the work of
creating these tools.The result of my initial work the Pyshards project, a
still-incomplete python and MySQL based horizontal partitioning and sharding
toolkit. HighScalability.com readers will already know that horizontal
partitioning is a data segmenting pattern in which distinct groups of physical
row-based datasets are distributed across multiple partitions. When the

<p>Introduction: In a recent project, I utilized RoR's cookie-based session storage to shard
geographically distinct user groups. My technique for doing so was unique and,
although it was a premature optimization, it is none-the-less an idea worth
exploring.</p><p>3 0.79901171 <a title="207-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-01-HotPads_on_AWS.html">615 high scalability-2009-06-01-HotPads on AWS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like?
Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing.
Specifically the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group(IPNSIG
).Ansible-likefaster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical
warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning
telegraph system.It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more
interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that
was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances
and with muchlonger delays:The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also
called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a
set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2]
Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances,
so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to
large delays and errors.[2] While the In</p><p>5 0.63164872 <a title="207-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala_-_P2P_Online_Storage_Cloud.html">368 high scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala - P2P Online Storage Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected
availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P
systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show
you how! They havelaunched Wuala, the social online storage service which
scales as new nodes join the P2P network.The goal ofWua.lais to provide
distributed online storage that is:largescalablereliablesecureby harnessing
the idle resources of participating computers.This challenge is an old dream
of computer science. In fact asAndrew Tanenbaumwrote in 1995:"The design of a
world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by
millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise
for the reader"After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich,
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system,
Caleido is ready to unveil the result: Wuala. Wuala is a new way of storing,
sharing, and p</p><p>6 0.62064993 <a title="207-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-02-Distributed_Hashing_Algorithms_by_Example%3A_Consistent_Hashing.html">892 high scalability-2010-09-02-Distributed Hashing Algorithms by Example: Consistent Hashing</a></p>

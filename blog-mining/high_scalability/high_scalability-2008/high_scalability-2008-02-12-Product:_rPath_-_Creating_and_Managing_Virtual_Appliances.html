<p>Introduction: Update 2: 3tera has addedDynamic Appliances, which are "packaged data center
operations like backup, migration or SLAs that users can add to their
applications to provide functionality."Update: in an effort to help cross the
chasm of how start building a website using their grid OS, 3tera is offering
theirAssured Success Plan. The idea is to provide training, consulting, and
support so you can get started with some confidence you'll end up
succeeding.If you are starting or extending a website you have a problem: what
technologies should you use?Now there are more answers to that question than
ever. One new and refreshingly innovative answer is3tera's grid OS. In this
podcast interview with Bert Armijo from 3tera, we'll learn how 3tera wants to
change how you build websites.How? By transforming the physical into the
virtual and then allowing the virtual to be manipulated as if it were real.

<p>Introduction: Update 4: Heroku versus GAE & GAE/JUpdate 3:Heroku has gone live!.
Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the
relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment
and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.Update 2:Heroku
Architecture. A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests
flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a
Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based
routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your
application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors. Dynos
themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware,
Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as
an application caching layer.Update: Aaron WorshamInterview with James

<p>Introduction: TGLdelivers Virtual Private Datacenters and virtual private servers from grids
of commodity servers. Each TGL grid consists of a pool of HP servers connected
with a Gigabit backbone network and running 3Tera's AppLogic grid operating
system.With a Virtual Private Datacenter, you get complete control of your own
private grid. Using our visual interface, you set up and assemble disposable
virtual infrastructure, including firewalls, load balancers, web servers,
database servers, NAS boxes, etc. visually, by pointing and clicking. You can
build advanced clusters, deploy large and small applications, and save them as
templates that can be provisioned in minutes. You can even build your own
virtual servers and appliances.</p><p>5 0.12849672 <a title="245-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-26-Hot_Links_for_2009-8-26.html">688 high scalability-2009-08-26-Hot Links for 2009-8-26</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things we are seeing is more tools and tool chains for
performing very high level operations quite simply.Vagrantis such a tool
forbuilding and distributing virtualized development environments.Web
developers use virtual environments every day with their web applications.
From EC2 and Rackspace Cloud to specialized solutions such as EngineYard and
Heroku, virtualization is the tool of choice for easy deployment and
infrastructure management. Vagrant aims to take those very same principles and
put them to work in the heart of the application lifecycle. By providing easy
to configure, lightweight, reproducible, and portable virtual machines
targeted at development environments, Vagrant helps maximize your productivity
and flexibility.If you've created a build and deployment system before Vagrant
does a lot of the work for you:Automated virtual machine creation

<p>Introduction: This is guest post byMichael DeHaan(@laserllama), a software developer and
architect, on Ansible, a simple deployment, model-driven configuration
management, and command execution framework.I owe High Scalability a great
deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>4 0.73165596 <a title="245-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA%3A_Badoo%E2%80%99s_journey_into_Continuous_Integration.html">1531 high scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA: Badoo’s journey into Continuous Integration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot
of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications
stemming from this, we use AIDA.AIDA(Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant)
is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git,
TeamCity and JIRA.In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were
able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous
integration.We'll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use
here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release
branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we'll discuss AIDA's major
contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.Git flowThe Badoo Team uses
Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and
tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in
JIRA and a description of the problem.BFG-

<p>Introduction: At a Cloud Computing Meetup, Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a
merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:Keeping Movies Running
Amid Thunderstorms. While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the
cloud, issues with capacity planning,thundering herds, latency problems,
andsimian armageddon, I found myself most taken with how they handlesoftware
deployment in the cloud.I've worked on half a dozen or more build and
deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large
organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability
that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant
software deployments:the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to
completely run a new release while running the old release at the same
time.The process goes something like: Acanary machineis launched first with
the new software load running real traffic to sanity test the load in a
production environment. If the ca</p><p>6 0.72163773 <a title="245-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Product%3A_ISPMan_Centralized_ISP_Management_System_.html">228 high scalability-2008-01-28-Product: ISPMan Centralized ISP Management System </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Van JacobsonVan Jacobson is a Research Fellow atPARC. Prior to
that he was Chief Scientist and co-founder of Packet Design. Prior to that he
was Chief Scientist at Cisco. Prior to that he was head of the Network
Research group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He's been studying
networking since 1969. He still hopes that someday something will start to
make sense.Scaling the Internet – Does the Net needs an upgrade?As the
Internet is being overrun with video traffic, many wonder if it can survive.

<p>Introduction: Digg has been researching ways to scale our database infrastructure for some
time now. We've adopted a traditional vertically partitioned master-slave
configuration with MySQL, and also investigated sharding MySQL with IDDB.
Ultimately, these solutions left us wanting. In the case of the traditional
architecture, the lack of redundancy on the write masters is painful, and both
approaches have significant management overhead to keep running.Since it was
already necessary to abandon data normalization and consistency to make these
approaches work, we felt comfortable looking at more exotic, non-relational
data stores. After considering HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, Tokyo
Cabinet/Tyrant, Voldemort, and Dynomite, we settled on Cassandra.Each system
has its own strengths and weaknesses, but Cassandra has a good blend of
everything. It offers column-oriented data storage, so you have a bit more
structure than plain key/value stores. It operates in a distributed, highly
available, peer-to-pee</p><p>3 0.93637145 <a title="245-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_SmarterStats.html">45 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: SmarterStats</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:GIGAOM onrPath Burns EC2 Appliances in a Web Portal. rBuilder adds a
portal that lets users turn software into virtual appliances.rPathdemoed their
virtual appliance management system at Monday'sAWS Meetup. What they do is
help you build a generic virtual machine image deployable on Amazon, VMWare,
Xen and other targets. The idea is to build your software application
independent of the underlying operating system and deploy it in your own or
someone else's datacenter without worrying about all the details.To put their
service in context think of rPath as how you build, deploy, and upgrade images
and someone likeRight Scalehas how you can run and managed a cluster of
deployed images.breakTo build a Virtual Appliance you pull together all your
packages through their web interface or through a Python based "recipe"
system, select a VM target, and "cook" it all into a VM image you can
immediately deploy and run.To make this magic happen they use theConary

<p>Introduction: In a strange case of synchronicity, Google just publishedInstant Previews:
Under the hood, a very well written blog post by Matias Pelenur of the Instant
Previews team, giving some fascinating inside details on how Google
implementedInstant Previews. It's syncronicty because I had just posted
Strategy: Biggest Performance Impact Is To Reduce The Number Of HTTP Requests
and one of the major ideas behind the design Instant Previews is to reduce the
number of HTTP requests through a few well chosen tricks. Cosmic!Some of what
Google does to reduce HTTP requests:Data URIs, which are are base64 encodings
of image data, are used instead of static images that are served from the
server. This means the whole preview can be pieced together from image slices
in one request as both the data and the image are returned in the same
request. Google found thateven though base64 encoding adds about 33% to the
size of the image, tests showed that gzip-compressed data URIs are comparable
in size to the o</p><p>6 0.92681628 <a title="245-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-16-Seven_Signs_You_May_Need_a_NoSQL_Database.html">779 high scalability-2010-02-16-Seven Signs You May Need a NoSQL Database</a></p>

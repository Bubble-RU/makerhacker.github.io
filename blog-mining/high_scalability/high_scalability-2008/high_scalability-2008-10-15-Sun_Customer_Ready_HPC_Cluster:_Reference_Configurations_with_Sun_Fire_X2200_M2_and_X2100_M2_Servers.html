<p>Introduction: Much of the focus of high performance computing (HPC) has centered on CPU
performance. However, as computing requirements grow, HPC clusters are
demanding higher rates of aggregate data throughput. Today's clusters feature
larger numbers of nodes with increased compute speeds. The higher clock rates
and operations per clock cycle create increased demand for local data on each
node. In addition, InfiniBand and other high-speed, low-latency interconnects
increase the data throughput available to each node.Traditional shared file
systems such as NFS have not been able to scale to meet this growing demand
for data throughput on HPC clusters. Scalable cluster file systems that can
provide parallel data access to hundreds of nodes and petabytes of storage are
needed to provide the high data throughput required by large HPC applications,
including manufacturing, electronic design, and research.This paper describes
an implementation of the Sun Lustre file system as a scalable storage cluster

<p>Introduction: Reducing the costs of IT infrastructure and improving the manageability and
efficiency of web services pose significant challenges for many organizations
in today's economic climate. Recent studies describe the challenges IT
managers face administering the proliferation of x86-based servers used to run
web services applications. Those reports reveal that using large number of
x86-based systems can increase space and power consumption, as well as cost
and asset management overhead. In addition, many of these x86-based systems
run a mixture of operating system and application software leading to
increased management complexity and potential security concerns.Faced with
these challenges, many organizations are attracted by the idea of
consolidating web and application services from multiple x86-based servers to
a smaller number of high-performance servers. This approach strives to help
simplify management, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of
delivering web services.

<p>Introduction: Sun FireTM X4540 Server as Backup Server for Zmanda's Amanda Enterprise 2.6
Softwareby Thomas Hanvey (Sun Microsystems) and Dmitri Joukovski and Ken
Crandall (Zmanda)September, 2008Explosive data growth, combined with demanding
requirements for data availability, has placed a tremendous burden on IT
operations staff at businesses of all sizes. Yet, many organizations do not
have the staff or budget to purchase and manage complex and expensive backup
and recovery software products.The Sun FireTM X4540 server can deliver massive
storage capacity and remarkable throughput so it is well-suited as a nearline
storage platform for backup and restore applications. Combining the power of
the SolarisTM 10 Operating System with the data integrity and simplified
administration of ZFS, the Sun Fire X4540 server can be an ideal candidate for
streamlining and improving backup and restore operations.Amanda Enterprise

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>4 0.91855621 <a title="418-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-13-Design_Preparations_for_Scaling.html">91 high scalability-2007-09-13-Design Preparations for Scaling</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread
pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is
tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal
variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user
id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the
code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to
pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought isclass ReferenceIdGenerator
{public static setReferenceId(String login) {threadLocal.set(login +
System.currentMillis());}public static String getReferenceId() {return
threadLocal.get();}private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =new
ThreadLocal();}class MySevlet {void service(.....) {HttpSession session =
request.getSession(false);String userId =
session.get("userId");ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId);try
{doSomething();}finally {ReferenceIdGenerator.remove();}}This method is also</p><p>6 0.86598676 <a title="418-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-25-Peter_Norvig%27s_9_Master_Steps_to_Improving_a_Program.html">1601 high scalability-2014-02-25-Peter Norvig's 9 Master Steps to Improving a Program</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Shawn Hsiao ,  Luke Massa , and  Victor Luu . Shawn runs  TripAdvisor ’s Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his team this past summer. This post is introduced by  Andy Gelfond , TripAdvisor’s head of engineering.   It's been a little over a year since our last post about the  TripAdvisor architecture . It has been an exciting year. Our business and team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown - we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:
  
 56M visitors per month 
 350M+ pages requests a day 
 120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large Hadoop cluster, and quickly growing

<p>Introduction: Are all instances created equal? Perhaps because under multi-tenancy multiple virtual machines run on the same physical host, not all applications will run equally well on every instance. In that case it makes sense to measure and move to a better performing instance. 
 
That's the interesting idea from  @botchagalupe :
  

Imagine something like a "performance monkey" where an infrastructure is so bound that it can kill lower performing instances automatically.

  
 @adrianco  says Netflix has throught of doing the same: 
  

We've looked at killing off multi-tenant instances that have high CPU stolen time...

<p>Introduction: We've long known one of the virtues of the cloud is, through the magic of services and automation, that systems can be shut or tuned down when not in use. What may be surprising is how much money can be saved. 
 
This aspect of cloudiness got a lot of pub at  AWS re:Invent  and is being rebranded under the term  Cost-Aware Architecture . An  interesting example  was given by Ryan Park, Pinterest’s technical operations lead:
  
 20% of their systems are shutdown after hours in response to traffic loads 
 Reserved instances are used for standard traffic  
 On-demand and spot instances are used to handle the elastic load throughout the day. When more servers are needed for an auto-scaled service,  spot requests are opened and on-demand instances are started at the same time. Most services are targeted to run at about 50% on-demand and 50% spot. 
 Watchdog processes continually check what's running. More instances are launched when needed and terminated when not needed. If spot prices spik</p><p>6 0.12476418 <a title="372-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture_to_Allow_High_Availability_File_Upload.html">262 high scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture to Allow High Availability File Upload</a></p>

 Urbandive  is an immersive view service launched by the  French YellowPages  which allows you to travel in cities in France thanks to a 360° view. Urbandive focuses on providing high definition pictures and accurate professional and social content. One of the biggest jobs was to enable a fast scalable architecture, because it was really difficult to forecast the traffic load at production time. Traffic load may be influenced if the service receives attention from users as a result of advertising.
 
Below you will find a summary of the goals we achieve by using a Ruby scheduler built on top of  Puppet  on  AWS  to create a complete infrastructure.
    Workflow & XTR-Lucid

<p>Introduction: When EC2 first started the mental model was of a magic Pez dispenser supplying an infinite stream of instances in any desired flavor. If you needed an instance, because of a either a failure or traffic spike, it would be there. As amazing as EC2 is, this model turned out to be optimistic.  
 
From a  thread on the Amazon discussion forum  we learn any dispenser has limits:
  

As Availability Zones grow over time, our ability to continue to expand them can become constrained. In these scenarios, we will prevent customers from launching in the constrained zone if they do not yet have existing resources in that zone. We also might remove the constrained zone entirely from the list of options for new customers. This means that occasionally, different customers will see a different number of Availability Zones in a particular Region. Both approaches aim to help customers avoid accidentally starting to build up their infrastructure in an Availability Zone where they might have less ability</p><p>6 0.73485166 <a title="372-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-12-Pinterest_Cut_Costs_from_%2454_to_%2420_Per_Hour_by_Automatically_Shutting_Down_Systems.html">1371 high scalability-2012-12-12-Pinterest Cut Costs from $54 to $20 Per Hour by Automatically Shutting Down Systems</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:
 
Now that we have a new computing paradigm, Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds? Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space, and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are a number of issues driving this uncertainty.

<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming your business – reports are out of date, your batch processing window is nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database consolidation – remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware, OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are clear,  what now?﻿

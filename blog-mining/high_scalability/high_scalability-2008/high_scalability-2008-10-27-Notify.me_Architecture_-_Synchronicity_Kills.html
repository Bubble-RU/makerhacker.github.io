been gracious enough to share with us his philosophy of how to build a
notification service. I think you'll find it fascinating because Arne goes
into a lot of useful detail about how his system works.His main design
philosophy is to minimize the bottlenecks that form around synchronous access,
that is whensome resource is requested and the requestor ties up more

can't accept any new ones. Nobody gets what they want and you have an outage.

<p>Introduction: Update: Erlang at Facebook by Eugene Letuchy. How Facebook uses Erlang to
implement Chat, AIM Presence, and Chat Jabber support. I've done
someXMPPdevelopment so when I readFacebook was making a Jabber chat clientI
was really curious how they would make it work. While core XMPP is
straightforward, a number of protocol extensions like discovery, forms, chat
states, pubsub, multi user chat, and privacy lists really up the
implementation complexity. Some real engineering challenges were involved to
make this puppy scale and perform. It's not clear what extensions they've
implemented, but a blog entry by Facebook's Eugene Letuchy hits some of the
architectural challenges they faced and how they overcame them.A web based
Jabber client poses a few problems because XMPP, like most IM protocols, is an
asynchronous event driven system that pretty much assumes you have a full time
open connection. After logging in the server sends a client roster information
and presence information.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byPeter Offringa, VP of engineering atZoosk. Zoosk is a
50 million member romantic social network.Our members get the most rewarding
experience from Zoosk when they can interact in real-time. After all, a future
relationship is potentially at the other end of every connection a user makes.
The excitement and richness of this situation can only be fully realized in
real-time. The suite of Zoosk services facilitating these interactions are
referred to by the general description of real-time communications (RTC).
These communications are delivered using the XMPP protocol, which also powers
other popular instant messaging products. Zoosk members experience real-time
communications within three distinct interactions:Presence.  When a member is
actively connected to the Zoosk RTC infrastructure, their public status
appears as 'available'. If they are idle for a period of time, their state
transitions to 'away'. Their presence automatically changes to 'offline' when

<p>Introduction: This strategy is stated perfectly by Flickr's Myles Grant:The Flickr
engineering team is obsessed with making pages load as quickly as possible. To
that end, weâ&euro;&trade;re refactoring large amounts of our code to do only the essential
work up front, and rely on our queuing system to do the rest.Flickr uses a
queuing system to process 11 million tasks a day. Leslie Michael Orchard also
does a great job explaining the queuing meme in his excellent postQueue
everything and delight everyone. Asynchronous work queues are how you scalably
solve problems that are too big to handle in real-time.The process:Identify
the minimum feedback the client (UI, API) needs to know an operation
succeeded. It's enough, for example, to update a client's view when a posting
a message to a microblogging service. The client probably isn't aware of all
the other steps that happen when a message is added and doesn't really care
when they happen as long as the obvious cases happen in an appropariate period
of time.Queue</p><p>4 0.7835989 <a title="431-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-06-How_HipChat_Stores_and_Indexes_Billions_of_Messages_Using_ElasticSearch_and_Redis.html">1573 high scalability-2014-01-06-How HipChat Stores and Indexes Billions of Messages Using ElasticSearch and Redis</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a little known fact that Santa Clause was an early queue innovator. Faced
with the problem of delivering a planet full of presents in one night, Santa,
in his hacker's workshop, created a Present Distribution System using
thousands of region based priority present queues for continuous delivery by
the Rudolphs. Rudolphs? You didn't think there was only one Rudolph did you?
Presents are delivered in parallel by a cluster of sleighs, each with
redundant reindeer in a master-master configuration. Each Rudolph is a cluster
leader and they coordinate work using an early and more magical version of the
ZooKeeper protocol.Programmers have followed Santa's lead and you can find
amessage queue in nearly every major architecture profile onHighScalability.
Historically they may have been introduced after a first generation
architecture needed to scale up from their two tier system into something a
little more capable (asynchronicity, work dispatch, load buffering, database
offloading, etc).</p><p>6 0.77811658 <a title="431-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Letting_Clients_Know_What%27s_Changed%3A_Push_Me_or_Pull_Me%3F.html">205 high scalability-2008-01-10-Letting Clients Know What's Changed: Push Me or Pull Me?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What's cool about starting a new project is you finally have a chance to do it
right. You of course eventually mess everything up in your own way, but for
that one moment the world has a perfect order, a rightness that feels
satisfying and good. Arne Claassen, the CTO of notify.me, a brand new real
time notification delivery service, is in this honeymoon period now.Arne has
been gracious enough to share with us his philosophy of how to build a
notification service. I think you'll find it fascinating because Arne goes
into a lot of useful detail about how his system works.His main design
philosophy is to minimize the bottlenecks that form around synchronous access,
that is whensome resource is requested and the requestor ties up more
resources, waiting for a response. If the requested resource can't be
delivered in a timely manner, more and more requests pile up until the server
can't accept any new ones. Nobody gets what they want and you have an outage.

<p>Introduction: Lighttpd(pronounced "lighty") is a web server which is designed to be secure,
fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-
critical environments. Its low memory footprint (compared to other web
servers), light CPU load and its speed goals make lighttpd suitable for
servers that are suffering load problems, or for serving static media
separately from dynamic content. lighttpd is free software / open source, and
is distributed under the BSD license. lighttpd runs on GNU/Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows.Load-balancing FastCGI, SCGI

<p>Introduction: Algorithms are moving out of the Platonic realm and are becoming dynamic first
class players in real life. We've seen corporations become people. Algorithms
will likely also follow that path to agency.Kevin Slavin in his intriguing TED
talk: How Algorithms Shape Our World, gives many and varied examples of how
algorithms have penetrated RL. One of his most interesting examples is from a
highly technical paper on Relativistic statistical arbitrage, which says to
make money on markets you have to be where the people are, the red dots (on
the diagram below), which means you have to put servers where the blue dots
are, many of which are in the ocean. Here's the diagram from the paper:Mr.
Slavin neatly sums this up by saying:And it's not the money that's so
interesting actually. It's what the money motivates, thatwe're actually
terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency. And in
that light, you go back and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs, and you
realize</p><p>4 0.92869163 <a title="431-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-29-Paper%3A_No_Relation%3A_The_Mixed_Blessings_of_Non-Relational_Databases.html">733 high scalability-2009-10-29-Paper: No Relation: The Mixed Blessings of Non-Relational Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This excellent survey of the field waswritten by Ian Thomas Varleyas part of
his Master of Science in Engineering program.The aim of this paper is to
explore the conceptual design space of non-relational databases as compared to
traditional relational databases. It is clear that the design needs of the two
paradigms are different, but how fundamental are the differences, and what
strategies can we use to transition our conceptual designs from one to the
other?There are a few things to like about this paper. A running a example is
used to show the different ways to model data depending on which type of
solution you are targeting, especially covering how many-to-many relationships
are modeled, data integrity, and how to support optional attributes. There's
also a brief survey of some of the major systems.The most interesting section
of the report is where it tackles the problem of design for non-relational
systems. The approach has two different phases: design questions and design

may have thought that node.js made just everything magically fast, but Shravya
Garlapati has some great strategies for going even faster: Avoid synchronous
code; Turn off socket pooling;  Don't use Node.js for static assets; Render on
the client-side; Use gzip; Go parallel; Go session-free; Use binary modules;
Use standard V8 JavaScript instead of client-side libraries; Keep your code

<p>Introduction: Update 3 :  A Comparison of Approaches to Large-Scale Data Analysis: MapReduce vs. DBMS Benchmarks .  Although the process to load data into and tune the execution of parallel DBMSs took much longer than the MR system, the observed performance of these DBMSs was strikingly better.   Update 2 :  H-Store: A Next Generation OLTP DBMS  is the project implementing the ideas in this paper:  The goal of the H-Store project is to investigate how these architectural and application shifts affect the performance of OLTP databases, and to study what performance benefits would be possible with a complete redesign of OLTP systems in light of these trends. Our early results show that a simple prototype built from scratch using modern assumptions can outperform current commercial DBMS offerings by around a factor of 80 on OLTP workloads.

<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one  Ilya Grigorik , Developer Advocate,  Make the Web Fast  at Google, and author of a great new book:  High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer should know about networking and web performance . 
 
That's a big topic you might be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It’s like a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.
 
In case you are not familiar with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For years Ilya has been producing excellent content on  his blog  and if you  search YouTube  you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the book. Authority established.
 
Reading the book I was struck by what a complicated beast or little World Wide Web has become.

<p>Introduction: The world of NoSQL and alternative database implementations (i.e.  non-relational) is deeply fascinating to me. I can’t help but be swept  up in the whirl of planet-scale web development scalability techniques  and the evolution of how developers think about building their  applications knowing that with success comes the inevitable need to  scale to levels almost unimaginable just five or ten years ago.
 
I’m going to make a prediction: Developers will be expected to  understand the fundamentals of how different database systems can be  applied within a singular application; their strengths and weaknesses,  and when it is appropriate to leverage them.
 
There’s a lot out there about scaling relational databases.  Partitioning your data over application-managed shards is a topic that  has seen its fair share of attention. But I think there’s a whole slew  over NoSQL databases that have been built and designed by some very  smart people that are new enough that their internals aren’t we</p><p>6 0.066548191 <a title="469-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-04-Paper%3A_MapReduce%3A_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters.html">483 high scalability-2009-01-04-Paper: MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An excellent article by Bryan Cantrill and Jeff Bonwick on how to write multi-threaded code. With more processors and no magic bullet solution for how to use them, knowing how to write multiprocessor code that doesn't screw up your system is still a valuable skill. Some topics:
   Know your cold paths from your hot paths.    Intuition is frequently wrong—be data intensive.    Know when—and when not—to break up a lock.     Be wary of readers/writer locks.   Consider per-CPU locking.   Know when to broadcast—and when to signal.    Learn to debug postmortem.   Design your systems to be composable.    Don't use a semaphore where a mutex would suffice.   Consider memory retiring to implement per-chain hash-table locks.    Be aware of false sharing.   Consider using nonblocking synchronization routines to monitor contention.   When reacquiring locks, consider using generation counts to detect state change.   Use wait- and lock-free structures only if you absolutely must.

<p>Introduction: On the blogs.technet.com article on microsoft.com's infrastructure:   The article reads like a blatant ad for it's own products, and is light on the technical side.     The juicy bits are here, so you know what the fuss is about:     Cytrix Netscaler (= loadbalancer with various optimizations)   W2K8 + IIS7 and antivirus software on the webservers   650GB/day ISS log files   8-9GBit/s (unknown if CDN's are included)   Simple network filtering: stateless access lists blocking unwanted ports on the routers/switches (hence the debated "no firewalls" claim).       Note that this information may not reflect present reality very well; the spokesman appears to be reciting others words.</p><p>4 0.60053957 <a title="469-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-02-The_case_against_ORM_Frameworks_in_High_Scalability_Architectures.html">235 high scalability-2008-02-02-The case against ORM Frameworks in High Scalability Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let me begin by saying that I have used and continue to use various ORM frameworks such as hibernate, ibatis, propel and activerecord in applications and websites that have a user base ranging from a couple hundred to 500k users.  Especially for projects that have to be up and running in a short duration of time, ORM frameworks significantly reduce the effort required to manipulate and persist OOP objects by providing time saving facilities such as automatically generated model objects, integrated unit testing,  secure variable substitution, etc. Hibernate even supports horizontal  data partitioning via Hibernate Shards.      However, the lay of the land is significantly different in the rarefied space occupied by applications needing to support millions of users. Profiling an application at this level and paying particular attention to the operations needed to move data to and from the database, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the operations are API related, whereby t</p><p>5 0.59089696 <a title="469-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-09-Writing_about_cisco_loadbalancer%3F.html">678 high scalability-2009-08-09-Writing about cisco loadbalancer?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Guys,  At one of my jobs I have to administer a CISCO ACE (application control engine) hardware load-balancer. I don't particularly love this beast, but it's very very powerful.  There appears to be little real-world info out there, so it could be interesting writing an article on that.  But I don't have other HW LB's to compare it to and I don't want to rehash the product page.   What would interest you in a 'product review' of a loadbalancer? No replies means it's not an interesting topic, so no article then ;-)</p><p>6 0.5606789 <a title="469-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable_Web_Architectures_and_Application_State.html">656 high scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable Web Architectures and Application State</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Markus has a short  update  on their  PlentyOfFish Architecture . Impressive November statistics:
  
 6 billion pageviews served 
 32 billion images served 
 6 million logins i n one day  
 IM servers handle about 30 billion pageviews 
 11 webservers (5 of which could be dropped) 
 Hired first  DBA in July . They currently have a  handful of employees . 
 All hosting/cdn costs  combined are under $70k/month. 
  
 Lesson : small organization, simple architecture, on raw hardware is still plenty profitable for PlentyOfFish.

<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:  Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework  by  Luigi Rizzo . As commodity networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen?

 


Abstract:

 

Today 10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the design of device drivers and network stacks.


The netmap framework is a promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary overhead and moves</p><p>6 0.47341841 <a title="469-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-18-Save_up_to_30%25_by_Selecting_Better_Performing_Amazon_Instances.html">1343 high scalability-2012-10-18-Save up to 30% by Selecting Better Performing Amazon Instances</a></p>

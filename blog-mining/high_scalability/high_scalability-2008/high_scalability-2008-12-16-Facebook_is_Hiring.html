<p>Introduction: The most important aspect of a scalable web architecture is data partitioning. Most components in a modern data center are completely stateless, meaning they just do batches of work that is handed to them, but don't store any data long-term. This is true of most web application servers, caches like memcached, and all of the network infrastructure that connects them. Data storage is becoming a specialized function, delegated most often to relational databases. This makes sense, because stateless servers are easiest to scale - you just keep adding more. Since they don't store anything, failures are easy to handle too - just take it out of rotation.         Stateful servers require more careful attention. If you are storing all of your data in a relational database, and the load on that database exceeds its capacity, there is no automatic solution that allows you to simply add more hardware and scale up. (One day, there will be, but that's for another post). In the meantime, most websites</p><p>same-blog 2 0.95861691 <a title="466-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-16-Facebook_is_Hiring.html">466 high scalability-2008-12-16-Facebook is Hiring</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since its inception,  Amazon EC2  has enabled companies to run highly scalable infrastructure with minimal overhead.  Over the years, Amazon Web Services has expanded with new offerings and additional regions around the world.
   
All this growth has made establishing a global footprint easier than ever.  And yet, most EC2 customers still choose to operate in a single region.  While this is fine for many applications, customers with significant web infrastructure are depriving users of drastically improved performance.  Deploying infrastructure in EC2's new regions cuts out one of the biggest sources of latency: distance.
   
In  this post , I describe how  Bizo  significantly reduced load times by implementing Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) to distribute traffic across all Amazon regions.

<p>Introduction: The first meeting of this Online Gaming High Scalability SIG will be on the 9th of July 2009 in central London, starting at 10 AM and finishing around 5PM.  The main topic of this meeting will be potentials for using cloud and grid technologies in online gaming systems. In addition to experience reports from the community, we have invited some of the leading cloud experts in the UK to discuss the benefits such as resource elasticity and challenges such as storage and security that companies from other industries have experienced. We will have a track for IT managers focused on business opportunities and issues and a track for architects and developers more focused on implementation issues.  The event is free but up-front registration is required for capacity planning, so please let us know in advance, if you are planning to attend by completing the registration form on this page  To propose a talk or for programme enquiries, contact meetings [at] gamingscalability [dot] org.

<p>Introduction: Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please comment on that too.
 
Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work. Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not. Taking all that wisdom and stuffing it into a presentations is surprisingly hard</p><p>4 0.096145809 <a title="220-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-06-GEO-aware_traffic_load_balancing_and_caching_at_CNBC.com.html">773 high scalability-2010-02-06-GEO-aware traffic load balancing and caching at CNBC.com</a></p>
<p>Introduction: CNBC, like many large web sites, relied  on a CDN for content delivery.  Recently, we started looking  to see if we could improve this model.  Our criteria was:     - improve response time  - have better control over traffic (real time reporting, change management and alerting)  - better utilize internal datacenters and their infrastructure  - shield users from any troubles at the origin infrastructure  - cost out       After researching the market, we turned to two vendors: Dyn (Dynamic Network Services) and  aiScaler . We' have had   about a year worth of experience with  aiScaler  (search for "CNBC" to see my previous post ), but Dyn was a new vendor for us.  We started building our relationship at Velocity conference in the summer of 2009.    Dyn has recently started offering a geo-aware DNS load balancing solution, using Anycast and the distributed nature of their DNS presence to enable a key component of what we were trying to achieve: steer users to geographically closest origin</p><p>5 0.088245824 <a title="220-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-31-8_Lessons_We_Can_Learn_from_the_MySpace_Incident_-_Balance%2C_Vision%2C_Fearlessness.html">1014 high scalability-2011-03-31-8 Lessons We Can Learn from the MySpace Incident - Balance, Vision, Fearlessness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A surprising amount of heat and light was generated by the whole  Micrsoft vs MySpace  discussion. Why people feel so passionate about this I'm not quite sure, but fortunately for us, in the best sense of the web, it generated an amazing number of insightful comments and observations. If we stand back and take a look at the whole incident, what can we take a way that might help us in the future?
         
  All computer companies are technology companies first.   A repeated theme was that you can't be an entertainment company first. You are a technology company providing entertainment using technology. The tech can inform the entertainment side, the entertainment side drives features, but they really can't be separated. An awesome stack that does nothing is useless. A great idea on a poor stack is just as useless. There's a difficult balance that must be achieved and both management and developers must be aware that there's something to balance.  All pigs are equal .

<p>Introduction: The Third International Conference on Scalable Information Systems will focus on a wide array of scalability issues and investigate new approaches to tackle problems arising from the ever-growing size and complexity of information of all kinds.

<p>Introduction: Surge  is a conference put on by OmniTI targeting practical Scalability matters. OmniTI specializes in helping people solve their scalability problems, as is only natural, as it was founded by Theo Schlossnagle, author of the canonical  Scalable Internet Architectures . 
 
Now that Surge 2011 is on the horizon, they've generously made available nearly all the  videos from the Surge 2010  conference.  A pattern hopefully every conference will follow (only don't wait a year please). We lose a lot of collective wisdom from events not being available online in a timely manner.
 
In truth, nearly  all the talks  are on topic and are worth watching, but here are a few that seem especially relevant:

<p>Introduction: Jesper Söderlund not only put together a few interesting  scalability patterns , he also came up with a few interesting  scalability lessons :
  
  Lesson #1 . Put Smarty compile and template caches on an active-active DRBD cluster with high load and your servers will DIE! 
  Lesson #2 . Don't use out-of-the-box configurations. 
  Lesson #3 . Single points of contention will eventually become a bottleneck. 
  Lesson #4 . Plan in advance.  
  Lesson #5 . Offload your databases as much as possible. 
  Lesson #6 . File systems matter and can run out of space / inodes.

<p>Introduction: With more users interacting, working, purchasing, and communicating over the network than ever before, Web 2.0 infrastructure is taking center stage in many organizations. Demand is rising, and companies are looking for ways to tackle the performance and scalability needs placed on Web infrastructure without raising IT operational expenses. Today companies are turning to efďŹ cient, high-performance, open source solutions as a way to decrease acquisition, licensing, and other ongoing costs and stay within budget constraints.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.82471645 <a title="220-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-22-The_high_scalability_community.html">220 high scalability-2008-01-22-The high scalability community</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     First of all; thanks for a creating a GREAT resource on high scalability architecture. For us building high scalability solutions from the west coast of (tiny) Norway good input on the subject isn't always abundant.     Which leads me to my next question; Are there any events or conferences on high scalability / SaaS in the US or internationally that any of you would recommend architects or data center managers to attend?</p><p>4 0.81069243 <a title="220-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-The_cost_of_High_Availability_%28HA%29_with_Oracle_.html">813 high scalability-2010-04-19-The cost of High Availability (HA) with Oracle </a></p>
<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000 or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.
 
This post focuses on a customer’s backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services and annual support?

<p>Introduction: Recently, I was working on a project that was coming to a close. It was related to optimizing a database using a Java based in-memory cache to reduce the load. The application had to process up to a million objects per day and was characterized by its heavy use of memory and the high number of read, write and update operations. These operations were found to be the most costly, which meant that optimization efforts were concentrated here.  The project had already achieved impressive performance increases, but one question remained unanswered - would changing the JVM increase performance?

<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations.  Jeremy Cole in   On efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GIS   succinctly explains the many uses for such a feature:     Geo-referencing IPs is, in a nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more applications.       This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-rereferncing data, how to load data,  and the performance of different approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to the subject.</p><p>3 0.20378777 <a title="289-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-28-How_to_Get_DNS_Names_of_a_Web_Server.html">290 high scalability-2008-03-28-How to Get DNS Names of a Web Server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server, e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.     The problem is that I'm still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my qu</p><p>4 0.1679365 <a title="289-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-22-7_Secrets_to_Successfully_Scaling_with_Scalr_%28on_Amazon%29_by_Sebastian_Stadil.html">798 high scalability-2010-03-22-7 Secrets to Successfully Scaling with Scalr (on Amazon) by Sebastian Stadil</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a part interview part guest with Sebastian Stadil, founder of  Scalr , a cheaper open-source version of RightScale. Scalr takes care of all the web site infrastructure bits to on Amazon (and other clouds) so you don’t have to.
 
I first met Sebastian at one of the original Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group meetups, a group which he founded. The meetings started in the tiny offices of Intalio where Sebastian was working with this new fangled Amazon thing to create an auto-scaling server farm on EC2. I remember distinctly how Sebastian met everyone at the door with a handshake and a smile, making us all feel welcome. Later I took one of the classes he  created on how to use AWS. I guess he figured all this cloud stuff was going somewhere and decided to start Scalr.
 
My only regret about this post is that the name Amazon does not begin with the letter ‘S’, that would have made for an epic title.

<p>Introduction: When EC2 first started the mental model was of a magic Pez dispenser supplying an infinite stream of instances in any desired flavor. If you needed an instance, because of a either a failure or traffic spike, it would be there. As amazing as EC2 is, this model turned out to be optimistic.  
 
From a  thread on the Amazon discussion forum  we learn any dispenser has limits:
  

As Availability Zones grow over time, our ability to continue to expand them can become constrained. In these scenarios, we will prevent customers from launching in the constrained zone if they do not yet have existing resources in that zone. We also might remove the constrained zone entirely from the list of options for new customers. This means that occasionally, different customers will see a different number of Availability Zones in a particular Region. Both approaches aim to help customers avoid accidentally starting to build up their infrastructure in an Availability Zone where they might have less ability</p><p>6 0.16114816 <a title="289-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-03-The_%E2%80%9CFour_Hamiltons%E2%80%9D_Framework_for_Mitigating_Faults_in_the_Cloud%3A_Avoid_it%2C_Mask_it%2C_Bound_it%2C_Fix_it_Fast.html">1604 high scalability-2014-03-03-The “Four Hamiltons” Framework for Mitigating Faults in the Cloud: Avoid it, Mask it, Bound it, Fix it Fast</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A man had a dream. His dream was to blend a bunch of RSS/Atom/RDF feeds into a single feed. The man is Beau Lebens of  Feedville  and like most dreamers he was a little short on coin. So he took refuge in the home of a cheap hosting provider and Beau realized his dream, creating  FEEDblendr . But FEEDblendr chewed up so much CPU creating blended feeds that the cheap hosting provider ordered Beau to find another home. Where was Beau to go? He eventually found a new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of affordable CPU cycles.

<p>Introduction: Scalr   is a fully redundant, self-curing and self-scaling hosting environment utilizing Amazon's EC2. It has been recently open sourced on Google Code.     Scalr allows you to create server farms through a web-based interface using prebuilt AMI's for load balancers (pound or nginx), app servers (apache, others), databases (mysql master-slave, others), and a generic AMI to build on top of.   Scalr promises automatic high-availability and scaling for developers by health and load monitoring.     The health of the farm is continuously monitored and maintained. When the Load Average on a type of node goes above a configurable threshold a new node is inserted into the farm to spread the load and the cluster is reconfigured. When a node crashes a new machine of that type is inserted into the farm to replace it.       4 AMI's are provided for load balancers, mysql databases, application servers, and a generic base image to customize. Scalr allows you to further customize each image, bundle t</p><p>4 0.65173292 <a title="289-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-02-Evolution_of_Bazaarvoice%E2%80%99s_Architecture_to_500M_Unique_Users_Per_Month.html">1557 high scalability-2013-12-02-Evolution of Bazaarvoice’s Architecture to 500M Unique Users Per Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post written by    Victor Trac   , Cloud Architect at    Bazaarvoice   .  
   Bazaarvoice is a company that people interact with on a regular basis but have probably never heard of. If you read customer reviews on sites like bestbuy.com, nike.com, or walmart.com, you are using Bazaarvoice services. These sites, along with thousands of others, rely on Bazaarvoice to supply the software and technology to collect and display user conversations about products and services. All of this means that Bazaarvoice processes a lot of sentiment data on most of the products we all use daily.

<p>Introduction: This is a part interview part guest with Sebastian Stadil, founder of  Scalr , a cheaper open-source version of RightScale. Scalr takes care of all the web site infrastructure bits to on Amazon (and other clouds) so you don’t have to.
 
I first met Sebastian at one of the original Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group meetups, a group which he founded. The meetings started in the tiny offices of Intalio where Sebastian was working with this new fangled Amazon thing to create an auto-scaling server farm on EC2. I remember distinctly how Sebastian met everyone at the door with a handshake and a smile, making us all feel welcome. Later I took one of the classes he  created on how to use AWS. I guess he figured all this cloud stuff was going somewhere and decided to start Scalr.
 
My only regret about this post is that the name Amazon does not begin with the letter ‘S’, that would have made for an epic title.

<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is adding   Elastic IP Addresses   and   Availability Zones  .     Elastic IP addresses are far better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight with   Jessica Alba   and they are:        Static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures by programmatica</p><p>2 0.95886135 <a title="289-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-04-Paper%3A_An_Analysis_of_Linux_Scalability_to_Many_Cores__.html">914 high scalability-2010-10-04-Paper: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores , by a number of MIT researchers, is a refreshingly practical paper on what it takes to scale Linux and common applications like Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce to run on 48 core systems. A very timely paper given moderately massive multicore systems are reportedly the near future of computing.
 
This paper must have taken a lot of work. They both tracked down bottlenecks in a number of applications and the Linux kernel and they also tried to fix them. Modestly speaking the authors said they made "modest" changes to the kernel and applications, but there's nothing modest about what they did. It's excellent work.
 
After the next bit, which is the abstract, there is a list of the problems they found and how they fixed them.

<p>Introduction: There are many reasons to roll your own  data  storage solution on top of existing technologies. We've seen stories on HighScalability about custom databases for very large sets of individual  data (like Twitter) and large amounts of binary  data  (like Facebook pictures). However, I recently ran into a  unique  type of problem. I was tasked with recording and storing bandwidth information for more than 20,000 servers and their associated networking equipment. This  data  needed to be accessed in real-time, with less than a 5 minute delay between the  data  being recorded and the  data showing up on customer bandwidth graphs on our customer portal.
 
After numerous false starts with off the shelf components and existing database clustering technology, we decided we must roll our own system. The real key to our problem (literally) was the ratio of the size of the key to the size of the actual  data . Because the tracked metric was so small (a 64-bit counter) compared to the  unique  ide</p><p>4 0.94958854 <a title="289-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-04-Changing_Architectures%3A_New_Datacenter_Networks_Will_Set_Your_Code_and_Data_Free___.html">1316 high scalability-2012-09-04-Changing Architectures: New Datacenter Networks Will Set Your Code and Data Free   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: One consequence of IT   standardization and commodification    has been Google’s    datacenter is the computer    view of the world. In that view all compute resources (memory, CPU, storage) are fungible. They are interchangeable and location independent, individual computers lose identity and become just a part of a service.     Thwarting that nirvana has been the abysmal performance of commodity datacenter networks which have caused the preference of architectures that favor the collocation of state and behaviour on the same box. MapReduce famously    ships code over to storage nodes    for just this reason.    Change the network and you change the fundamental assumption driving collocation based software architectures. You are then free to store data anywhere and move compute anywhere you wish. The datacenter becomes the computer.     On the host side with an x8 slot running at    PCI-Express 3.0    speeds able to push 8GB/sec (that’s bytes) of bandwidth in both directions, we have</p><p>5 0.94714671 <a title="289-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-14-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_14th%2C_2014.html">1612 high scalability-2014-03-14-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 14th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Several readers had follow-up questions in response toHow FarmVille Scales to
Harvest 75 Million Players a Month. Here are Luke's response to those
questions (and a few of mine).How does social networking makes things easier
or harder?The primary interesting aspect of social networking games is how you
wind up with a graph of connected users who need to be access each other's
data on a frequent basis. This makes the overall dataset difficult if not
impossible to partition.What are examples of the Facebook calls you try to
avoid and how they impact game play?We can make a call for facebook friend
data to retrieve information about your friends playing the game. Normally, we
show a friend ladder at the bottom of the game that shows friend information,
including name and facebook photo. Can you say where your cache is, what form
it takes, and how much cached there is? Do you have a peering relationship
with Facebook, as one might expect at that bandwidth?We use memcache as our
caching tec</p><p>3 0.17484626 <a title="337-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-26-Facebook%27s_Memcached_Multiget_Hole%3A_More_machines_%21%3D_More_Capacity_.html">728 high scalability-2009-10-26-Facebook's Memcached Multiget Hole: More machines != More Capacity </a></p>
<p>Introduction: When you are on the bleeding edge of scale like Facebook is, you run into some
interesting problems. As of 2008Facebook had over 800 memcached
serverssupplying over 28 terabytes of cache. With those staggering numbers
it's a fair bet to think they've seen their share of Dr. House worthy
memcached problems.Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at
Facebook,describes one such problemthey've dubbed theMultiget Hole.You fall
into the multiget hole when memcached servers areCPU bound, adding more
memcached servers seems like the right way to add more capacity so more
requests can be served, but against all logic adding servers doesn't help
serve more requests. This puts you in a hole that simply adding more servers
can't dig you out of. What's the treatment?Dr. House would immediately notice
the hidden clue, we are talking requests not memory. We aren't running out of
memory to store stuff, we arerunning out of CPU power to process requests.
What happens when you add more servers is</p><p>4 0.14027159 <a title="337-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-13-Why_are_Facebook%2C_Digg%2C_and_Twitter_so_hard_to_scale%3F.html">721 high scalability-2009-10-13-Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things).
That's why scaling Facebook is hardsays Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of
Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and
Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why
would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional
web sites? Let's find out.Traditional websites are easier to scale than social
networking sites for two reasons:They usually access only their own data and
common cached data.Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one
time.Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your
profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the
website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around
single records usingdistributed hashing schemes. And since only a few percent
of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little RAM cache
to handle a</p><p>5 0.12086775 <a title="337-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling_Twitter%3A_Making_Twitter_10000_Percent_Faster.html">639 high scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling Twitter: Making Twitter 10000 Percent Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived

<p>Introduction: Im sure most are familiar with Facebooks 'news feed'. If not, the 'news feed'
basically lists recent activity of all of your friends.I dont see how you can
get this information efficiently from a DB:* Im assuming all user activity is
inserted in a "actions" table.* first get a list of all your friends* then
query the actions table to return recent activity where the activity belongs
to someone on your friends listThis can't be efficient especially considering
some people have 200+ friends.So what am I missing? How do you think Facebook
is implementing their "news feed".Im not asking for any specific details, just
a general point in the right direction, as I cant see how they are
implementing the 'news feed efficiently.Thanks.</p><p>3 0.66777593 <a title="337-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-17-7_Lessons_Learned_While_Building_Reddit_to_270_Million_Page_Views_a_Month.html">828 high scalability-2010-05-17-7 Lessons Learned While Building Reddit to 270 Million Page Views a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Huffman, co-founder of social news site Reddit, gave an
excellentpresentation (slides,transcript) on the lessons he learned while
building and growing Reddit to 7.5 million users per month, 270 million page
views per month, and 20+ database servers.Steve says a lot of the lessons were
really obvious, so you may not find a lot of completely new ideas in the
presentation. But Steve has an earnestness and genuineness about him that is
so obviously grounded in experience that you can't help but think deeply about
what you could be doing different. And if Steve didn't know about these
lessons, I'm betting others don't either.There are seven lessons, each has
their own summary section: Lesson one: Crash Often; Lesson 2: Separation of
Services; Lesson 3: Open Schema; Lesson 4: Keep it Stateless; Lesson 5:
Memcache; Lesson 6: Store Redundant Data; Lesson 7: Work Offline.By far the

<p>Introduction: My first post, please be gentle. I know it is long. You are all like doctors -
the more info, the better the diagnosis.-----------What is the best way to
store a list of all of your friends in the memcached cache (a simple boolean
saying “yes this user is your friend”, or “no”)? Think Robert Scoble (26,000+
“friends”) on Twitter.com. He views a list of ALL existing users, and in this
list, his friends are highlighted.I came up with 4 possible methods:--store in
memcache as an array, a list of all the "yes" friend ID's--store your friend
ID's as individual elements.--store as a hash of arrays based on last 3 digits
of friend's ID -- so have up to 1000 arrays for you.--comma-delimited string
of ID's as one elementI'm using the second one because I think it is faster to
update. The single array or hash of arrays feels like too much overhead
calculating and updating – and even just loading – to check for existence of a
friend.The key is FRIEND[small ID#]_[big ID#]. The value is 1.This way</p><p>2 0.81719786 <a title="337-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-16-Reducing_Your_Website%27s_Bandwidth_Usage_-_how_to.html">494 high scalability-2009-01-16-Reducing Your Website's Bandwidth Usage - how to</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this beautiful morning:  Group Decision
Making in Honey Bee Swarms. In distributed computing systems nodes reach
aquorum when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum
logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:
A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act
and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow
the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether
they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating
the swarm's move to this site.Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.
Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being
a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.Fire! Fire!
Brent Chapman shows how to put that IT fire out in Incident Command for IT:

<p>Introduction: One of the benefits of web applications is that they are generally
transported via TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol designed to
assure delivery. TCP has a variety of native mechanisms through which delivery
issues can be addressed - from window sizes to selective acks to idle time
specification to ramp up parameters. All these technical knobs and buttons
serve as a way for operators and administrators to tweak the protocol, often
at run time, to ensure the exchange of requests and responses upon which web
applications rely. This is unlike UDP, which is more of a "fire and forget"
protocol in which the server doesn't really care if you receive the data or
not.Now, voice and streaming video and audio over the web has always leveraged
UDP and thus it has always been highly sensitive to jitter. Jitter is, without
getting into layer one (physical) jargon, an undesirable delay in the
otherwise consistent delivery of packets. It causes the delay of and sometimes
outright loss of p</p><p>5 0.80022019 <a title="337-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-10-ElasticSearch_-_Open_Source%2C_Distributed%2C_RESTful_Search_Engine.html">775 high scalability-2010-02-10-ElasticSearch - Open Source, Distributed, RESTful Search Engine</a></p>

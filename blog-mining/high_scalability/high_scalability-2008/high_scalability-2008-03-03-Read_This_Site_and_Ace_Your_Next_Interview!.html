<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: " High Performance at Massive Scale –  Lessons learned at Facebook ". The abstract for the talk is:
  

Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web architectures.

  
There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into  later, but I thought you might want a head start on learning how Facebook handles 30K+ machines,</p><p>3 0.14979306 <a title="264-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-23-The_Real_News_is_Not_that_Facebook_Serves_Up_1_Trillion_Pages_a_Month%E2%80%A6.html">1123 high scalability-2011-09-23-The Real News is Not that Facebook Serves Up 1 Trillion Pages a Month…</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s some amount of debate whether Facebook  really  crossed over the one trillion page view per month threshold. While one report says it did,  another respected firm says it did not ; that its monthly page views are a mere 467 billion per month.


In the big scheme of things, the discrepancy is somewhat irrelevant, as neither show the  true  load on Facebook’s infrastructure – which is far more impressive a set of numbers than its externally measured “page view” metric.  Mashable reported in “ Facebook Surpasses 1 Trillion Pageviews per Month ” that the social networking giant saw “approximately 870 million unique visitors in June and 860 million in July” and followed up with some per visitor statistics, indicating “each visitor averaged approximately 1,160 page views in July and 40 per visit — enormous by any standard. Time spent on the site was around 25 minutes per user.”


From an architectural standpoint it’s not  just  about the page views. It’s about requests and responses,</p><p>4 0.14722317 <a title="264-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring_the_software_behind_Facebook%2C_the_world%E2%80%99s_largest_site.html">845 high scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring the software behind Facebook, the world’s largest site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Peter Alguacil at Pingdom wrote a HighScalability worthy article on Facebook's architecture:  Exploring the software behind Facebook, the world’s largest site . It covers the challenges Facebook faces, the software Facebook uses, and the techniques Facebook uses to keep on scaling.

<p>Introduction: This post about using Hive and Hadoop for analytics comes straight from Facebook engineers.  Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis and business intelligence applications used by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook products are also based on analytics.   These products range from simple reporting applications like Insights for the Facebook Ad Network, to more advanced kind such as Facebook's Lexicon product.   As a result a flexible infrastructure that caters to the needs of these diverse applications and users and that also scales up in a cost effective manner with the ever increasing amounts of data being generated on Facebook, is critical. Hive and Hadoop are the technologies that we have used to address these requirements at Facebook.

<p>Introduction: Facebook made quite a splash when they released their  native iOS app , not because of their app per se, but because of their conclusion that their  biggest mistake was betting on HTML5 , so they had to go native.
 
As you might imagine this was a bit like telling a Great White Shark that its bark is worse than its bite.  A  common refrain  was Facebook simply had made a bad HTML5 site, not that HTML5 itself is bad, as plenty of other vendors have made slick well performing mobile sites.
 
An interesting and relevant conversation given the rising butt kickery of mobile. But we were lacking details. Now we aren't. If you were wondering just why Facebook ditched HTML5, Tobie Langel in  Perf Feedback - What's slowing down Mobile Facebook , lists out the reasons:
  
  Tooling / Developer APIs . Most importantly, the lack of tooling to track down memory problems.  
  Scrolling performance.  Scrolling must be fast and smooth and full featured. It's not.

<p>Introduction: Paul Tyma published a massive and massively good 96 page insider's manual on   How to Pass a Silicon Valley Software Engineering Interview  . My eyes immediately latched on to one of his key example scenarios, which involves scaling Facebook:           Facebook     ● What was Facebook day 1?   – A database with a PHP front-end   ● In PHP, Java, C#, whatever   – How long would it take you to reproduce Facebook's first incarnation?   ● A single MySQL instance with some simple queries probably used to happily query the whole userbase.       Facebook     ● What is it today?   ● Its not about “that stuff you learned in school”   – Its about what a company with thousands of (possibly conflicting) queries per second operating   on a directed-graph with 50 million nodes   ● And of course a few Petabytes of data   ● And 99.99% uptime   ● Design decision? A Facebook user is (or recently was) currently limited to 5000 friends.

<p>Introduction: Oh, you don't have a Quantum Computer Lab staffed with researchers? Well, Google does. Here they are  on G+ . To learn what they are up to the Verge has  A first look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab . The lab is partnership between NASA, Google, and a 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum computer.  
 
One result from the lab is:
  

The first practical application has been on Google Glass, as engineers put the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks. For engineering reasons, the quantum processor can never be installed in Glass, but together with Google's conventional server centers, it can point the way to a better blink-detecting algorithm. That would allow the Glass processor to detect blinks with better accuracy and using significantly less power. If successful, it could be an important breakthrough for wink-triggered apps, which have struggled with the task so far.

<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle , infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made a  really interesting statement  about the economics of scale in the datacenter:
  

Weâ&euro;&trade;ve shown that when you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.

  
My first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>4 0.94385856 <a title="264-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-27-Big_Data_In_the_Cloud_Using_Cloudify.html">1216 high scalability-2012-03-27-Big Data In the Cloud Using Cloudify</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill  wrote an interesting article on O’Reilly Radar covering the current solutions for running  Big Data in the Cloud   
  Big data and cloud technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing, which clouds can readily provide.
   Big PaaS 
  Edd touched briefly on the role of PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloud
  Beyond IaaS, several cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes referred to as managed solutions, or  platform as a service   (PaaS), these services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce, reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass those savings on to the customer.
 
To put it simply, managing data clusters is one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we need to think about when we’re dealing with application platforms, as I no</p><p>5 0.94170135 <a title="264-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

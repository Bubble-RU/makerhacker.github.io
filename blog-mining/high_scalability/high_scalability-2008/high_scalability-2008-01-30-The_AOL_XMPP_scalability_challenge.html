<p>Introduction: Update :  Erlang at Facebook  by Eugene Letuchy. How Facebook uses Erlang to implement Chat, AIM Presence, and Chat Jabber support.  
 
I've done some  XMPP  development so when I read  Facebook was making a Jabber chat client  I was really curious how they would make it work. While core XMPP is straightforward, a number of protocol extensions like discovery, forms, chat states, pubsub, multi user chat, and privacy lists really up the implementation complexity. Some real engineering challenges were involved to make this puppy scale and perform.  It's not clear what extensions they've  implemented, but a blog entry by Facebook's Eugene Letuchy hits some of the architectural challenges they faced and how they overcame them.
 
A web based Jabber client poses a few problems because XMPP, like most IM protocols, is an asynchronous event driven system that pretty much assumes you have a full time open connection. After logging in the server sends a client roster information and presence info</p><p>3 0.17069232 <a title="234-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-19-Twitter%E2%80%99s_Plan_to_Analyze_100_Billion_Tweets.html">780 high scalability-2010-02-19-Twitter’s Plan to Analyze 100 Billion Tweets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If Twitter is the “nervous system of the web” as some people think, then what is the brain that makes sense of all those signals (tweets) from the nervous system? That brain is the Twitter Analytics System and Kevin Weil,  as Analytics Lead at Twitter,  is the homunculus within in charge of figuring out what those over 100 billion tweets (approximately the number of neurons in the human brain) mean.
 
Twitter has only 10% of the expected 100 billion tweets now, but a good brain always plans ahead. Kevin gave a talk,  Hadoop and Protocol Buffers at Twitter , at the  Hadoop Meetup , explaining how Twitter plans to use all that data to an answer key business questions.
 
What type of questions is Twitter interested in answering? Questions that help them better understand Twitter. Questions like:
  
  How many requests do we serve in  a day?  
  What is the average latency? 
  How many searches happen in day?  
  How many unique queries, how many unique users, what is their geographic dist</p><p>4 0.14404686 <a title="234-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me_Architecture_-_Synchronicity_Kills.html">431 high scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me Architecture - Synchronicity Kills</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What's cool about starting a new project is you finally have a chance to do it right. You of course eventually mess everything up in your own way, but for that one moment the world has a perfect order, a rightness that feels satisfying and good. Arne Claassen, the CTO of notify.me, a brand new real time notification delivery service, is in this honeymoon period now.  Arne has been gracious enough to share with us his philosophy of how to build a notification service. I think you'll find it fascinating because Arne goes into a lot of useful detail about how his system works.    His main design philosophy is to minimize the bottlenecks that form around synchronous access, that is when  some resource is requested and the requestor ties up more resources, waiting for a response. If the requested resource can’t be delivered in a timely manner, more and more requests pile up until the server can’t accept any new ones. Nobody gets what they want and you have an outage.

<p>Introduction: If you are a normal human being and find the  Paxos protocol  confusing, then this paper,  Paxos Made Moderately Complex , is a great find. Robbert van Renesse from Cornell University has written a clear and well written paper with excellent explanations.
 
The Abstract:
  For anybody who has ever tried to implement it, Paxos is by no means a simple protocol, even though it is based on relatively simple invariants. This paper provides imperative pseudo-code for the full Paxos (or Multi-Paxos) protocol without shying away from discussing various implementation details. The initial description avoids optimizations that complicate comprehension. Next we discuss liveness, and list various optimizations that make the protocol practical.   Related Articles

<p>Introduction: So how do you knit multiple datacenters and many thousands of phones and other clients into a single cooperating system?
 
Usually you don't. It's too hard. We see nascent attempts in services like Firebase and Parse. 
 
 SwiftCloud , as described in  SwiftCloud: Fault-Tolerant Geo-Replication Integrated all the Way to the Client Machine , goes two steps further, by leveraging Conflict free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), which means "data can be replicated at multiple sites and be updated independently with the guarantee that all replicas converge to the same value. In a cloud environment, this allows a user to access the data center closer to the user, thus optimizing the latency for all users."
 
While we don't see these kind of systems just yet, they are a strong candidate for how things will work in the future, efficiently using resources at every level while supporting huge numbers of cooperating users.

<p>Introduction: Here are a few updates on the article  Paper: Don’t Settle For Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS  from Mike Freedman and Wyatt Lloyd.
 
 Q: How software architectures could change in response to casual+ consistency? 
 
 A : I don't really think they would much. Somebody would still run a two-tier architecture in their datacenter:  a front-tier of webservers running both (say) PHP and our client library, and a back tier of storage nodes running COPS.  (I'm not sure if it was obvious given the discussion of our "thick" client -- you should think of the COPS client dropping in where a memcache client library does...albeit ours has per-session state.)
 
 
 
 Q: Why not just use vector clocks? 
 
 A : The problem with vector clocks and scalability has always been that the size of vector clocks in O(N), where N is the number of nodes.  So if we want to scale to a datacenter with 10K nodes, each piece of metadata must have size O(10K).  And in fact, vector</p><p>4 0.49608028 <a title="234-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-10-Paper%3A_Paxos_Made_Moderately_Complex.html">1243 high scalability-2012-05-10-Paper: Paxos Made Moderately Complex</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Georeplication is one of the standard techniques for dealing when bad things--failure and latency--happen to good systems. The problem is always: how do you do that?  Murat Demirbas , Associate Professor at SUNY Buffalo, has a couple of really good posts that can help:  MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency  and  Making Geo-Replicated Systems Fast as Possible, Consistent when Necessary . 
 
In  MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency  Murat discusses a paper that says synchronous wide-area replication can be feasible. There's a quick and clear explanation of Paxos and various optimizations that is worth the price of admission. We find that strong consistency doesn't have to be lost across a WAN:
  

The good thing about using Paxos over the WAN is you /almost/ get the full CAP  (all three properties: consistency, availability, and partition-freedom). As we discussed earlier (Paxos taught), Paxos is CP, that is, in the presence of a partition, Paxos keeps consistency over availability. But, P</p><p>6 0.4898369 <a title="234-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-10-Paper%3A_Consensus_Protocols%3A_Paxos___.html">529 high scalability-2009-03-10-Paper: Consensus Protocols: Paxos   </a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting and still relevant research paper by Jim Gray, Prashant Shenoy at Microsoft Research that examines the rules of thumb for the design of data storage systems. It looks at storage, processing, and networking costs, ratios, and trends with a particular focus on performance and price/performance.     Jim Gray has an updated presentation on this interesting topic:   Long Term Storage Trends and You  . Robin Harris has a great post that reflects on the Rules of Thumb whitepaper on his StorageMojo blog:   Architecting the Internet Data Center - Parts I-IV  .</p><p>3 0.64025891 <a title="234-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-What_is_Mashery%3F.html">48 high scalability-2007-07-30-What is Mashery?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Bees have a similar problem to website servers: how to do a lot of work with limited resources in an ever changing environment. Usually lessons from biology are hard to apply to computer problems. Nature throws hardware at problems. Billions and billions of cells cooperate at different levels of organizations to find food, fight lions, and make sure your DNA is passed on.   Nature's software is "simple," but her hardware rocks. We do the opposite. For us hardware is in short supply so we use limited hardware and leverage "smart" software to work around our inability to throw hardware at problems. But we might be able to borrow some load balancing techniques from bees. What do bees do that we can learn from?
 
Bees do a dance to indicate the quality and location of a nectar source. When a bee finds a better source they do a better dance and resources shift to the new location.  This approach may seem inefficient, but it turns out to be "optimal for the unpredictable nectar world."

have people fill out this template and that then becomes the basis for a

turned out well. People always want more detail, but realistically you can
only expect so much.The template is definitely too long, but it's more just a
series of questions to jog people's memories and then they can answer whatever
they think is important.What I want to ask is if you can think of any things
to add/delete/change in the template? What do you want to know about the
systems people are building? So if you have the time, please take a look and
tell me what you think.Getting to Know You* What is the name of your system

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived
processes) and why they moved toScalato program against it (high level

<p>Introduction: Several months ago I attended a Joyent presentation where the spokesman hinted
that Joyent had the chops to support a one billion page per month Facebook
Ruby on Rails application. Even under a few seconds of merciless grilling he
would not give up the name of the application. Now we have the big reveal: it
was LinkedIn'sBumper Stickerapp. For those not currently sticking things on
bumps, Bumper Sticker is quite surprisingly aviral media sharing application
that allows users to express their individuality by sticking small virtual
stickers on Facebook profiles. At the time I was quite curious how Joyent's
cloud approach could be leveraged for this kind of app. Now that they've
released a few details, we get to find out.Site:

<p>Introduction: Slashdot effect: overwhelming unprepared sites with an avalanche of reader's
clicks after being mentioned on Slashdot. Sure, we now have the "Digg effect"
and other hot new stars, but Slashdot was the original. And like many stars
from generations past, Slashdot plays the elder statesman's role with with
class, dignity, and restraint. Yet with millions and millions of users
Slashdot is still box office gold and more than keeps up with the young'ins.
And with age comes the wisdom of learning how to handle all those users. Just
how does Slashdot scale and what can you learn by going old school?breakSite:

<p>Introduction: Update 7:Basecamp, now with more vroom. Basecamp application servers running
Ruby code were upgraded and virtualization was removed. The result:A 66 %
reduction in the response time while handling multiples of the traffic is
beyond what I expected. They still use virtualization (Linux KVM), just less
of it now.Update 6:Things We've Learned at 37Signals. Themes: less is more;
don't worry be happy.Update 5:Nuts & Bolts: HAproxy. Nice explanation (post,
screencast) by Mark Imbriaco of why HAProxy (load balancing proxy server) is
their favorite (fast, efficient, graceful configuration, queues requests when
Mongrels are busy) for spreading dynamic content between Apache web servers

an old(2009), yet still very good post byLadar Levisonon Lavabit's

it should give you a general idea what Lavabit was all about.Getting to Know

abit.com/network.htmlhttp://lavabit.com/about.htmlWhat is your system
for?Lavabit is a mid-sized email service provider. We currently have about
140,000 registered users with more than 260,000 email addresses. While most of
our accounts belong to individual users, we also provide corporate email
services to approximately 70 companies.Why did you decide to build this
system?We built the system to compete against the other large free email
providers, with an emphasis on serving the privacy conscious and technically
savvy user. Lavabit was one of</p><p>6 0.79186004 <a title="313-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-03-MocoSpace_Architecture_-_3_Billion_Mobile_Page_Views_a_Month.html">821 high scalability-2010-05-03-MocoSpace Architecture - 3 Billion Mobile Page Views a Month</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Combining GPU power with PostgreSQLPostgreSQL is one of the world's leading
Open Source databases and it provides enormous flexibility as well as
extensibility. One of the key features of PostgreSQL is that users can define
their own procedures and functions in basically any known programming
language. With the means of functions it is possible to write basically any
server side codes easily.Now, all this extensibility is basically not new.
What does it all have to do with scaling and then? Well, imagine a world where
the data in your database and enormous computing power are tightly integrated.
Imagine a world where data inside your database has direct access to hundreds
of FPUs. Welcome to the world of CUDA, NVIDIA's way of making the power of
graphics cards available to normal, high-performance applications.When it
comes to complex computations databases might very well turn out to be a
bottleneck. Depending on your application it might easily happen that adding
more CPU power does</p><p>2 0.97770894 <a title="313-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_18th%2C_2014.html">1634 high scalability-2014-04-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 18th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the Stack Overflow Architecture.
Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack
Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up
and out in the last few years.Stack Overflow has grown up by more then
doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page
views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  Stack Overflow has
grown out by expanding into theStack Exchange Network, which includes Stack
Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different
sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.What hasn't changed is
Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted
this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been
handling their growth: Stack Exchange's Architecture in Bullet Points, Stack
Overflow's New York Data Center, Designing For Scalability of Management and

<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300
thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially
experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems
and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each
day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly
visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a
very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale
meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?Site:

<p>Introduction: ThemBid provides a market where people needing work done broadcast their
request and accept bids from people competing for the job. Unlike many of the
sites profiled at HighScalability, ThemBid is not in the popular press as
often as Paris Hilton. It's not a media darling or a giant of the industry.
But what I like is they have a strategy, a point-of-view for building websites
and were gracious enough to share very detailed instructions on how to go
about building a website. They even delve into actual installation details of
the various software packages they use. Anyone can benefit by taking a look at
their work.Site: http://www.thembid.com/Information SourcesBuild Scalable Web

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steffen Konerow, author of theHigh Performance
Blog.Learning how to scale isn't easy without any prior experience. Nowadays
you have plenty of websites likehighscalability.comto get some inspiration,
but unfortunately there is no solution that fits all websites and needs. You
still have to think on your own to find a concept that works for your
requirements. So did I.A few years ago, my bosses came to me and said "We've
got a new project for you. It's the relaunch of a website that has already 1
million users a month. You have to build the website and make sure we'll be
able to grow afterwards". I was already an experienced coder, but not in these
dimensions, so I had to start learning how to scale - the hard way.The
software behind the website was a PHP content management system, based on
Smarty and MySQL. The first task was finding a proper hosting company who had
the experience and would also manage the servers for us. After some research
we found one, told t</p><p>5 0.16850686 <a title="248-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-12-Using_Varnish_for_Paywalls%3A_Moving_Logic_to_the_Edge.html">1321 high scalability-2012-09-12-Using Varnish for Paywalls: Moving Logic to the Edge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post fromPer Buer, founder and CEO of Varnish Software,
provider of Varnish Cache, an open source web application accelerator freely
available at varnish-cache.org. Varnish powers a lot of really big websites
worldwide.We at Varnish Software are all about speed. Varnish Cache is built
for speed. It executes its policy code more or less a thousand times faster
than your typical Java or PHP based application servers, mostly due to the
fact that the configuration is compiled into system call free machine
code.System calls require expensive context switches, stall the CPU and wreck
havoc in the CPU cache so avoiding them makes the code fly. There are strong
limitations on what kind of logic you can move into Varnish Cache, but the
logic that you do move there will run very fast.An example is using Varnish
for access control to serve access controlled content from the caching edge
layer.The Varnish PaywallWho gets to access your content? In a traditional
environment the cach</p><p>6 0.16738586 <a title="248-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-27-Handle_700_Percent_More_Requests_Using_Squid_and_APC_Cache.html">662 high scalability-2009-07-27-Handle 700 Percent More Requests Using Squid and APC Cache</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a

<p>Introduction: As a tasty pairing withFacebook And Site Failures Caused By Complex, Weakly
Interacting, Layered Systems, is another excellent tale of caching gone wrong
by Peter Zaitsev, in an exciting twin billing:Cache Miss Stormand More on
dangers of the caches. This is fascinating case where the cause turned out to
be software upgrade that ran long because it had to be rolled back. During the
long recovery time many of the cache entries timed out. When the database came
back, slam, all the clients queried the database to repopulate the cache and
bad things happened to the database. The solution was equally interesting: So
the immediate solution to bring the system up was surprisingly simple. We just
had to get traffic on the system in stages allowing Memcache to be warmed up.
There were no code which would allow to do it on application side so we did it
on MySQL side instead. "SET GLOBAL max_connections=20" to limit number of
connections to MySQL and so let application to err when it tries to put</p><p>5 0.78182012 <a title="248-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-23-6_Ways_to_Kill_Your_Servers_-__Learning_How_to_Scale_the_Hard_Way.html">884 high scalability-2010-08-23-6 Ways to Kill Your Servers -  Learning How to Scale the Hard Way</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you plan to scale your system as you reach predictable milestones? This
topic came up in another venue and it reminded me about a great comment an
Anonymous wrote a while ago and I wanted to make sure that comment didn't get
lost.The Anonymous scaling plan was relatively simple and direct:My two cents
on what I'm using to start a website from scratch using a single server for
now. Later, I'll scale out horizontally when the need arises.Phase
1breakSingle Server, Dual Quad-Core 2.66, 8gb RAM, 500gb Disk Raid 10OS:
Fedora 8. You could go with pretty much any Linux though. I like Fedora 8 best
for servers.Proxy Cache: Varnish - it is way faster than Squid per my own
benchmarks. Squid chokes bigtime.Web Server: Lighttpd - faster than Apache 2
and easier to configure for me.Object Cache: Memcached. Very scalable.PHP
Cache: APC. Easy to configure and seems to work fine.Language: PHP 5 - no
bloated frameworks, waste of time for me. You spend too much time trying to

<p>Introduction: Release It!authorMichael Nygard tells a tale of two web sites, both brought
low by unexpectedly huge unbounded results sets that slowed down their sites
to the speed of a Christmas checkout line.I've committed this error more than
a few times. During testing the results sets are often small, so you don't see
problems. Or when a product is new you don't have a lot of data so everything
is fine, until some magic line is crossed and you get that dreaded 2AM fix it
call.breakMy most embarrassing bug of this type caused a rather spectacular
failure at a customer site as the variance in response times was out of spec
and this kicked in penalty clauses. What happened was the customer had a
larger network than we could even test (customers always get the good stuff).
I took a lock and went to get all the data. Because the result set was so much
larger in their larger system I took the lock for many more milliseconds than
I should have.

<p>Introduction: Update:Social networks in the database: using a graph database. A nice post on
representing, traversing, and performing other common social network
operations using a graph database.If you areDiggorLinkedInyou can build your
own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network
relationships. For those of more modest meansNeo4j, a graph database, is a
good alternative.A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges
(relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs)
on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to
represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships
are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and
relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look
at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for
relationships."A graph looks something like:For more lovely examples take a

<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting
HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting
services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary.
Thanks for the thought though.It's been a long long long process. Importing a
largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like
dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the
site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm
betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things.I'll
explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia
that needs to be handled to make the move complete:If you have a user account
and have posted on HighScalability before then you have a user account, but
since I don't know your passwords I had to make new passwords up for you. So

<p>Introduction: Update 4::Introducing Digg's IDDB Infrastructureby Joe Stump.IDDB is a way to
partition both indexes (e.g. integer sequences and unique character indexes)
and actual tables across multiple storage servers (MySQL and MemcacheDB are
currently supported with more to follow).Update 3::Scaling Digg and Other Web
Applications.Update 2::How Digg WorksandHow Digg Really Works(wear ear plugs).
Brought to you straight from Digg's blog. A very succinct explanation of the
major elements of the Digg architecture while tracing a request through the
system. I've updated this profile with the new information.Update:Digg now
receives 230 million plus page views per month and 26 million unique visitors
- traffic that necessitated major internal upgrades.Traffic generated by
Digg's over 22 million famously info-hungry users and 230 million page views
can crash an unsuspecting website head-on into its CPU, memory, and bandwidth
limits. How does Digg handle billions of requests a month?Site:

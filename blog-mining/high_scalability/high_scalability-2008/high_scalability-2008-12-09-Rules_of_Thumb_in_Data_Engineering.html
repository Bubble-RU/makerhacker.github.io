<p>Introduction: Update :   Parascale’s CTO on what’s different about Parascale .   Let's say you have gigglebytes of data to store and you aren't sure you want to use a  CDN . Amazon's  S3  doesn't excite you. And you aren't quite ready to join the  grid  nation. You want to keep it all in house. Wouldn't it be nice to have something like the  Google File System  you could use to create a unified file system out of all your disks sitting on all your nodes?
 
According to Robin Harris, a.k.a  StorageMojo  (a great blog BTW), you can now have your own GFS:  Parascale launches Google-like storage software .  Parascale  calls their softwate a Virtual Storage Network (VSN). It "aggregates disks across commodity Linux x86 servers to deliver petabyte-scale file storage. With features such as automated, transparent file replication and file migration, Parascale eliminates storage hotspots and delivers massive read/write bandwidth." Why should you care?

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean: can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something useful? 
 
Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often do very little to help front-line developers succeed. 
 
How many ideas break out of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distribu</p><p>5 0.081009313 <a title="463-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-08-Art_of_Parallelism_presentation.html">652 high scalability-2009-07-08-Art of Parallelism presentation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Professor Lance Fortnow, in his blog post  Drowning in Data , says complexity has taught him this lesson:  When storage is expensive, it is cheaper to recompute what you've already computed. And that's the world we now live in: Storage is pretty cheap but data acquisition and computation are even cheaper. 
 
Jouni, one of the commenters, thinks the opposite is true:  storage is cheap, but computation is expensive. When you are dealing with massive data, the size of the data set is very often determined by the amount of computing power available for a certain price .  With such data, a linear-time algorithm takes O(1) seconds to finish, while a quadratic-time algorithm requires O(n) seconds. But as computing power increases exponentially over time, the quadratic algorithm gets exponentially slower .
 
For me it's not a matter of which is true, both positions can be true, but what's interesting is to think that storage and computation are in some cases fungible. Your architecture can dec</p><p>3 0.65887964 <a title="463-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-06-Paper%3A_Scaling_Genome_Sequencing_-_Complete_Genomics_Technology_Overview.html">403 high scalability-2008-10-06-Paper: Scaling Genome Sequencing - Complete Genomics Technology Overview</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in terms of scalability. The  paper  describes a new technology by the startup company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction of the cost of earlier possibilities.  Complete Genomics is building the worldâ&euro;&trade;s largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey, outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.  By 2010, their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30 petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.

<p>Introduction: “ Data is everywhere, never be at a single location. Not scalable, not maintainable. ”  –Alex Szalay    While Galileo played life and death doctrinal games over the mysteries revealed by the telescope, another revolution went unnoticed, the microscope gave up mystery after mystery and nobody yet understood how subversive would be what it revealed. For the first time these new tools of perceptual augmentation allowed humans to peek behind the veil of appearance. A new new eye driving human invention and discovery for hundreds of years.     Data is another    material    that hides, revealing itself only when we look at different scales and investigate its underlying patterns. If the universe is truly    made of information   , then we are looking into truly primal stuff. A new eye is needed for Data and an ambitious project called    Data-scope    aims to be the lens.     A detailed    paper    on the Data-Scope tells more about what it is:

<p>Introduction: In case you are interested here's the info:     INFOSCALE 2009: The 4th International ICST Conference on Scalable Information Systems. 10-12 June 2009, Hong Kong, China.     In the last few years, we have seen the proliferation of the use of heterogeneous distributed systems, ranging from simple Networks of Workstations, to highly complex grid computing environments. Such computational paradigms have been preferred due to their reduced costs and inherent scalability, which pose many challenges to scalable systems and applications in terms of information access, storage and retrieval.     Grid computing, P2P technology, data and knowledge bases, distributed information retrieval technology and networking technology should all converge to address the scalability concern. Furthermore, with the advent of emerging computing architectures - e.g. SMTs, GPUs, Multicores. - the importance of designing techniques explicitly targeting these systems is becoming more and more important.

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting and still relevant research paper by Jim Gray, Prashant Shenoy at Microsoft Research that examines the rules of thumb for the design of data storage systems. It looks at storage, processing, and networking costs, ratios, and trends with a particular focus on performance and price/performance.     Jim Gray has an updated presentation on this interesting topic:   Long Term Storage Trends and You  . Robin Harris has a great post that reflects on the Rules of Thumb whitepaper on his StorageMojo blog:   Architecting the Internet Data Center - Parts I-IV  .</p><p>2 0.83546865 <a title="463-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-30-The_AOL_XMPP_scalability_challenge.html">234 high scalability-2008-01-30-The AOL XMPP scalability challenge</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Bees have a similar problem to website servers: how to do a lot of work with limited resources in an ever changing environment. Usually lessons from biology are hard to apply to computer problems. Nature throws hardware at problems. Billions and billions of cells cooperate at different levels of organizations to find food, fight lions, and make sure your DNA is passed on.   Nature's software is "simple," but her hardware rocks. We do the opposite. For us hardware is in short supply so we use limited hardware and leverage "smart" software to work around our inability to throw hardware at problems. But we might be able to borrow some load balancing techniques from bees. What do bees do that we can learn from?
 
Bees do a dance to indicate the quality and location of a nectar source. When a bee finds a better source they do a better dance and resources shift to the new location.  This approach may seem inefficient, but it turns out to be "optimal for the unpredictable nectar world."

<p>Introduction: In the wake of the recent Amazon problems  Ryan Lackey  offers some practical first responder cloud survival advice:
  If you're a large site (particularly a PaaS) on AWS and care about availability, you need to have spare capacity in your region (using Reserve Instances, like Netflix does) to cover when a single AZ disappears, and your own external to AWS load balancing (not DNS based), with your own per-AZ subsidiary load balancers (nginx or whatever) running within EC2.   You need a robust database layer, ideally multi-region or AWS + nonAWS, but that's more site specific.     Going multiregion is the next step, and the above is an essential part of getting to that point.</p><p>6 0.56801331 <a title="463-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-17-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_17th%2C_2014.html">1581 high scalability-2014-01-17-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 17th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose limits (  GAE Quotas  ,   Fotolog  ,   Facebook  ) as a means of protecting a website against service destroying   traffic spikes  . Twitter will reportedly   limit the number followers   to 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow Twitter to make some bank by   going freemium   and charging for adding more followers.     Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established ecosystem?      One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is, however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service. Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.      Now in Twitter's case the people with the most followers tend to be o</p><p>3 0.1085924 <a title="201-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-25-Let%27s_Welcome_our_Neo-Feudal_Overlords.html">765 high scalability-2010-01-25-Let's Welcome our Neo-Feudal Overlords</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  Stack Overflow Architecture Update - Now At 95 Million Page Views A Month , a commenter expressed surprise about Stack Overflow's backup strategy: 
  

Backup is to disk for fast retrieval and to tape for historical archiving.

  
The comment was:
  

Really? People still do this? I know some organizations invested a tremendous amount in automated, robotic tape backup, but seriously, a site founded in 2008 is backing up to tape?

   The Case of the Missing Gmail Accounts  
I admit that I was surprised at this strategy too. In this age of copying data to disk three times for safety, I also wondered if tape backups were still necessary? Then, like in a movie, an event happened that made sense of everything, Google suffered the quintessential  #firstworldproblem , gmail accounts went missing! Queue emphatic music. And what's more they were taking a long time to come back. There was a palpable fear in the land that email accounts might never be restored. Think about that.

<p>Introduction: Oh, you don't have a Quantum Computer Lab staffed with researchers? Well, Google does. Here they are  on G+ . To learn what they are up to the Verge has  A first look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab . The lab is partnership between NASA, Google, and a 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum computer.  
 
One result from the lab is:
  

The first practical application has been on Google Glass, as engineers put the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks. For engineering reasons, the quantum processor can never be installed in Glass, but together with Google's conventional server centers, it can point the way to a better blink-detecting algorithm. That would allow the Glass processor to detect blinks with better accuracy and using significantly less power. If successful, it could be an important breakthrough for wink-triggered apps, which have struggled with the task so far.

<p>Introduction: The world has changed. And some things that should not have been forgotten, were lost.  I found these words from the Lord of the Rings echoing in my head as I listened to a fascinating presentation by  Luiz André Barroso , Distinguished Engineer at Google, concerning Google's legendary past, golden present, and apocryphal future. His talk,  Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering the Teenage Decade , was given at the  Federated Computing Research Conference . Luiz clearly knows his stuff and was early at Google, so he has a deep and penetrating perspective on the technology. There's much to learn from, think about, and build.

<p>Introduction: Kevin Burton calculates that   Blekko  , one of the barbarian hoard storming Google's search fortress, would need to spend $5 million just to buy enough weapons, er storage.      Kevin estimates storing a deep crawl of the internet would take about 5 petabytes. At a projected $1 million per petabyte that's a paltry $5 million. Less than expected. Imagine in days of old an ambitious noble itching to raise an army to conquer a land and become its new prince. For a fine land, and the search market is one of the richest, that would be a smart investment for a VC to make.      In these situations I always ask: What would Machiavelli do?        Machiavelli taught some lands are hard to conquer and easy to keep and some are easy to conquer and hard to keep. A land like France was easy to conquer because it was filled with nobles. You can turn nobles on each other because they always hate each other for some reason or another. But it's hard to keep a land of nobles because they all think they</p><p>2 0.61046469 <a title="201-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Howto_setup_GFS-GNBD.html">227 high scalability-2008-01-28-Howto setup GFS-GNBD</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Before you proceed make sure you have physical volume(something like /dev/sda1, /dev/sda4, etc) with no data. This is going to be the gfs volume which you will export to other nodes. It should be on the node which is going to be your gnbd server. If you dont have such volume create one using fdisk.     I used mounted gfs volume as a DOCUMENT ROOT for my Apache server nodes(Load Balanced).     I tried it on FC4 64-bit. If you plan to try it on any other distribution or 32-bit arch.. still the procedure remains same. Since I built it from source but not RPMs, you may have to simply supply config options with a different CFLAGS.

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble  is a kind of Brothers Grimm for the digital age. Instead of inspired romantics walking around the country side collecting the folk tales of past ages, he is an inspired technologist documenting the current mythology of startups.
 
One of the developments Robert is exploring is the rise of the  contextual age . Where every bit of information about you is continually being prodded, pulled, and observed, shoveled into a great learning machine, and turned into a fully actionable  knowledge graph  of context. A digital identity more real to software than your physical body ever was. 
 
Sinner or saviour, the Age of Context has interesting implications for startups. It raises the entrance bar to dizzying heights. Much of the reason companies are tearing down the Golden Age of the Web, one open protocol at a time, is to create a walled garden of monopolized information.
 
To operate in this world you will have to somehow create a walled garden of your own. And it will be a damn</p><p>4 0.50601083 <a title="201-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-20-Paper%3A_Log-structured_Memory_for_DRAM-based_Storage_-_High_Memory_Utilization_Plus_High_Performance.html">1616 high scalability-2014-03-20-Paper: Log-structured Memory for DRAM-based Storage - High Memory Utilization Plus High Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Most every programmer who gets sucked into deep performance analysis for long running processes eventually realizes memory allocation is the heart of evil at the center of many of their problems. So you replace malloc with something less worse. Or you tune your garbage collector like a fineÂ ukulele. But there's a smarter approach brought to you from the folks at  RAMCloud , a Stanford University production, which is a large scale, distributed, in-memory key-value database.
 
What they've found is that typical memory management approaches don't work and using a log structured approach yields massive benefits:
  

Performance measurements of log-structured memory in RAMCloud show that it enables high client through- put at 80-90% memory utilization, even with artificially stressful workloads. In the most stressful workload, a single RAMCloud server can support 270,000-410,000 durable 100-byte writes per second at 90% memory utilization. The two-level approach to cleaning improves perform</p><p>5 0.50396639 <a title="201-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-04-Is_Provisioned_IOPS_Better%3F_Yes%2C_it_Delivers_More_Consistent_and_Higher_Performance_IO.html">1398 high scalability-2013-02-04-Is Provisioned IOPS Better? Yes, it Delivers More Consistent and Higher Performance IO</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with their  Provisioned IOPS  for RDS, EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model. You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used. 
 
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?
 
 Rodrigo Campos  put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he describes in  IOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012 .
 
The result?  Yes,   AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and Higher Performance IO :
  

It is clear that the provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer a huge performance upgrade when compared to the non-optimized EBS volumes, but as data has to be spread among more underlying disks or systems, it seems that the volume is increasingly more susceptibl</p><p>6 0.44255286 <a title="201-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-14-Designing_a_Scalable_Twitter.html">568 high scalability-2009-04-14-Designing a Scalable Twitter</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byPatrick Eaton, Software Engineer and Distributed
Systems Architect at Stackdriver.Stackdriver provides intelligent monitoring-
as-a-service for cloud hosted applications.  Behind this easy-to-use service
is a large distributed system for collecting and storing metrics and events,
monitoring and alerting on them, analyzing them, and serving up all the
results in a web UI.  Because we ourselves run in the cloud (mostly on AWS),
we spend a lot of time thinking about how to deal with faults in the cloud.
We have developed a framework for thinking about fault mitigation for large,
cloud-hosted systems.  We endearingly call this framework the "Four Hamiltons"
because it is inspired by an article from James Hamilton, the Vice President
and Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services.The article that led to this
framework is called "The Power Failure Seen Around the World".  Hamilton
analyzes the causes of the power outage that affected Super Bowl XLVII in
early 2013.</p><p>5 0.10736992 <a title="288-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon_Architecture.html">96 high scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steve Newman, co-founder of Writely (Google Docs),
tech lead on the Paxos-based synchronous replication in Megastore, and founder
of cloud service providerScalyr.com.Microsoft's Azure service suffered a
widely publicized outage on February 28th / 29th. Microsoft recently published
an excellentpostmortem. For anyone trying to run a high-availability service,
this incident can teach several important lessons.The central lesson is that,
no matter how much work you put into redundancy, problems will arise. Murphy
is strong and, I might say, creative; things go wrong. So preventative
measures are important, but how you react to problems is just as important.
It's interesting to review the Azure incident in this light.The postmortem is
worth reading in its entirety, but here's a quick summary: each time Azure
launches a new VM, it creates a "transfer certificate" to secure
communications with that VM. There was a bug in the code that determines the
certificate expirat</p><p>4 0.73941594 <a title="288-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-31-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_31%2C_2013.html">1468 high scalability-2013-05-31-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 31, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot of sites hosted in San Francisco are down because of at least 6 back-to-
back power outages power outages. More details atlaughingsquid.breakSites like
SecondLife, Craigstlist, Technorati, Yelp and all Six Apart properties,
TypePad, LiveJournal and Vox are all down. The cause was an underground
explosion in a transformer vault under a manhole at 560 Mission Street. Flames
shot 6 feet out from the manhole cover. Over PG&E; 30,000 customers are without
power.What's perplexing is the UPS backup and diesel generators didn't kick in
to bring the datacenter back on line. I've never toured that datacenter, but
they usually have massive backup systems. It's probably one of those multiple
simultaneous failure situations that you hope never happen in real life, but
too often do. Or maybe the infrastructure wasn't rolled out completely.Update:
the cause was a cascade of failures in a tightly couples system that could
never happen :-) Details atFailure Happens: A summary of the power outage a</p><p>6 0.7263642 <a title="288-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-29-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_29%2C_2013.html">1431 high scalability-2013-03-29-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 29, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Greg Lindenlinks to a heavily lesson ladened LISA 2007 paper titledOn
Designing and Deploying Internet-Scale Servicesby James Hamilton of the
Windows Live Services Platform group. I know people crave nitty-gritty
details, but this isn't a how to configure a web server article. It hitches
you to a rocket and zooms you up to 50,000 feet so you can take a look at best
web operations practices from a broad, yet practical perspective. The author
and his team of contributors obviously have a lot of in the trenches
experience. Many non-obvious topics are covered. And there's a lot to learn
from.The paper has too many details to cover here, but the big sections
are:RecommendationsAutomatic Management and ProvisioningDependency

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>4 0.084870793 <a title="316-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-19-Heavy_upload_server_scalability.html">516 high scalability-2009-02-19-Heavy upload server scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,We are running a backup solution that uploads every night the files our
clients worked on during the day (Cabonite-like).We have currently about 10GB
of data per night, via http PUT requests (1 per file), and the files are
written as-is on a NAS.Our architecture is basically compound of a load
balancer (hardware, sticky sessions), 5 servers (Tomcat under RHEL4/5, ) and a
NAS (nfs 3).Since our number of clients is rising, (as is our system load) how
would you recommend we could scale our infrastructure? hardware and software?
Should we go towards NAS sharding, more servers, NIO on tomcat...?Thanks for
your inputs!</p><p>5 0.084052153 <a title="316-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-20-Paper%3A_Asynchronous_HTTP_and_Comet_architectures.html">286 high scalability-2008-03-20-Paper: Asynchronous HTTP and Comet architectures</a></p>

This JavaWorld article takes a wider view of asynchronous HTTP, explaining its
role in developing high-performance HTTP proxies and non-blocking HTTP

<p>Introduction: Performance is critical to the success of any web site, and yet today's web
applications push browsers to their limits with increasing amounts of rich
content and heavy use of Ajax. In his new bookEven Faster Web Sites:
Performance Best Practices for Web Developers, Steve Souders, web performance
evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable
techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.Souders' previous
book, the bestsellingHigh Performance Web Sites, shocked the web development
world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on
the client side. In Even Faster Web Sites, Souders and eight expert
contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your
site's performance in three critical categories:JavaScript- Get advice for
understanding Ajax performance, writing efficient JavaScript, creating

<p>Introduction: SinceThe Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage was published we've a had
few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their
Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East
Region. Netlix shared theirLessons Learned from the AWS Outage as did Heroku
(How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage), Smug Mug (How SmugMug survived the
Amazonpocalypse), and SimpleGeo (How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS
Downtime). The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of
response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been
almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon
was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to
talk about the event itself.Lesson for crisis handlers: deep dive post-mortems
that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective
means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention. Amazon's

<p>Introduction: This website has been a great resource for helping me to understand the
successful (and failed) scalable network designs from organizations that have
actually done it, but I haven't seen any explicite explanations about secure
remote administration of these systems.I understand that the *nix people love
to SSH, and the windows gang has their RDP, but how does one go about creating
a network architecture that both allows one to manage their systems and does
its best to avoid hacker interest? As I imagine, no big website will have the
SSH/RDP/FTP ports open on the web server, so how is it that they go about
remotely administering their geographically diverse groups of servers

chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and

prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change
remains...cloudy.I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes

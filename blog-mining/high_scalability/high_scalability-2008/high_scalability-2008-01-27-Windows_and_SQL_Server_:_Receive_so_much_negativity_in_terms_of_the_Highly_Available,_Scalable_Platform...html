<p>Introduction: Playing like the big boys may be getting cheaper. The big boys, like  YouTube , farm the serving of their most popular videos to a third party CDN. A lot of people were surprised YouTube didn't serve all their content themselves, but it makes sense. It allows them to keep up with demand without a large hit for infrastructure build out, much like leasing computers instead of buying them.
   
 The problem has been CDNs are expensive.  Om Malik reports in  Akamai & the CDN Price Wars  that may be changing. CDN service could be becoming affordable enough that you might consider using them as part of your scaling strategy.    Akamai , once the clear leader in the CDN field, is facing strong competition from the likes of Limelight Networks, Level 3, Internap, CDNetworks, Panther Express and EdgeCast Networks.  This  commoditization  may be bad for their stock prices, but it's good for website builders looking for new scaling strategies. EdgeCast, for example, passes on the cost savings when</p><p>4 0.11223048 <a title="225-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-31-Scaling_MySQL_on_Amazon_Web_Services.html">690 high scalability-2009-08-31-Scaling MySQL on Amazon Web Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've recently started working with a large company who is looking to take one of their heavily utilized applications and move it to Amazon Web Services.  I'm not looking to start a debate on the merits of EC2, the decision to move to aws is already made (and is a much better decision than paying a vendor millions to host it).  I've done my reasearch and I'm comfortable with creating this environment with one exception, scaling MySQL.  I havent done much work with MySQL, i'm more of an Oracle guy up to now.  I'm struggling to determine a way to scale MySQL on the fly in a way so that replication works, the server takes its proper place in line for master candidacy, and the apache servers become aware of it.  So this is really three questions:  1. What are some proven methods of load balancing the read traffic going from apache to MySQL. 2. How do I let the load balancing mechanism know when I scale up / down a new Mysql Server?   3. How to alert the master of the new server and initiate</p><p>5 0.10652721 <a title="225-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-13-SQL_Server_2008_Database_Performance_and_Scalability.html">410 high scalability-2008-10-13-SQL Server 2008 Database Performance and Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 incorporates the tools and technologies that are necessary to implement relational databases, reporting systems, and data warehouses of enterprise scale, and provides optimal performance and responsiveness.      With SQL Server 2008, you can take advantage of the latest hardware technologies while scaling up your servers to support server consolidation. SQL Server 2008 also enables you to scale out your largest data solutions.         This white paper describes the performance and scalability capabilities of Microsoft速 SQL Server速 2008 and explains how you can use these capabilities to:           * Optimize performance for any size of database with the tools and features that are available for the database engine, analysis services, reporting services, and integration services.               * Scale up your servers to take full advantage of new hardware capabilities.         * Scale out your database environment to optimize responsiveness and to move your data</p><p>6 0.10492633 <a title="225-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-24-Strategy%3A_Eliminate_Unnecessary_SQL.html">995 high scalability-2011-02-24-Strategy: Eliminate Unnecessary SQL</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple (any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and how you resolved it?

<p>Introduction: Launched in 2001 by Microsoft, since then this platform is widely popular among organizations to increase the efficiency of their business and productive volume. As we all know the importance of communication mode in every organization and by keeping in the mind this fact, Microsoft SharePoint communicates over all barriers and spread the required information within a company.
 
Microsoft SharePoint is an ideal solution for companies who have multiple offices and staff members who are on the move. Using SharePoint, documents and other materials can be easily shared with both colleagues and managers. Other features include advanced document management, which allows users to virtually check out a document, modify it or just read it, then check in the document again. This allows managers/company owners to see exactly when their staff members are working and just what they are doing. When combined with a highly customizable workflow management system and group calendars, SharePoint can imp</p><p>5 0.60986751 <a title="225-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-25-Application_Database_and_DAL_Architecture.html">222 high scalability-2008-01-25-Application Database and DAL Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups (this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day, let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>6 0.60562545 <a title="225-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-08-Servers_Component_-_How_to_choice_and_build_perfect_server.html">653 high scalability-2009-07-08-Servers Component - How to choice and build perfect server</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I remain neutral, but time and again, when people talk Windows or SQL Server, they seem to consider them unreliable with limits around scalability, performance and availability.     And then you start looking at some of the big boys you have listed here in the architectural section and most of them are on Linux, MySQL,Oracle platforms that we dont see Windows and SQL Server in there..     What are your thoughts ?</p><p>2 0.66177624 <a title="225-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Shared_filesystem_on_EC2.html">283 high scalability-2008-03-18-Shared filesystem on EC2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi. I'm looking for a way to share files between EC2 nodes. Currently we are using glusterfs to do this. It has been reliable recently, but in the past it has crashed under high load and we've had trouble starting it up again. We've only been able to restart it by removing the files, restarting the cluster, and filing it up again with our files from backup. This takes ages, and will take even longer the more files we get.     What worries me is that it seems to make each node a point of failure for the entire system. One node crashes and soon the entire cluster has crashed. The other problem is adding another node. It seems like you have to take down the whole thing, reconfigure to include the new node, and restart. This kind of defeats the horizontal scaling strategy.      We are using 2 EC2 instances as web servers, 1 as a DB master, and 1 as a slave. GlusterFS is installed on the web server machines as well as the DB slave machine (we backup files to s3 from this machine). The files</p><p>3 0.64863777 <a title="225-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-02-Some_Real_Financial_Numbers_for_Your_Startup.html">107 high scalability-2007-10-02-Some Real Financial Numbers for Your Startup</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are a startup you may find useful Guy Kawasaki's post   Financial Models for Underachievers: Two Years of the Real Numbers of a Startup  . Part of any business plan are the projected guestimates. They are guestimates because everyone keeps these numbers hidden like a Swiss bank account.  But not   Redfin  . They've bravely shared their initial cost projections, their actual numbers from real life, and the lessons they've learned from the discrepancy between the two...           You can find their model estimates and actuals for Rent, Per Employee, Per Month (model: $250, actual: $336); Initial Per-Employee Equipment Cost; Monthly Benefits, Per-Employee; Annual Payroll Tax; Quarterly Bonus Payout, as a % of the Total Possible; Annual Payroll Increase for Existing Employees; All-Company Meeting Cost, Per-Meeting, Per-Employee; Annual Accounting Costs, and a few more.      There is also a great lessons section: Focus on headcount; Plan slow, run fast; Run top-down sanity-checks; Fo</p><p>4 0.64631933 <a title="225-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-23-When_to_migrate_your_database%3F.html">782 high scalability-2010-02-23-When to migrate your database?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming your business – reports are out of date, your batch processing window is nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database consolidation – remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware, OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are clear,  what now?﻿

<p>Introduction: Update  :  as of the end of Q2 2011,  Akamai had 95,811  servers deployed globally.     
 
Akamai is the CDN to the stars. It claims to deliver between 15 and 30 percent of all Web traffic, with major customers like Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and the US military. Traditionally quite secretive, we get a peek behind the curtain in this paper:  The Akamai Network: A Platform for High-Performance Internet Applications  by Erik Nygren, Ramesh Sitaraman, and Jennifer Sun. 
  Abstract:
 Comprising more than 61,000 servers located across nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the components and capabilities of this large-scale distributed computing platform, and offer some insight into its architecture, design principles, operation, and management.

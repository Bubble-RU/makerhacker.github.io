<p>Introduction: Hi,I am using drupal for my clients website, and was thinking is it possible
to host all ( about 500) of them on the same server(maybe VPS or
dedicated).Here is the situation..... Each clients website has a database with
about 50 tables each, all the databases are small in size about 2-5 MB ....
and the websites are low traffic websites with say.. 50 hits/day on avg....
that means about 2000 queries/db/day ..... (avg 40 queries per hit)....Wanted
to know if it is possible to have so many databases about 500 on the same
server?what are the things that i should look into if i should make this
happen?</p><p>5 0.16421838 <a title="252-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-06-Economies_of_Non-Scale.html">340 high scalability-2008-06-06-Economies of Non-Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scalability forces us to think differently. What worked on a small scale
doesn't always work on a large scale -- and costs are no different. If 90% of
our application is free of contention, and only 10% is spent on a shared
resources, we will need to grow our compute resources by a factor of 100 to
scale by a factor of 10! Another important thing to note is that 10x, in this
case, is the limit of our ability to scale, even if more resources are
added.1. The cost of non-linearly scalable applications grows exponentially
with the demand for more scale.2. Non-linearly scalable applications have an
absolute limit of scalability. According to Amdhal's Law, with 10% contention,
the maximum scaling limit is 10. With 40% contention, our maximum scaling
limit is 2.5 - no matter how many hardware resources we will throw at the
problem.This post discuss in further details how to measure the true cost of
non linearly scalable systems and suggest a model for reducing that cost
significantly.</p><p>6 0.14024153 <a title="252-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-21-Tracking_usage_of_public_resources_-_throttling_accesses_per_hour.html">256 high scalability-2008-02-21-Tracking usage of public resources - throttling accesses per hour</a></p>

<p>Introduction: MySQL Expert Ronald Bradford explains how one key way to improve the
scalability of a MySQL server, and undoubtedly nearly every other server, is
toeliminate unnecessary SQL, saying the most efficient way to improve an SQL
statement is to eliminate it:The MySQL kernel can only physically process a
certain number of SQL statements for a given time period (e.g. per second).
Regardless of the type of machine you have, there is a physical limit. If you
eliminate SQL statements that are unwarranted and unnecessary, you
automatically enable more important SQL statements to run. There are numerous
other downstream affects, however this is the simple math. To run more SQL,
reduce the number of SQL you need to run.Ronald shows how to use mk-query-
digest to look at query execution times and determine which ones can be
profitably whacked. Related ArticlesQuora:What are the best methods for

mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developersof
Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that
theGnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,
theNapster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network
isseverely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a
millionpeers. In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have
overlooked theintrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the
Gnutella network:a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the
definition).Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher
dimensionaltopologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of
interconnectiontopologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware
implementations(see, e.g., Culler et al. 1996; Buyya 1999</p><p>5 0.72584844 <a title="252-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-23-Gone_Fishin%27_2014.html">1653 high scalability-2014-05-23-Gone Fishin' 2014</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Well, not exactly Fishin', but I'll be on a month long vacation starting
today.I won't be posting new content, so we'll all have a break.
Disappointing, I know.If you've ever wanted to write an article for
HighScalability this would be a great time :-) I'd be very interested in your
experiences with containers vs VMs if you have some thoughts on the subject.So
if the spirit moves you, please write something.See you on down the road...</p><p>6 0.72023749 <a title="252-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-23-Working_With_Large_Data_Sets.html">907 high scalability-2010-09-23-Working With Large Data Sets</a></p>

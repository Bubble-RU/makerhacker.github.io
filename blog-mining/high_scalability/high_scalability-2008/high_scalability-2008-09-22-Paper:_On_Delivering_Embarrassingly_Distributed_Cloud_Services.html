<p>Introduction: Update:   Streamy Explains CAP and HBase's Approach to CAP .  We plan to employ inter-cluster replication, with each cluster located in a single DC.  Remote replication will introduce some eventual consistency into the system, but each cluster will continue to be strongly consistent.   Ryan Barrett, Google App Engine datastore lead, gave this talk   Transactions Across Datacenters (and Other Weekend Projects)   at the Google I/O 2009 conference.   While the talk doesn't necessarily break new technical ground, Ryan does an excellent job explaining and evaluating the different options you have when architecting a system to work across multiple datacenters. This is called  multihoming ,  operating from multiple datacenters simultaneously.  As multihoming is one of the most challenging tasks in all computing, Ryan's clear and thoughtful style comfortably leads you through the various options. On the trip you learn:

<p>Introduction: The RAD Lab (Reliable Adaptive Distributed Systems Laboratory) wants to leapfrog the Big Switch and create The Next Big Switch, skipping the cloud/utility evolutionary stage altogether. This hyper-evolutionary niche buster develops technology so advanced the cloud disperses and you can go back to building your own personal datacenters again. Where Google took years to create their datacenters, using a prefab Datacenter Operating System you might create your own in a long holiday weekend. Not St. Patrick's of course.     Their vision:   Enable one person to invent and run the next revolutionary IT service, operationally expressing a new business idea as a multi-million-user service over the course of a long weekend. By doing so we hope to enable an Internet "Fortune 1 million".        How? By wizardry in the form of a “datacenter operating system” created from a pinch of "statistical machine learning (SML)" and a tincture of "recent insights from networking and distributed systems."

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking  The Datacenter as a Computer  book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!
 
John Fries in a  G+ comment  has what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the book:
  

It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter anymore

  
It's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware; datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key challenge</p><p>4 0.69625854 <a title="387-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_30%2C_2012.html">1219 high scalability-2012-03-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 30, 2012</a></p>

 Should your database failover automatically or wait for the guiding hands of a helpful human? Jeremy Zawodny in  Handling Database Failover at Craigslist  says Craigslist and Yahoo! handle failovers manually. Knowing when a failure has happened is so error prone it's better to put in a human breaker in the loop. Others think this could be a SLA buster as write requests can't be processed while the decision is being made. Main issue is knowing anything is true in a distributed system is hard.

<p>Introduction: Joel Spolsky and Jeff   Atwood are  raising VC money  for    StackOverflow.  This is interesting for three reasons: 1) Joel has always seemed like a keep it small and grow organically type of guy, so this is a big step in a different direction. 2) It means they think there's a very big market in the Q&A; space and they mean to capture as much as the market as possible. 3) Most importantly for this blog, Joel gives some good advice on when to stay fresh and local and when it's time to jump for the brass ring, scale up your ambition, and go for VC money. Please see  Joel's blog  post for the details, but here's when to go VC:
  
 There’s a land grab going on. 
 There is a provable concept that’s repeatable. 
 The business itself could benefit from the publicity. 
 The investor will add substantial value to the business. 
 The business can potentially have a big exit or become a large, publically traded company. 
 The founders are not in it for their own personal aggrandizement.

<p>Introduction: How do we scale datacenters? Should we build a few mammoth million machine datacenters or many smaller micro datacenters? Intuitively we usually go with a bigger is better economies of scale type argument, but it may not be so. What works for Walmart may not work for White Box World. Mega datacenters may actually exhibit diseconomies of scale. It may be better to run applications over many distributed  micro datacenters instead of one large one.  This paper by Ken Church, Albert Greenberg, and James Hamilton, all from Microsoft, takes a look at the different issues and concludes:
   Putting it all together, the micro model offers a design point with attractive performance, reliability, scale and cost. Given how much the industry is currently investing in the mega model, the industry would do well to consider the micro alternative.

<p>Introduction: In the scalability is specialization department here is an interesting paper presented at  HotNets '13  on high performance networking:  Network Stack Specialization for Performance .
 
The idea is generalizing a service so it fits in the kernel comes at a high performance cost. So move TCP into user space.  The result is a web server with ~3.5x the throughput of Nginx "while experiencing low CPU utilization, linear scaling on multicore systems, and saturating current NIC hardware."
 
Here's a good description of the paper published  on Layer 9 :
  Traditionally, servers and OSes have been built to be general purpose. However now we have a high degree of specialization. In fact, in a big web service, you might have thousands of machines dedicated to one function. Therefore, there's scope for specialization. This paper looks at a specific opportunity in that space. Network stacks today are good for high throughput with large transfers, but not small files (which are common in web browsi</p><p>4 0.89493734 <a title="387-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-25-Strategy%3A_Rule_of_3_Admins_to_Save_Your_Sanity.html">830 high scalability-2010-05-25-Strategy: Rule of 3 Admins to Save Your Sanity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The idea came up in this Hacker News  thread , commenting on a 37signals interview, that having three system administrators is the minimum optimal number of admins. Everyone wants to lower their costs by having each admin administer a lot of machines. The problem is when you have fewer than three admins you can never get a break from the constant corrosive pressure of always being on call. When every moment of your life you are dreading the next emergency, it eats at you. Having three admins solves that problem. With three admins you can:
  
 Go on a real vacation. The two remaining admins can switch off being on call. 
 Not be on call all the time. 
  
A larger shop will naturally have more admins so it's not as big an issue, but at smaller shops trying to minimize head count, carrying three admins (or people in those roles) might be something to consider.</p><p>5 0.89027661 <a title="387-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-04-Jim_Starkey_is_Creating_a_Brave_New_World_by_Rethinking_Databases_for_the_Cloud.html">1092 high scalability-2011-08-04-Jim Starkey is Creating a Brave New World by Rethinking Databases for the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey , founder of  NuoDB , in this  thread  on the Cloud Computing group, delivers a  masterful post  on why he thinks the relational model is the best overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave new lock free world.... 
 
I'll  [Jim Starkey]  go into more detail later in the post for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the s</p><p>6 0.87131912 <a title="387-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-07-Product%3A_Wackamole.html">114 high scalability-2007-10-07-Product: Wackamole</a></p>

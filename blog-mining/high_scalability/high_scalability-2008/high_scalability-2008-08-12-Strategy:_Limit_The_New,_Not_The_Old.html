Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.As I was writingan
articleon the architecture of theStorm Botnet, I couldn't help but notice the
deep similarity of how Storm works and changes we're seeing in the evolution
of political systems. In particular, the rise of thevirtual-state. As crazy as
this may sound, I think this is also the direction applications will need
follow to survive in a complex world of billions of compute devices.You may
have already heard ofvirtual corporations. Virtual corporations are companies
with limited office space, a distributed workforce, and production facilities
located wherever it is profitable to locate them. The idea is to stay lean and
compete using therapid development and introduction of new products into high
value-added markets. If you spot a market opportunity with a small time

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.There's a pattern,
already begun, that has accelerated by the need for applications to scale and
increase complexity, the end result of which will be that applications give up
their independence and enter a kind offeudal relationshipwith their platform
provider.To understand how this process works, like a glacier slowly and
inevitably carving out a deep river valley, here's the type of question I get
quite a lot:I've learned PHP and MySQL and I've built a web app that I HOPE
will receive traffic comparable to eBay's with a similar database structure. I
see all these different opinions and different techniques and languages being
recommended and it's so confusing. All I want is perhaps one book or one
website that focuses on PHP and MySQL and building a large database web app
like eBay's. Does something like this exist?I'm always at a loss for words

<p>Introduction: Kevin Burton calculates thatBlekko, one of the barbarian hoard storming
Google's search fortress, would need to spend $5 million just to buy enough
weapons, er storage.Kevin estimates storing a deep crawl of the internet would
take about 5 petabytes. At a projected $1 million per petabyte that's a paltry
$5 million. Less than expected. Imagine in days of old an ambitious noble
itching to raise an army to conquer a land and become its new prince. For a
fine land, and the search market is one of the richest, that would be a smart
investment for a VC to make.In these situations I always ask: What would
Machiavelli do?breakMachiavelli taught some lands are hard to conquer and easy
to keep and some are easy to conquer and hard to keep. A land like France was
easy to conquer because it was filled with nobles. You can turn nobles on each
other because they always hate each other for some reason or another. But it's
hard to keep a land of nobles because they all think they are as good as you

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose
limits (GAE Quotas,Fotolog,Facebook) as a means of protecting a website
against service destroyingtraffic spikes. Twitter will reportedlylimit the
number followersto 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow
Twitter to make some bank bygoing freemiumand charging for adding more
followers.Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting
aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established
ecosystem?One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let
everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is,
however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignantFriendFeed threadcommiserating PodTech's
unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup.
Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with
them:Have a story.Have everyone on board with that story.If anyone goes off of
that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.Make sure
people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues
should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get
fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.Work ONLY for a leader who
will make the tough decisions.Build a place where excellence is expected,
allowed, and is enabled.Fire idiots quickly.If your engineering team can't
give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only
things that are measured ever get improved.When your stars aren't listened to
the company is in trouble.Getting rid of the CEO, even if it's all his fault,

<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsayis a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on
software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant,
but it applies to software development too.You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on
one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying
to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show
Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few
heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant
owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is
there to help.If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay
is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say"
means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses,
belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he
does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence at

<p>Introduction: Now that the internet has become defined as a mashup over a collection of
service APIs, we have a little problem: for clients using APIs is a lot like
drinking beer through a straw. You never get as much beer as you want and you
get a headache after. But what if I've been a good boy and deserve a bigger
straw? Maybe we can use game theory to model trust relationships over a life
time of interactions over many different services and then give more
capabilities/beer to those who have earned them?breakLet's say Twitter limits
me to downloading only 20 tweets at a time through their API. But I want more.
I may even want to do something so radical as download all my tweets. Of
course Twitter can't let everyone do that. They would be swamped serving all
this traffic and service would be denied. So Twitter does that rational thing
and limits API access as a means of self protection. As does Google,
Yahoo,Skynet, and everyone else.But when I hit the API limit I think, but hey

<p>Introduction: Om proposes one solution to theTwitter Problemis tolimit followersto three
square meals a day. The reasonable idea being that lower limits should mean
fewer scaling problems. And as a kicker raising those limits is a good way to
raise much needed revenue.Scoble thinks users shouldconsume without limitand
will drive to another buffet if all-you-can-eat privileges are revoked. The
reasonable idea being that if an internet service can't solve internet scale
problems then there's not much use for it.Dave sayscomp power users a top
floor suiteand shower them with free passes to the buffet. Let the good times
roll! The reasonable idea being that power users help create popular
restaurants, er, services in the first place and limiting them starves users
and starved users won't come back.So, should web services like Twitter be a
buffet, a fixed eight course fine dining experience, a small plate restaurant,
a family style joint, or a vending machine? Or something else entirely?In a

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose
limits (GAE Quotas,Fotolog,Facebook) as a means of protecting a website
against service destroyingtraffic spikes. Twitter will reportedlylimit the
number followersto 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow
Twitter to make some bank bygoing freemiumand charging for adding more
followers.Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting
aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established
ecosystem?One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let
everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is,
however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are
will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service.
Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.Now in Twitter's
case the people with the most followers tend to be opinion leaderswho shape
much of the blognet echo</p><p>2 0.81700933 <a title="363-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-16-A_Short_on_the_Pinterest_Stack_for_Handling_3%2B_Million_Users.html">1193 high scalability-2012-02-16-A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling 3+ Million Users</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.They're using a static server to
deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that
the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on
serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.I'm curious how other
people have dealt with this situation.Seperating into two different servers
would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the
premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created
in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>6 0.71647859 <a title="363-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-01-Art_of_scalability_%281%29_-_Scalability_principles.html">552 high scalability-2009-04-01-Art of scalability (1) - Scalability principles</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've seen mentioned in few times sites like Digg or LinkedIn using graph servers to hold their social graphs. But the only sort of open source graph server I've found is http://neo4j.org/ .   Can anyone recommend an open source graph server?

<p>Introduction: I'm moving this from the forum section to the front page. Just FYI, any registered user can Submit a Link to this blog. You don't have to use the forums.       In The Architectures You've Always Wondered About track at the Qcon conference, Second Life, eBay, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Orbitz presented how they dealt with different aspects of their applications, such as scalability.

<p>Introduction: Update : More background by Ikai Lan, who worked on the mobile server team at LinkedIn, says  some facts were left out : the app made "a cross data center request, guys. Running on single-threaded Rails servers (every request blocked the entire process), running Mongrel, leaking memory like a sieve." Which explains why any non-blocking approach would be a win. And Ikai, I hope as you do that nobody reads HS and just does what somebody else does without thinking. The goal here is information that you can use to make your own decisions.
 
 
 
Ryan Paul has written an excellent  behind-the-scenes look at LinkedIn’s mobile engineering . While the mobile part of the story--23% mobile usage; focus on simplicity, ease of use, and reliability; using a room metaphor; 30% native, 80% HTML; embedded lightweight HTTP server; single client-app connection--could help guide your mobile strategy, the backend effects of moving from Rails to Node.js may also prove interesting.

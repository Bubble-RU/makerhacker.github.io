<p>Introduction: Distributed transactions are costly because they use  agreement protocols . Calvin says, surprisingly, that using a deterministic database allows you to avoid the use of agreement protocols. The approach is to use a deterministic transaction layer that does all the hard work before acquiring locks and the beginning of transaction execution.      Overview:   Many distributed storage systems achieve high data access throughput via partitioning and replication, each system with its own advantages and tradeoffs. In order to achieve high scalability, however, today’s systems generally reduce transactional support, disallowing single transactions from spanning multiple partitions. Calvin is a practical transaction scheduling and data replication layer that uses a deterministic ordering guarantee to signiﬁcantly reduce the normally prohibitive contention costs associated with distributed transactions. Unlike previous deterministic database system prototypes, Calvin supports disk-based storage</p><p>3 0.70904815 <a title="380-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-08-F1_and_Spanner_Holistically_Compared.html">1529 high scalability-2013-10-08-F1 and Spanner Holistically Compared</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This aricle,  F1: A Distributed SQL Database That Scales  by  Srihari Srinivasan , is republished with permission from a blog you really should follow:  Systems We Make  - Curating Complex Distributed Systems. 
 
With both the F1 and  Spanner  papers out its now possible to understand their interplay a bit holistically. So lets start by revisiting the key goals of both systems.
   Key Goals of F1′s design    
 
 System must be able to scale up by adding resources 
 Ability to re-shard and rebalance data without application changes 
 ACID consistency for transactions 
 Full SQL support, support for indexes 
 
       Spanner’s objectives    
 
 Main focus is on managing cross data center replicated data 
 Ability to re-shard and rebalance data 
 Automatically migrates data across machines 
 
  F1 – An overview  
 
 
 F1 is built on top of Spanner. Spanner offers support for for features such as – strong consistency through distributed transactions (2PC), global ordering based on timestam</p><p>4 0.69240105 <a title="380-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-03-Paper%3A_Optimistic_Replication.html">507 high scalability-2009-02-03-Paper: Optimistic Replication</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To scale in the large you have to partition. Data has to be spread around, replicated, and kept consistent (keeping replicas sufficiently similar to one another despite operations being submitted independently at different sites). The result is a highly available, well performing, and scalable system.   Partitioning is required, but it's a pain to do efficiently and correctly. Until  Quantum teleportation  becomes a reality how data is kept consistent across a bewildering number of failure scenarios is a key design decision.  This excellent paper by Yasushi Saito and Marc Shapiro takes us on a wild ride (OK, maybe not so wild) of different approaches to achieving consistency.   What's cool about this paper is they go over some real systems that we are familiar with and cover how they work: DNS (single-master, state-transfer), Usenet (multi-master), PDAs (multi-master, state-transfer, manual or application-specific conflict resolution), Bayou (multi-master, operation-transfer, epidemic</p><p>5 0.68551856 <a title="380-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-05-Skype_Plans_for_PostgreSQL_to_Scale_to_1_Billion_Users.html">297 high scalability-2008-04-05-Skype Plans for PostgreSQL to Scale to 1 Billion Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Skype  uses PostgreSQL as their backend database . PostgreSQL doesn't get enough run in the database world so I was excited to see how PostgreSQL is used "as the main DB for most of [Skype's] business needs." Their approach is to use a traditional stored procedure interface for accessing data and on top of that layer proxy servers which hash SQL requests to a set of database servers that actually carry out queries. The result is a horizontally partitioned system that they think will scale to handle 1 billion users.
   Skype's goal is an architecture that can handle 1 billion plus users. This level of scale isn't practically solvable with one really big computer,  so our masked superhero horizontal scaling comes to the rescue.    Hardware is dual or quad Opterons with SCSI RAID.    Followed common database progression: Start with one DB. Add new databases partitioned by functionality. Replicate read-mostly data for better read access. Then horizontally partition data across multiple nod</p><p>6 0.67847389 <a title="380-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-26-Google%27s_Paxos_Made_Live_%E2%80%93_An_Engineering_Perspective.html">357 high scalability-2008-07-26-Google's Paxos Made Live – An Engineering Perspective</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The world of scalable databases is not a simple one. They come in every race, creed, and color. Rick Cattell has brought some harmony to that world by publishing  High Performance Scalable Data Stores , a nicely detailed one stop shop paper comparing scalable databases soley on the content of their character. Ironically, the first step in that evaluation is dividing the world into four groups:
  
 Key-value stores: Redis, Scalaris, Voldmort, and Riak. 
 Document stores: Couch DB, MongoDB, and SimpleDB. 
 Record stores: BigTable, HBase, HyperTable, and Cassandra. 
 Scalable RDBMSs: MySQL Cluster, ScaleDB, Drizzle, and VoltDB. 
  
The paper describes each system and then compares them on the dimensions of Concurrency Control, Data Storage Replication, Transaction Model, General Comments, Maturity, K-hits, License Language.
 
And the winner is: there are no winners. Yet. Rick concludes by pointing to a great convergence:

<p>Introduction: Wildly popular VC blogger  Fred Wilson  defines in an excellent  27 minute video  the ten most important criteria he uses when deciding to give the gold, that is, fund a web application. Note, this video is  from 2010 , so no doubt the ideas are still valid, but the importance of mobile vs web apps has probably shifted to mobile, as Mr. Wilson says in a recent post:  mobile is growing like a weed . 
  
   Speed  - speed is more than a feature, it's a requirement. Mainstream users are unforgiving. If something is slow they won't use it. Pingdom is used to track speed across their portfolio. A trend they've noticed is that as an application slows down they don't grow as quickly.   
   Instant Utility  - a service must be instantly useful to users. Lengthy setup and configuration is a killer. Tricks like crawling the web to populate information you expect to get from your users later makes the service initially useful. YouTube won, for example, with instant availability of uploaded video.</p><p>3 0.9743374 <a title="380-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-04-Dremel%3A_Interactive_Analysis_of_Web-Scale_Datasets_-_Data_as_a_Programming_Paradigm.html">871 high scalability-2010-08-04-Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets - Data as a Programming Paradigm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If Google was a boxer then MapReduce would be a probing right hand that sets up the massive left hook that is  Dremel , Google's—scalable (thousands of CPUs, petabytes of data, trillions of rows), SQL based, columnar, interactive (results returned in seconds), ad-hoc—analytics system. If Google was a magician then MapReduce would be the shiny thing that distracts the mind while the trick goes unnoticed. I say that because even though Dremel has been around internally at Google since 2006, we have not heard a whisper about it. All we've heard about is MapReduce, clones of which have inspired entire new industries.  Tricky .
 
Dremel, according to Brian Bershad, Director of Engineering at Google, is targeted at solving  BigData class problems :

<p>Introduction: Update 3:  Presentation from the  NoSQL Conference :  slides ,  video .  Update 2:  Jim Wilson helps with the  Understanding HBase and BigTable  by explaining them from a "conceptual standpoint."  Update:  InfoQ interview:  HBase Leads Discuss Hadoop, BigTable and Distributed Databases . "MapReduce (both Google's and Hadoop's) is ideal for processing huge amounts of data with sizes that would not fit in a traditional database. Neither is appropriate for transaction/single request processing."   Hbase  is the open source answer to BigTable, Google's highly scalable distributed database.  It is built on top of Hadoop ( product ), which implements functionality similar to Google's GFS and Map/Reduce systems.Â 
 
Both Google's GFS and Hadoop's HDFS provide a mechanism to reliably store large amounts of data. However, there is not really a mechanism for organizing the data and accessing only the parts that are of interest to a particular application.  Bigtable (and Hbase) provide a means for</p><p>6 0.96653169 <a title="380-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-13-Reconnoiter_-_Large-Scale_Trending_and_Fault-Detection.html">680 high scalability-2009-08-13-Reconnoiter - Large-Scale Trending and Fault-Detection</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Skypeuses PostgreSQL as their backend database. PostgreSQL doesn't get enough
run in the database world so I was excited to see how PostgreSQL is used "as
the main DB for most of [Skype's] business needs." Their approach is to use a
traditional stored procedure interface for accessing data and on top of that
layer proxy servers which hash SQL requests to a set of database servers that
actually carry out queries. The result is a horizontally partitioned system
that they think will scale to handle 1 billion users.Skype's goal is an
architecture that can handle 1 billion plus users. This level of scale isn't
practically solvable with one really big computer, so our masked superhero
horizontal scaling comes to the rescue.Hardware is dual or quad Opterons with
SCSI RAID.Followed common database progression: Start with one DB. Add new
databases partitioned by functionality. Replicate read-mostly data for better
read access. Then horizontally partition data across multiple nodes..In a

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've

<p>Introduction: Hey,I do have a website that I would like to scale. Right now we have 10
servers but this does not scale well.I know how to deal with my apache web
servers but have problems with sql servers.I would like to use the "scale out"
system and add servers when we need. We have over 100Gb of data for mysql and
we tried to have around 20G per server. It works well except that if a server
goes down then 1/5 of the user can't access the website. We could use
replication but we would need to at least double sql servers to replicate each
server. And maybe in the future it's not gonna be enough we would need maybe 3
slaves per master ... well I don't really like this idea.I would prefer to
have 8 servers that all deal with data from the 5 servers we have right now
and then we could add new servers when we need. I looked at NFS but that does
not seem to be a good idea for SQL servers ? Can you confirm?</p><p>6 0.11056612 <a title="389-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-The_7_Stages_of_Scaling_Web_Apps.html">391 high scalability-2008-09-23-The 7 Stages of Scaling Web Apps</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a

<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical
successful website goes through:Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture,
low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers,
database server, and internal storage.Stage 2 - More of the same, just
bigger.Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache
static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding.Stage 4 - The Pain
Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too
long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content,
significant re-architecting for DB.Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink
entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters,
using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster.Stage 6
- Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database
architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again,
optimizing some code,</p><p>4 0.72694761 <a title="389-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-12-FeedBurner_Architecture.html">7 high scalability-2007-07-12-FeedBurner Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: By George Palmer of 3dogsbark.com. Covers:* How you start out: shared hosting,
web server DB on same machine. Move two 2 machines. Minimal code changes.*
Scaling the database. Add read slaves on their own machines. Then master-
master setup. Still minimal code changes.* Scaling the web server. Load
balance against multiple application servers. Application servers scale but
the database doesn't.* User clusters. Partition and allocate users to their
own dedicated cluster. Requires substantial code changes.* Caching. A large
percentage of hits are read only. Use reverse proxy, memcached, and language
specific cache.* Elastic architectures. Based on Amazon EC2. Start and stop
instances on demand. For global applications keep a cache on each continent,
assign users to clusters by location, maintain app servers on each continent,
use transaction replication software if you must replicate your site globally.</p><p>2 0.86235505 <a title="389-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Sun%27s_High-Performance_and_Reliable_Web_Proxy_Solution.html">456 high scalability-2008-12-01-Sun's High-Performance and Reliable Web Proxy Solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage
of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with
CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable
solution that</p><p>3 0.83583176 <a title="389-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-25-Not_All_Regions_are_Created_Equal_-_South_America_Es_Bueno.html">1347 high scalability-2012-10-25-Not All Regions are Created Equal - South America Es Bueno</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rodrigo Camposshared some interesting benchmark resultsfor AWS instances in
the South America Region (Sao Paulo) and US East Region (North Virginia). He
summarized the results in this thread on theGuerrilla Capacity
Planninglist:The same instance type shows a different behavior depending on
the region that it is running, this is particularly critical if you depend on
multiple regions for disaster recovery or geographical load balancingGenerally
speaking performance is better and more consistent in the South America region
when compared to Virginia, this is probably due to the fact that SA region was
the latest to be deployed. Maybe the SA datacenter uses new server models or
it is just underutilized, but this is a wild guessWrite performance for the
medium instance type in Virginia abruptly decays, dropping from almost 400
call/s to something around 300 calls/s, this is not very clear in the scatter
plot but if you draw a time-based chart you can clearly see this pattern. This

<p>Introduction: Scale-up solutions in the form of large SMPs have represented the mainstream
of commercial computing for the past several years. The major server vendors
continue to provide increasingly larger and more powerful machines. More
recently, scale-out solutions, in the form of clusters of smaller machines,
have gained increased acceptance for commercial computing.Scale-out solutions
are particularly effective in high-throughput web-centric applications.In this
paper, we investigate the behavior of two competing approaches to parallelism,
scale-up and scale-out, in an emerging search application. Our conclusions
show that a scale-out strategy can be the key to good performance even on a
scale-up machine.Furthermore, scale-out solutions offer better
price/performance, although at an increase in management complexity.Read more
about scaling out/up and about the conclusions here (PDF - you can also

<p>Introduction: After winning a CSC Leading Edge Forum (LEF) research grant, I (Paul Colmer)
wanted to publish some of the highlights of my research to share with the
wider technology community.What is an In Memory Data Grid?It is not an in-
memory relational database, a NOSQL database or a relational database.  It is
a different breed of software datastore.In summary an IMDG is an 'off the
shelf' software product that exhibits the following characteristics:The data
model is distributed across many servers in a single location or across
multiple locations.  This distribution is known as a data fabric.  This
distributed model is known as a 'shared nothing' architecture.All servers can
be active in each site.All data is stored in the RAM of the servers.Servers
can be added or removed non-disruptively, to increase the amount of RAM
available.The data model is non-relational and is object-based. Distributed
applications written on the .NET and Java application platforms are
supported.The data fabric is re</p><p>6 0.78672248 <a title="389-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-24-Scalability_Perspectives_%233%3A_Marc_Andreessen_%E2%80%93_Internet_Platforms.html">450 high scalability-2008-11-24-Scalability Perspectives #3: Marc Andreessen – Internet Platforms</a></p>

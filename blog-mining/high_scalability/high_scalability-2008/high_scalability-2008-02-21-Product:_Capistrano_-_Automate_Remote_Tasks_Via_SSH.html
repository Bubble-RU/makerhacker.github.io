</p><p>5 Its configuration files use the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know Ruby to do most things with Capistrano. [sent-9, score-0.236]
</p><p>6 breakOne of the original use cases for Capistrano was for deploying web applications. [sent-12, score-0.149]
</p><p>7 ) In order to make deploying these applications reliable, Capistrano needed to ensure that if something went wrong during the deployment, changes made to that point on the other servers could be rolled back, leaving each server in its original state. [sent-14, score-0.325]
</p><p>8 If you ever need similar functionality in your own recipes, you can introduce a transaction:task :deploy dotransaction doupdate_codesymlinkendendtask :update_code doon_rollback { run "rm -rf #{release_path}" }source. [sent-15, score-0.06]

[sent-16, score-0.654]
</p><p>10 If an error happens within that transaction, the "on_rollback" handlers that have been declared are all executed, in reverse order. [sent-17, score-0.198]
</p><p>11 They don't really automatically track and revert your changes. [sent-19, score-0.07]
</p><p>12 You need to do that yourself, and register on_rollback handlers appropriately, that take the necessary steps to undo the changes that the task has made. [sent-20, score-0.384]
</p><p>13 From the Ruby on Railmanual:Ultimately, Capistrano is a utility that can execute commands in parallel on multiple servers. [sent-22, score-0.133]
</p><p>14 It allows you to define tasks, which can include commands that are executed on the servers. [sent-23, score-0.312]
</p><p>15 You can also define roles for your servers, and then specify that certain tasks apply only to certain roles. [sent-24, score-0.412]

</p><p>18 You just run those snippets of shell script on remote servers, possibly interacting with them based on their output. [sent-29, score-0.555]
</p><p>19 You can also upload files, and Capistrano includes some basic templating to allow you to dynamically create and deploy things like maintenance screens, configuration files, shell scripts, and more. [sent-30, score-0.537]

<p>Introduction: This is guest post byMichael DeHaan(@laserllama), a software developer and
architect, on Ansible, a simple deployment, model-driven configuration
management, and command execution framework.I owe High Scalability a great
deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>6 0.09353248 <a title="255-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling_an_AWS_infrastructure_-_Tools_and_Patterns.html">881 high scalability-2010-08-16-Scaling an AWS infrastructure - Tools and Patterns</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>5 0.75195342 <a title="255-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-18-Code_deployment_tools.html">369 high scalability-2008-08-18-Code deployment tools</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: Deployment with Capistrano  by Charles Max Wood.  Nice simple step-by-
step for using Capistrano for deployment.From their website:Simply
put,Capistranois a tool for automating tasks on one or more remote servers. It
executes commands in parallel on all targeted machines, and provides a
mechanism for rolling back changes across multiple machines. It is ideal for
anyone doing any kind of system administration, either professionally or
incidentally.* Great for automating tasks via SSH on remote servers, like
software installation, application deployment, configuration management, ad
hoc server monitoring, and more.* Ideal for system administrators, whether
professional or incidental.* Easy to customize. Its configuration files use
the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know Ruby to do
most things with Capistrano.* Easy to extend. Capistrano is written in the
Ruby programming language, and may be extended easily by writing additional
Ruby modules.breakOne of t</p><p>2 0.89650893 <a title="255-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-25-Not_All_Regions_are_Created_Equal_-_South_America_Es_Bueno.html">1347 high scalability-2012-10-25-Not All Regions are Created Equal - South America Es Bueno</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rodrigo Camposshared some interesting benchmark resultsfor AWS instances in
the South America Region (Sao Paulo) and US East Region (North Virginia). He
summarized the results in this thread on theGuerrilla Capacity
Planninglist:The same instance type shows a different behavior depending on
the region that it is running, this is particularly critical if you depend on
multiple regions for disaster recovery or geographical load balancingGenerally
speaking performance is better and more consistent in the South America region
when compared to Virginia, this is probably due to the fact that SA region was
the latest to be deployed. Maybe the SA datacenter uses new server models or
it is just underutilized, but this is a wild guessWrite performance for the
medium instance type in Virginia abruptly decays, dropping from almost 400
call/s to something around 300 calls/s, this is not very clear in the scatter
plot but if you draw a time-based chart you can clearly see this pattern. This

<p>Introduction: InScaling writes in MySQL (slides) Philip Tellis, while working for Yahoo,
describes how using time based partitions they were able to increase their
write capability from 2100 inserts per second (7 million a day) to a sustained
8500 inserts per second (734 million a day). This was capacity enough to
handle the load during Michael Jackson's memorial service. In summary, the
secrets to scalable writes are:Bulk inserts push up insert ratePartitioning
lets you insert more recordsPartition based on incoming data for fast
insertsPartitioning is a standard approach for handling high write loads
because it means data can be written to different hard disks in parallel. In
this example Phillip created a separate table for each day with each table
having it's own database file. Each table is partitioned on time, 12
partitions per day, 2 hours of data per partition. Huge log streams are often
handled this way. Other advantages of this approach: 1) fast drop table
operations 2) space for dropped t</p><p>4 0.82162642 <a title="255-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-18-Scaling_Mania_at_MySQL_Conference_2008.html">303 high scalability-2008-04-18-Scaling Mania at MySQL Conference 2008</a></p>

Halfway There. Excellent analysis of all the reasons you need real background
processing. Hey, you can't even build an alarm clock! Hard to believe some
commenters say it's not so..Update: Josh Lowensohn of Webware tells usWhy
users should be scared of Apple's new notification system.A big item on the
iPhone developer iWishlist has been background processing. If you can't write
an app to poll for new data in the background how will you keep your even more
important non-foreground app in sync? Live from the Apple developer conference
we learn the solution is a centralized push based architecture.Here's the
relevant MacRumorsLive transcript:Thanking the developers for their hard work.
Now talking about how the #1 request has been background support. Apple wants
to solve this problem.The wrong solution would be to allow for background
processes -- bad for battery life and performance. Poking fun at Windows

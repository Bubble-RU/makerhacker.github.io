<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:Now that we have a new computing paradigm,
Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data
vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds?
Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space,
and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still
seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids
versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are
a number of issues driving this uncertainty.read more at:BigDataMatters.com</p><p>4 0.81578976 <a title="386-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-25-How_do_you_explain_cloud_computing_to_your_grandma%3F.html">325 high scalability-2008-05-25-How do you explain cloud computing to your grandma?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle
traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch
or other very popular websites frontpage).Regular hosting companies
(especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get
crushed under the load in short time.But there is hope. A new breed of hosting
companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability
you need at a fraction of the cost.Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!”
(or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same
thing).Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting
companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of
them).Read the entire article aboutCloud computing, grid computing, utility

<p>Introduction: I am excited about the upcoming release of two books on Web 2.0 and Cloud
Application Architectures by O'Reilly.Web 2.0 Architectures(estimated release
in May 2009)What entrepreneurs and information architects need to knowUsing
several high-profile Web 2.0 companies as examples, authors Duane Nickull,
Dion Hinchcliffe, and James Governor have distilled the core patterns of Web
2.0 coupled with an abstract model and reference architecture. The result is a
base of knowledge that developers, business people, futurists, and
entrepreneurs can understand and use as a source of ideas and inspiration.
Featured architectures include Google, Flickr, BitTorrent, MySpace, Facebook,
and Wikipedia.Cloud Application Architectures(estimated release in April
2009)Building Applications and Infrastructure in the CloudThis book by George
Reese offers tested techniques for creating web applications on cloud
computing infrastructures and for migrating existing systems to these
environments. Specifically, yo</p><p>6 0.74522078 <a title="386-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-12-Technology_behind_mediatemple_grid_service_.html">90 high scalability-2007-09-12-Technology behind mediatemple grid service </a></p>

<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novice   x   I am starting a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).      I have done some research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I have some basic knowledge on these.     Following are my requirements     1) My budget is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).   2) I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first 2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)   3) 90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.     Based on the above, could you please answer my following questions?       1) Can I go with just a good dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site gets big? Or do you think its wise</p><p>3 0.10077692 <a title="267-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-18-Paper%3A_The_Akamai_Network_-_61%2C000_servers%2C_1%2C000__networks%2C_70_countries_.html">1100 high scalability-2011-08-18-Paper: The Akamai Network - 61,000 servers, 1,000  networks, 70 countries </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update  :  as of the end of Q2 2011,  Akamai had 95,811  servers deployed globally.     
 
Akamai is the CDN to the stars. It claims to deliver between 15 and 30 percent of all Web traffic, with major customers like Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and the US military. Traditionally quite secretive, we get a peek behind the curtain in this paper:  The Akamai Network: A Platform for High-Performance Internet Applications  by Erik Nygren, Ramesh Sitaraman, and Jennifer Sun. 
  Abstract:
 Comprising more than 61,000 servers located across nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the components and capabilities of this large-scale distributed computing platform, and offer some insight into its architecture, design principles, operation, and management.

<p>Introduction: The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality augmentation, live crab (fresh and local), and live event publishing. One of the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a  broadcaster  and a consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a time shift war. The resources and the engineering needed to make this happened must be substantial. How do you do that?

<p>Introduction: Update 10:     The Value of CDNs   by Mike Axelrod of Google.  Google implements a distributed content cache from within   large ISPs  . This allows them to serve content from the edge of the network and save bandwidth on the ISPs backbone.    Update 9:     Just Jump: Start using Clouds and CDNs  . Bob Buffone gives a really nice and practical tutorial of how to use CloudFront as your CDN.        Update 8:     Akamai’s Services Become Affordable for Anyone! Blazing Web Site Performance by Distribution Cloud  .   Distribution Cloud starts at $150 per month for access to the best content distribution network in the world and the leader of Content Distribution Networks.     Update 7:     Where Amazon’s Data Centers Are Located  ,   Expanding the Cloud: Amazon CloudFront  .   Why Amazon's CDN Offering Is No Threat To Akamai, Limelight or CDN Pricing  .

<p>Introduction: Playing like the big boys may be getting cheaper. The big boys, like  YouTube , farm the serving of their most popular videos to a third party CDN. A lot of people were surprised YouTube didn't serve all their content themselves, but it makes sense. It allows them to keep up with demand without a large hit for infrastructure build out, much like leasing computers instead of buying them.
   
 The problem has been CDNs are expensive.  Om Malik reports in  Akamai & the CDN Price Wars  that may be changing. CDN service could be becoming affordable enough that you might consider using them as part of your scaling strategy.    Akamai , once the clear leader in the CDN field, is facing strong competition from the likes of Limelight Networks, Level 3, Internap, CDNetworks, Panther Express and EdgeCast Networks.  This  commoditization  may be bad for their stock prices, but it's good for website builders looking for new scaling strategies. EdgeCast, for example, passes on the cost savings when</p><p>5 0.69314378 <a title="267-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-16-Paper%3A_An_Experimental_Investigation_of_the_Akamai_Adaptive_Video_Streaming.html">991 high scalability-2011-02-16-Paper: An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how to make it work. Dan Rayburn  has a post  pointing to a fascinating paper:  An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming , which talks in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the Internet. For Akamai they found:
  
 Each video is encoded in five versions at different bit rates and stored in separate files. 
 The client sends commands to the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds.

<p>Introduction: Making the world's knowledge computable  
  Today's Wolfram|Alpha is the first step in an ambitious, long-term project to make all systematic knowledge immediately computable by anyone.  You enter your question or calculation, and Wolfram|Alpha uses its built-in algorithms and growing collection of data to compute the answer. 
  Answer Engine vs Search Engine  
 When  Wolfram|Alpha  launches later today, it will be  one of the most computationally intensive websites on the internet . The  Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine  is an "answer engine" that is able to produce answers to various questions such as
  
 What is the GDP of France? 
 
 Weather is Springfield when David Ortiz was born

<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are Oprah...     Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast" where traffic peaked at 242Gbps.  A variable bitrate scheme was used so depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as 750Kbps.     Dan Rayburn thinks   The big take away from this webcast is that it shows proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.        To handle more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P</p><p>3 0.81418288 <a title="267-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Product%3A__Hibernate_Shards.html">24 high scalability-2007-07-24-Product:  Hibernate Shards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.
 
Hibernate Shards is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.   Hibernate Shards  key features:
  
  Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love: SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards. 
  Flexible sharding strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific logic. 
  Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your</p><p>4 0.78173077 <a title="267-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-16-The_5_Biggest_Ways_to_Boost_MySQL_Scalability.html">1099 high scalability-2011-08-16-The 5 Biggest Ways to Boost MySQL Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sean Hall  with some really good  MySQL advice : 
  
  Tune those queries . Biggest bang for your buck. Enable the slow query log and watch it. Once you've found a heavy resource intensive query, optimize it! Tune what receives real-world traffic.  
  Employ Master-Master Replication . Immediately have a read-only slave for your application to hit as well. 
  Use Your Memory . Set innodb_buffer_pool_size, key_buffer_size and other key options. 
  RAID Your Disk I/O . Use RAID 10 mirroring and striping. On EC2 striping across a number of EBS volumes using the Linux md software raid. 
  Tune Key Parameters . speeds up inserts & updates with innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2; create a tablespace and underlying datafile for each table with innodb_file_per_table.

<p>Introduction: Update 6 :  CARS = Cost Aware Runtimes and Services  by William Louth.  Update 5 :  Damn You Google, Damn You Yahoo! Why D'Ya Do This to Us?  Free accounts on a cloud platform are a constant drain of money.  Update 4:  Caching becomes even more important in  CPU based billing environments . Avoiding the CPU means saving money.  Update 3:  An interesting simple example of this idea showed up on the Google AppEngine list. With one paging algorithm and one use of AJAX the yearly cost of the site was $1000. By changing those algorithms the site went under quota and became free again. This will make life a lot more interesting for developers.  Update 2:   Business Model Influencing Software Architecture  by Brandon Watson.  The profitability of your project could disappear overnight on account of code behaving badly .  Update:  Amazon adds  Elastic Block Store  at $0.10 per 1 million I/O requests. Now I need some cost minimization storage algorithms!

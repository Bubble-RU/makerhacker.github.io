</p><p>3 Focus on an obstacle and you'll hit the obstacle, even though you are trying to avoid it. [sent-18, score-0.323]
</p><p>4 It may be hard to believe target fixation exists as a serious risk. [sent-26, score-0.811]
</p><p>5 If you've ever driven a car and have managed to hit the one pot hole in the road that you couldn't take your eyes off--that's target fixation. [sent-28, score-0.465]
</p><p>6 This is where the  framework fixation  that we'll talk about a little later comes in. [sent-35, score-0.593]
</p><p>7 Your brain suddenly jumps to a shiny thing off to the side of the road. [sent-44, score-0.478]

</p><p>9 Whatever the distraction, when you focus on that shiny thing you'll drive to it and fly off the corner. [sent-52, score-0.461]
</p><p>10 In true Ninja fashion we can turn target fixation to our advantage. [sent-58, score-0.895]

</p><p>12 Your body will automatically make all the adjustments needed to carry out the turn because you are looking where you want to go, which is the stretch of road after the turn. [sent-61, score-0.366]
</p><p>13 This is because about half the 100 billion neurons in your brain are dedicated to learned unconscious motor movement. [sent-68, score-0.293]

<p>Introduction: Let me begin by saying that I have used and continue to use various ORM frameworks such as hibernate, ibatis, propel and activerecord in applications and websites that have a user base ranging from a couple hundred to 500k users.  Especially for projects that have to be up and running in a short duration of time, ORM frameworks significantly reduce the effort required to manipulate and persist OOP objects by providing time saving facilities such as automatically generated model objects, integrated unit testing,  secure variable substitution, etc. Hibernate even supports horizontal  data partitioning via Hibernate Shards.      However, the lay of the land is significantly different in the rarefied space occupied by applications needing to support millions of users. Profiling an application at this level and paying particular attention to the operations needed to move data to and from the database, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the operations are API related, whereby t</p><p>3 0.1064468 <a title="347-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-20-Dependency_Injection_and_AOP_frameworks_for_.NET_.html">685 high scalability-2009-08-20-Dependency Injection and AOP frameworks for .NET </a></p>

It will likely get hit pretty hard, so we'd like to chose a framework that's proven to scale well, and operates well under pressure.

<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsay  is a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant, but it applies to software development too.
 
You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is there to help.
 
If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say" means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses, belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence a</p><p>3 0.89289171 <a title="347-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-16-What_if_Cars_Were_Rented_Like_We_Hire_Programmers%3F.html">1388 high scalability-2013-01-16-What if Cars Were Rented Like We Hire Programmers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are hired at many software companies...   Agency  : So sorry you had to wait in the reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?  Applicant  : I drive a 2008 Subaru.  Agency  : That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent you.  Applicant  : That's OK. Any car will do.  Agency  : No, we can only take on clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way. There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take a chance.  Applicant  : I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt.</p><p>4 0.89214623 <a title="347-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-22-How_can_we_spark_the_movement_of_research_out_of_the_Ivory_Tower_and_into_production%3F.html">863 high scalability-2010-07-22-How can we spark the movement of research out of the Ivory Tower and into production?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean: can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something useful? 
 
Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often do very little to help front-line developers succeed. 
 
How many ideas break out of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distribu</p><p>5 0.88855803 <a title="347-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-18-Robert_Scoble%27s_Rules_for_Successfully_Scaling_Startups.html">352 high scalability-2008-07-18-Robert Scoble's Rules for Successfully Scaling Startups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignant   FriendFeed thread   commiserating PodTech's unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup. Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with them:       Have a story.   Have everyone on board with that story.   If anyone goes off of that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.   Make sure people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.   Work ONLY for a leader who will make the tough decisions.   Build a place where excellence is expected, allowed, and is enabled.   Fire idiots quickly.

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.    We're basically using a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget). Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.    I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>2 0.97633851 <a title="347-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In case you are interested here's the info:     INFOSCALE 2009: The 4th International ICST Conference on Scalable Information Systems. 10-12 June 2009, Hong Kong, China.     In the last few years, we have seen the proliferation of the use of heterogeneous distributed systems, ranging from simple Networks of Workstations, to highly complex grid computing environments. Such computational paradigms have been preferred due to their reduced costs and inherent scalability, which pose many challenges to scalable systems and applications in terms of information access, storage and retrieval.     Grid computing, P2P technology, data and knowledge bases, distributed information retrieval technology and networking technology should all converge to address the scalability concern. Furthermore, with the advent of emerging computing architectures - e.g. SMTs, GPUs, Multicores. - the importance of designing techniques explicitly targeting these systems is becoming more and more important.

<p>Introduction: Before      We started with a small site, a mess of open source, and a small team that didn't know much about scaling.          After      We ended with a large site, a medium sized team, and an architecture that has scaled.         We never stopped. We used a roadmap and a compass, made weekly changes in direction, regularly shipped code on Wednesday to handle the next weekend's capacity constraints, and shipped new features the whole time.           These are excerpts from the IMVU PDF presentation of their architecture which can be viewed or downloaded  here    .

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on an amazing  Beach's motorcycle tour  of the  Alps  ( and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ,  and ). My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.   The trip was more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system, listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of fellow riders. Magical.

<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch or other very popular websites frontpage).      Regular hosting companies (especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get crushed under the load in short time.     But there is hope. A new breed of hosting companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability you need at a fraction of the cost.     Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!” (or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same thing).     Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of them).

<p>Introduction: I came across an interesting study about who are the leaders in open source content management systems market in the year of 2008.     The study was just released to the public and it was conducted by Ric Sheves from Water & Stone web development company.     At 50 pages, there is a significant amount of data in this study that should be of use to developers or to anyone who is looking to commit to a web publishing system (also known as a Content Management System).

<p>Introduction: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 incorporates the tools and technologies that are necessary to implement relational databases, reporting systems, and data warehouses of enterprise scale, and provides optimal performance and responsiveness.      With SQL Server 2008, you can take advantage of the latest hardware technologies while scaling up your servers to support server consolidation. SQL Server 2008 also enables you to scale out your largest data solutions.         This white paper describes the performance and scalability capabilities of Microsoft速 SQL Server速 2008 and explains how you can use these capabilities to:           * Optimize performance for any size of database with the tools and features that are available for the database engine, analysis services, reporting services, and integration services.               * Scale up your servers to take full advantage of new hardware capabilities.         * Scale out your database environment to optimize responsiveness and to move your data</p><p>5 0.1807369 <a title="479-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-What_is_Network-based_Application_Virtualization_and_Why_Do_You_Need_It%3F.html">924 high scalability-2010-10-21-What is Network-based Application Virtualization and Why Do You Need It?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it’s easy to forget about network-based application virtualization. But it’s the one virtualization technique you  shouldn’t  forget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad other solutions will be enabled.
   WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION VIRTUALIZATION?    
This term may not be familiar to you but that’s because since its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it’s always just been called “server virtualization”. After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the way) it was always referred to as  service virtualization  in  SOA  and XML circles. With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server virtualization solutions, it’s become impossible to just use the term “server virtualization” and “service virtualization” is just as ambiguous so it seems appropriate to giv</p><p>6 0.18016233 <a title="479-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-17-Some_Services_are_More_Equal_than_Others.html">944 high scalability-2010-11-17-Some Services are More Equal than Others</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This and the next post will discuss how virtualization and cloud computing, as we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today’s IT inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core inefficiencies lie. Virtualization principles must be extended to higher levels of the application stack, to make it easier for all of us to manage, tune and integrate applications. Otherwise we will continue to spend most of our time on things that don’t provide real value to the business.

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Nice introductory New York Time's article  Cloud Computing: So You Don’t Have to Stand Still . Good example of how Animoto used RightScale and Amazon to meet a Facebook driven demand of 25,000 test drives an hour.     Update: Peter Laird in  Understanding the Cloud Computing/SaaS/PaaS markets: a Map of the Players in the Industry  paints a very cool visual map of all the cloud service players. It's a larger industry than you might think.      Once upon a time I worked at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch startup. Over a delicious Christmas punch my grandma asked me what I did for a living that I could afford such extravagantly inexpensive gifts. Always so subtle. I explained I worked on an ATM switch. Mistake. She sniffed, said that's nice, and asked me why the Automated Teller Machine ate her bank card that morning. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't convince her I didn't work on bank ATMs. To all future job interrogations I waxed off, protesting I do boring soft</p><p>5 0.59714472 <a title="479-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Useful_Cloud_Computing_Blogs.html">445 high scalability-2008-11-14-Useful Cloud Computing Blogs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:   Overcast: Conversations on Cloud Computing . Listened to the first two podcasts and they're doing a great job.  Worth a look. The singing and dance routines are way over the top however :-)  Update:   9 Sources of Cloud Computing News You May Not Know About  by James Urquhart. I folded in these recommendations.  Can't get enough cloud computing? Then you must really be a glutton for punishment! But just in case, here are some cloud computing resources, collected from various sources, that will help you transform into a Tesla silently flying solo down the diamond lane.

<p>Introduction: Digg has been researching ways to scale our database infrastructure for some time now. We’ve adopted a  traditional vertically partitioned master-slave  configuration with MySQL, and also investigated sharding MySQL with  IDDB . Ultimately, these solutions left us wanting. In the case of the traditional architecture, the lack of redundancy on the write masters is painful, and both approaches have significant management overhead to keep running.
 
Since it was already necessary to abandon data normalization and consistency to make these approaches work, we felt comfortable looking at more exotic, non-relational data stores. After considering HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, Tokyo Cabinet/Tyrant, Voldemort, and Dynomite, we settled on  Cassandra .
 
Each system has its own strengths and weaknesses, but Cassandra has a good blend of everything. It offers column-oriented data storage, so you have a bit more structure than plain key/value stores.

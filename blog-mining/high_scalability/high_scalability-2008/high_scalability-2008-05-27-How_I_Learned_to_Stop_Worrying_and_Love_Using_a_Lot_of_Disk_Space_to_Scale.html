</p><p>5 Instead of storing attributes in separate entities in order to remove duplication, duplicate the attributes and store them where they need to be used. [sent-70, score-0.693]
</p><p>6 This isn’t the same as an object oriented database because the behavior is provided by applications, behavior is not bound to the entity so multiple applications can read the same entities yet implement very different behaviors. [sent-85, score-0.831]

<p>Introduction: Google AppEngine Numbers  
This group of numbers is from Brett Slatkin in  Building Scalable Web Apps with Google App Engine .
  Writes are expensive!   Datastore is transactional: writes require disk access   Disk access means disk seeks   Rule of thumb: 10ms for a disk seek   Simple math: 1s / 10ms = 100 seeks/sec maximum   Depends on: * The size and shape of your data * Doing work in batches (batch puts and gets) 
 Reads are cheap! 
   Reads do not need to be transactional, just consistent   Data is read from disk once, then it's easily cached   All subsequent reads come straight from memory   Rule of thumb: 250usec for 1MB of data from memory   Simple math: 1s / 250usec = 4GB/sec maximum * For a 1MB entity, that's 4000 fetches/sec

<p>Introduction: We've asked  What The Heck Are You Actually Using NoSQL For? . We've asked  101 Questions To Ask When Considering A NoSQL Database . We've even had a  webinar   What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for Scalable Web Applications .
 
Now we get to the point of considering use cases and which systems might be appropriate for those use cases.
  What are your options?  
First, let's cover what are the various data models. These have been adapted from  Emil Eifrem  and  NoSQL databases . 
 
 Document Databases 
  
 Lineage: Inspired by Lotus Notes. 
 Data model: Collections of documents, which contain key-value collections. 
 Example: CouchDB, MongoDB  
 Good at: Natural data modeling. Programmer friendly. Rapid development. Web friendly, CRUD. 
             Graph Databases    
 
 Lineage: Euler and graph theory. 
 Data model: Nodes & relationships, both which can hold key-value pairs 
 Example: AllegroGraph, InfoGrid, Neo4j 
 Good at:  Rock complicated graph problems. Fast.</p><p>5 0.24278088 <a title="327-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-07-What_Google_App_Engine_Price_Changes_Say_About_the_Future_of_Web_Architecture.html">1112 high scalability-2011-09-07-What Google App Engine Price Changes Say About the Future of Web Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things . -- Corinthians
 
 With this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs .  I like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.  -- Sylvain on  Google Groups 
 
The dream is dead. Google App Engine's bold  pay for what you use  dream dies as it leaves childish things behind and becomes a  real product .  Pricing will change . Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will change. But Google App Engine  will survive.   
 
Google is  shutting down  many of its  projects . GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank for it surving the  more wood behind  more deadly arrows push? Without a radical and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote in the long scroll of good ideas.

<p>Introduction: A giant step into the fully distributed future has been taken by the Google App Engine team with the release of their  High Replication Datastore . The HRD is targeted at mission critical applications that require data replicated to at least three datacenters, full ACID semantics for  entity groups , and lower consistency guarantees across entity groups.
 
This is a major accomplishment. Few organizations can implement a true multi-datacenter datastore. Other than SimpleDB, how many other publicly accessible database services can operate out of multiple datacenters? Now that capability can be had by anyone. But there is a price, literally and otherwise. Because the HRD uses three times the resources as Google App Engine's Master/Slave datastatore, it will cost three times as much. And because it is a distributed database, with all that implies in the CAP sense, developers will have to be very careful in how they architect their applications because as costs increased, reliability incre</p><p>5 0.75735414 <a title="327-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-10-31-15_Ways_to_Make_Your_Application_Feel_More_Responsive_under_Google_App_Engine.html">1135 high scalability-2011-10-31-15 Ways to Make Your Application Feel More Responsive under Google App Engine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Small Imrovements , makers of a hosted, lightweight feedback platform, have written an excellent article on  Performance issues on GAE, and how we resolved them . They show how they trimmed most of their requests to between 300ms and 800ms, some still take 2 seconds when memcache is stale, and others clock in at 150ms. Not  zippy  overall, but acceptable, especially if you really like GAE's PaaS promise.
 
What's tricky with PaaS is if your performance is poor, there's often not a lot you can do about it. But the folks at Small Improvements have been clever and diligent, giving many specific details and timings. Though their advice is specifically for GAE, it will apply to a lot of different situations as well.
 
Here are the 15 ways they made small performance improvements: 
  
  Understand App Engine has bad days . App Engine can have bad days where performance can degrade. Your design needs to take this potential for high latency variability into account.

<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his picture), in  I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything , reveals the stack used for building Google+:
  Our stack is pretty standard fare for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily most people don't run</p><p>2 0.96582162 <a title="327-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_18%2C_2011.html">1007 high scalability-2011-03-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 18, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are hired at many software companies...   Agency  : So sorry you had to wait in the reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?  Applicant  : I drive a 2008 Subaru.  Agency  : That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent you.  Applicant  : That's OK. Any car will do.  Agency  : No, we can only take on clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way. There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take a chance.  Applicant  : I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt.</p><p>5 0.96293175 <a title="327-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-02-C_is_for_Compute_-_Google_Compute_Engine_%28GCE%29.html">1275 high scalability-2012-07-02-C is for Compute - Google Compute Engine (GCE)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After poking around the   Google Compute Engine    (GCE) documentation I had some trouble creating a mental model of how GCE works. Is it like AWS, GAE, Rackspace, just what is it? After watching    Google I/O 2012 - Introducing Google Compute Engine    and    Google Compute Engine -- Technical Details   , it turns out my initial impression, that GCE is disarmingly straightforward, turns out to be the point.     The focus of GCE is on the C, which stands for Compute, and that’s what GCE is all about: deploying lots of servers to solve computationally hard problems. What you get with GCE is a Super Datacenter on Google Steroids.     If you are wondering how you will run the next Instagram on GCE then that would be missing the point. GAE is targeted at applications. GCE is targeted at:

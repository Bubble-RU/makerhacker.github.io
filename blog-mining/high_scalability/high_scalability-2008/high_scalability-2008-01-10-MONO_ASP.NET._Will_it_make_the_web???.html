<p>Introduction: Wikipedia andWikimediahave some of the best, most complete real-world
documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas
Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an
overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid,
lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN, how
caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how
they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle
load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of
configuration files. This is a really useful resource.Related

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops
Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access
to production machin</p><p>4 0.069023736 <a title="206-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-23-Ask_HighScalability%3A_How_Do_I_Build_My_MegaUpload_%2B_Itunes_%2B_YouTube_Startup%3F.html">1288 high scalability-2012-07-23-Ask HighScalability: How Do I Build My MegaUpload + Itunes + YouTube Startup?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This question was sent in by Val, who asking for a little help in creating the
next big thing. Any ideas?I'm planning to run my own, first startup website
and have been surfing the webs for relevant info to plan the technology I will
use for it (the frontend and the backend, including the software and the
hardware). The website will be something like a combination of:MegaUpload
(users will upload their files)iTunes (users will be paid for their
uploads)and YouTube (in the future I'm planning to let users watch/listen to
the content online, without downloading).I don't have any investors yet, nor
the budget - I'm still preparing the idea and I'm going to create first
implementation (an "alpha version") before I show it to potential investors.
Hence the initial technologies have to be extremely cheap *but* also highly
scalable in the future so that I don't have to redo anything when the website
grows.Unfortunately I don't have much experience in running big wesites but,
on the other hand</p><p>5 0.06303633 <a title="206-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-Too_many_databases.html">231 high scalability-2008-01-29-Too many databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I am using drupal for my clients website, and was thinking is it possible
to host all ( about 500) of them on the same server(maybe VPS or
dedicated).Here is the situation..... Each clients website has a database with
about 50 tables each, all the databases are small in size about 2-5 MB ....
and the websites are low traffic websites with say.. 50 hits/day on avg....
that means about 2000 queries/db/day ..... (avg 40 queries per hit)....Wanted
to know if it is possible to have so many databases about 500 on the same
server?what are the things that i should look into if i should make this
happen?</p><p>6 0.056248464 <a title="206-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-01-many_website%2C_one_setup%2C_many_databases.html">169 high scalability-2007-12-01-many website, one setup, many databases</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi everyone, I'm researching on Scalability for a college paper, and found
this site great, but it has too many tips, articles and the like, but I can't
see a hierarchical organization of subjects, I would need something like a
checklist of things or fields, or technologies to take into account when
assesing scalability.So far I've identified these:- Hardware scalability:-
scale out- scale up- CacheWhat types of cache are there? app-level, os-level,
network-level, I/O-level?- Load Balancing- DB ClusteringAm I missing something
important? (I'm sure I am)I don't expect you to give a lecture here, but maybe
point some things out, give me some useful links...Thanks!</p><p>3 0.73952234 <a title="206-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-27-Starting_a_website_from_scratch_-_what_technologies_should_I_use%3F.html">167 high scalability-2007-11-27-Starting a website from scratch - what technologies should I use?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi, if you were to design your own highly scalable website from scratch, what
technologies would you use?Based on Web 2.0 popularity, LAMP seems to be high
in the running. But would you tack on CakePHP? Drupal? or build your
framework/CMS from scratch?What version of Linux runs best for a scalable
website?Would you consider Windows and .NET? Java? Or do you want to throw a
brick at me for even suggesting such heresies?Would you prefer Postgres,
Tomcat, Perl, Python, or any of that other *NIX fancy stuff...why or why
not?Please forget for the moment, "use what you know" argument. I am pretty
versatile, and can look for an expert in whatever platform I choose. So all
skills being equal, I'm looking for the best community support, the fastest
development time and most importantly, the best scaling approach.Let's say,
for fun, that I'm planning for the website to have as many messages going back
& forth as an eBay.Definitely building this on a budget..Jason</p><p>4 0.72948372 <a title="206-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-06-Start_Here.html">1 high scalability-2007-07-06-Start Here</a></p>

few useful topics to get you going...Why does the High Scalability site
exist?Good things to read.Participate by adding your own links to interesting
sites and articles.Participate by signing up for the RSS feed.Consider the
many benefits of registering as a user.How do I get notification of content
and comment changes?Contact High Scalability.About.Why does the High
Scalability site exist?To help you build successful scalable websites.This
site tries to bring together all the lore, art, science, practice, and
experience of building scalable websites into one place so you can learn how
to build your website with confidence.When it becomes clear you must grow your
website or die, most people have no idea where to start. It's not a skill you
learn in school or pick up from a magazine article on a plane flight home. No,

explode to be the next facebook/flickr/digg/etc. Since I really don't know how
popular the site will be I don't want to spend a ton of money on the
hardware/hosting right away but I want to be able to scale it easily if it
does grow rapidly. With this in mind, what would be the best approach to

their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still
around today: It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built
with high availability in mind. We findengineers being engineers, no matter
the age:It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of
compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the
bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466
AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to
mitigate its thirst.The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of
Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of
the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got
dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe while the dirty pipe was
cleaned</p><p>same-blog 2 0.75714254 <a title="206-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-MONO_ASP.NET._Will_it_make_the_web%3F%3F%3F.html">206 high scalability-2008-01-10-MONO ASP.NET. Will it make the web???</a></p>

cannot see any real websites (with the term real I mean "a highly visited

<p>Introduction: Judging from the tweet flow, Velocitylooked like a riotous good time. In this
video on themain themes at Velocity, after a little microphone enhanced
violence, John Allspaw and Steve Souders identifyresilienceandautomationas two
of the big ideas behind building a faster and stronger web.John says
resiliency is the idea that we we don't live in a perfect world so trying to
build perfect systems is counter productive. We have to accept failure as a
baseline and think in terms of degrees of availability. All abstraction layers
leak so every part of a system must be monitorable and open to introspection.A
focus on resilience means the web is growing up. Resilience has long been a
requirement for "real" systems, it's great to see the web thinking in terms of
the complex systems they've always been. For the Alpha and Omega on resilience
you'll want to watchDr. Richard Cook'sinspiring talk on How Complex Systems
Fail. Here are some of the most enjoyable Quotable Quotes from

<p>Introduction: IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale is IBMs in memory data grid product (IMDG). It can
be used as a key-value store which partitions the keys (using a form of
consistent hashing) over a set of servers such that each server is responsible
for a subset of the keys. It automatically handles replication which can be
either synchronous of asynchronous and handles advanced placement so that
replicas can be placed in different physical zones when compared to the
placement of the primary. Think buildings, racks, floor, data centers.It is
fully elastic in that servers can be added and removed and it automatically
redistributes the partition primaries and backups. It can be scaled from one
server to hundreds if not thousands of JVMs in a single grid. Each additional
server provides more CPU, memory capacity and network and it scales linearly
with grid growth.It also has a key-graph mode where a graph of objects can be
associated with a single key and it allows fine grained modification of that
graph. Th</p><p>5 0.59791374 <a title="206-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-02-YouPorn_-_Targeting_200_Million_Views_a_Day_and_Beyond.html">1220 high scalability-2012-04-02-YouPorn - Targeting 200 Million Views a Day and Beyond</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Here's thevideo of the talk.Erick Pickup, lead developer at
YouPorn.com, presented their architecture in a talk titledBuilding a Website
To Scalegiven at theConFooconference.  As you might expect, YouPorn is a
beast, streaming three full DVDs of video every second, handing 300K queries
every second, and generating up to 15GBs of log data per hour.Unfortunately,
all we have are the slides of the talk, so this article isn't as technical as
I might like, there's no visibility at all on the video handling for example,
but we do get some interesting details.The most interesting takeway is that
YouPorn is a pretty conventional LAMP stack, with a NoSQL twist as Redis now
replaces MySQL in the live datapath. Reminds me a little ofYouTubein its
simplicity.The second most interesting takeaway was thegreat switchover.
Common wisdom says never rewrite, but in 2011 YouPorn rewrote their entire
site to use PHP + Redis instead of a complex Perl + MySQL based architecture.
And by all accounts</p><p>6 0.5900352 <a title="206-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-14-Problem%3A_Mobbing_the_Least_Used_Resource_Error.html">275 high scalability-2008-03-14-Problem: Mobbing the Least Used Resource Error</a></p>

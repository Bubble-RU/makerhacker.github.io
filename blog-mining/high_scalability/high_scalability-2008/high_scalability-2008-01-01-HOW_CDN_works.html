<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>3 0.22083847 <a title="198-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting_and_CDN_for_startup_video_sharing_site.html">181 high scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting and CDN for startup video sharing site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novicexI am starting
a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality
possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).I have done some
research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I
have some basic knowledge on these.Following are my requirements1) My budget
is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).2)
I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first
2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And
more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)3)
90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.Based on the above,
could you please answer my following questions?1) Can I go with just a good
dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site
gets big? Or do you think its wise to start with a CDN service?2) Should I</p><p>4 0.20478125 <a title="198-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-23-State_of_the_CDN%3A_More_Traffic%2C_Stable_Prices%2C_More_Products%2C_Profits_-_Not_So_Much.html">1289 high scalability-2012-07-23-State of the CDN: More Traffic, Stable Prices, More Products, Profits - Not So Much</a></p>
<p>Introduction: CDNs (content delivery networks) are the secret shadow super powers behind the
web and Dan Rayburn atstreamingmedia.comis the go to investigative reporter
for quality information on CDNs. Every year Dan has a Content Delivery Summit
on all things CDN and those videos arenow available. Dan also gives a kind
ofstate of the industry talkwhere he does something wonderful, he gives real
numbers and prices. Dan really knows his stuff and is an excellent speaker, so
watch the video, but here's my gloss on the state of the CDN so far this
year:Massive growth. Large customers are expecting 126% growth in video
traffic over last year; medium size customers are seeing 48% traffic growth,
small sized customer are seeing 73.3% traffic growth.More traffic != More
profit. Traffic growth doesn't lead to more profit because the traffic growth
is concentrated in larger customers that can make the best deals.Video takes
up the largest amount of traffic on a CDNs network but gives the least amount

<p>Introduction: Playing like the big boys may be getting cheaper. The big boys, likeYouTube,
farm the serving of their most popular videos to a third party CDN. A lot of
people were surprised YouTube didn't serve all their content themselves, but
it makes sense. It allows them to keep up with demand without a large hit for
infrastructure build out, much like leasing computers instead of buying
them.breakThe problem has been CDNs are expensive. Om Malik reports inAkamai &
the CDN Price Warsthat may be changing. CDN service could be becoming
affordable enough that you might consider using them as part of your scaling
strategy.Akamai, once the clear leader in the CDN field, is facing strong
competition from the likes of Limelight Networks, Level 3, Internap,
CDNetworks, Panther Express and EdgeCast Networks.Thiscommoditizationmay be
bad for their stock prices, but it's good for website builders looking for new

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: All,I'm just new to this and have a basic understanding how CDN works? My
questions are:1. How does CDN sync data with web servers for video/images? If
I have a user to upload a video to my site, will it get stored directly in CDN
or it comes to my webserver first and then sync-ed with cache server?2. How to
have only the dynamic video/image delivered through CDN while the rest is
served by a webserver?3. How sync happens and who pays for the bandwidth for
sync?I'd appreciate if someone could explain this.Regards,Janakan Rajendran</p><p>2 0.71711886 <a title="198-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to
start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their
application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I
am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I
plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need
to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure
and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the
application that will become critical over time.</p><p>3 0.71675634 <a title="198-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>4 0.70793426 <a title="198-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy%3A_Put_Mobile_Video_Into_Cold_Storage_After_30_Days.html">1201 high scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy: Put Mobile Video Into Cold Storage After 30 Days</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Limelight says 95% of Mobile Video Views Take Place in First 90 Days and 88.8
percent of views take place in the first 30 days.Since a lot of people are
working with video, which is expensive to store and serve, the implication:
there's little need to keep your video close to the user or on a CDN after 30
days.</p><p>5 0.70451939 <a title="198-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-11-FTP_Sanity%3A_Redundancy%2C_archiving%2C_consolidation..html">208 high scalability-2008-01-11-FTP Sanity: Redundancy, archiving, consolidation.</a></p>

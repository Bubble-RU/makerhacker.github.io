<p>Introduction: Todd had originally posted an entry oncollectlhere atCollectl - Performance
Data Collector. Collectl collects real-time data from a large number of
subsystems like buddyinfo, cpu, disk, inodes, infiniband, lustre, memory,
network, nfs, processes, quadrics, slabs, sockets and tcp, all using one tool
and in one consistent format.Since then a lot has happened.  It's now part of
both Fedora and Debian distros, not to mention several others. There has also
been a pretty good summary written up byJoe Brockmeier. It's also pretty well
documented (I like to think) onsourceforge. There have also been a few blog
postings by Martin Bachon his blog.Anyhow, awhile back I released a new
version of collectl-utils and gave a complete face-lift to one of the
utilities, colmux, which is a collectl multiplexor.  This tool has the ability
to run collectl on multiple systems, which in turn send all their output back
to colmux.  Colmux then sorts the output on a user-specified column and

<p>Introduction: I had posted a note the other day about collectl and its ganglia interface but
perhaps I wasn't provocative enough to get any responses so let me ask it a
different way, specifically how do people monitor their clusters and more
importantly how often? Do you monitor to get a general sense of what the
system is doing OR do you monitor with the expectation that when something
goes wrong you'll have enough data to diagnose the problem? Or both? I suspect
both...Many cluster-based monitoring tools tend to have a data collection
daemon running on each target node which periodically sends data to some
central management station. That machine typically writes the data to some
database from which it can then extract historical plots. Some even put up
graphics in real-time.From my experience working with large clusters - and I'm
talking either many hundreds or even 1000s of nodes, most have to limit both
the amount of data they manage centrally as well as the frequency that they
collect it, oth</p><p>4 0.18584603 <a title="237-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-29-Strategy%3A_Sample_to_Reduce_Data_Set.html">311 high scalability-2008-04-29-Strategy: Sample to Reduce Data Set</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Arjenlinks to videoSupporting Scalable Online Statistical
Processingwhich shows"rather than doing complete aggregates, use statistical
sampling to provide a reasonable estimate (unbiased guess) of the result."When
you have a lot of data,samplingallows you to draw conclusions from a much
smaller amount of data. That's why sampling is a scalability solution. If you
don't have to process all your data to get the information you need then
you've made the problem smaller and you'll need fewer resources and you'll get
more timely results.breakSampling is not useful when you need a complete list
that matches a specific criteria. If you need to know the exact set of people
who bought a car in the last week then sampling won't help.But, if you want to
know many people bought a car then you could take a sample and then create
estimate of the full data-set. The difference is you won't really know the
exact car count. You'll have a confidence interval saying how confident you
are in your es</p><p>5 0.15688354 <a title="237-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-15-Lustre_cluster_file_system.html">13 high scalability-2007-07-15-Lustre cluster file system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lustreé€Ÿis a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system. It
is designed, developed and maintained by Cluster File Systems, Inc.The central
goal is the development of a next-generation cluster file system which can
serve clusters with 10,000's of nodes, provide petabytes of storage, and move
100's of GB/sec with state-of-the-art security and management
infrastructure.Lustre runs on many of the largest Linux clusters in the world,
and is included by CFS's partners as a core component of their cluster
offering (examples include HP StorageWorks SFS, and the Cray XT3 and XD1
supercomputers). Today's users have also demonstrated that Lustre scales down
as well as it scales up, and runs in production on clusters as small as 4 and
as large as 25,000 nodes.The latest version of Lustre is always available from
Cluster File Systems, Inc. Public Open Source releases of Lustre are available

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by LogicMonitor's Director of Tech Ops,Jesse Aukeman,
about the different ways they're monitoring the success or failure of Puppet
runs.If you are like us, you are running some type of linux configuration
management tool. The value of centralized configuration and deployment is well
known and hard to overstate. Puppetis our tool of choice. It is powerful and
works well for us, except when things don't go as planned. Failures of puppet
can be innocuous and cosmetic, or they can cause production issues, for
example when crucial updates do not get properly propagated.Why?In the most
innocuous cases, the puppet agent craps out (we run puppet agent via cron). As
nice as puppet is, we still need to goose it from time to time to get past
some sort of network or host resource issue. A more dangerous case is when an
administrator temporarily disables puppet runs on a host in order to perform
some test or administrative task and then forgets to reenable it. In either

<p>Introduction: Deferred Deletesis a technique where deleted items are marked as deleted but
not garbage collected until some days or preferably weeks later. James
Hamilton talks describes this strategy in his classicOn Designing and
Deploying Internet-Scale Services:Never delete anything. Just mark it deleted.
When new data comes in, record the requests on the way. Keep a rolling two
week (or more) history of all changes to help recover from software or
administrative errors. If someone makes a mistake and forgets the where clause
on a delete statement (it has happened before and it will again), all logical
copies of the data are deleted. Neither RAID nor mirroring can protect against
this form of error. The ability to recover the data can make the difference
between a highly embarrassing issue or a minor, barely noticeable glitch. For
those systems already doing off-line backups, this additional record of data
coming into the service only needs to be since the last backup. But, being
cautious, we re</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89461654 <a title="237-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-03-Product%3A_Collectl_-_Performance_Data_Collector.html">237 high scalability-2008-02-03-Product: Collectl - Performance Data Collector</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From theirwebsite:There are a number of times in which you find yourself
needing performance data. These can include benchmarking, monitoring a
system's general heath or trying to determine what your system was doing at
some time in the past. Sometimes you just want to know what the system is
doing right now. Depending on what you're doing, you often end up using
different tools, each designed to for that specific situation. Features
include:You are be able to run with non-integral sampling
intervals.Collectluses very little CPU. In fact it has been measured to use
<0.1% when run as a daemon using the default sampling interval of 60 seconds
for process and slab data and 10 seconds for everything else.Brief, verbose,
and plot formats are supported.You can report aggregated performance numbers
on many devices such as CPUs, Disks, interconnects such as Infiniband or
Quadrics, Networks or even Lustre file systems.Collectl will align its
sampling on integral second boundaries.Supports proce</p><p>3 0.87376332 <a title="237-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-What_I%27m_Thankful_For_on_Thanksgiving.html">747 high scalability-2009-11-26-What I'm Thankful For on Thanksgiving</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be
thankful for thesongof the tinniestsparrowatsunrise, I'll save you from all
that. It's hard to tie scalability and thegiving of thankstogether, especially
as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of
time. But I think I found a sentiment in A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and
MIRACLES byJames Bridlethat manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving
thanks meaningfully together:I distrust commercial definitions of innovation,
and particularly of awesomeness. It's an overused term. When I think of
awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.So I
started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for
me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.We're not actually very good
about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use
metaphors and examples. Douglas Adams writes somewhere about how big the

illusion)Who am I? I have 50 petabytes of data stored in Hadoop and Teradata,
400 million items for sale, 250 million queries a day, 100,000 pages served
per second, 112 million active users, $75 billions sold in 2012...If

search result pages yields 0.6% more in revenueLuis Bettencourt: A city is
first and foremost a social reactor. It works like a star, attracting people
and accelerating social interaction and social outputs in a way that is
analogous to how stars compress matter and burn brighter and faster the bigger

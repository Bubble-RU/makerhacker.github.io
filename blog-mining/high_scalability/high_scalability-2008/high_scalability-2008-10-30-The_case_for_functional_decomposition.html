<p>Introduction: How do you keep in sync a crescendo of data between data centers over a slow
WAN? That's the questionAlbertoposted a few weeks ago. Normally I'm not into
all boy bands, but I was frustrated there wasn't a really good answer for his
problem. It occurred to me later a WAN accelerator might help turn his slow
WAN link into more of a LAN, so the overhead of copying files across the WAN
wouldn't be so limiting. Many might not consider a WAN accelerator in this
situation, but since my friend Damon Ennis works at the WAN accelerator
vendorSilver Peak, I thought I would ask him if their product would help. Not
surprisingly his answer is yes! Potentially a lot, depending on the nature of
your data. Here's a no BS overview of their product:breakWhat is it?- Scalable
WAN Accelerator from Silver Peak (http://www.silver-peak.com)What does it do?-
You can send 5x-100x times more data across your expensive, low-bandwidth WAN

<p>Introduction: Steve Huffman, co-founder of social news site Reddit, gave an
excellentpresentation (slides,transcript) on the lessons he learned while
building and growing Reddit to 7.5 million users per month, 270 million page
views per month, and 20+ database servers.Steve says a lot of the lessons were
really obvious, so you may not find a lot of completely new ideas in the
presentation. But Steve has an earnestness and genuineness about him that is
so obviously grounded in experience that you can't help but think deeply about
what you could be doing different. And if Steve didn't know about these
lessons, I'm betting others don't either.There are seven lessons, each has
their own summary section: Lesson one: Crash Often; Lesson 2: Separation of
Services; Lesson 3: Open Schema; Lesson 4: Keep it Stateless; Lesson 5:
Memcache; Lesson 6: Store Redundant Data; Lesson 7: Work Offline.By far the
most surprising feature of their architecture is in Lesson Six, whose

<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application
delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to
addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application
delivery tier of the data center. By Lori Mac Vittie, F5 Networks The "High
Scalability" blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not
disappoint with a posthighlighting a set of scalability design patternsthat
was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on "6 Ways to
Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way." Credit:Michael
Chow/azcentral.com  This particular post caught my attention primarily because
although I've touched on many of these patterns in the past, I've never
thought to call them what they are: scalability patterns. That's probably a
side-effect of forgetting thatbuilding an architecture of any kind is at its
core computer scienceand thus algorithms and design patterns are applicable to

<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We
are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple
(any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would
be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally
there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database
server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that
particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and
how you resolved it?Thanks,Scott</p><p>3 0.71075565 <a title="435-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-04-Database_question_for_upcoming_project.html">379 high scalability-2008-09-04-Database question for upcoming project</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We will be developing an RIA that will have a lot of database access. Think
something like a QuickBooks but with about 50 transactions entered per hour
per user. Users will be in the system for 7 to 9 hours a day and there will be
around 20,000 users, all logged in at the same time.Reporting will be done
just like a QuickBooks style app plus a lot of extra things you don't do in
QuickBooks.Our operations is familiar with W2003 Server and MS SQL Server so
they are recommending we stick with that. I originally requested Linux and
PostgreSQL.How far can a single database server get me? If we have a 4
processor, 8 core, 128gb server, how far am I going to get before I need to
shard or do something else? I know there are a lot of factors involved but in
general for this size of a site, what should the strategy be?I've read almost
all articles on this website but most of the applications are not RIA type of

<p>Introduction: Me and my partner are making a blueprint for an online webshop service. The
purpose of this project is to make webshops available for small company's/
individuals automatically just by creating an account with us. Our webapp can
be used to add products/pages/... to the store and we'll handle secure
checkout by paypal.Our app should be scalable and manageable. Because we also
want to offer free webshops, the amount of webshops could be +10.000 within a
few years. We are building on the Zend framework and are using mysql for
database.From the start we want to build our application for optimal and easy
scalability in the future, to avoid a lot changes to our app/database in the
future.Now our questions are:Should we use?:* one database for all shops (or
limited to X shops );* one database for each new shop (each having products,
orders... tables);I think both approaches have PRO/CONS. What do you think ?
Does anyone has experience with this kind of structure ?PRO:one database:

<p>Introduction: Launched in 2001 by Microsoft, since then this platform is widely popular
among organizations to increase the efficiency of their business and
productive volume. As we all know the importance of communication mode in
every organization and by keeping in the mind this fact, Microsoft SharePoint
communicates over all barriers and spread the required information within a
company.Microsoft SharePoint is an ideal solution for companies who have
multiple offices and staff members who are on the move. Using SharePoint,
documents and other materials can be easily shared with both colleagues and
managers. Other features include advanced document management, which allows
users to virtually check out a document, modify it or just read it, then check
in the document again. This allows managers/company owners to see exactly when
their staff members are working and just what they are doing. When combined
with a highly customizable workflow management system and group calendars,

<p>Introduction: Hi all,I'm a big fan of http://highscalability.com/ and have been looking in
my current development to decompose my application along functional boundaries
as a route to being able to scale out the server side, specifically the
database layer. The problem comes when there are links between the data in
different components, ie one component holds all the user data, but another
component needs to reference a user as being an owner of some piece of data.
I'm currently doing this by holding the primary key information for each side
of the the link (as you would if they all lived in a single database), but
this link table needs to exist in both components to allow lookups to be done
in either direction, ie 'get the things a specific user owns' and 'get the
owners of this specific thing' would each use different components. The
alternative to this would be to store the link data in only one of the
components, but then the reverse lookups would require 2 calls instead of just
one.My question</p><p>2 0.88696623 <a title="435-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Database_Design_101.html">281 high scalability-2008-03-18-Database Design 101</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a
firm schema. I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the
overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding. The data is
essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song. This
lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and
Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together. This will be in
a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by
artist album or song. By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song
I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by. The problem is
that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to
shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what
are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it? Should I go
with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table? Perhaps it might be

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.I have a problem I'd like to have your view on. I've
looked around a lot, and I haven't found a definite answer. The question is
this:Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of
users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open
source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will
cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft
licenses(OS, SQL Server, â&euro;Ś)?I am in charge of selecting the technology toolbox
for a startup which is going to build a scalable public web platform. I've
worked as a developer and database developer/admin (mainly as a DBA) using
different platforms and technologies, but my main focus is on Microsoft
technology. I've considered all other important factors for this decision, and
at the end, I always come back to the question of money. When I finish
developing the first st</p><p>4 0.86293209 <a title="435-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-09-Federation_at_Flickr%3A_Doing_Billions_of_Queries_Per_Day.html">348 high scalability-2008-07-09-Federation at Flickr: Doing Billions of Queries Per Day</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When you're looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium ecosystem,
one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular breed of fish is
amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are not, which means if you
put them together in a confined space, they're going to fight. Viciously. To
the death. Responsible aquarists try to avoid such situations, so careful
attention to theconspecificityof animals is a must.Now, while in many respects
the data center ecosystem correlates well to an aquarium ecosystem, in this
case it does not. It's what you usually get, today, but its not actually the
best model. That's because what you want in the data center ecosystem -
particularly when it extends to include publiccloud computingresources - is
conspecificity in infrastructure.This desire and practice is being seen both
in enterprise data center decision making as well as in startups suddenly
dealing with massive growth and increasingly encountering performance
bottlenecks over w</p><p>6 0.84453928 <a title="435-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-15-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_15th%2C_2013.html">1549 high scalability-2013-11-15-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 15th, 2013</a></p>

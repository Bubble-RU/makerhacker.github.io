<p>Introduction: The need for IT consolidation is most evident in two types of organizations.
In the first group, IT grew organically with business over the decades, and
survived changes of strategy, management, staff and vendor orientation. The
second group of businesses capital groups are characterized by rapid growth
through acquisitions (followed by attempts to integrate radically different IT
environments). In both groups, their IT infrastructures have typically been
pieced together over the past 20 (or more) years.ďťżRead more

<p>Introduction: A giant step into the fully distributed future has been taken by the Google
App Engine team with the release of theirHigh Replication Datastore. The HRD
is targeted at mission critical applications that require data replicated to
at least three datacenters, full ACID semantics forentity groups, and lower
consistency guarantees across entity groups.This is a major accomplishment.
Few organizations can implement a true multi-datacenter datastore. Other than
SimpleDB, how many other publicly accessible database services can operate out
of multiple datacenters? Now that capability can be had by anyone. But there
is a price, literally and otherwise. Because the HRD uses three times the
resources as Google App Engine's Master/Slave datastatore, it will cost three
times as much. And because it is a distributed database, with all that implies
in the CAP sense, developers will have to be very careful in how they
architect their applications because as costs increased, reliability
increased, com</p><p>6 0.12877464 <a title="222-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-Classifying_XTP_systems_and_how_cloud_changes_which_type_startups_will_use.html">531 high scalability-2009-03-11-Classifying XTP systems and how cloud changes which type startups will use</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Me and my partner are making a blueprint for an online webshop service. The
purpose of this project is to make webshops available for small company's/
individuals automatically just by creating an account with us. Our webapp can
be used to add products/pages/... to the store and we'll handle secure
checkout by paypal.Our app should be scalable and manageable. Because we also
want to offer free webshops, the amount of webshops could be +10.000 within a
few years. We are building on the Zend framework and are using mysql for
database.From the start we want to build our application for optimal and easy
scalability in the future, to avoid a lot changes to our app/database in the
future.Now our questions are:Should we use?:* one database for all shops (or
limited to X shops );* one database for each new shop (each having products,
orders... tables);I think both approaches have PRO/CONS. What do you think ?
Does anyone has experience with this kind of structure ?PRO:one database:

<p>Introduction: Hi there,I have an idea for an online database that services a large number of
people. I've been studying it for a while and it seems feasible to me to
create it and get people to populate it. It will need time to grow but
eventually it will get there.The model I'm looking at is IMDB, the depth of
information is fascinating, yet it's fast, not so easy to use though, but it's
pretty usable!What do you think I need to create a database an online database
like IMDB. I know that IMDB power comes from it's information, not the design
of the site. This is something I kind of figured out.But what I need to know
is the best tools to publish database contents on the web, retrieve it in that
fast way like IMDB. I'm sure that I will need to create data entry logs for my
users to populate the database.What programming languages you suggest?
development environment? approaches?your contribution is highly
appreciated.Regards,Jalil</p><p>4 0.7403819 <a title="222-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-21-Running_TPC-C_on_MySQL-RDS.html">1065 high scalability-2011-06-21-Running TPC-C on MySQL-RDS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently came across a TPC-C benchmark results held on MySQL based RDS
databases. You can see ithere. I think the results may bring light to many
questions concerning MySQL scalability in general and RDS scalability in
particular. (For disclosure, I'm working forScaleBasewhere we run an internal
scale out TPC-C benchmark these days, and will publish results soon).TPC-
CTPC-C is a standard database benchmark, used to measure databases. The
database vendors invest big bucks in running this test, and showing off which
database is faster, and can scale better.It is a write intensive test, so it
doesn't necessarily reflect the behavior of the database in your application.
But it does give some very important insights on what you can expect from your
database under heavy load.The Benchmark ProcessFirst of all, I have some
comments for the benchmark method itself.Generally - the benchmarks were held
in an orderly fashion and in a rather methodological way - which increases the
credibility o</p><p>5 0.73737854 <a title="222-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-04-Database_question_for_upcoming_project.html">379 high scalability-2008-09-04-Database question for upcoming project</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We will be developing an RIA that will have a lot of database access. Think
something like a QuickBooks but with about 50 transactions entered per hour
per user. Users will be in the system for 7 to 9 hours a day and there will be
around 20,000 users, all logged in at the same time.Reporting will be done
just like a QuickBooks style app plus a lot of extra things you don't do in
QuickBooks.Our operations is familiar with W2003 Server and MS SQL Server so
they are recommending we stick with that. I originally requested Linux and
PostgreSQL.How far can a single database server get me? If we have a 4
processor, 8 core, 128gb server, how far am I going to get before I need to
shard or do something else? I know there are a lot of factors involved but in
general for this size of a site, what should the strategy be?I've read almost
all articles on this website but most of the applications are not RIA type of
apps with this type of usage or they are architectures for sites with millions
of use</p><p>6 0.72283721 <a title="222-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-Too_many_databases.html">231 high scalability-2008-01-29-Too many databases</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create
a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll
have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own
forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each
group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to
start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups
(this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that
having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that
some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day,
let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active
though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate
which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if
having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>2 0.9049167 <a title="222-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-21-Hot_Holiday_Scalability_Links_for_2009.html">753 high scalability-2009-12-21-Hot Holiday Scalability Links for 2009</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the
Ambient Cloud. The only independent platform most of us will have access to
capable of hosting planet-scale applications is the Ambient Cloud. It forms a
sort of digital potluck where everyone contributes memory, network, and other
compute resources from whatever they happen to have available. Top 10 Internet
Startup Scalability Killers. Strategies taken fromThe Art of Scalability. 1\.
Thinking Scalability Is Just About Technology; 2. Overuse of Synchronous
Calls; 3. Failure to Weed or Seed Soon Enough; 4. Inappropriate Use of
Databases; 5. Cesspools Instead of Swim Lanes; 6. Reliance on Vertical Scale;
7. Failure to Learn from History; 8. Changing Development Methodologies to Fix
Problems; 9. Too Little Caching, Too Late; 10. Overreliance on Third Parties

<p>Introduction: Hello, I am new to the back end side of things. Love this web site.Read all
comments about Amazon hosting, actually I really like Amazon S3 but concerned
that it may not be sufficient for my computing needs. And E3 just not too
sure.What about hosting sites like host monster? Their prices seem amazing.
Are they too good to be true? What are the cons and what are the things I
should be considering? I am concerned about costs, but I want user experience
to be world class.I am creating a media sharing site.Any help will be
great.ThanksFahad</p><p>4 0.84730732 <a title="222-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-14-A_TripAdvisor_Short.html">1059 high scalability-2011-06-14-A TripAdvisor Short</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sometimes I get article proposals and then there's no follow up. Though these
TripAdvisor data points are from 2010, I thought them worth sharing:Our site
serves in excess of 100M dynamically generated page view a day (all media and
static content goes through CDN), and we do this with about 100 machines, no
single point of failure, supported by distributed service architecture that
that responds to over 2B requests a day, and a data warehouse of over 20TB
that is used to drive email campaigns, SEM, and general reporting. We are a
Linux/Java/Apache/Tomcat/Postgres/Lucene shop, and have built our own
distributed computing architecture. We also maintain duplicate data centers
(one active, one standby) for redundancy and maintenance purposes.Too bad, it
sounds like it would have been a good article.Related Articles A new twist on

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Nicholas CarrA former executive editor of the Harvard Business
Review, Nicholas Carr writes and speaks on technology, business, and culture.
His provocative 2004 book Does IT Matter? set off a worldwide debate about the
role of computers in business.The Big Switch – Rewiring the World, From Edison
to GoogleCarr's core insight is that the development of the computer and the
Internet remarkably parallels that of the last radically disruptive
technology, electricity. He traces the rapid morphing of electrification from
an in-house competitive advantage to a ubiquitous utility, and how the
business advantage rapidly shifted from the innovators and early adopters to

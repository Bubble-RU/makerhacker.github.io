<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Why you don’t want to shard.  by Morgon on the MySQL Performance Blog.  Optimize everything else first, and then if performance still isn’t good enough, it’s time to take a very bitter medicine.    Update 3:   Building Scalable Databases: Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemes  by Dare Obasanjo. Excellent discussion of why and when you would choose a sharding architecture, how to shard, and problems with sharding.  Update 2:   Mr. Moore gets to punt on sharding  by Alan Rimm-Kaufman of 37signals. Insightful article on design tradeoffs and the evils of premature optimization. With more memory, more CPU, and new tech like SSD,  problems can be avoided before more exotic architectures like sharding are needed.  Add features not infrastructure.  Jeremy Zawodny  says he's wrong wrong wrong. we're running multi-core CPUs at slower clock speeds. Moore won't save you.

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>4 0.14944364 <a title="345-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding_the_Hibernate_Way.html">358 high scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding the Hibernate Way</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update :  A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview with  Google engineer Max Ross on Hibernate Shards . Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to Google AppEngine (not much).   To scale you are supposed to partition your data. Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all the details it’s not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff in the right way and it’s very much worth looking at, especially if you us</p><p>5 0.1285976 <a title="345-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr_Architecture.html">152 high scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Flickr hits  2 Billion photos  served. That's a lot of hamburgers.   Flickr is both my favorite  bird  and the web's leading photo sharing site. Flickr has an amazing challenge, they must handle a vast sea of ever expanding new content, ever increasing legions of  users, and a constant stream of new features, all while providing excellent performance.  How do they do it?

<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.
 
Hibernate Shards is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.   Hibernate Shards  key features:
  
  Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love: SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards. 
  Flexible sharding strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific logic. 
  Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your</p><p>4 0.74782783 <a title="345-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-28-How_to_Organize_a_Database_Table%E2%80%99s_Keys_for_Scalability.html">476 high scalability-2008-12-28-How to Organize a Database Table’s Keys for Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all shards.     There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys across a shard cluster. Each has its pro’s and con’s and the one chosen should be specific to the problems you’re trying to solve.</p><p>5 0.73109609 <a title="345-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-23-Product%3A_dbShards_-_Share_Nothing._Shard_Everything..html">847 high scalability-2010-06-23-Product: dbShards - Share Nothing. Shard Everything.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I met the CodeFutures folks, makers of  dbShards , at  Gluecon . They occupy an interesting niche in the database space, somewhere between  NoSQL , which jettisons everything SQL, and  high end analytics platforms  that completely rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.
 
High concept: I think of dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from  HSCALE  (partitioning) +  MySQL Proxy  (transparent intermediate layer) +  Memcached  (client side sharding) +  Gigaspaces  (parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).
 
You may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult questions (not really).
  Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was dbShards created to solve?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jeffrey Damick , Principal Software Engineer for  Neustar .   Jeffrey has overseen the software architecture for  UltraDNS  for last two and half years as it went through substantial revitalization.  
 
UltraDNS is one the top the DNS providers, serving many  top-level domains (TLDs)  as well as  second-level domains (SLDs) .  This requires handling of several hundreds of thousands of zones with many containing millions of records each.  Even with all of its success UltraDNS had fallen into a rut several years ago, its release schedule had become haphazard at best and the team was struggling to keep up with feature requests in a waterfall development style.
  Development  
Realizing that something had to be done the team came together and identified the most important areas to attack first.  We began with the code base, stabilizing our flagship proprietary C++ DNS server, instituting common best practices and automation.   Testing was very manual and not easily</p><p>2 0.9532243 <a title="345-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-25-Great_Open_Source_Solution_for_Boring_HA_and_Scalability_Problems.html">1522 high scalability-2013-09-25-Great Open Source Solution for Boring HA and Scalability Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post about how boring and repetitive HA and scalability problems can be solved via Open Source so you can focus on the interesting tasks. The post was written by  Maarten Ectors , responsible for Cloud Strategy and  Frank Mueller , a Juju Core developer, at  Ubuntu / Canonical . 
 
High-availability and scalability are exciting in general but there are certain problems that experts see over and over again. The list is long but examples are setting up MySQL clustering, sharding Mongo, adding data nodes to a Hadoop cluster, monitoring with Ganglia, building continuous deployment solutions, integrating Memcached / Varnish / Nginx,… Why are we reinventing the wheel?
 
At Ubuntu we made it our goal to have the community solve these repetitive and often boring tasks. How often have you had to set-up MySQL replication and scale it? What if the next time you just simply do:

 juju deploy mysql mysql-slave

<p>Introduction: I've been interested in sharding concepts since first hearing the term "shard" a few years back. My interest had been piqued earlier, the first time I read about Google's original approach to distributed search. It was described as a hashtable-like system in which independent physical machines play the role of the buckets. More recently, I needed the capacity and performance of a Sharded system, but did not find helpful libraries or toolkits which would assist with the configuration for my language of preference these days, which is Python. And, since I had a few weeks on my hands, I decided I would begin the work of creating these tools.       The result of my initial work the Pyshards project, a still-incomplete python and MySQL based horizontal partitioning and sharding toolkit. HighScalability.com readers will already know that horizontal partitioning is a data segmenting pattern in which distinct groups of physical row-based datasets are distributed across multiple partitions.

Instagram uses a pastiche of different technologies and strategies. The team is small yet has experience rapid growth riding the crest of a rising social and mobile wave, it uses a hybrid of SQL and NoSQL, it uses a ton of open source projects, they chose the cloud over colo, Amazon services are highly leveraged rather than building their own, reliability is through availability zones, async work scheduling links components together, the system is composed as much as possible</p><p>5 0.93680429 <a title="345-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-09-The_Instagram_Architecture_Facebook_Bought_for_a_Cool_Billion_Dollars.html">1224 high scalability-2012-04-09-The Instagram Architecture Facebook Bought for a Cool Billion Dollars</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's been a well kept secret, but you may have heard  Facebook will Buy Photo-Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion . Just what is Facebook buying? Here's a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the " canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...

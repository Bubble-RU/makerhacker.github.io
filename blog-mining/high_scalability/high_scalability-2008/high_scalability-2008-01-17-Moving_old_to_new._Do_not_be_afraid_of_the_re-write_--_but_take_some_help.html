<p>Introduction: FromFRESH Portsand their website:ISPmanis an ISP management software written
in perl, using an LDAPbackend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP. It can be
used to manage,DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration,
cyrusmail boxes, proftpd etc.ISPMan was written as a management tool for the
network at 4unet wherebetween 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is
crazily growing.Managing these domains and their users was a little time
consuming,and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these
daemonsfluently. Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and
users.LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server canbe
scaled from 1 to n as required. An LDAP entry called maildroptells the SMTP
server (postfix) where to deliver the mail. The SMTPservers can be
loadbalanced with one of many load balancingtechniques. The program is written
with scalability and Highavailability in mind.This may not be the right
software for you if you want to run a sm</p><p>3 0.14817797 <a title="218-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-27-Zen_and_the_Art_of_Scaling_-_A_Koan_and_Epigram_Approach.html">1199 high scalability-2012-02-27-Zen and the Art of Scaling - A Koan and Epigram Approach</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post derived from an email conversation withRussell Sullivan,
a computer architect and creator ofAlchemy Database,A Hybrid RDBMS/NOSQL-
Datastore.Russell (AKA Jak Sprats) has been pondering, considering, and
implementing distributed databases for many years. In a recent email
conversation he shared 44 of the lessons he has learned from developing the
infrastructure for high performance / highly scalable systems. Some are well
known, some are debatable, and some obviously result from a deep experience
that is worth learning from:There are maybe 20 classic bottlenecks (CPU, NIC
overload, memory fragmentation, disk seeks, swap, thread deadlock, packet
loss, etc.), have a basic understanding of them, because each is a dark
tunnel, and you need a specialised flashlight for each.The true style of
scalable architecture is rooted in the nature of bottlenecks. I always talk
aboutcommutative operationson a sharded relational model, and I figure if that
is in place, whatever is bu</p><p>4 0.13570064 <a title="218-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-18-Scaling_Mailbox_-_From_0_to_One_Million_Users_in_6_Weeks_and_100_Million_Messages_Per_Day.html">1477 high scalability-2013-06-18-Scaling Mailbox - From 0 to One Million Users in 6 Weeks and 100 Million Messages Per Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You know your product is doing well when most of yourearly blog postsdeal with
the status of the waiting list of hundreds of thousands of users eagerly
waiting to download your product. That's the enviable positionMailbox, a free
mobile email management app, found themselves early in their release cycle.
Hasn't email been done already? Apparently not. Mailbox scaled to one million
users in a paltry six weeks with a team ofabout 14 people. As of April they
were delivering over100 million messages per day.How did they do it? Mailbox
engineering lead,Sean Beausoleil, gave an informative interview on
readwrite.comon how Mailbox planned to scale... Gather signals early. A pre-
release launch video helped generate interest, but it also allowed them to
gauge early interest before even releasing. From the overwhelming response
they knew they would need to have to scale and scale quickly. Have something
unique. The average person might not think a mailbox app would be a fertile
product space.

<p>Introduction: Hello! My first post here, so be patient please. I am developing site where I
have lots of static content. But on many pages I have query to update count of
views. I would say this is may cause lots of problems and was interested in
another solution like storing these counts somewhere else. As my knowledge is
bit limited in this way, I am asking you. I can say I understand PHP(OOP ofc)
and MySQL. Nowadays I am getting into servers.Other question I have is:I read
about making lots of things static.(in Flickr Architecture) and am interested
how they do static sites? Lets say they make photo page static? And rebuild
when tagg or comment is added? I am bit interested in it as I want to learn
Smarty better(newbie) and serving content.Moreover, how about PHP? I have read
many books about PHP theoretically but would love to see some RL example of
using objects and exceptions(mainly this as I don't completely understand it)
to learn some good programming habits.

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've accumulated quite a rag tag collection of personal systems
scattered wide across a galaxy of different servers. For the past month I've
been on a quest to rationalize this conglomeration by moving everything to a
managed service of one kind or another. The goal: lift a load of worry from my
mind. I like to do my own stuff my self so I learn something and have control.
Control always comes with headaches and it was time for a little aspirin. As
part of the process GAE came in handy as a host for a few Twitter related
scripts I couldn't manage to run anywhere else. I recoded my simple little
scripts into Python/GAE and learned a lot in the process.breakIn the move I
exported HighScalability from a VPS and imported it into a shared hosting
service. I could never quite configure Apache and MySQL well enough that they
wouldn't spike memory periodically and crash the VPS. And since a memory crash
did not automatically restarted it was unacceptable. I also wrote a script t</p><p>5 0.71420586 <a title="218-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-09-The_Etsy_Saga%3A_From_Silos_to_Happy_to_Billions_of_Pageviews_a_Month.html">1171 high scalability-2012-01-09-The Etsy Saga: From Silos to Happy to Billions of Pageviews a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Seldom do we get to hear stories of the bumps and bruses earned by a popular
website during its formative years. Ross Snyder, a Sr. Software Engineer at
Etsy, changes that with an engaging talk he gave at Surge 2011:Scaling Etsy:
What Went Wrong, What Went Right.Ross gives a detailed and honest account of
how Etsy went from a raw startup in 2005, to a startup struggling with their
success in 2007, to the mean, handmade, super scaling, ops driven machine
they've become in 2011.There's lots to learn from this illuminating story of
transformation:Origin StoryEtsyis a market for handmade goods. They connect
buyers and sellers, similar to eBay, they don't handle goods.Started: June
2005,3 guys in an apartment.Today: 250 employees, billions of pageviews a
month. All in 6 years.2007 - The Architecture ThenUbuntu, PostgreSQL,

<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for
"CloudAPIportability," which implies a series of misconceptions.If we break
away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud
portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly
simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without
settling on a common CloudAPI.In this post i'll be covering five common
misconceptions people haveWRTto cloud portability.Cloud portability = Cloud
API portability. API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.The
main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in.Cloud
portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-
in.Cloud portability isn't for startups. Every startup that is expecting rapid
growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability
rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared
to do so.Cloud portability = Compromising on t</p><p>3 0.89328867 <a title="218-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-28-Need_for_change_in_your_IT_infrastructure_.html">731 high scalability-2009-10-28-Need for change in your IT infrastructure </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Companies earnings outstripforecasts, consumer confidence is retuning and city
bonuses areback. What does this mean for business? Growth! After the recent
years of cost cutting in IT budgets, there is the sudden fear induced from
increased demand. Pre-existing trouble points in IT infrastructures that have
lain dormant will suddenly be exposed. Monthly reporting and real time
analytics will suffer as data grows. IT departments across the land will be
crying out "The engine canna take no more captain". What can be done?.entry-
bodyWhat we need is a scalable system that grows with the business. A system
that can handle sudden increases in data growth without falling over. There
are two core principles to a scalable system (1) Users experience constant QoS
as demand grows (2) System Architects can grow system capacity proportionally
with the available resources. In other words, if demand increases twofold, it
is "enough" to purchase twice the hardware.This is linear growth. Is it enough

<p>Introduction: CTLis aflexible distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to
break management processes into reusable control modules and execute them in
distributed fashion over the network.From their website:CTL is a flexible
distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to break management
processes into reusable control modules and execute them in distributed
fashion over the network.What does CTL do?CTL helps you leverage your current
scripts and tools to easily automate any kind of distributed systems
management or application provisioning task. Its good for simplifiying large-
scale scripting efforts or as another tool in your toolbox that helps you
speed through your daily mix of ad-hoc administration tasks.What are CTL's
features?CTL has many features, but the general highlights are:* Execute
sophisticated procedures in distributed environments - Aren't you tired of

remote actions? CTL d</p><p>5 0.88180828 <a title="218-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce_With_Ruby_Using_Hadoop.html">968 high scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce With Ruby Using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use

<p>Introduction: Hey,I do have a website that I would like to scale. Right now we have 10
servers but this does not scale well.I know how to deal with my apache web
servers but have problems with sql servers.I would like to use the "scale out"
system and add servers when we need. We have over 100Gb of data for mysql and
we tried to have around 20G per server. It works well except that if a server
goes down then 1/5 of the user can't access the website. We could use
replication but we would need to at least double sql servers to replicate each
server. And maybe in the future it's not gonna be enough we would need maybe 3
slaves per master ... well I don't really like this idea.I would prefer to
have 8 servers that all deal with data from the 5 servers we have right now
and then we could add new servers when we need. I looked at NFS but that does
not seem to be a good idea for SQL servers ? Can you confirm?</p><p>4 0.13639234 <a title="302-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling_Pinterest_-_From_0_to_10s_of_Billions_of_Page_Views_a_Month_in_Two_Years.html">1440 high scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling Pinterest - From 0 to 10s of Billions of Page Views a Month in Two Years</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>5 0.1330044 <a title="302-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc_-_Database_Clustering_via_JDBC.html">151 high scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc - Database Clustering via JDBC</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Practically any software project nowadays could not survive without a database
(DBMS) backend storing all the business data that is vital to you and/or your
customers. When projects grow larger, the amount of data usually grows larger
exponentially. So you start moving the DBMS to a separate server to gain more
speed and capacity. Which is all good and healthy but you do not gain any
extra safety for this business data. You might be backing up your database
once a day so in case the database server crashes you don't lose EVERYTHING,
but how much can you really afford to lose? Well clearly this depends on what
kind of data you are storing. In our case the users of our solutions use our
software products to do their everyday (all day) work. They have "everything"
they need for their business stored in the database we are providing. So is 24
hours of data loss acceptable? No, not really. One hour? Maybe. But what we
really want is a second database running with the EXACT same data. We mos</p><p>6 0.13276215 <a title="302-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-09-Clustering_Solution.html">86 high scalability-2007-09-09-Clustering Solution</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steffen Konerow, author of theHigh Performance
Blog.Learning how to scale isn't easy without any prior experience. Nowadays
you have plenty of websites likehighscalability.comto get some inspiration,
but unfortunately there is no solution that fits all websites and needs. You
still have to think on your own to find a concept that works for your
requirements. So did I.A few years ago, my bosses came to me and said "We've
got a new project for you. It's the relaunch of a website that has already 1
million users a month. You have to build the website and make sure we'll be
able to grow afterwards". I was already an experienced coder, but not in these
dimensions, so I had to start learning how to scale - the hard way.The
software behind the website was a PHP content management system, based on
Smarty and MySQL. The first task was finding a proper hosting company who had
the experience and would also manage the servers for us. After some research
we found one, told t</p><p>3 0.72284228 <a title="302-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-13-What%27s_your_scalability_plan%3F.html">248 high scalability-2008-02-13-What's your scalability plan?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you plan to scale your system as you reach predictable milestones? This
topic came up in another venue and it reminded me about a great comment an
Anonymous wrote a while ago and I wanted to make sure that comment didn't get
lost.The Anonymous scaling plan was relatively simple and direct:My two cents
on what I'm using to start a website from scratch using a single server for
now. Later, I'll scale out horizontally when the need arises.Phase

Fedora 8. You could go with pretty much any Linux though. I like Fedora 8 best
for servers.Proxy Cache: Varnish - it is way faster than Squid per my own
benchmarks. Squid chokes bigtime.Web Server: Lighttpd - faster than Apache 2
and easier to configure for me.Object Cache: Memcached. Very scalable.PHP
Cache: APC. Easy to configure and seems to work fine.Language: PHP 5 - no
bloated frameworks, waste of time for me. You spend too much time trying to

<p>Introduction: Hi,I'minterested in peoples thoughts on the best choice for a database
clustering solution.I have a database that is mostly varchars and numbers that
doesn't store any binary data at all. It's used at about 70% read and 30%
writes - though we're using memcached at the moment so it's not really hit
that hard.We're currently using mysql with m/cluster, but are interested in a
new solution. Possible candidate so far are unicluster (which doesn't seem
mature yet.) or DRBD.Had anyone had a similar experience and can make any
suggestions?Thanks</p><p>5 0.66900694 <a title="302-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-09-High_Load_on_production_Webservers_after_Sourcecode_sync.html">118 high scalability-2007-10-09-High Load on production Webservers after Sourcecode sync</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi everybody :)We have a bunch of webservers (about 14 at this time) running
Apache. As application framework we're using PHP with the APC Cache installed
to improve performance. For load balancing we're using a Big F5 system with
dynamic ratio (SNMP driven)To sync new/updated sourcecode we're using
subversion to "automaticly" update these servers with our latest software
relases. After updating the new source to these production servers the load of
the mashines is raising to hell.While updating the servers, they are still in
"production", serving webpages to the users. Otherwise the process of updating
would take ages. Most of the time we're only updating in the morning hours
while less users are online, because of the above issue.My guess is, that the
load is raising that high, because APC needs to recompile a bunch of new files
each time. Before and while compiling the performance simply is "bad".My goal
would be to find a better solution. We want to "sync" code no matter how many

<p>Introduction: Hi,I am an owner of an large community website and currently we are having
problems with our database architecture. We are using 2 database servers and
spread tables across them to divide read/writes. We have about 90% reads and
10% writes. We use Memcached on all our webservers to cache as much as we can,
traffic is load balanced between webservers. We have 2 extra servers ready to
put to use!We have looked into a couple of solution so far:Continuent
Uni/Cluster aka Sequoia -> Commercial version way too expensive and Java isn't
as fast as it suppose to be.MySQL Proxy -> We couldn't find any good example
on how to create a master - master with failover scenario.MySQL Clustering ->
Seems to be not mature enough, had a lot of performance issues when we tried
to go online with it.MySQL DRDB HA -> Only good for failover, cannot be
scaled!MySQL Replication -> Well don't get me started ;)So now I turn to you
guys to help me out, I am with my hands in my hair and see the site still

<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byShawn Hsiao,Luke Massa, andVictor Luu. Shawn
runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college
intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were

engineers.One recurri</p><p>4 0.87266046 <a title="302-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-14-How_do_you_even_do_anything_without_using_EBS%3F.html">1631 high scalability-2014-04-14-How do you even do anything without using EBS?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing recent AWS price changes,seldo
mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good
question was asked:How do you even do anything without using EBS?Amazon
certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability
record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This
avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as
AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS
services like RDS or ELB.If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where
to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls gives a great answer:Well,
you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that,
you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual
node failure. I prefer to believe that if you can't roll your entire
infrastructure over to new nodes monthly then you're unprepared for the
eventual outage of</p><p>5 0.86853439 <a title="302-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-10-How_FarmVille_Scales_-_The_Follow-up.html">792 high scalability-2010-03-10-How FarmVille Scales - The Follow-up</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several readers had follow-up questions in response toHow FarmVille Scales to
Harvest 75 Million Players a Month. Here are Luke's response to those
questions (and a few of mine).How does social networking makes things easier
or harder?The primary interesting aspect of social networking games is how you
wind up with a graph of connected users who need to be access each other's
data on a frequent basis. This makes the overall dataset difficult if not
impossible to partition.What are examples of the Facebook calls you try to
avoid and how they impact game play?We can make a call for facebook friend
data to retrieve information about your friends playing the game. Normally, we
show a friend ladder at the bottom of the game that shows friend information,
including name and facebook photo. Can you say where your cache is, what form
it takes, and how much cached there is? Do you have a peering relationship
with Facebook, as one might expect at that bandwidth?We use memcache as our

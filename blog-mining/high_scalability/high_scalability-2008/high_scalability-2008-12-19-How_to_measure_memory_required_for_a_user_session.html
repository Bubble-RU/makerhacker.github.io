<p>Introduction: Hi,Every application server has its own session management implementations for
supporting high scalability. But an application architect/developer has to
design and implement the application to make the best use of it.What are the
guiding principles and pattern for session state management?Websphere System
management red book mentions that "Session management performance is optimum
when session data per user is around 2Kb. It degrades if session data is more
than that".I have following questions.1. How do you measure session data per
user?2. It is generally recommended that you should keep all the session state
in database and keep only the keys in HttpSession object. Then everytime a web
request is processed, session data is fetched from the database. This way all
the data remains in memory only till the request is processed and actual data
in HttpSession is very less. (Only few keys).What is the general practice?At
what point you should be switching from keeping data in HttpSession t</p><p>3 0.14872284 <a title="472-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-09-Best_Practices_for_Speeding_Up_Your_Web_Site.html">273 high scalability-2008-03-09-Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site</a></p>

for making web pages faster. These best practices have proven to reduce
response times of Yahoo! properties by 25-50%. They focus on the front-end,
for example, why it's bad to use "@import" for including stylesheets and why
ETags disable browser caching.This google tech talk features these best

<p>Introduction: If using a DB to store session(used by some app server, ex.. websphere), how
would an enterprise class site that is housed in 2 different data centers(that
are live/live) maintain the session between both data centers.The problem as I
see it is that since each data center has their own session database, if I was
to flip the users to only access Data Center 1(by changing the DNS records for
the site or some other Load balancing technique) then that would cause all
previous Data Center 2 users to lose their session. What would be some pure
hardware based solutions to this that are being used now? That way the
applications supporting the web site can be abstracted from this.As I see now,
a solution is to possibly have the session databases in both centers some how
replicate the data to each other. I just don't see the best way to even
accomplish this you are not even guraunteed that the session ID's will be
unique since it's 2 different Application Server tiers(again websphere). Not

<p>Introduction: In the post Using memcache might be free, but it's costing you money with
instance pricing! Use instance caches if possible made on the Google App
Engine group, Santiago Lema brings up an oldie but a goody of an idea that was
once used to improve performance, but now it's used to save money:Santiago's
GAE application went from about $9 to about $177 per month. Memcache is slow
enough that under higher loads extra instances are created by the scheduler to
handle the load.For static or semi-static data, a way around the cost of the
extra instances, is to keep a cache in the instance so requests can be served
out of local memory rather than going to memcache or the database. A simple
hashtable makes a good in-memory cache.This solution made his app affordable
again by reducing the number of instances back to 1 (sometimes 2).Where have
we seen this before?This is a variant of the old Sticky Session idea where web
sessions are stored in RAM in an application server and all further
interacti</p><p>6 0.10213662 <a title="472-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-23-Which_Key_value_pair_database_to_be_used.html">578 high scalability-2009-04-23-Which Key value pair database to be used</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Although I have a basic working knowledge of memory, SSDs and the like, I am
not technical...I have never developed or deployed a system. I was exposed to
ram-disks years ago, when their expense limited their use to very small files
or DB applications. I am looking to "get current" on what role memory plays in
curremt WEB 2.0 design and deployments.How is memory commonly used to remove
latency and accelerate performance in typical Web 2.0 architectures? What role
can memory play in massive scale-out implementations? Are there such a thing
as memory "best practives"? If memory were cheap, would that significantly
change the way systems are designed and deployed?What commercial and open
source products that use memory are used, what are the benefits and trade-
offs?Can anyone suggest what sources - people, books, papers, products - I
might look into to gain a practical understanding of this topic?</p><p>4 0.52891058 <a title="472-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Sharding_with_Cookie-Based_Session_Storage.html">207 high scalability-2008-01-10-Sharding with Cookie-Based Session Storage</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Recently, I was working on a project that was coming to a close. It was
related to optimizing a database using a Java based in-memory cache to reduce
the load. The application had to process up to a million objects per day and
was characterized by its heavy use of memory and the high number of read,
write and update operations. These operations were found to be the most
costly, which meant that optimization efforts were concentrated here.The
project had already achieved impressive performance increases, but one
question remained unanswered - would changing the JVM increase
performance?Read more at:http://bigdatamatters.com/bigdatamatters/2009/08/jvm-

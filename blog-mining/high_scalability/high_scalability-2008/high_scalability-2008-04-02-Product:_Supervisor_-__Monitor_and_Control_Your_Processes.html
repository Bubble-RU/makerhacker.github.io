</p><p>2 Adapted from theirwebsite:Supervisor is a Python program that allows you to start, stop, and restart other programs on UNIX systems. [sent-15, score-0.46]
</p><p>3 d scripts cannot automatically restart a crashed process and many programs do not restart themselves properly on a crash. [sent-22, score-1.118]
</p><p>4 Supervisord starts processes as its subprocesses, and can be configured to automatically restart them on a crash. [sent-23, score-0.775]
</p><p>5 It can also automatically be configured to start processes on its own invocation. [sent-24, score-0.499]
</p><p>6 It's often difficult to get accurate up/down status on processes on UNIX. [sent-25, score-0.652]
</p><p>7 Supervisord starts processes as subprocesses, so it always knows the true up/down status of its children and can be queried conveniently for this data. [sent-27, score-0.548]
</p><p>8 Users who need to control process state often need only to do that. [sent-28, score-0.378]
</p><p>9 They don't want or need full-blown shell access to the machine on which the processes are running. [sent-29, score-0.494]
</p><p>10 Supervisorctl allows a very limited form of access to the machine, essentially allowing users to see process status and control supervisord-controlled subprocesses by emitting "stop", "start", and "restart" commands from a simple shell or web UI. [sent-30, score-0.972]
</p><p>11 Supervisor provides a simple, secure, and uniform mechanism for interactively and automatically controlling processes on groups of machines. [sent-32, score-0.544]
</p><p>12 Processes which listen on "low" TCP ports often need to be started and restarted as the root user (a UNIX misfeature). [sent-33, score-0.336]
</p><p>13 It's usually the case that it's perfectly fine to allow "normal" people to stop or restart such a process, but providing them with shell access is often impractical, and providing them with root access or sudo access is often impossible. [sent-34, score-1.194]
</p><p>14 If supervisord is started as root, it is possible to allow "normal" users to control such processes without needing to explain the intricacies of the problem to them. [sent-36, score-0.932]
</p><p>15 Processes often need to be started and stopped in groups, sometimes even in a "priority order". [sent-37, score-0.327]
</p><p>16 Supervisor allows you to assign priorities to processes, and allows user to emit commands via the supervisorctl client like "start all", and "restart all", which starts them in the preassigned priority order. [sent-39, score-0.641]
</p><p>17 Additionally, processes can be grouped into "process groups" and a set of logically related processes can be stopped and started as a unit. [sent-40, score-0.774]
</p><p>18 Supervisor also has a web interface and an XMP-RPC interface:A (sparse) web user interface with functionality comparable to supervisorctl may be accessed via a browser if you start supervisord against an internet socket. [sent-41, score-0.922]

<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process
level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback
models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple
models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to
make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like
work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.But that's not
all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be
composed across threads of control.Your favorite language may not give you
access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there
has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially
for controlling latency variance, so I think it's time to talk about these
kind of issues. When it was do everything in the thread of a web server thread
pool none of these issues really mattered. But now that developers are

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Douglas Wilson, EMEA Field Application Engineer at
Raima, based on insights from biulding theirRaima Database Manager.Scalability
and HardwareScalability is the ability to maintain performance as demands on
the system increase, by adding further resources. Normally those resources
will be in the form of hardware. Since processor speeds are no longer
increasing much, scaling up the hardware normally means adding extra
processors or cores, and more memory.Scalability and SoftwareHowever,
scalability requires software that can utilize the extra hardware effectively.
The software must be designed to allow parallel processing. In the context of
a database engine this means that the server component must be multi-threaded,
to allow the operating system to schedule parallel tasks on all the cores that
are available. Not only that, but the database engine must provide an
efficient way to break its workload into as many parallel tasks as there are
cores. So, for example,</p><p>4 0.090207331 <a title="295-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-17-7_Lessons_Learned_While_Building_Reddit_to_270_Million_Page_Views_a_Month.html">828 high scalability-2010-05-17-7 Lessons Learned While Building Reddit to 270 Million Page Views a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Huffman, co-founder of social news site Reddit, gave an
excellentpresentation (slides,transcript) on the lessons he learned while
building and growing Reddit to 7.5 million users per month, 270 million page
views per month, and 20+ database servers.Steve says a lot of the lessons were
really obvious, so you may not find a lot of completely new ideas in the
presentation. But Steve has an earnestness and genuineness about him that is
so obviously grounded in experience that you can't help but think deeply about
what you could be doing different. And if Steve didn't know about these
lessons, I'm betting others don't either.There are seven lessons, each has
their own summary section: Lesson one: Crash Often; Lesson 2: Separation of
Services; Lesson 3: Open Schema; Lesson 4: Keep it Stateless; Lesson 5:
Memcache; Lesson 6: Store Redundant Data; Lesson 7: Work Offline.By far the
most surprising feature of their architecture is in Lesson Six, whose
essential idea is: The key to speed is</p><p>5 0.089977086 <a title="295-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture_to_Allow_High_Availability_File_Upload.html">262 high scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture to Allow High Availability File Upload</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if anyone has found any information on how to architect a
system to support high availability file uploads. My scenario: I have an
Apache server proxying requests to a bunch of Tomcat Java application servers.
When I need to upgrade my site, I stop and upgrade each of the Tomcat servers
one at a time. This seems to work well as Apache automatically routes
subsequent requests for the stopped app server to the remaining app servers
that are up. The problem is that if a user is uploading a file when the app
server is stopped, the upload fails and the user has to upload the file again.
This is problematic as uploading files is an integral feature of the site and
it's frustrating for the users to have to restart their uploads every time I
upgrade the site (which I want to be able to do frequently).Has anyone seen
any information on how this can be done or have ideas on how this can be
architected? I imagine sites like Flickr must have a solution to this problem
as I have</p><p>6 0.084968388 <a title="295-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-27-Updating_distributed_web_applications.html">372 high scalability-2008-08-27-Updating distributed web applications</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot
of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications
stemming from this, we use AIDA.AIDA(Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant)
is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git,
TeamCity and JIRA.In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were
able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous
integration.We'll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use
here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release
branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we'll discuss AIDA's major
contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.Git flowThe Badoo Team uses
Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and
tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in
JIRA and a description of the problem.BFG-

<p>Introduction: This is guest post byMichael DeHaan(@laserllama), a software developer and
architect, on Ansible, a simple deployment, model-driven configuration
management, and command execution framework.I owe High Scalability a great
deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>4 0.80726588 <a title="295-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-16-Product%3A_Func_-_Fedora_Unified_Network_Controller.html">385 high scalability-2008-09-16-Product: Func - Fedora Unified Network Controller</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>5 0.77757722 <a title="295-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-15-ZooKeeper_-_A_Reliable%2C_Scalable_Distributed_Coordination_System_.html">350 high scalability-2008-07-15-ZooKeeper - A Reliable, Scalable Distributed Coordination System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: ZooKeeperis ahigh available and reliable coordination system. Distributed
applications use ZooKeeper to store and mediate updates key configuration
information. ZooKeeper can be used for leader election, group membership, and
configuration maintenance.In additionZooKeeper can be usedfor event
notification, locking, and as a priority queue mechanism. It's a sort of
central nervous system for distributed systems where the role of the brain is
played by the coordination service, axons are the network, processes are the

<p>Introduction: It's a sad fact of life, but processes die. I know, it's horrible. You start
them, send them out into process space, and hope for the best. Yet sometimes,
despite your best coding, they core dump, seg fault, or some other calamity
befalls them. Unlike our messy biological world so cruelly ruled by entropy,
in the digital world processes can be given another chance. They can be
restarted. A greater destiny awaits. And hopefully this time the random
lottery of unforeseen killing factors will be avoided and a long productive
life will be had by all.This is fun code to write because it's a lot more
complicated than you might think. And restarting processes is a highly
effective high availability strategy. Most faults are transient, caused by an
unexpected series of events. Rather than taking drastic action, like taking a
node out of production or failing over, transients can be effectively masked
by simply restarting failed processes. Though complexity makes it a fun
problem, it's also why</p><p>3 0.88382423 <a title="295-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-28-Pursue_robust_indefinite_scalability_with_the_Movable_Feast_Machine.html">1127 high scalability-2011-09-28-Pursue robust indefinite scalability with the Movable Feast Machine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and
Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper: Pursue robust
indefinite scalability, wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural
networks, starting from scratch.What is this strange thing calledindefinite
scalability? They sound like words that don't really go together:Indefinite
scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended
computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense
as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network
designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable
because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-
core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of
numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-
engineered.Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to
programmers using rei</p><p>4 0.86477172 <a title="295-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN_is_Not_a_Silver_Bullet_for_Network_Scalability.html">1256 high scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN is Not a Silver Bullet for Network Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak(CCIE#1354 Emeritus) is Chief Technology Advisor atNIL Data
Communications,author of numerous webinarsandadvanced networking books, and
aprolific blogger. He's focusing on data center and cloud networking, network
virtualization, and scalable application design.OpenFlow is an interesting
emerging networking technology appearingseemingly out of nowhere with much
hype and fanfarein March 2011. More than a year later, there are two
commercial products based on OpenFlow (NEC's Programmable FlowandNicira's
Network Virtualization Platform) and probably less than a dozen production-
grade implementations (includingGoogle's G-Scale networkandIndiana
University's campus network). Is this an expected result for an emerging
technology or another case of overhyped technology hitting limits imposed by
reality?OpenFlow-based solutions have to overcome numerous problems every
emerging technology is facing, in OpenFlow's case ranging from compatibility

<p>Introduction: Let me begin by saying that I have used and continue to use various ORM
frameworks such as hibernate, ibatis, propel and activerecord in applications
and websites that have a user base ranging from a couple hundred to 500k
users. Especially for projects that have to be up and running in a short
duration of time, ORM frameworks significantly reduce the effort required to
manipulate and persist OOP objects by providing time saving facilities such as
automatically generated model objects, integrated unit testing, secure
variable substitution, etc. Hibernate even supports horizontal data
partitioning via Hibernate Shards.However, the lay of the land is
significantly different in the rarefied space occupied by applications needing
to support millions of users. Profiling an application at this level and
paying particular attention to the operations needed to move data to and from
the database, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the operations
are API related, whereby the ORM fr</p><p>6 0.832147 <a title="295-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-24-Strategy%3A_Using_Lots_of_RAM_Often_Cheaper_than_Using_a_Hadoop_Cluster.html">1445 high scalability-2013-04-24-Strategy: Using Lots of RAM Often Cheaper than Using a Hadoop Cluster</a></p>

GigaSpaces XAP, Scalr, RightScale and FreedomOSS can be used to handle peak
load within EC2.Theo Schlossnagle, with his usual insight, talks about
inDissecting today's surgeshow the nature of internet traffic has evolved over
time. Traffic now spikes like a heart attack, larger and more quickly than
ever from traffic inflow sources like Digg and The New York Times. Theo
relates howAt least eight times in the past month, we've experienced from 100%
to 1000% sudden increases in traffic across many of our clientsand those spike
can happen as quickly as 60 seconds. To me this sounds a lot likePunctuated

<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg, the first paid employee at reddit, teaches us a lot about how
to create a successful social site in a really good talk he gave at the RAMP
conference. Watch it here at Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion-
Pitfalls and Lessons.Jeremy uses a virtue and sin approach. Examples of the
mistakes made in scaling reddit are shared and it turns out they did a lot of
good stuff too. Somewhat of a shocker is that Jeremy is now a Reliability
Architect at Netflix, so we get a little Netflix perspective thrown in for
free.Some of the lessons that stood out most for me: Think of SSDs as cheap
RAM, not expensive disk. When reddit moved from spinning disks to SSDs for the
database the number of servers was reduced from 12 to 1 with a ton of
headroom. SSDs are 4x more expensive but you get 16x the performance. Worth
the cost. Give users a little bit of power, see what they do with it, and turn
the good stuff into features. One of the biggest revelations for me was how

<p>Introduction: Seldom do we get to hear stories of the bumps and bruses earned by a popular
website during its formative years. Ross Snyder, a Sr. Software Engineer at
Etsy, changes that with an engaging talk he gave at Surge 2011:Scaling Etsy:
What Went Wrong, What Went Right.Ross gives a detailed and honest account of
how Etsy went from a raw startup in 2005, to a startup struggling with their
success in 2007, to the mean, handmade, super scaling, ops driven machine
they've become in 2011.There's lots to learn from this illuminating story of
transformation:Origin StoryEtsyis a market for handmade goods. They connect
buyers and sellers, similar to eBay, they don't handle goods.Started: June

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO ofiDoneThis, which makes status
reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch.iDoneThisis
a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day
to ask, "What'd you get done today?" Just reply with a few lines of what you
got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what
the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and
kickstart another awesome day.Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a
weekend in the most rudimentary way possible. I kid you not, we sent the first
few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox. The upshot
is that we've had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.We've gone
from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by
hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming
emails per month. In total, customers have recorded over 1.7 million
dones.Stat</p><p>5 0.81304258 <a title="344-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-20-A_Scalability_Lament.html">659 high scalability-2009-07-20-A Scalability Lament</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In Scalabilityissues for dummiesAlex Barrera talks movingly about the
challenges he faces trying to scale his startupinkzeeas the lone developer.
Inkzee is anonline news reader that automatically groups similar topics. This
is a cool problem and is one you know right away is going to have some killer
scalability problems as the number of feeds and the number of users increase.
And these problems lead to the point of the post, toexplain here what are
scalability problems and how deep the repercussions are for a small company,
which Alex does admirably.Some takeaways:Sites are composed of a frontend and
backend. The backend isn't visible to users, but it does all the work and this
is where the scalability problems show up.As more and more users use a site it
becomes slow because more users reveal bottlenecks in the system that weren't
visible before.There can be many many reasons for these bottlenecks. They are
often very hard to find because the backend systems are very complex and have</p><p>6 0.81183052 <a title="344-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-Should_Twitter_be_an_All-You-Can-Eat_Buffet_or_a_Vending_Machine%3F.html">330 high scalability-2008-05-27-Should Twitter be an All-You-Can-Eat Buffet or a Vending Machine?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a question asked on theycombinatorlist and there are some good
responses. I gave a quick response, but I particularly like neilk's knock out
of the park insightful answer:Read Cal Henderson's book. (I'd add in Theo's
book and Release It! too)The center of your design should be the data store,
not a process. You transition the data store from state to state, securely and
reliably, in small increments.Avoid globals and session state. The more "pure"
your function is, the easier it will be to cache or partition.Don't make your
data store too smart. Calculations and renderings should happen in a separate,
asynchronous process.The data store should be able to handle lots of
concurrent connections. Minimize locking. (Read about optimistic
locking).Protect your algorithm from the implementation of the data store,
with a helper class or module or whatever. But don't (DO NOT) try to build a
framework for any conceivable query. Just the ones your algorithm
needs.Viewing an application as</p><p>same-blog 2 0.94589722 <a title="344-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-09-FaceStat%27s_Rousing_Tale_of_Scaling_Woe_and_Wisdom_Won.html">344 high scalability-2008-06-09-FaceStat's Rousing Tale of Scaling Woe and Wisdom Won</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lukas Biewald shares a fascinatingslam by slam recountof how
hisFaceStat(upload your picture and be judged by the masses) site was battered
by a link on Yahoo's main page that caused an almost instantaneous 650,000
page view jump on their site. Yahoo spends considerable effort making sure its
own properties can handle the truly massive flow from the main page. Turning
theGreat Eyeof the Internet towards an unsuspecting newborn site must be quite
the diaper ready experience. Theo Schlossnagle eerily prophesized about such
events inThe Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture:
massive, unexpected and sudden traffic spikes will become more common as a
fickle internet seeks ever for new entertainments (my summary). Exactly

is the problem, their architecture now serves 100 times the original load.How

<p>Introduction: There's a popular line of thought that says don't waste time on optimization
because developing features is more important than saving money. True, you can
always add resources, but at some point, especially in a more mature part of a
product lifecycle: performance equals $$$.Two great examples of this evolution
come from Facebook and Google. The upshot is that when you spend time and
money on optimizing your tool chain you can get huge wins in performance,
control, and costs. Certainly, don't bother if you are just starting, but at
some point you may want to switch to big development efforts in improving
efficiency.Facebook and HipHopThe Facebook example is quite well known:HipHop,
a static PHP compiler released in 2010, after two years of development. PHP
because Facebook implements their web tierin PHP. They've now developed a
dynamic compiler,HipHop VM, using techniques like JIT, side exits, HipHop
bytecode, type prediction, and parallel tracelet linking.This is an incredible

<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To
$20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems hits Hacker News and
generates agood conversation. One of the common sentiments about the cloud was
raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own
hardware instead of using the cloud?Ryan Park, Operations Engineer at
Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfectmodern responseto that
ultimate existential design dilemma:Our #1 requirement has been to keep up
with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that
there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast
enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a
dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which
gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud
providers.AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to
the list price for on-demand instances. But</p><p>5 0.91703045 <a title="344-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy%3A_Break_Up_the_Memcache_Dog_Pile_.html">673 high scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy: Break Up the Memcache Dog Pile </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog
PileEffectinDog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails. Glenn
Franxman also has a Django solution inMintCache.Data is usually cached because
it's too expensive to calculate for every hit. Maybe it's a gnarly SQL query

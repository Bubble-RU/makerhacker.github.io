<p>Introduction: One of the best projects I've ever worked on was creating a large scale web
site publishing system that was almost entirely static. A large team of very
talented creatives made the art work, writers penned the content, and
designers generated templates. All assets were controlled in a database. Then
all that was extracted, after applying many different filters, to a static
site that was uploaded via ftp to dozens of web servers. It worked great.
Reliable, fast, cheap, and simple. Updates were a bit of a pain as it required
pushing a lot of files to a lot of servers, and that took time, but otherwise
a solid system.Alas, this elegant system was replaced with a new fangled

<p>Introduction: High Performance Multithreaded Access to Amazon SimpleDBis a great follow up
to the idea inHow SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMSthat more programming is the
price paid for performance in SimpleDB. It shows how much work and
infrastructure is required to batter better performance out of
SimpleDB.Remember, in SimpleDB you get keys to records from queries so if you
want to get all the fields for records you need to make separate requests.
Since SimpleDB isn't exactly a speed daemon the obvious strategy is to
parallelize. Even if a job takes a 100 msecs you can get a lot done in a
little time if you can execute enough jobs in parallel.Parallelization is the
approach taken by Haakon@AWS in his Java code example of how to get the most
out of SimpleDB. You can find the code atIndexing and Querying Amazon S3
Metadata with Amazon SimpleDB. We'll also consider how a back-end service
architecture built on Erlang may be a better fit with cloud computing.breakTwo

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: Matthew Might, as a first responder to a surprisetraffic surgeon his
inexpensive linode hosted blog, took emergency steps that you might find
useful in a similar situation:Find the bottleneck. Reloading the page in
firebug showed the first page took 24 seconds to load and after that
everything else loaded quickly. In retrospect this burst meant the site was
thread limited as the CPU was idle.Cut image sizes in halfwith a shell script
using ImageMagick's convert. Load time is now 12 seconds.Turn dynamic content
into static content using a static index.html file  copied using the browser's
"view source" feature. Load time is now 6 seconds.Added threadsto the Apache
configuration file. Load time is now 2 seconds. Crises averted.Because of this
quick thinking and quick action the patient survived to serve pages another
day.And in fine post-mortem tradition some of the future changes are: Run a
cron job to trigger an earlier alert. Email when requests exceed a per second

<p>Introduction: In the articleThe Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us, a lot of
interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from
Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and
work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn
in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting
the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-
in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer
specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed
development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and
reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5 second procedure;
capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git
for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem;
memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10
minutes; videos, articl</p><p>3 0.73152214 <a title="365-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-26-17_Techniques_Used_to_Scale_Turntable.fm_and_Labmeeting_to_Millions_of_Users.html">1124 high scalability-2011-09-26-17 Techniques Used to Scale Turntable.fm and Labmeeting to Millions of Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InHow to launch in a month and scale to a million users,Joseph Perla, Former
VP of Technology and founding team of Turntable.fm, shares techniques he used
to build and quickly scale his startups. The post is very well written and a
must read. Here are the essentials:Keep it simple.Build API's before making
the website or mobile apps. Keep interfaces small and single-purpose. Get it
right.Build in automated tests from the start. Create function tests, module
level tests, and full integration tests. Run tests on every commit. No new
code written while bugs exist.Don't hide power.UsePebblesto write bug-free
Javascript, a library to create complicated AJAX interactions by writing 0
javascript by adding a few extra HTML tags to code.Use procedure arguments to
provide flexibility in an interface.Pass functions instead of parameters to

analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly

<p>Introduction: Release It!authorMichael Nygard tells a tale of two web sites, both brought
low by unexpectedly huge unbounded results sets that slowed down their sites
to the speed of a Christmas checkout line.I've committed this error more than
a few times. During testing the results sets are often small, so you don't see
problems. Or when a product is new you don't have a lot of data so everything
is fine, until some magic line is crossed and you get that dreaded 2AM fix it
call.breakMy most embarrassing bug of this type caused a rather spectacular
failure at a customer site as the variance in response times was out of spec
and this kicked in penalty clauses. What happened was the customer had a
larger network than we could even test (customers always get the good stuff).
I took a lock and went to get all the data. Because the result set was so much
larger in their larger system I took the lock for many more milliseconds than
I should have.

<p>Introduction: Pre-generating static files is an oldy but a goody, and as Thomas Brox RĂ¸st
says, it's probably an underused strategy today. At one time this was the
dominate technique for structuring a web site. Then the age of dynamic web
sites arrived and we spent all our time worrying how to make the database
faster and add more caching to recover the speed we had lost in the transition
from static to dynamic.Static files have the advantage of being very fast to
serve. Read from disk and display. Simple and fast. Especially when caching
proxies are used. The issue is how do you bulk generate the initial files, how
do you serve the files, and how do you keep the changed files up to date? This
is the process Thomas covers in his excellent articleServing static files with
Django and AWS - going fast on a budget", where he explains how he converted
600K thousand previously dynamic pages to static pages for his
siteEventseer.net, a service for tracking academic events.Eventseer.net was

<p>Introduction: Eric Pickup from Youporn.com posted on anews group that Youporn is now 100%
Redis based and will soon be revealing more about their architecture at
theConFoo conference. Some stunning, but not surprising numbers were

over 300k queries per second.Some additional nuggets:Additional Redis nodes
were added because the network cards couldn't keep up with Redis.Impressed
with Redis' performance.All reads come from Redis;  we are maintaining MySQL

is found in hashes with ordered sets used to know what data to show.   A

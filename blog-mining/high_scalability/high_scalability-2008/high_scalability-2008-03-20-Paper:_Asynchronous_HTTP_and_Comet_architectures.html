<p>Introduction: Comet is anactive distributed key-value storebuilt at the University of
Washington. The paper describing Comet is Comet: An active distributed key-
value store, there are also slides, and a MP3 of a presentation given atOSDI
'10. Here's a succinct overview of Comet:Today's cloud storage services, such
as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety
of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes,
fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility
first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption
keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage
service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their
data's behavior inside the storage service.I found this paper quite
interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-
value store, which turns it into what might called a key-code store. This is
something</p><p>3 0.14677221 <a title="286-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Letting_Clients_Know_What%27s_Changed%3A_Push_Me_or_Pull_Me%3F.html">205 high scalability-2008-01-10-Letting Clients Know What's Changed: Push Me or Pull Me?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a false beliefI thought I came here to stayWe're all just visitingAll
just breaking like wavesThe oceans made me, but who came up with me?Push me,
pull me, push me, or pull me out .So true Perl Jam(Push me Pull me lyrics), so
true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes.
Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from
servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.breakTo pull
events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server.
This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a
list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has
changed and makes those changes available to you. Knowing what has changed can
be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very
complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state
on what I client still needs to see.Polling is heavy man. Imagine all your

<p>Introduction: Hi,First of all I want to to say that this is an extremely interesting and
informative website. i have enjoyed reading the various posts on how the big
sites scale to meet the needs of their customers.The service we are developing
is a webcam service. The client application sends images to the server via
HTTP POST and they are saved in folder specified by the users id. When a new
image is sent to the server it will overwrite the current image.Users can then
view the images via our web server.Ideally we want the images to upload as
quickly as possible and allow users to view them as quickly as possible.Would
I be correct to assume that when the number of uploading clients exceeds the
capability of the server the only way to scale is to add more hardware.Also I
assume that to use HTTP accelerator caches will not speed up viewing the
images as the new images will invalidate the cache.I appreciate any input on
the subject.</p><p>6 0.58211869 <a title="286-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-05-Put_the_web_server_on_a_diet_and_increase_scalability.html">316 high scalability-2008-05-05-Put the web server on a diet and increase scalability</a></p>

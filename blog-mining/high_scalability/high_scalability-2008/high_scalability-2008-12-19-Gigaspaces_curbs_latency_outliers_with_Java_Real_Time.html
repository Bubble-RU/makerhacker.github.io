World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them

is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,EhcacheTerracotta Inc.Note:
this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are
still generally valid and useful.The legendary Moore's Law, which states that
the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated
circuit doubles approximately every two years, has held true since 1965. It
follows that integrated circuits will continue to get smaller, with chip
fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm process (1). Users of big iron
hardware, or servers that are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity,
benefit from this trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful
over time. At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum
mechanics will preclude further density increases.At the same time, low-cost
commodity hardware influences enterprise architects to scale their
applications horizontally, where processing is spread across clusters of low-
cost commodity serv</p><p>4 0.18132684 <a title="471-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-07-Sun_Acquires_Q-layer_in_Cloud_Computing_Play.html">486 high scalability-2009-01-07-Sun Acquires Q-layer in Cloud Computing Play</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++
to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development
productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and
platform independence (Java Bytecode). They may even have gotten better
throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and
application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking
applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution,
you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor.
Why? Because of the unpredictable pauses introduced by the garbage collector
which result in significant jitter (variance of execution time).In this post
Frederic Pariente Engineering Manager at Sun Microsystems posted a summary of
a case study on how the use of Sun Real Time JVM and GigaSpaces was used in
the context of of a customer proof-of-concept this summer to ensureguaranteed

completely vendor independent, as that's the only honor preserving and
technically accurate way of doing these things.The webinar will run about 60
minutes, with 40 minutes of speechifying and 20 minutes for questions.The
hashtag for the event on Twitter will beSQLNoSQL. I'll be monitoring that
hashtag if you have any suggestions for the webinar or if you would like to

<p>Introduction: Hi,Every application server has its own session management implementations for
supporting high scalability. But an application architect/developer has to
design and implement the application to make the best use of it.What are the
guiding principles and pattern for session state management?Websphere System
management red book mentions that "Session management performance is optimum
when session data per user is around 2Kb. It degrades if session data is more
than that".I have following questions.1. How do you measure session data per
user?2. It is generally recommended that you should keep all the session state
in database and keep only the keys in HttpSession object. Then everytime a web
request is processed, session data is fetched from the database. This way all
the data remains in memory only till the request is processed and actual data
in HttpSession is very less. (Only few keys).What is the general practice?At
what point you should be switching from keeping data in HttpSession t</p><p>3 0.14509852 <a title="240-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-19-How_to_measure_memory_required_for_a_user_session.html">472 high scalability-2008-12-19-How to measure memory required for a user session</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Nobody came up with an example of a website powered by a Websphere product
(which has a community edition) and backed up by a DB2 database.I guess you
all know about usopen.org so here's the story:breakWhile the re-emergence of
35-year-old Andre Agassi and the continued dominance of wunderkind Maria
Sharapova have highlighted the on-court headlines at this year's U.S. Open
Tennis Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., IBM is hoping its new Power5
chip-based IT support for USOpen.org can make news among those more interested
in .NET than tennis nets.Big Blue has partnered with the U.S. Tennis
Association and the U.S. Open -- the most prestigious tennis tournament in the
U.S. -- since 1992. Together, they launched USOpen.org in 1995 so racket heads
could follow the matches online.The iSeries' role this year is in powering a
Web-based end-user application called "Point Tracker," a graphics tool using
autonomic technology that recreates the trajectory of every shot. On-court
cameras capt</p><p>5 0.13411243 <a title="240-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization_and_Cloud_Computing_is_Changing_the_Network_to_East-West_Routing.html">1157 high scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization and Cloud Computing is Changing the Network to East-West Routing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's called "east-west" networking, which when compared to its predecessor,
"north-south" networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane winds and
tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation between the
transformative shift this change in networking patterns has on the data center
with that of El NiÂçòo's transformative power upon the weather patterns across
the globe.Traditionally, data center networks have focused on North-South
network traffic. The assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly
communicate with servers at the core, rather than across the network to other
clients.But server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual
appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical
infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with workloads
moving to different physical locations on the network as virtual servers are
migrated (in the case of data center networks) and clients move about the
building (in the ca</p><p>6 0.13088866 <a title="240-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-22-Server_load_balancing_architectures%2C_Part_2%3A_Application-level_load_balancing.html">427 high scalability-2008-10-22-Server load balancing architectures, Part 2: Application-level load balancing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: NetApp MetroCluster SoftwareCost-effective is an integrated high-availability
storage cluster and site failover capability.NetApp MetroCluster is an
integrated high-availability and disaster recovery solution that can reduce
system complexity and simplify management while ensuring greater return on
investment. MetroCluster uses clustered server technology to replicate data
synchronously between sites located miles apart, eliminating data loss in case
of a disruption. Simple and powerful recovery process minimizes downtime, with
little or no user action required.At one company I worked at they used the
NetApp snap mirror feature to replicate data across long distances to multiple
datacenters. They had a very fast backbone and it worked well. The issue with
NetApp is always one of cost, but if you can afford it, it's a good option.</p><p>4 0.64652896 <a title="240-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-28-GemFire%3A_Solving_the_hardest_problems_in_data_management.html">730 high scalability-2009-10-28-GemFire: Solving the hardest problems in data management</a></p>

I felt that the users of this site might find our detailed description of how
we solve the hardest problems in data management interesting. This can be
viewed at:http://www.gemstone.com/hardest-problems(PDF available for
download).Also check out our industry page to see how GemFire applies to
multiple industries, then head over to the solutions page to see how GemFire
enables mainframe migration, real-time BI in data warehousing, RDB
scalup/speedup and the cloud. Finally, check out our community site if you
want a more technical view of GemFire. We hope you enjoy the new facelift and
content!</p><p>5 0.64446592 <a title="240-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-29-Second_Hand_Seizure_%3A_A_New_Cause_of_Site_Death.html">1070 high scalability-2011-06-29-Second Hand Seizure : A New Cause of Site Death</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Like a digital SWAT team that implodes the wrong door on a raid, the FBI
seized multiple racks of computers from DigitalOne, theseracks host websites
from many clients that just happened to be in the same racks as whomever they
are investigating. Downed sites include Instapaper, Curbed Network,
andPinboard. With thedensity of serversthese days many 1000s of sites could
easily have been effected.Sites like Pinboard were victims by association,
they did not inhale. This is an association sites have no control over. On a
shared hosting service, you have no control over your fellow VM mates. In a
cloud or a managed service, you have no control over which racks your servers
are in. So like second hand smoke, you get the disease by random association.
There's something inherently unfair about that.Acomment by illumin8 shows just
how Darth insidious this process can be:A popular method used by hackers is to
sign up for a virtual server with a stolen credit card. If they are careful

<p>Introduction: If using a DB to store session(used by some app server, ex.. websphere), how
would an enterprise class site that is housed in 2 different data centers(that
are live/live) maintain the session between both data centers.The problem as I
see it is that since each data center has their own session database, if I was
to flip the users to only access Data Center 1(by changing the DNS records for
the site or some other Load balancing technique) then that would cause all
previous Data Center 2 users to lose their session. What would be some pure
hardware based solutions to this that are being used now? That way the
applications supporting the web site can be abstracted from this.As I see now,
a solution is to possibly have the session databases in both centers some how
replicate the data to each other. I just don't see the best way to even
accomplish this you are not even guraunteed that the session ID's will be
unique since it's 2 different Application Server tiers(again websphere). Not

<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>4 0.88119537 <a title="240-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_eAccelerator_a_PHP_Accelerator.html">32 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: eAccelerator a PHP Accelerator</a></p>
<p>Introduction: eAcceleratoris a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic
content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in
their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely
eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution.
eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP
code by 1-10 times.</p><p>5 0.87630129 <a title="240-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay_history_and_architecture.html">550 high scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay history and architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ebay[1]Starts in 1995, initial name AuctionWeb (V1) :- very simple
architecture- based on perl- no database, for data persistence they used plain
filesBecause of rapid growth they needed to improve their architecture and so
V2 (clever name) was born:- replaced perl with C/C++- started using a database
in a master-slave configuration- C++ back-end- XSLT front-endAny request will
lead to an XML file being created in C++ and the XLST processor will transform
that into html.*pretty sophisticated architecture for the 90s, XLST was
cutting-edge back then*breakThat hold out pretty well for a while but in the
late 90s ebay experienced an exponential growth.They started having some
trouble with outages and needed improvements, so V3 was developed:- based on
java- search engine still used C++- proof that relational databases can scale
(aggressive caching)- developed a messaging layer for making a lot of
asyncronious calls, they actually ended up being sued because of the delay in

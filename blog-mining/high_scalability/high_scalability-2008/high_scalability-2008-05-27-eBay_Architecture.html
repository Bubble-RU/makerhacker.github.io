Architect, gives thispresentationon how eBay scales, for free. Randy has done
a fabulous job in this presentation and in other talks listed at the end of
this post getting at the heart of the principles behind scalability. It's more
about ideas of how things work and fit together than a focusing on a
particular technology stack.Impressive StatsIn case you weren't sure, eBay is
big, with lots of: users, data, features, and change...Over 89 million active
users worldwide190 million items for sale in 50,000 categoriesOver 8 billion

<p>Introduction: At eBay, one of the primary architectural forces we contend with every day is
scalability. It colors and drives every architectural and design decision we
make. With hundreds of millions of users worldwide, over two billion page
views a day, and petabytes of data in our systems, this is not a choice - it
is a necessity.In a scalable architecture, resource usage should increase
linearly (or better) with load, where load may be measured in user traffic,
data volume, etc. Where performance is about the resource usage associated
with a single unit of work, scalability is about how resource usage changes as
units of work grow in number or size. Said another way, scalability is the
shape of the price-performance curve, as opposed to its value at one point in
that curve.There are many facets to scalability - transactional, operational,
development effort. In this article, I will outline several of the key best
practices we have learned over time to scale the transactional throughput of a
web-</p><p>4 0.20013702 <a title="331-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay_history_and_architecture.html">550 high scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay history and architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ebay[1]Starts in 1995, initial name AuctionWeb (V1) :- very simple
architecture- based on perl- no database, for data persistence they used plain
filesBecause of rapid growth they needed to improve their architecture and so
V2 (clever name) was born:- replaced perl with C/C++- started using a database
in a master-slave configuration- C++ back-end- XSLT front-endAny request will
lead to an XML file being created in C++ and the XLST processor will transform
that into html.*pretty sophisticated architecture for the 90s, XLST was
cutting-edge back then*breakThat hold out pretty well for a while but in the
late 90s ebay experienced an exponential growth.They started having some
trouble with outages and needed improvements, so V3 was developed:- based on
java- search engine still used C++- proof that relational databases can scale
(aggressive caching)- developed a messaging layer for making a lot of
asyncronious calls, they actually ended up being sued because of the delay in

<p>Introduction: Alan Watts once observed how after we accepted Descartes' separation of the
mind and body we've been trying to smash them back together again ever since
when really they were never separate to begin with.The database normalization-
denormalization dualism has the same mobius shaped reverberations as
Descartes' error. We separate data into a million jagged little pieces and
then spend all our time stooping over, picking them and up, and joining them
back together again.Normalization has been standard practice now for decades.
But times are changing. Many mega-website architects are concluding Watts was
right: the data was never separate to begin with. And even more radical, we
may even need to store multiple copies of data.breakInformation

thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially
experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems
and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each
day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly
visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a
very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale
meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?Site:

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO ofMocoSpace, describing
the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely
architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very
large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their
system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile
Web; their multi-tiered, read/write, local/distributed caching system;
selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.MocoSpace is
a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a
month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the
US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser,

<p>Introduction: Update 2:EBay's Randy Shoup spills the secrets of how to service hundreds of
millions of users and over two billion page views a day in ScalabilityBest
Practices: Lessons from eBayon InfoQ. The practices: Partition by Function,
Split Horizontally, Avoid Distributed Transactions, Decouple Functions
Asynchronously, Move Processing To Asynchronous Flows, Virtualize At All
Levels, Cache Appropriately.Update:eBay Serves 5 Billion API Calls Each Month.
Aren't we seeing more and more traffic driven by mashups composed on top of
open APIs? APIs are no longer a bolt on, they are your application.
Architecturally that argues for implementing your own application around the
same APIs developers and users employ.Who hasn't wondered how eBay does their
business? As one of the largest most loaded websites in the world, it can't be
easy. And the subtitle of the presentation hints at how creating such a
monster system requires true engineering: Striking a balance between site

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the Stack Overflow Architecture.
Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack
Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up
and out in the last few years.Stack Overflow has grown up by more then
doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page
views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  Stack Overflow has
grown out by expanding into theStack Exchange Network, which includes Stack
Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different
sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.What hasn't changed is
Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted
this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been
handling their growth: Stack Exchange's Architecture in Bullet Points, Stack
Overflow's New York Data Center, Designing For Scalability of Management and

<p>Introduction: Like many other media content providers, libraries and museums are
increasingly moving their content onto the Web.  While the move itself is no
easy process (with digitization, web development, and training costs), being
able to successfully deliver content to a wide audience is an ongoing concern,
particularly for large libraries.Much of the concern is financial, as most
libraries do not have the internal budget or outside investors that for-profit
businesses enjoy.  Even large university libraries will face serious budget
constraints that even other university departments, such as science and
technology would not face.Creating a scalable infrastructure and also
distributing a large digital collection that can handle multiple requests,
requires planning that many librarians have not even imagined.  They must stop
thinking in terms of "one-item-per-customer" and start thinking in terms of
numerous users accessing the same information simultaneously.Content Delivery

<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300
thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially
experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems
and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each
day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly
visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a
very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale
meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?Site:

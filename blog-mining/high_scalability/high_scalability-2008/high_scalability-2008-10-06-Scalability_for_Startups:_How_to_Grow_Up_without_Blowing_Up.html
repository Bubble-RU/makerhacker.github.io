<p>Introduction: At eBay, one of the primary architectural forces we contend with every day is
scalability. It colors and drives every architectural and design decision we
make. With hundreds of millions of users worldwide, over two billion page
views a day, and petabytes of data in our systems, this is not a choice - it
is a necessity.In a scalable architecture, resource usage should increase
linearly (or better) with load, where load may be measured in user traffic,
data volume, etc. Where performance is about the resource usage associated
with a single unit of work, scalability is about how resource usage changes as
units of work grow in number or size. Said another way, scalability is the
shape of the price-performance curve, as opposed to its value at one point in
that curve.There are many facets to scalability - transactional, operational,
development effort. In this article, I will outline several of the key best
practices we have learned over time to scale the transactional throughput of a

<p>Introduction: Surgeis a conference put on by OmniTI targeting practical Scalability matters.
OmniTI specializes in helping people solve their scalability problems, as is
only natural, as it was founded by Theo Schlossnagle, author of the
canonicalScalable Internet Architectures. Now that Surge 2011 is on the
horizon, they've generously made available nearly all thevideos from the Surge
2010conference.  A pattern hopefully every conference will follow (only don't
wait a year please). We lose a lot of collective wisdom from events not being
available online in a timely manner.In truth, nearlyall the talksare on topic
and are worth watching, but here are a few that seem especially relevant:Going

commenting system with 75 million comments and 250 million visitors. Lots of
good details on how they partition their database, testing, continuous
integration, feature switches, caching, delayed signals, and more.Things I
learnt tracking a billion events in 24 hours: Know your host, Scaling isn't
just servers, My servers need to talk to me more, Kill switches for users,
What you don't know is the problem, Don't mix server roles, Know your most
important users outside of your site.Tweets of Gold:georgebarnett: I read High

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure...A good night's sleep is why Facebook CTO
Bret Taylor says Friendfeed should have gone cloud, let others take the
midnight watch, even if it costs a bit more.James Urquhartwith an information
packed interview on a wide range of cloud topics: Cloud Expert Inside theCube
at Stata Conference. Highlights: cloud is an operations model, it is not a
technology, it is a way to apply technology to problems; the faster you can
get the resources into the hands of the people who use it the more money you
save overall; cloud is a cash flow story, not a savings story; services aren't
about servers or storage, they are about applications.Quotable Quotes:Ryan
Tomayko: Frameworks don't solve scalability problems, design solves
scalability problems. Via@GregSkloot@zuno: The golden rule of scalability: "it
can probably wait" look for other areas to save resources.@bihzad: joinserv

per month.Since scalability is considered a non-functional requirement, it is
often overlooked in the hopes of decreasing time to market. Adding scalability
down the road can decrease the time to market but only after assuming
significant technical debt.Balancing performance and scalability vs. fast
iteration and cost efficiency can be a significant challenge for startups. The
good news is that achieving this balance is not impossible.Read the rest of

<p>Introduction: With the Chapultepec aqueduct, also namedthe great aqueduct, theAztecsbuilt a
novel uninterruptible water supply for providing fresh water to Tenochtitlan,
their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still
around today: It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built
with high availability in mind. We findengineers being engineers, no matter
the age:It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of
compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the
bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466
AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to
mitigate its thirst.The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of
Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of
the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got
dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe while the dirty pipe was
cleaned</p><p>3 0.81849921 <a title="404-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-14-Parallel_Information_Retrieval_and_Other_Search_Engine_Goodness.html">810 high scalability-2010-04-14-Parallel Information Retrieval and Other Search Engine Goodness</a></p>

Search EnginesbyStefan Buttcher, Google Inc andCharles L. A. Clarke,Gordon V.
Cormack, both of the University of Waterloo. The full table of contents is on-
line and looks to be really interesting:Information retrieval is the
foundation for modern search engines. This text offers an introduction to the
core topics underlying modern search technologies, including algorithms, data
structures, indexing, retrieval, and evaluation. The emphasis is on
implementation and experimentation; each chapter includes exercises and
suggestions for student projects.Currently available is the full text of

<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novicexI am starting
a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality
possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).I have done some
research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I
have some basic knowledge on these.Following are my requirements1) My budget
is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).2)
I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first
2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And
more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)3)
90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.Based on the above,
could you please answer my following questions?1) Can I go with just a good
dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site
gets big? Or do you think its wise to start with a CDN service?2) Should I</p><p>5 0.8106842 <a title="404-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-09-Productivity_vs._Control_tradeoffs_in_PaaS.html">1002 high scalability-2011-03-09-Productivity vs. Control tradeoffs in PaaS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Gartner published recently an interesting paper: Productivity vs. Control:
Cloud Application Platforms Must Split to Win. (The paper requires
registration.)The paper does a pretty good job covering the evolution that is
taking place in the PaaS market toward a more open platform and compares
between the two main categories: aPaaS (essentially a PaaS running as a
service) and CEAP (Cloud Enabled Application Platform) which is the  *P* out
of PaaS that gives you the platform to build your own PaaS in private or
public cloud.While I was reading through the paper I felt that something
continued to bother me with this definition, even though I tend to agree with
the overall observation. If I follow the logic of this paper than I have to
give away productivity to gain control, hmmâ&euro;Ś  that's a hard choice.The issue
seem to be with the way we define productivity.

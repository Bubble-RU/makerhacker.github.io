<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case. Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on Fotolog in  Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success , which was one of my personal favorites.  Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've developed a</p><p>3 0.11076045 <a title="247-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-30-Facebook_and_Site_Failures_Caused_by_Complex%2C_Weakly_Interacting%2C_Layered_Systems.html">910 high scalability-2010-09-30-Facebook and Site Failures Caused by Complex, Weakly Interacting, Layered Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook has been so reliable that when a site outage does occur it's a definite learning opportunity. Fortunately for us we can learn something because in  More Details on Today's Outage , Facebook's  Robert Johnson  gave a pretty candid explanation of what caused a rare 2.5 hour period of down time for Facebook. It wasn't a simple problem. The root causes were feedback loops and transient spikes caused ultimately by the complexity of weakly interacting layers in modern systems. You know, the kind everyone is building these days. Problems like this are notoriously hard to fix and finding a real solution may send Facebook back to the whiteboard. There's a technical debt that must be paid. 
 
The outline and my interpretation (reading between the lines) of what happened is:
  
 Remember that Facebook  caches everything . They have   28  terabytes  of  memcached  data on 800 servers. The database is the system of record, but memory is where the action is.

<p>Introduction: Ehcache  is a pure Java cache with the following features: fast, simple, small foot print, minimal dependencies,  provides memory and disk stores for scalability into gigabytes, scalable to hundreds of caches is a pluggable cache for Hibernate, tuned for high concurrent load on large multi-cpu servers, provides LRU, LFU and FIFO cache eviction policies, and is production tested. Ehcache is used by  LinkedIn  to cache member  profiles. The user guide says it's possible to get at 2.5 times system speedup for persistent Object Relational Caching, a 1000 times system speedup for Web Page Caching, and a 1.6 times system speedup Web Page Fragment Caching.

<p>Introduction: Caching is not new of course, but I don't think I've heard of caching store procedure results before. It's like memoization in the database. Brent Ozar covers this idea inÂ  How to Cache Stored Procedure Results .
 
The benefits are the usual for doing work in the database, it doesn't take per developer per app work, just code it once in the stored proc and it works for everyone, everywhere, for all of time. The disadvantage is the usual as well, it adds extra load to a probably already busy database, so it should only be applied to heavy computations.
 
Brent positions this strategy as an emergency bandaid to apply when you need to take pressure off a database now. Developers can then work on moving the cache off the database and into its own tier. Interesting idea. And as the comments show the implementation is never as simple as it seems.</p><p>3 0.79963928 <a title="247-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy%3A_Break_Up_the_Memcache_Dog_Pile_.html">673 high scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy: Break Up the Memcache Dog Pile </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Asynchronous  HTTP cache validations . A proposed HTTP caching extension:  if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content, then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-experience.   Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin. Slow site: add caching.  Facebook  must have a lot of headaches because they popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called the   Dog Pile  Effect  in  Dog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails . Glenn Franxman also has a Django solution in  MintCache .

<p>Introduction: Ever come to a point where you feel you've learned enough to share your experiences in the hopes of helping others traveling the same road? That's what  Martin Kleppmann  has done in an lovingly written  Six things I wish we had known about scaling , an article well worth your time.
 
It's not advice about scaling a Twitter, but of building a million user system, which is the sweet spot for a lot of projects. His conclusion rings true:
  Building scalable systems is not all sexy roflscale fun. It’s a lot of plumbing and yak shaving. A lot of hacking together tools that really ought to exist already, but all the open source solutions out there are too bad (and yours ends up bad too, but at least it solves your particular problem).  
Here's a gloss on the six lessons (plus a bonus lesson):

<p>Introduction: We have a lot of dependencies to our SQL databases and we have heard that caching does help a lot as we move into scaling and providing better performance.     So the question is what are some reliable software products out there that we could consider in this space ? We want to put a lot of frequently called database calls that do not change frequently into this caching layer.     Also what would be an easy way to move only those database changes into the cache as opposed to reloading or pulling it into cache every few mins or hours.     We need something smart that would just push changes to the caching layer as it happens. I guess we could build our own, but are there any good reliable products out there ? Please also mention how they play with regards to pricing 'cos that would be a determining factor as well.     Thanks</p><p>2 0.9252066 <a title="247-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-24-Saving_Cash_Using_Less_Cache_-__90%25_Savings_in_the_Caching_Tier.html">1346 high scalability-2012-10-24-Saving Cash Using Less Cache -  90% Savings in the Caching Tier</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a paper delivered at HotCloud '12 by a group from CMU and Intel Labs,  Saving Cash by Using Less Cache  ( slides ,   pdf ), they show it may be possible to use less DRAM under low load conditions to save on operational costs. There are some issues with this idea, but in a give me more cache era, it could be an interesting source of cost savings for your product. 
 
 
 
Caching is used to:
  
 Reduce load on the database. 
 Reduce latency. 
  
Problem:
  
 RAM in the cloud is quite expensive. A third of costs can come from the caching tier. 
  
Solution: 
  
 Shrink your cache when the load is lower. Their work shows when the load drops below a certain point you can throw away 50% of your cache while still maintaining performance. 
 A few popular items often account for most of your hits, implying can remove the cache for the long tail.  
 Use two tiers of servers, the Retiring Group, which is the group of servers you want to get rid of.

<p>Introduction: This is a  guest repost  by  Sriram Devadas , Engineer at Vistaprint, Web platform group. A fun and well written analogy of how to scale web applications using a familiar coffee shop as an example. No coffee was harmed during the making of this post. 
 
I own a small coffee shop.   My expense is proportional to resources  100 square feet of built up area with utilities, 1 barista, 1 cup coffee maker.   My shop's capacity  Serves 1 customer at a time, takes 3 minutes to brew a cup of coffee, a total of 5 minutes to serve a customer.   Since my barista works without breaks and the German made coffee maker never breaks down,  my shop's maximum throughput = 12 customers per hour.

Customers walk away during peak hours. We only serve one customer at a time. There is no space to wait.   I upgrade shop. My new setup is better!

 A Friday the 13th Postmorterama:                       
 
 James Hamilton with some  high powered perspective  on the report for the Fukushima Nuclear Accident. Apparently they haven't heard of the blameless post-mortem. Lots of interesting stuff, but this is a potentially disaster saving general lesson learned: operators can’t figure out what is happening or take appropriate action without detailed visibility into the state of the system. 
 Evernote with a nicely detailed note  on a recent outage . A kernel panic happened while upgrading two new “shard” servers with 3x as much RAM, SSDs instead of 15krpm disks, bonded networking, and an updated kernel. They had to revert and shite loves to happen when other shite happens. 
 Heroku with their  postmortem on what happened  when AWS went down. They lost 30% of their instances across 3 AZs in the US-East region. Rich detail on the impact of the AWS, but not much on what they can do about it</p><p>5 0.89822757 <a title="247-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling_Twitter%3A_Making_Twitter_10000_Percent_Faster.html">639 high scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling Twitter: Making Twitter 10000 Percent Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 6:  Some interesting changes from Twitter's  Evan Weaver : everything in RAM now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability; switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them locally.  Update 5:   Twitter on Scala . A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners.

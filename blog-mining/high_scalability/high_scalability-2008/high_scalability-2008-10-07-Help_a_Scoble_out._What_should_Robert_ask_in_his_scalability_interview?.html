<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Barry Abrahamson, Chief Systems Wrangler at
Automattic, andNginx's Coufounder Andrew Alexeev.WordPress.com serves more
than 33 million sites attracting over 339 million people and 3.4 billion pages
each month. Since April 2008, WordPress.com has experienced about 4.4 times
growth in page views. WordPress.com VIP hosts many popular sites including
CNN's Political Ticker, NFL, Time Inc's The Page, People Magazine's Style
Watch, corporate blogs for Flickr and KROQ, and many more. Automattic operates
two thousand servers in twelve, globally distributed, data centers.
WordPress.com customer data is instantly replicated between different
locations to provide an extremely reliable and fast web experience for
hundreds of millions of visitors.ProblemWordPress.com, which began in 2005,
started on shared hosting, much like all of the WordPress.org sites. It was
soon moved to a single dedicated server and then to two servers. In late 2005,

open source this project as a part of Facebook's open source initiative, and
we hope it will be useful to others building real-time web services.You can

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignantFriendFeed threadcommiserating PodTech's
unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup.
Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with
them:Have a story.Have everyone on board with that story.If anyone goes off of
that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.Make sure
people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues
should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get
fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.Work ONLY for a leader who
will make the tough decisions.Build a place where excellence is expected,
allowed, and is enabled.Fire idiots quickly.If your engineering team can't
give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only
things that are measured ever get improved.When your stars aren't listened to
the company is in trouble.Getting rid of the CEO, even if it's all his fault,
won'</p><p>5 0.10409629 <a title="405-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-10-Webcast%3A_Advanced_Database_High_Availability_and_Scalability_Solutions.html">4 high scalability-2007-07-10-Webcast: Advanced Database High Availability and Scalability Solutions</a></p>

performed a sophisticated weighting of their popularity based on page range,
trust authority, Alexa rank, Google hits, and number of comments. When all the

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be
thankful for thesongof the tinniestsparrowatsunrise, I'll save you from all
that. It's hard to tie scalability and thegiving of thankstogether, especially
as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of
time. But I think I found a sentiment in A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and
MIRACLES byJames Bridlethat manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving
thanks meaningfully together:I distrust commercial definitions of innovation,
and particularly of awesomeness. It's an overused term. When I think of
awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.So I
started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for
me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.We're not actually very good
about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use
metaphors and examples. Douglas Adams writes somewhere about how big the

Matter at the Crypt on the Clarkenwell green. The main topics of this
cloud/grid computing community meeting were service-level agreements,

What should Robert ask in his scalability interview?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know
everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this
case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help?
Here's Robert's plight:I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest
interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.It’s on
Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.Look at
who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind
WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of
FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the
“don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million
users on Facebook in about 10 days.What would you ask?</p><p>4 0.69891608 <a title="405-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-21-Manage_virtualized_sprawl_with_VRMs.html">725 high scalability-2009-10-21-Manage virtualized sprawl with VRMs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The essence of my work is coming into daily contact with innovative
technologies. A recent example was at the request of a partner company who
wanted to answer- which one of these tools will best solve my virtualized
datacenter headache? After initial analysis all the products could be
classified as tools that troubleshoot VM sprawl, but there was no universally
accepted term for them. The most descriptive term  that I found was Virtual
Resource Manager (VRM) from DynamicOps. As I delved deeper into their
workings, the distinction between VRMs and Private Clouds became blurred. What
are the differences?Read more

<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node
then that root node can become overwhelmed:The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for
either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal
with the flood of requests.The network interface becomes a bottleneck because
a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then
clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an
undisciplined system.One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.
Jeff Dean, Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this
Stanford video presentation:Tree Distribution of Requests and
Responses.Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat
topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a
number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes.
Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset of
the leaf nodes.With this</p><p>6 0.54498547 <a title="405-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-23-Funny%3A_A_Cautionary_Tale_About_Storage_and_Backup.html">1162 high scalability-2011-12-23-Funny: A Cautionary Tale About Storage and Backup</a></p>

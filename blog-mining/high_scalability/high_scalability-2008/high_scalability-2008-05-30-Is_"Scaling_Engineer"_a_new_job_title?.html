<p>Introduction: Hi everybodyI'm wondering what you would do: I develop a webapp using Grails,
Memcached and Mysql as persistence. Now, I have following domain classes
(simplified):Product: Can be in one categoryCategory: Can have nested
children, and have multiple products.I need to access all product objects by
id which led me to the idea to store all products in one big Memcached-entry
with a key: PRODUCTMAP and as value, all product attributes as array, like:
[productId1: [title: 'title'], productId2: [title: 'title']]If I browse to
category 4, I simply get my map categoryMap with value [cateoryId:
[productId1, productId2]]I also can list all products of a certain category by
providing that id. The bad thing about this is that I always have to put back
everything if I modify a single product.Who can give advice how to realize
that?Any help will be appreciated! Thanks,BestSullivan</p><p>3 0.093664363 <a title="335-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Inspired by axkcd comic,Peter Norvig,Director of Research at Google and all
around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving
a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful
systems profiled on HighScalability.The original code is atxkcd 1313: Regex
Golf, which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the
winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is
readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but
soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find
regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's
deliberate strategy for finding a regex.The post demonstrating the iterated
improvement of the program is atxkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite
Problems). As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the
program Peter recommends the following steps: Profiling: Figure out where the
program spends its time. Speed</p><p>3 0.59853739 <a title="335-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC_for_web-DB_servers.html">226 high scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC for web-DB servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The need for IT consolidation is most evident in two types of organizations.
In the first group, IT grew organically with business over the decades, and
survived changes of strategy, management, staff and vendor orientation. The
second group of businesses capital groups are characterized by rapid growth
through acquisitions (followed by attempts to integrate radically different IT
environments). In both groups, their IT infrastructures have typically been
pieced together over the past 20 (or more) years.ďťżRead more

<p>Introduction: Justin.tv is looking to hire aScaling Engineerto help scale their video
cluster, IRC server, web app, monitoring and search services. I've never seen
this job title before. A quick search that showed only a few previous
instances of it being used. Has anyone else seen Scaling Engineer as a job
title before?It's a great idea. Scaling is certainly a worthy specialty of
it's own. Why there's a difficult lingo, obscure tools, endlessly subtle
concepts, a massive body of knowledge to master, and many competing religious
factions. All a good start. Next I see a chain of Scalability Universities.
Maybe use all those Starbucks that are closing down. Contact me for franchise
opportunities :-)</p><p>3 0.67246926 <a title="335-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-17-Scalable_CMS%3F.html">95 high scalability-2007-09-17-Scalable CMS?</a></p>

GemFire has reached a stage of maturity in its evolution. GemStone touts this
version as the true 'best of breed' distributed caching technology, solving
scalability issues in all industries.</p><p>5 0.66361094 <a title="335-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-08-ID_generator.html">145 high scalability-2007-11-08-ID generator</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I would like feed back on a ID generator I just made. What positive and
negative effects do you see with this. It's programmed in Java, but could just
as easily be programmed in any other typical language. It's thread safe and
does not use any synchronization. When testing it on my laptop, I was able to
generate 10 million IDs within about 15 seconds, so it should be more than
fast enough.Take a look at the attachment.. (had to rename it from IdGen.java
to IdGen.txt to attach it)IdGen.java</p><p>6 0.65781915 <a title="335-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Flickr.html">41 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Flickr</a></p>

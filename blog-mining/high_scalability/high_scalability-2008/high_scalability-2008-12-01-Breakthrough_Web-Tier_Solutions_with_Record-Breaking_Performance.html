<p>Introduction: It started out innocently enough with a simple question, "What exactly *is*
the model for PaaS services scalability? If based on HTTP/REST API
integration, fairly easy. If native middleware… input?" You'll forgive the odd
phrasing - Twitter's limitations sometimes make conversations of this nature …
interesting.The discussion culminated in what appeared to be the sentiment
that middleware was mostly obsolete with respect to PaaS.THE OLD WAYVery
briefly for those of you who are more infrastructure / network minded than
application architecture fluent, let's review the traditional middleware-based
application architecture.Generally speaking, middleware - a.k.a. JMS, MQ
Series and most recently, ESB - is leveraged as means to enable a publish-
subscribe model of sharing data. Basically, it's an integration pattern, but
no one really likes to admit that because of the connotations associated with
the evil word "integration" in the enterprise. But that's what it's used for -

<p>Introduction: Reducing the costs of IT infrastructure and improving the manageability and
efficiency of web services pose significant challenges for many organizations
in today's economic climate. Recent studies describe the challenges IT
managers face administering the proliferation of x86-based servers used to run
web services applications. Those reports reveal that using large number of
x86-based systems can increase space and power consumption, as well as cost
and asset management overhead. In addition, many of these x86-based systems
run a mixture of operating system and application software leading to
increased management complexity and potential security concerns.Faced with
these challenges, many organizations are attracted by the idea of
consolidating web and application services from multiple x86-based servers to
a smaller number of high-performance servers. This approach strives to help
simplify management, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of
delivering web services. The co</p><p>4 0.11258167 <a title="453-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-25-Is_Your_Data_Really_Secured%3F.html">727 high scalability-2009-10-25-Is Your Data Really Secured?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Caching/data-grids are going through a similar evolution to databases. As with
databases, we started by using caching as an embedded service to the
application. Now we are in the phase where we need to be able to share the
data between multiple applications, or in cases where we don't want to share
the data, we need to be able to share the resources for managing the data,
while keeping a high degree of isolation.The demand for these sort of
requirements becomes much more common with SOA or SaaS-based applications. As
we approach the next generation of middleware and data-centers, it becomes
clear that we cannot move to the next wave of virtualization and cloud
computing without a strong security and isolation solution that is built-in to
all layers of our application and middleware.</p><p>5 0.087261938 <a title="453-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-23-Building_Redundant_Datacenter_Networks_is_Not_For_Sissies_-_Use_an_Outside_WAN_Backbone.html">1392 high scalability-2013-01-23-Building Redundant Datacenter Networks is Not For Sissies - Use an Outside WAN Backbone</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak, in his short and information packed REDUNDANT DATA CENTER
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY video, shows why networking as played at the highest
levels is something you want to leave to professionals, like alarge animal
country vetenariandelivering a stuck foal at 2AM on a dark and stormy night.
There are always a lot questions about the black art of building redundant
datacenter networks and there's a shortage of accessible explanations. What I
liked about Ivan's video is how effortlessly he explains the issues and
tradeoffs you can expect in designing your own solution, as well as giving
creative solutions to those problems. A lot of years of experience are boiled
down to a 17 minute video.Ivan begins by showing what a canonical fully
redundant datacenter would look like:It's like an ark where everything goes
two by two. You have two datacenters, each datacenter has redundant core
switches, redundant servers, redundant disk arrays, redundant links between
datacenters (for synchro</p><p>6 0.084426239 <a title="453-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-23-Salesforce_Architecture_-_How_they_Handle_1.3_Billion_Transactions_a_Day.html">1521 high scalability-2013-09-23-Salesforce Architecture - How they Handle 1.3 Billion Transactions a Day</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>3 0.67068923 <a title="453-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-24-A_Scalable%2C_Commodity_Data_Center_Network_Architecture.html">371 high scalability-2008-08-24-A Scalable, Commodity Data Center Network Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Looks interesting...Abstract:Today's data centers may contain tens of
thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The
network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching
elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up
the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP
switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate
bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring
tremendous cost. Nonuniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates
application design and limits overall system performance.In this paper, we
show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full
aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements.
Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more
specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and
interconnected commodity s</p><p>4 0.64190525 <a title="453-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-The_cost_of_High_Availability_%28HA%29_with_Oracle_.html">813 high scalability-2010-04-19-The cost of High Availability (HA) with Oracle </a></p>

uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.This post focuses on a

<p>Introduction: With the explosive growth of the Internet, increasing complexity of user
requirements, and wide choice of hardware, operating systems, and middleware,
IT executives are facing new challenges in their application infrastructures.
Rapid expansion of the application tier has resulted in significant cost and
complexity, and many organizations are simply running out of datacenter space,
power, and cooling.</p><p>4 0.86388057 <a title="453-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-01-Moving_Beyond_End-to-End_Path_Information_to_Optimize_CDN_Performance.html">712 high scalability-2009-10-01-Moving Beyond End-to-End Path Information to Optimize CDN Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,
we analyze latencies measured</p><p>5 0.83709002 <a title="453-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-12-The_Rise_of_the_Virtual_Cellular_Machines.html">826 high scalability-2010-05-12-The Rise of the Virtual Cellular Machines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

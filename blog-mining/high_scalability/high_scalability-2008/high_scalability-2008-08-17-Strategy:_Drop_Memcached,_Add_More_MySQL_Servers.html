<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: Matt, from the ever excellentMySQL Performance Blog, decided to run a test
using a simple scenario drawn from his client experience in the gaming space.
The scenario: read a row based on a primary key, update the row, write it to
disk, and use the row to lookup another row. Matt ran three different tests
explained in a series of three different articles:MySQL and MySQL + Memcached,
Memcached Only, andTokyo Tyrant.The lovingly compiled details along with many
cool graphs are in the articles, but in general the lessons learned are:When
memcached hasenough memory(so records being accessed are in RAM), memcached +
MySQL can provide a10x performance boostover MySQL alone. When the RAM is too
small and hot records, those being accessed a lot, aren't in RAM, or perhaps
applications are doing a sequential scan of a table and the entire table isn't
cached, then memcached won't be the big bang improvement you may be hoping
for.When the database is removed and memcached serves both reads and writ</p><p>4 0.74341106 <a title="367-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-30-More_Troubles_with_Caching.html">911 high scalability-2010-09-30-More Troubles with Caching</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a tasty pairing withFacebook And Site Failures Caused By Complex, Weakly
Interacting, Layered Systems, is another excellent tale of caching gone wrong
by Peter Zaitsev, in an exciting twin billing:Cache Miss Stormand More on
dangers of the caches. This is fascinating case where the cause turned out to
be software upgrade that ran long because it had to be rolled back. During the
long recovery time many of the cache entries timed out. When the database came
back, slam, all the clients queried the database to repopulate the cache and
bad things happened to the database. The solution was equally interesting: So
the immediate solution to bring the system up was surprisingly simple. We just
had to get traffic on the system in stages allowing Memcache to be warmed up.
There were no code which would allow to do it on application side so we did it
on MySQL side instead. "SET GLOBAL max_connections=20" to limit number of
connections to MySQL and so let application to err when it tries to put</p><p>5 0.73398769 <a title="367-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-05-Product%3A_Tugela_Cache.html">174 high scalability-2007-12-05-Product: Tugela Cache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tugela Cacheis a cache system like memecached, but instead of storing data
just in RAM, it stores data in the file system using a b-tree. You trade
latency in order to have a very large cache. It's useful for sites that have
caching requirements that exceed their available memory. It uses the same wire
protocol asmemcachedso it can be dropped in without a hassle. From the
website:As large MediaWiki deployments may gain performance using Memcached,
at some level cost of RAM to store all objects becomes too high. In order to
balance resource usage and make more use of our Apache server disks, Tugela,
the distributed cached on-disk hash database, has arrived.Tugela Cache is
derived from Memcached. Much of the code remains the same, but notably, these
changes:Internal slab allocator replaced by BerkeleyDB B-Tree database.Expiry
policy management moved to external program tugela-expireMuch statistics code
made obsolete.An interesting point brought up in the comments is using

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Michael Galpin inCache MoneyandCache Discussionslikes memcached for
it's expiry policy, complex graph data, process data, but says MySQL has many
advantages: SQL, Uniform Data Access, Write-through, Read-through,
Replication, Management, Cold starts, LRU eviction.Update:Dormando asksShould
you use memcached? Should you just shard mysql more?. The idea of caching is
the most important part of caching as it transports you beyond a simple CRUD
worldview. Plan for caching and sharding by properly abstracting data access
methods.Brace for change. Be ready to shard, be ready to cache. React and
change to what you push out which is actually popular, vs over planning and
wasting valuable time.Feedster's Franรงois Schiettecatte wondersifFotolog's 21
memcached serverswouldn't be better used to further shard data by adding more
MySQL servers? He mentions Feedster was able to drop memcached once they
partitioned their data across more servers. The algorithm: partition until all

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeffrey Damick, Principal Software Engineer forNeustar.
Jeffrey has overseen the software architecture forUltraDNSfor last two and
half years as it went through substantial revitalization.UltraDNS is one the
top the DNS providers, serving manytop-level domains (TLDs)as well assecond-
level domains (SLDs). This requires handling of several hundreds of thousands
of zones with many containing millions of records each. Even with all of its
success UltraDNS had fallen into a rut several years ago, its release schedule
had become haphazard at best and the team was struggling to keep up with
feature requests in a waterfall development style.DevelopmentRealizing that
something had to be done the team came together and identified the most
important areas to attack first. We began with the code base, stabilizing our
flagship proprietary C++ DNS server, instituting common best practices and
automation. Testing was very manual and not easily reproducible, so we brought

<p>Introduction: It's been a well kept secret, but you may have heard Facebook will Buy Photo-
Sharing Service Instagram for $1 Billion. Just what is Facebook buying? Here's
a quick gloss I did a little over a year ago on a presentation Instagram gave
on their architecture. In that article I called Instagram's architecture the
"canonical description of an early stage startup in this era." Little did we
know how true that would turn out to be. If you want to learn how they did it
then don't take a picture, just keep on reading...  Instagram is a free photo
sharing and social networking service for your iPhone that has been an instant
success. Growing to14 million usersin just over a year (now 30 million users),
they reached 150 million photos in August while amassing several terabytes of

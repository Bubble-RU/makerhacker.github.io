<p>Introduction: What should the architecture of your scalable, real-time, highly available
service look like? There are as many options as there are developers, but if
you are looking for a general template, this architecture as described by
Prashant Malik, Facebook's lead for theMessagesback end team, in Scaling the
Messages Application Back End, is a very good example to consider. Although
Messages is tasked with handling 135+ billion messages a month, from email,
IM, SMS,  text messages, and Facebook messages, you may think this is an
example of BigArchitecture and doesn't apply to smaller sites. Not so. It's a
good, well thought out example of a non-cloud architecture exhibiting many
qualities any mom would be proud of:Layered- components are independent and
isolated. Service/API Driven- each layer is connected via well defined
interface that is the sole entry point for accessing that service. This
prevents nasty complicated interdependencies. Clients hide behind an
application API.

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>5 0.14920436 <a title="350-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-01-Sponsored_Post%3A_Get_Your_High_Scalability_Fix_at_Digg.html">833 high scalability-2010-06-01-Sponsored Post: Get Your High Scalability Fix at Digg</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When building a system on top of a set of wildly uncooperative and unruly
computers you have knowledge problems: knowing when other nodes are dead;
knowing when nodes become alive; getting information about other nodes so you
can make local decisions, like knowing which node should handle a request
based on a scheme for assigning nodes to a certain range of users; learning
about new configuration data; agreeing on data values; and so on.How do you
solve these problems? A common centralized approach is to use a database and
all nodes query it for information. Obvious availability and performance
issues for large distributed clusters. Another approach is to use Paxos, a
protocol for solving consensus in a network to maintain strict consistency
requirements for small groups of unreliable processes. Not practical when
larger number of nodes are involved.So what's the super cool decentralized way
to bring order to large clusters?Gossip protocols, which maintain relaxed
consistency requireme</p><p>3 0.8142637 <a title="350-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-02-Product%3A_Supervisor_-__Monitor_and_Control_Your_Processes.html">295 high scalability-2008-04-02-Product: Supervisor -  Monitor and Control Your Processes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a sad fact of life, but processes die. I know, it's horrible. You start
them, send them out into process space, and hope for the best. Yet sometimes,
despite your best coding, they core dump, seg fault, or some other calamity
befalls them. Unlike our messy biological world so cruelly ruled by entropy,
in the digital world processes can be given another chance. They can be
restarted. A greater destiny awaits. And hopefully this time the random
lottery of unforeseen killing factors will be avoided and a long productive
life will be had by all.This is fun code to write because it's a lot more
complicated than you might think. And restarting processes is a highly
effective high availability strategy. Most faults are transient, caused by an
unexpected series of events. Rather than taking drastic action, like taking a
node out of production or failing over, transients can be effectively masked
by simply restarting failed processes. Though complexity makes it a fun
problem, it's also why</p><p>4 0.81367582 <a title="350-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-11-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Conditioning_Collection.html">1421 high scalability-2013-03-11-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Conditioning Collection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We talked about 42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase. And inThe
Aggregation Collection we talked about the value of prioritizing work and
making smart queues as a way of absorbing and not reflecting traffic
spikes.Now we move on to our next batch of strategies where the theme
isconditioning, which is the idea of shaping and controlling flows of work
within your application...Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed LimitThis is
probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an
application. What it means:Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you
know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of
objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of
objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion.Devise ways of tying
what you need to do to the individual resources.Some examples:Keep a list of
purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of

simplicity.Two years later traffic has grown 10x. How did WhatsApp make that
jump to the next level of scalability?Rick Reedtells us in a talk he gave at

<p>Introduction: Dryad is Microsoft's answer to Google'smap-reduce. What's the question: How do
you process really large amounts of data? My initial impression of Dryad is
it's like a giant Unix command line filter on steroids. There are lots of
inputs, outputs, tees, queues, and merge sorts all connected together by a
master exec program. What else does Dryad have to offer the scalable
infrastructure wars?Dryad models programs as the execution of a directed
acyclic graph. Each vertex is a program and edges are typed communication
channels (files, TCP pipes, and shared memory channels within a process). Map-
reduce uses a different model. It's more like a large distributed sort where
the programmer defines functions for mapping, partitioning, and reducing. Each
approach seems to borrow from the spirit of its creating organization. The
graph approach seems a bit too complicated and map-reduce seems a bit too
simple. How ironic, in the Alanis Morissette sense.Dryad is a middleware layer

<p>Introduction: ZooKeeperis ahigh available and reliable coordination system. Distributed
applications use ZooKeeper to store and mediate updates key configuration
information. ZooKeeper can be used for leader election, group membership, and
configuration maintenance.In additionZooKeeper can be usedfor event
notification, locking, and as a priority queue mechanism. It's a sort of
central nervous system for distributed systems where the role of the brain is
played by the coordination service, axons are the network, processes are the
monitored and controlled body parts, and events are the hormones and
neurotransmitters used for messaging. Every complex distributed application
needs a coordination and orchestration system of some sort, so the ZooKeeper
folks at Yahoo decide to build a good one and open source it for everyone to
use.The target market for ZooKeeper are multi-host, multi-process C and Java
based systems that operate in a data center. ZooKeeper works using distributed
processes to coordinate</p><p>3 0.95269352 <a title="350-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-31-Pud_is_the_Anti-Stack_-_Windows%2C_CFML%2C_Dropbox%2C_Xeround%2C_JungleDisk%2C_ELB.html">1108 high scalability-2011-08-31-Pud is the Anti-Stack - Windows, CFML, Dropbox, Xeround, JungleDisk, ELB</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pud off*ckedcomany.com (FC) fame, a favorite site of the dot bomb era, and a
site I absolutely loved until my company became featured, has given us a look
at his backend: Why Must You Laugh At My Back End. For those whose don't
remember FC's history, TechCrunch published afitting eulogy:[FC] first went
live in 2000, chronicling failing and troubled companies in its unique and
abrasive style after the dot com bust. Within a year it had a massive audience
and was getting serious mainstream press attention. As the startup economy
became better in 2004, much of the attention the site received went away. But
a large and loyal audience remains at the site, coming back day after day for
its unique slant on the news. At its peak, FC had 4 million unique monthly
visitors.Delightfully, FC was not a real-names kind of site. Hard witty
cynicism ruled and not a single cat picture was in sight. It was a blast of
fun when all around was the enclosing dark.So when I saw Pud's post I was

<p>Introduction: The addingjitterstrategy was one of the most commented on techniques from7
Years Of YouTube Scalability Lessons In 30 MinutesonHackerNews. Probably
because it's one of the emergent phenomena that you really can't predict and
is shocking when you see it in real life. Here's the technique:Add Entropy
Back into Your SystemIf your system doesn't jitter then you getthundering
herds. Distributed applications are really weather systems. Debugging them is
as deterministic as predicting the weather. Jitter introduces more randomness
because surprisingly, things tend to stack up.For example, cache expirations.
For a popular video they cache things as best they can. The most popular video
they might cache for 24 hours. If everything expires at one time then every
machine will calculate the expiration at the same time. This creates a
thundering herd.By jittering you are saying  randomly expire between 18-30
hours. That prevents things from stacking up. They use this all over the
place. Systems hav</p><p>5 0.94391614 <a title="350-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-30-37signals_Still_Happily_Scaling_on_Moore_RAM_and_SSDs.html">1183 high scalability-2012-01-30-37signals Still Happily Scaling on Moore RAM and SSDs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are so many architectural ideas swirling in the bit wind these days. Two
of the biggest battles are cloud vs. bare metal and RAM vs. disk vs. SSD.
37signals has published two solid articles that are counter hype cycle in
their message:Technologists who grew up when RAM cost $1,000 per megabyte can
have a hard time dealing with the luxury of RAM being virtually free.The
progress of technology is throwing an ever greater number of optimizations
into the "premature evil" bucket never to be seen again.37signals made quite a
stir with their money shot of the864GB of RAM they bought for a mere $12Kas
part of their caching layer for Basecamp. That's a lot of memory for not a lot
of money. There's nothing like actually seeing it in the flesh to bring the
point home. Does that makeMemory Based Architecturesa little more
appealing?37signals then followed up with another provocative article:Three

both my favoritebirdand the web's leading photo sharing site. Flickr has an
amazing challenge, they must handle a vast sea of ever expanding new content,
ever increasing legions of users, and a constant stream of new features, all
while providing excellent performance. How do they do it?Site:

<p>Introduction: This is a question asked on theycombinatorlist and there are some good
responses. I gave a quick response, but I particularly like neilk's knock out
of the park insightful answer:Read Cal Henderson's book. (I'd add in Theo's
book and Release It! too)The center of your design should be the data store,
not a process. You transition the data store from state to state, securely and
reliably, in small increments.Avoid globals and session state. The more "pure"
your function is, the easier it will be to cache or partition.Don't make your
data store too smart. Calculations and renderings should happen in a separate,
asynchronous process.The data store should be able to handle lots of
concurrent connections. Minimize locking. (Read about optimistic
locking).Protect your algorithm from the implementation of the data store,
with a helper class or module or whatever. But don't (DO NOT) try to build a
framework for any conceivable query. Just the ones your algorithm
needs.Viewing an application as</p><p>4 0.12220416 <a title="282-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Flickr.html">41 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Flickr</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Flickroffers a free basic account with limited upload bandwidth and limited
storage. Download bandwidth is unlimited. Upgrading to a paid Pro account for
$25/year removes all upload and storage restrictions. Flickr's terms of use
warn that "professional or corporate uses of Flickr are prohibited", and all
external images require a link back to Flickr.</p><p>5 0.12179486 <a title="282-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-19-Serving_JavaScript_Fast.html">285 high scalability-2008-03-19-Serving JavaScript Fast</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cal Hendersonwrites at thinkvitamin.com: "With our so-called "Web 2.0'
applications and their rich content and interaction, we expect our
applications to increasingly make use of CSS and JavaScript. To make sure
these applications are nice and snappy to use, we need to optimize the size
and nature of content required to render the page, making sure we're
delivering the optimum experience. In practice, this means a combination of
making our content as small and fast to download as possible, while avoiding
unnecessarily refetching unmodified resources." A lot of good comments too.</p><p>6 0.097360209 <a title="282-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-09-Federation_at_Flickr%3A_Doing_Billions_of_Queries_Per_Day.html">348 high scalability-2008-07-09-Federation at Flickr: Doing Billions of Queries Per Day</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 3:The book was released! Find it on Amazon atThe Art of Capacity
Planning.Update 2:Maybe the iPhone can use a little capacity planning?What's
Behind the iPhone 3G Glitches:One source says Apple programmed the Infineon
chip to demand a more powerful 3G signal than the iPhone really requires. So
if too many people try to make a call or go on the Internet in a given area,
some of the devices will decide there's insufficient power and switch to the
slower networkâ&euro;&rdquo;even if there is enough 3G bandwidth available.Update:To get a
taste of what will be served,mySQL DBAhas a nice post titledCapacity Planning,
Architecture, Scaling, Response time, Throughput. You learn how to figure out
when your application will break by building a 3rd order polynomial. Cool
stuff!John Allspaw who is the Operations Engineering Manager at Flickr is

<p>Introduction: I am excited about the upcoming release of two books on Web 2.0 and Cloud
Application Architectures by O'Reilly.Web 2.0 Architectures(estimated release
in May 2009)What entrepreneurs and information architects need to knowUsing
several high-profile Web 2.0 companies as examples, authors Duane Nickull,
Dion Hinchcliffe, and James Governor have distilled the core patterns of Web
2.0 coupled with an abstract model and reference architecture. The result is a
base of knowledge that developers, business people, futurists, and
entrepreneurs can understand and use as a source of ideas and inspiration.
Featured architectures include Google, Flickr, BitTorrent, MySpace, Facebook,
and Wikipedia.Cloud Application Architectures(estimated release in April
2009)Building Applications and Infrastructure in the CloudThis book by George

<p>Introduction: The Relational Cloud Project is an effort by a group of researchers at MIT to
investigate technologies and challenges related to Database-as-a-Service
within cloud-computing. They are trying to figure out how the advantages of
the DaaS (Database-as-a-Service) model, that we've seen arise in other areas
like OLAP and NoSQL, can be applied to relational databases. The DaaS
advantages as they see them are: 1) predictable costs, proportional to the
quality of service and actual workloads, 2) lower technical complexity, thanks
to a unified and simplified service access interface, and 3) virtually
infinite resources ready at hand. An interesting description of their approach
is explained in the paper Relational Cloud: A Database-as-a-Service for the
Cloud. From the abstract:This paper introduces a new transactional "database-
as-a-service" (DBaaS) called Relational Cloud. A DBaaS promises to move much
of the operational burden of provisioning, conﬁguration, scaling, performance
tuning, backu</p><p>5 0.53291482 <a title="282-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-24-11_Secrets_of_a_Cloud_Scale_Consultant_That_They_Dont%27_Want_You_to_Know.html">428 high scalability-2008-10-24-11 Secrets of a Cloud Scale Consultant That They Dont' Want You to Know</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK, there is no "they" and "they" wouldn't care if you knew anyway. After all,
this isn't a blog about really important stuff like investing, acne cures, or
cheap natural cleansing products.But the secrets are real. Super cloud scaling

<p>Introduction: If you like the idea of exploiting market inconsistencies to lower your costs
then you will love thispaperand video from the Hot Cloud '12
conference:Exploiting Hardware Heterogeneity within the Same Instance Type of
Amazon EC2.The conclusion is interesting and is a source of good
guidance:Amazon EC2 uses diversified hardware to host the same type of
instance.  The hardware diversity results in performance variation.In general,
the variation between the fast instances and slow  instances can reach 40%. In
some applications, the variation can even approach up to 60%.  By selecting
fast instances within the same instance type,  Amazon EC2 users can acquire up
to 30% of cost saving, if the fast instances have a relatively low
probability.The abstract:Cloud computing providers might start with near-
homogeneous hardware environment. Over time, the homogeneous environment will
most likely evolve into heterogeneous one because of possible upgrades and
replacement of outdated hardware.

<p>Introduction: It's called "east-west" networking, which when compared to its predecessor,
"north-south" networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane winds and
tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation between the
transformative shift this change in networking patterns has on the data center
with that of El Ni単o's transformative power upon the weather patterns across
the globe.Traditionally, data center networks have focused on North-South
network traffic. The assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly
communicate with servers at the core, rather than across the network to other
clients.But server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual
appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical
infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with workloads
moving to different physical locations on the network as virtual servers are
migrated (in the case of data center networks) and clients move about the
building (in the ca</p><p>6 0.40292969 <a title="282-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud.html">40 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: At a Cloud Computing Meetup, Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a
merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:Keeping Movies Running
Amid Thunderstorms. While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the
cloud, issues with capacity planning,thundering herds, latency problems,
andsimian armageddon, I found myself most taken with how they handlesoftware
deployment in the cloud.I've worked on half a dozen or more build and
deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large
organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability
that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant
software deployments:the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to
completely run a new release while running the old release at the same
time.The process goes something like: Acanary machineis launched first with
the new software load running real traffic to sanity test the load in a
production environment.

<p>Introduction: Robert Johnson, a director of engineering at Facebook, celebrated Facebook's
monumental achievement of reaching 500 million users by sharing thescaling
principles that helped reach that milestone. In case you weren't suitably
impressed by the 500 million user number, Robert ratchets up the numbers game
with these impressive figures:1 million users per engineer500 million active

hundreds of millions of requests per second130TB of logs every dayHow did
Facebook get to this point?People Matter Most. It's people who build and run
systems. The best tools for scaling are an engineering and operations teams

<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great
presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: "High Performance at
Massive Scale -  Lessons learned at Facebook". The abstract for the talk
is:Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today
serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes
engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging
proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data
that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core
architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to
address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies
that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web
architectures.There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into
later, but I thought you might want a head start on learning how Facebook

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 1 of an interviewI did for theBoundary
blog.Boundary:What is Facebook's secret sauce for managing what's got to be
the biggest Big Data project, if you will, on the Web?Hoff:From several
presentations we've learned what Facebook insiders likeAditya AgarwalandRobert
Johnson, both former Directors of Engineering, consider their secret
sauce:Scaling Takes Iteration. Solutions often work in the beginning, but
you'll have to modify them as you go. PHP, for example, is simple to use at
first, but is not a good choice when you have tens of thousands of web
servers.Scaling Takes Iteration. You can say that again.Don't Over-Design.
Just use what you need as you scale your system out. Figure out where you need
to iterate on a solution, optimize something, or completely build a part of
the stack yourself.Choose the Right Tool for the Job. Realize that any choice
comes with overhead. If you really need to use Python then go ahead and, we'll

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble wrote a fascinating case study,MySpace's death spiral: insiders
say it's due to bets on Los Angeles and Microsoft, where he reports MySpace
insiders blame the Microsoft stack on why theylost the great social network
raceto Facebook.  Does anyone know if this is true? What's the real story?I
was wondering because it doesn't seem to track with theMySpace Architecture
post that I did in 2009, where they seem happy with their choices and had
stats to back up their improvements. Why this matters is it's a fascinating
model for startups to learn from. What does it really take to succeed? Is it
the people or the stack? Is it the organization or the technology? Is it the
process or the competition? Is the quality of the site or the love of the
users? So much to consider and learn from.Some conjectures from the

Communications,author of numerous webinarsandadvanced networking books, and
aprolific blogger. He's focusing on data center and cloud networking, network
virtualization, and scalable application design.OpenFlow is an interesting
emerging networking technology appearingseemingly out of nowhere with much
hype and fanfarein March 2011. More than a year later, there are two
commercial products based on OpenFlow (NEC's Programmable FlowandNicira's
Network Virtualization Platform) and probably less than a dozen production-
grade implementations (includingGoogle's G-Scale networkandIndiana
University's campus network). Is this an expected result for an emerging
technology or another case of overhyped technology hitting limits imposed by
reality?OpenFlow-based solutions have to overcome numerous problems every

<p>Introduction: Kim Nash in aninterview with Jonathan Heiliger, Facebook VP of technical
operations, provides some juicy details on how Facebook handles operations.
Operations is one of those departments everyone runs differently as it is
usually anontogeny recapitulates phylogenysituation. With 2,000 databases, 25
terabytes of cache, 90 million active users, and 10,000 servers you know
Facebook has some serious operational issues. What are some of Facebook's
secrets to better operations?Frequent Releases. A major release once a week
and a minor releases every few days.Create a Cyber Liability Group. At one
time operations was distributed amongst several groups. A permanent operations
group was created to isolate problems and revert problem software components
back to previously known good states. The ability of a separate team to handle
rollbacks speaks to a great deal of standardization and advanced tool
building.Distribute Team Across Time Zones. Split the operations team across
different time zone</p><p>3 0.92789233 <a title="378-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-02-Product%3A_Supervisor_-__Monitor_and_Control_Your_Processes.html">295 high scalability-2008-04-02-Product: Supervisor -  Monitor and Control Your Processes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a sad fact of life, but processes die. I know, it's horrible. You start
them, send them out into process space, and hope for the best. Yet sometimes,
despite your best coding, they core dump, seg fault, or some other calamity
befalls them. Unlike our messy biological world so cruelly ruled by entropy,
in the digital world processes can be given another chance. They can be
restarted. A greater destiny awaits. And hopefully this time the random
lottery of unforeseen killing factors will be avoided and a long productive
life will be had by all.This is fun code to write because it's a lot more
complicated than you might think. And restarting processes is a highly
effective high availability strategy. Most faults are transient, caused by an
unexpected series of events. Rather than taking drastic action, like taking a
node out of production or failing over, transients can be effectively masked
by simply restarting failed processes. Though complexity makes it a fun
problem, it's also why</p><p>4 0.91954547 <a title="378-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-28-Pursue_robust_indefinite_scalability_with_the_Movable_Feast_Machine.html">1127 high scalability-2011-09-28-Pursue robust indefinite scalability with the Movable Feast Machine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and
Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper: Pursue robust
indefinite scalability, wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural
networks, starting from scratch.What is this strange thing calledindefinite
scalability? They sound like words that don't really go together:Indefinite
scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended
computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense
as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network
designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable
because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-
core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of
numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-
engineered.Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to
programmers using rei</p><p>5 0.91628689 <a title="378-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-07-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_December_7%2C_2012.html">1368 high scalability-2012-12-07-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For December 7, 2012</a></p>

Gaga wants to cut them all out of the action too. Reap and sow. Reap and sow.

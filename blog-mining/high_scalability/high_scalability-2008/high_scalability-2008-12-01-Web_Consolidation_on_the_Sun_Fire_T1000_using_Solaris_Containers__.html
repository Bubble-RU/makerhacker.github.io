<p>Introduction: Much of the focus of high performance computing (HPC) has centered on CPU
performance. However, as computing requirements grow, HPC clusters are
demanding higher rates of aggregate data throughput. Today's clusters feature
larger numbers of nodes with increased compute speeds. The higher clock rates
and operations per clock cycle create increased demand for local data on each
node. In addition, InfiniBand and other high-speed, low-latency interconnects
increase the data throughput available to each node.Traditional shared file
systems such as NFS have not been able to scale to meet this growing demand
for data throughput on HPC clusters. Scalable cluster file systems that can
provide parallel data access to hundreds of nodes and petabytes of storage are
needed to provide the high data throughput required by large HPC applications,
including manufacturing, electronic design, and research.This paper describes
an implementation of the Sun Lustre file system as a scalable storage cluster

<p>Introduction: Sun FireTM X4540 Server as Backup Server for Zmanda's Amanda Enterprise 2.6
Softwareby Thomas Hanvey (Sun Microsystems) and Dmitri Joukovski and Ken
Crandall (Zmanda)September, 2008Explosive data growth, combined with demanding
requirements for data availability, has placed a tremendous burden on IT
operations staff at businesses of all sizes. Yet, many organizations do not
have the staff or budget to purchase and manage complex and expensive backup
and recovery software products.The Sun FireTM X4540 server can deliver massive
storage capacity and remarkable throughput so it is well-suited as a nearline
storage platform for backup and restore applications. Combining the power of
the SolarisTM 10 Operating System with the data integrity and simplified
administration of ZFS, the Sun Fire X4540 server can be an ideal candidate for
streamlining and improving backup and restore operations.Amanda Enterprise

<p>Introduction: From their website:FAIis an automated installation tool to install or deploy
Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a
Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat,
autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used
for configuration management of a running system.You can take one or more
virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction
necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your
computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized
management system for your Linux deployment.breakFAI's target group are system
administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of
computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general
purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a
rendering farm, a web server</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89700651 <a title="458-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Web_Consolidation_on_the_Sun_Fire_T1000_using_Solaris_Containers__.html">458 high scalability-2008-12-01-Web Consolidation on the Sun Fire T1000 using Solaris Containers  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Reducing the costs of IT infrastructure and improving the manageability and
efficiency of web services pose significant challenges for many organizations
in today's economic climate. Recent studies describe the challenges IT
managers face administering the proliferation of x86-based servers used to run
web services applications. Those reports reveal that using large number of
x86-based systems can increase space and power consumption, as well as cost
and asset management overhead. In addition, many of these x86-based systems
run a mixture of operating system and application software leading to
increased management complexity and potential security concerns.Faced with
these challenges, many organizations are attracted by the idea of
consolidating web and application services from multiple x86-based servers to
a smaller number of high-performance servers. This approach strives to help
simplify management, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of
delivering web services. The co</p><p>3 0.895037 <a title="458-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-03-5_Steps_to_Benchmarking_Managed_NoSQL_-_DynamoDB_vs_Cassandra.html">1434 high scalability-2013-04-03-5 Steps to Benchmarking Managed NoSQL - DynamoDB vs Cassandra</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBen BromheadfromInstaclustrDeciding to use a managed
NoSQL datastore is a great step in ensuring you run a fast, scalable and
resilient application without needing to be an expert in highly available
architecture. How do you know which technology is the best for your
application? How do you know whether the provider's performance claims are
true? You are putting your application on someone else’s infrastructure and
that requires some hard answers about their claims.To determine the
suitability of a provider, your first port of call is to benchmark. Choosing a
service provider is often done in a number of stages. First is to shortlist
providers based on capabilities and claimed performance, ruling out those that
do not meet your application requirements. Second is to look for benchmarks
conducted by third parties, if any. The final stage is to benchmark the
service yourself.In this article we will show you how to run some preliminary
benchmarks against two managed</p><p>4 0.87767386 <a title="458-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-07-Sun_Acquires_Q-layer_in_Cloud_Computing_Play.html">486 high scalability-2009-01-07-Sun Acquires Q-layer in Cloud Computing Play</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pud off*ckedcomany.com (FC) fame, a favorite site of the dot bomb era, and a
site I absolutely loved until my company became featured, has given us a look
at his backend: Why Must You Laugh At My Back End. For those whose don't
remember FC's history, TechCrunch published afitting eulogy:[FC] first went
live in 2000, chronicling failing and troubled companies in its unique and
abrasive style after the dot com bust. Within a year it had a massive audience
and was getting serious mainstream press attention. As the startup economy
became better in 2004, much of the attention the site received went away. But
a large and loyal audience remains at the site, coming back day after day for
its unique slant on the news. At its peak, FC had 4 million unique monthly
visitors.Delightfully, FC was not a real-names kind of site. Hard witty
cynicism ruled and not a single cat picture was in sight. It was a blast of
fun when all around was the enclosing dark.So when I saw Pud's post I was

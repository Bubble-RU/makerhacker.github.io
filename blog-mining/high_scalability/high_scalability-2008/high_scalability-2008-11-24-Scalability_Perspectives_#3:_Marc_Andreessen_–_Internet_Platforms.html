<p>Introduction: One of the premier scaling strategies is always: get someone else to do the
work for you. But unlike Huckleberry Finn inTom Sawyer, you won't have to
trick anyone into whitewashing a fence for you. Times have changed. Companies
likeNing,Facebook, andSalesforceare more than happy to help. Their price:
lock-in.Previously you had few options when building a "real" website. You
needed to do everything yourself. Infrastructure and application were all
yours. Then companies stepped in by commoditizing parts of the infrastructure,
but the application was still yours. The next step is full on Borg take no
prisoners assimilation where the infrastructure and application are built as
one collective. What you have to decide as someone faced with building a
scalable website is if these new options are worth the price.Feeding this
explosion of choice is one of the new strategy games on the intertubes: the
Internet Platform Game. Ning's Marc Andreessen defines aplatformas:a system

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade

already begun, that has accelerated by the need for applications to scale and
increase complexity, the end result of which will be that applications give up
their independence and enter a kind offeudal relationshipwith their platform
provider.To understand how this process works, like a glacier slowly and
inevitably carving out a deep river valley, here's the type of question I get
quite a lot:I've learned PHP and MySQL and I've built a web app that I HOPE
will receive traffic comparable to eBay's with a similar database structure. I
see all these different opinions and different techniques and languages being
recommended and it's so confusing. All I want is perhaps one book or one

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

<p>Introduction: "I'll never need to scale so why bother? We aren't Twitter or Facebook or
Google after all." This is the most common email I get, a question in the form
of a thinly disguised rationalization for not having to worry about scaling.
And in these days of giant transformer-like machines they are probably right.
But what if there areBarry Bonds enhancing type forces at work that argue for
the chances of your needing to scale being higher than you think?And if that
happens, how will you cross the scalability chasm? Will you want to completely
change your architecture or evolve it from a tool-chain that was meant to
scale from the start? Architecturally, that's the question you have to answer.
Today's tool-chains are making it possible to grow a system from small to
large without needing to implement complete architectural phase changes at
various scale inflection points, but that's a different topic. We're trying to
think about why you may actually need to scale, that is the question.Tumblr i</p><p>6 0.61644709 <a title="450-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-05-10_Golden_Principles_For_Building_Successful_Mobile-Web_Applications.html">1277 high scalability-2012-07-05-10 Golden Principles For Building Successful Mobile-Web Applications</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure...On the new yearTwitter set a recordwith
6,939 Tweets Per Second (TPS). Cool video visualizing New Year's Eve Tweet
data across the world. Marko Rodriguez in Memoirs of a Graph Addict: Despair
to Redemption tells a stirring tale of how graph programming saved the world
from certain destruction by realizing Aritstotle's dream of an eudaimonia-
driven society. Could a relational database do that? The tools of the
revolution can be found at tinkerprop.com, which describes a databases
agnostic stack for working with property graphs, they include Blueprints - a
property graph model interface; Pipes - a dataflow netowork using process
grapphs; Gremlin - a graph based programming language; Rexster - a RESTful
graph shell.The never never ending battle of good versus evil has nothing on
programmers arguing about bracket policies or sync vs async programming
models. In this node.js thread, I love async, but I can't code like this, the
battle continues.

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though - the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Marc AndreessenMarc Andreessen is known as an internet pioneer,
entrepreneur, investor, startup coach, blogger, and a multi-millionaire
software engineer best known as co-author of Mosaic, the first widely-used web
browser, and founder of Netscape Communications Corporation. He was the chair
of Opsware, a software company he founded originally as Loudcloud, when it was
acquired by Hewlett-Packard. He is also a co-founder of Ning, a company which
provides a platform for social-networking websites. He has recently joined the
Board of Directors of Facebook and eBay.Marc is an investor in several
startups including Digg, Metaplace, Plazes, Qik, and Twitter. His passion is

Scalaculation?twines several different threads on the topic together into a
fine noose.Update 2: Kevin says thebiggest problems he sees with startups is
they need to scaletheir backend (no, the other one).Update: My bad.It's hard
to sell scalabilityso just forget it.The premise ofStartups and The Problem Of
Premature ScalaculationandDonâ&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Martis that
you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before
you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful
enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied
life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites
siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its
best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?If I ever believed this I
certainly don't believe it anymore. The world has changed, even since
2005.Thanks to many books a</p><p>4 0.92966425 <a title="450-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-27-OpenStack_-_The_Answer_to%3A_How_do_We_Compete_with_Amazon%3F.html">888 high scalability-2010-08-27-OpenStack - The Answer to: How do We Compete with Amazon?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a meetup Wednesday onOpenStack,
whose tag line isthe open source, open standards cloud. I was shocked at the
large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of
them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free
t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are
really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud
doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from
Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems
to be. The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:OpenStack allows any organization
to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software
running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically
creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack
Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage using
clusters o</p><p>5 0.92604387 <a title="450-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-21-What_CDN_would_you_recommend%3F.html">576 high scalability-2009-04-21-What CDN would you recommend?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 10:The Value of CDNsby Mike Axelrod of Google. Google implements a
distributed content cache from withinlarge ISPs. This allows them to serve
content from the edge of the network and save bandwidth on the ISPs
backbone.Update 9:Just Jump: Start using Clouds and CDNs. Bob Buffone gives a
really nice and practical tutorial of how to use CloudFront as your
CDN.breakUpdate 8:Akamai’s Services Become Affordable for Anyone! Blazing Web
Site Performance by Distribution Cloud.Distribution Cloud starts at $150 per
month for access to the best content distribution network in the world and the
leader of Content Distribution Networks.Update 7:Where Amazon’s Data Centers
Are Located,Expanding the Cloud: Amazon CloudFront.Why Amazon's CDN Offering
Is No Threat To Akamai, Limelight or CDN Pricing. Amazon has launched their
CDN with "“low latency, high data transfer speeds, and no commitments.” The

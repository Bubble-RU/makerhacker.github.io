<p>Introduction: Many people in the Apache Hadoop community have asked Yahoo! to publish the version of Apache Hadoop they test and deploy across their large Hadoop clusters. As a service to the Hadoop community, Yahoo is releasing the Yahoo! Distribution of Hadoop -- a source code distribution that is based entirely on code found in the Apache Hadoop project.   This source distribution includes code patches that they have added to improve the stability and performance of their clusters.

Update 4:   Introduction to Pig . Pig allows you to skip programming Hadoop at the low map-reduce level. You don't have to know Java. Using the Pig Latin language, which is a scripting data flow language, you can think about your problem as a data flow program. 10 lines of Pig Latin = 200 lines of Java.

<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job on your Hadoop cluster. You will  not  need to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other platforms running bash and Java.
  

  

 Fire-Up Your Hadoop Cluster 

I choose the  Cloudera distribution of Hadoop  which is still 100% Apache licensed, but has some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released by  Doug Cutting , who started Hadoop and drove itâ€™s development at Yahoo! He also started  Lucene , which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see, is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo has developed a new language called Pig Latin that fit in a sweet spot between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level, procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.  The accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined Hadoop as a subproject.  The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo! are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and execution of their data analysis tasks, compared to using Hadoop directly.

<p>Introduction: At Monday's  Cloud Computing Meetup ,  Paco Nathan  gave an excellent   Getting Started on Hadoop   talk ( slides ). I found one of Paco's strategies particularly interesting: consider when a service starts charging in cost calculations. Depending on your use case it may be cheaper to go with a more expensive service that charges only for work accomplished rather than charging for both work + startup time.
 
The example is comparing the cost of running Hadoop on AWS yourself versus using Amazon's prepackaged Hadoop service,  Elastic MapReduce  (EMR). The thought may have gone through your mind as it did mine that it doesn't necessarily make sense to use Amazon's Hadoop service. Why pay a premium for EMR when Hadoop will run directly on AWS?
 
One reason is that Amazon has made significant changes to Hadoop to make it run more efficiently and easily on AWS. The other more surprising reason is cost.

<p>Introduction: For some Friday Fun nerd style, I thought this  demonstration from Basho  on the difference between single master, sharding, and consistent smashing was really clever. I love the use of safety glasses! And it's harder to crash a server with a hammer than you might think...

<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a firm schema.  I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding.  The data is essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song.  This lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together.  This will be in a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by artist album or song.  By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by.  The problem is that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it?  Should I go with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table?  Perhaps it might</p><p>4 0.80663538 <a title="397-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-20-what_is_j2ee_stack.html">162 high scalability-2007-11-20-what is j2ee stack</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Has a Java only Hadoop been getting you down? Now you can be  Happy . Happy is a  framework for writing map-reduce programs for Hadoop using Jython. It files off the sharp edges on Hadoop and makes writing map-reduce programs a breeze . There's really no history yet on Happy, but I'm delighted at the idea of being able to map-reduce in  other languages . The more ways the better.  From the website:
   Happy is a framework that allows Hadoop jobs to be written and run in Python 2.2 using Jython. It is an  easy way to write map-reduce programs for Hadoop, and includes some new useful features as well.  The current release supports Hadoop 0.17.2.  Map-reduce jobs in Happy are defined by sub-classing happy.HappyJob and implementing a  map(records, task) and reduce(key, values, task) function. Then you create an instance of the  class, set the job parameters (such as inputs and outputs) and call run().  When you call run(), Happy serializes your job instance and copies it and all accompanyi</p><p>6 0.78598446 <a title="397-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-17-Scaling_Spam_Eradication_Using_Purposeful_Games%3A_Die_Spammer_Die%21.html">422 high scalability-2008-10-17-Scaling Spam Eradication Using Purposeful Games: Die Spammer Die!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The first meeting of this Online Gaming High Scalability SIG will be on the 9th of July 2009 in central London, starting at 10 AM and finishing around 5PM.  The main topic of this meeting will be potentials for using cloud and grid technologies in online gaming systems. In addition to experience reports from the community, we have invited some of the leading cloud experts in the UK to discuss the benefits such as resource elasticity and challenges such as storage and security that companies from other industries have experienced. We will have a track for IT managers focused on business opportunities and issues and a track for architects and developers more focused on implementation issues.  The event is free but up-front registration is required for capacity planning, so please let us know in advance, if you are planning to attend by completing the registration form on this page  To propose a talk or for programme enquiries, contact meetings [at] gamingscalability [dot] org.

<p>Introduction: Hi,     Every application server has its own session management implementations for supporting high scalability. But an application architect/developer has to design and implement the application to make the best use of it.     What are the guiding principles and pattern for session state management?     Websphere System management red book mentions that "Session management performance is optimum when session data per user is around 2Kb. It degrades if session data is more than that".     I have following questions.   1. How do you measure session data per user?   2. It is generally recommended that you should keep all the session state in database and keep only the keys in HttpSession object. Then everytime a web request is processed, session data is fetched from the database. This way all the data remains in memory only till the request is processed and actual data in HttpSession is very less. (Only few keys).   What is the general practice?   At what point you should be switching fr</p><p>5 0.12045105 <a title="388-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-13-CloudCamp_London_2%3A_private_clouds_and_standardisation.html">441 high scalability-2008-11-13-CloudCamp London 2: private clouds and standardisation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The GigaOM Network today announces its second Structure conference after the runaway success of the 2008 event. The Structure 09 conference returns to San Francisco, Calif., on June 25th, 2009.     Structure 09 (http://structureconf.com) is a conference designed to explore the next generations of Internet infrastructure. Over a year ago, The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik saw that the platforms on which we have done business for over a decade were starting to provide diminishing returns, and smart money was seeking new options.  Structure 09 looks at the changing needs and rapid growth in the Internet infrastructure sector, and this year's event will consider the impact of the global economy. "I cannot remember a time when a new technology had so much relevance to our industry as cloud computing does in the current economic climate," said The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik. "We all need to find ways to leverage what we have and cut costs without compromising future options.

<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model, which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model, networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sunâ&euro;&trade;s VeriScale architecture provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures for more than a decade.

<p>Introduction: CloudCamp   is an interesting unconference where early adapters of Cloud Computing technologies exchange ideas. With the rapid change occurring in the industry, we need a place we can meet to share our experiences, challenges and solutions. At CloudCamp, you are encouraged you to share your thoughts in several open discussions, as we strive for the advancement of Cloud Computing. End users, IT professionals and vendors are all encouraged to participate.      CloudCamp Silicon Valley 08   is scheduled for Tuesday, September 30, 2008 from 06:00 PM - 10:00 PM in Sun Microsystems' EBC Briefing Center   15 Network Circle   Menlo Park, CA 94025     CloudCamp follows an interactive, unscripted unconference format. You can propose your own session or you can attend a session proposed by someone else. Either way, you are encouraged to engage in the discussion and “Vote with your feet”, which means … “find another session if you don’t find the session helpful”.

<p>Introduction: Adrian Singer has boiled down 7 years of experience to a set of 10 very useful tips on how to best  optimize NGINX and PHP-fpm for high traffic sites :
  
  Switch from TCP to UNIX domain sockets . When communicating to processes on the same machine UNIX sockets have better performance the TCP because there's less copying and fewer context switches. 
  Adjust Worker Processes . Set the worker_processes in your nginx.conf file to the number of cores your machine has and  increase the number of worker_connections. 
  Setup upstream load balancing . Multiple upstream backends on the same machine produce higher throughout than a single one. 
  Disable access log files . Log files on high traffic sites involve a lot of I/O that has to be synchronized across all threads. Can have a big impact. 
  Enable GZip .  
  Cache information about frequently accessed files .  
  Adjust client timeouts . 
  Adjust output buffers . 
  /etc/sysctl.conf tuning . 
  Monitor . Continually monitor the number</p><p>4 0.65402716 <a title="388-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-20-Netflix%3A_Harden_Systems_Using_a_Barrel_of_Problem_Causing_Monkeys_-_Latency%2C_Conformity%2C_Doctor%2C_Janitor%2C_Security%2C_Internationalization%2C_Chaos.html">1083 high scalability-2011-07-20-Netflix: Harden Systems Using a Barrel of Problem Causing Monkeys - Latency, Conformity, Doctor, Janitor, Security, Internationalization, Chaos</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously how Netflix used  Chaos Monkey , a tool to test failover handling by continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this approach in this very interesting post:  The Netflix Simian Army .
 
I know what you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down lately.  Dmuino addressed  this potential embarrassment, putting all fears of cloud inferiority to rest:
  

Unfortunately we're not running 100% on the cloud today. We're working on it, and we could use more help. The latest outage was caused by a com</p><p>5 0.63900739 <a title="388-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons_Learned_at_208K%3A_Towards_Debugging_Millions_of_Cores.html">484 high scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons Learned at 208K: Towards Debugging Millions of Cores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we debug and profile a cloud full of processors and threads? It's a problem more will be seeing as we code big scary programs that run on even bigger scarier clouds. Logging gets you far, but sometimes finding the root cause of problem requires delving deep into a program's execution. I don't know about you, but setting up 200,000+ gdb instances doesn't sound all that appealing. Tools like STAT (Stack Trace Analysis Tool) are being developed to help with this huge task. STAT "gathers and merges stack traces from a parallel applicationâ&euro;&trade;s processes." So STAT isn't a low level debugger, but it will help you find the needle in a million haystacks.  Abstract:
  Petascale systems will present several new challenges to performance and correctness tools. Such machines may contain millions of cores, requiring that tools use scalable data structures and analysis algorithms to collect and to process application data. In addition, at such scales, each tool itself will become a large paralle</p><p>6 0.63088042 <a title="388-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-01-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_1%2C_2011.html">1071 high scalability-2011-07-01-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 1, 2011</a></p>

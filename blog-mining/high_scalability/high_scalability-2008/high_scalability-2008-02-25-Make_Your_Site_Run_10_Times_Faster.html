<p>Introduction: Hi,First of all I want to to say that this is an extremely interesting and
informative website. i have enjoyed reading the various posts on how the big
sites scale to meet the needs of their customers.The service we are developing
is a webcam service. The client application sends images to the server via
HTTP POST and they are saved in folder specified by the users id. When a new
image is sent to the server it will overwrite the current image.Users can then
view the images via our web server.Ideally we want the images to upload as
quickly as possible and allow users to view them as quickly as possible.Would
I be correct to assume that when the number of uploading clients exceeds the
capability of the server the only way to scale is to add more hardware.Also I
assume that to use HTTP accelerator caches will not speed up viewing the
images as the new images will invalidate the cache.I appreciate any input on
the subject.</p><p>5 0.13448043 <a title="261-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish_Architecture.html">638 high scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 5:PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews And 32 Billion Images A
MonthUpdate 4:Jeff Atwoodcosts out Markus' scale up approach against a scale
out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as
interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his
software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive
scale up works better for his needs.Update 3:POF now has 200 million imagesand
serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS
RamSan to handle the load. Also upgraded to a core database machine with 512
GB of RAM, 32 CPU's, SQLServer 2008 and Windows 2008.Update 2: This seems to
be aPOF Peer1 love fest infomercial. It's pretty content free, but the
production values are high. Lots of quirky sounds and fish swimming on the
screen.Update: by Facebook standards Read/WriteWeb says POF is worth a coolone

<p>Introduction: Shanti Braforddetails how his Ruby on Railsbased website survived a 24 hour
550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup
details, so there's not much I can add.Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web
server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR,
nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved
performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of
the performance boost.Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a
very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>4 0.73373538 <a title="261-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-03-5_Rockin%27_Tips_for_Scaling_PHP_to_30%2C000_Concurrent_Users_Per_Server.html">1486 high scalability-2013-07-03-5 Rockin' Tips for Scaling PHP to 30,000 Concurrent Users Per Server</a></p>

that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: Use PHP's APC feature.
APC is opcode cache that is "really a requirement in order for a website to
have a chance at performing well."Put everything that's not a .php request on
a CDN. Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on
S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused
them to serve directly from S3.Don't make connections to other servers in your
PHP code. Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down
processing. Use the APC key/value store for data storage and Varnish for

<p>Introduction: Matthew Might, as a first responder to a surprisetraffic surgeon his
inexpensive linode hosted blog, took emergency steps that you might find
useful in a similar situation:Find the bottleneck. Reloading the page in
firebug showed the first page took 24 seconds to load and after that
everything else loaded quickly. In retrospect this burst meant the site was
thread limited as the CPU was idle.Cut image sizes in halfwith a shell script
using ImageMagick's convert. Load time is now 12 seconds.Turn dynamic content
into static content using a static index.html file  copied using the browser's
"view source" feature. Load time is now 6 seconds.Added threadsto the Apache
configuration file. Load time is now 2 seconds. Crises averted.Because of this
quick thinking and quick action the patient survived to serve pages another
day.And in fine post-mortem tradition some of the future changes are: Run a
cron job to trigger an earlier alert. Email when requests exceed a per second

<p>Introduction: I just heard about some web sites where Velocity templates are used to render
HTML instead of using JSPs and all the processing in performed in servlets.
Can JSPs cause issue with scalability?Thanks,Unmesh</p><p>2 0.94982904 <a title="261-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-16-Paper%3A_An_Experimental_Investigation_of_the_Akamai_Adaptive_Video_Streaming.html">991 high scalability-2011-02-16-Paper: An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading
retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent
applications. Furthermore, over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are
more likely to make a purchase after "liking" a brand they find online.

they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex
relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:the architectural
considerations behind their solutionwhy they chose memory over diskhow they
partitioned the data to gain scalabilitywhy they chose to execute code with
the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution frameworkhow they integrated
with Facebookwhy they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>5 0.88503081 <a title="261-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Book%3A_High_Performance_MySQL.html">16 high scalability-2007-07-16-Book: High Performance MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues
of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well
documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an
insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has
managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!,
maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at
conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing
major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of
their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High
Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in
depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn
practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information
that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life
environments. And you</p><p>same-blog 6 0.86987084 <a title="261-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-25-Make_Your_Site_Run_10_Times_Faster.html">261 high scalability-2008-02-25-Make Your Site Run 10 Times Faster</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Skypeuses PostgreSQL as their backend database. PostgreSQL doesn't get enough
run in the database world so I was excited to see how PostgreSQL is used "as
the main DB for most of [Skype's] business needs." Their approach is to use a
traditional stored procedure interface for accessing data and on top of that
layer proxy servers which hash SQL requests to a set of database servers that
actually carry out queries. The result is a horizontally partitioned system
that they think will scale to handle 1 billion users.Skype's goal is an
architecture that can handle 1 billion plus users. This level of scale isn't
practically solvable with one really big computer, so our masked superhero
horizontal scaling comes to the rescue.Hardware is dual or quad Opterons with
SCSI RAID.Followed common database progression: Start with one DB. Add new
databases partitioned by functionality. Replicate read-mostly data for better
read access. Then horizontally partition data across multiple nodes..In a

<p>Introduction: InScaling writes in MySQL (slides) Philip Tellis, while working for Yahoo,
describes how using time based partitions they were able to increase their
write capability from 2100 inserts per second (7 million a day) to a sustained
8500 inserts per second (734 million a day). This was capacity enough to
handle the load during Michael Jackson's memorial service. In summary, the
secrets to scalable writes are:Bulk inserts push up insert ratePartitioning
lets you insert more recordsPartition based on incoming data for fast
insertsPartitioning is a standard approach for handling high write loads
because it means data can be written to different hard disks in parallel. In
this example Phillip created a separate table for each day with each table
having it's own database file. Each table is partitioned on time, 12
partitions per day, 2 hours of data per partition. Huge log streams are often
handled this way. Other advantages of this approach: 1) fast drop table
operations 2) space for dropped t</p><p>4 0.15533595 <a title="315-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Sun%27s_High-Performance_and_Reliable_Web_Proxy_Solution.html">456 high scalability-2008-12-01-Sun's High-Performance and Reliable Web Proxy Solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage
of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with
CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable
solution that</p><p>5 0.15191098 <a title="315-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling_Pinterest_-_From_0_to_10s_of_Billions_of_Page_Views_a_Month_in_Two_Years.html">1440 high scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling Pinterest - From 0 to 10s of Billions of Page Views a Month in Two Years</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>6 0.14973879 <a title="315-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-10-mixi.jp__Architecture.html">5 high scalability-2007-07-10-mixi.jp  Architecture</a></p>

details about how DbShards works on the inside.The dbShards architecture is a

of dbShards is shown here:The above diagram shows how dbShards works for
achieving massive database scalability across multiple database servers, using
native DBMS engines and our dbShards components. The important components
are:dbS/Client: A design goal of dbShards is to make database sharding as
seamless as possible to an application, so that application developers can
write the same type of code they always have. A key component to making this
possible is the dbShards Client. The dbShards Client is our intelligent driver
that is an exact API emulation of a given vendor's database driver. For

database system hit its limits. Especially on the Internet, where you have
millions of users which theoretically access your database simultaneously,
eventually your IO system will be a bottleneck. [A] promising but more complex
solution with nearly no scale-out limits is application partitioning. If and

<p>Introduction: It is widely recognized that MySQL is the most popular database software in
the world. Since its inception in 1995, there have been 11 million product
installations around the world in a wide variety of markets. There are more
installations of MySQL in use today than any other database architecture. From
startup companies hoping to be the next Web2.0 poster child to large global
enterprises, the MySQL database architecture has proven to be flexible,
extendable, scalable, and more than capable of filling high-capacity database
roles in very different venues.</p><p>6 0.72469491 <a title="315-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-23-Product%3A_dbShards_-_Share_Nothing._Shard_Everything..html">847 high scalability-2010-06-23-Product: dbShards - Share Nothing. Shard Everything.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy thatthe best method to analyse spam is to become a
spammer, this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely
researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part
Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that
their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they
figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales
they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.Two different spam campaigns were
run on aStormbotnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-
peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide
computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit
new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to
download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the
executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon. The
downloaded compone</p><p>2 0.90529305 <a title="315-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-30-Paper%3A_GargantuanComputing%E2%80%94GRIDs_and_P2P.html">374 high scalability-2008-08-30-Paper: GargantuanComputing—GRIDs and P2P</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found the discussion of the available bandwidth of tree vs higher
dimensional virtual networks topologies quite, to quote Spock,fascinating:A
mathematical analysis by Ritter (2002) (one of the original developersof
Napster) presented a detailed numerical argument demonstrating that
theGnutella network could not scale to the capacity of its competitor,
theNapster network. Essentially, that model showed that the Gnutella network
isseverely bandwidth-limited long before the P2P population reaches a
millionpeers. In each of these previous studies, the conclusions have
overlooked theintrinsic bandwidth limits of the underlying topology in the
Gnutella network:a Cayley tree (Rains and Sloane 1999) (see Sect. 9.4 for the
definition).Trees are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher
dimensionaltopologies, e.g., hypercubes and hypertori. Studies of
interconnectiontopologies in the literature have tended to focus on hardware
implementations(see, e.g., Culler et al. 1996; Buyya 1999</p><p>3 0.90196961 <a title="315-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-23-Working_With_Large_Data_Sets.html">907 high scalability-2010-09-23-Working With Large Data Sets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my blogpostWorking With Large Data Sets...For the past
18 months I've moved from working on the SMTP proxy to working on our other
systems, all of which make use of the data we collect from each connection.
It's a fair amount of data and it can be up to 2Kb in size for each
connection. Our servers receive approximately 1000 of these pieces of data per
second, which is fairly sustained due to our global distribution of customers.
If you compare that toTwitter's peak of 3,283 tweets per second (maximum of
140 characters), you can see it's not a small amount of data that we are
dealing with here.I recently set out to scientifically prove the benefits of
throttling, which is our technology for slowing down connections in order to
detect spambots, who are kind enough to disconnect quite quickly when they see
a slow connection. Due to the nature of the data we had, I needed to work with
a long range of data to show evidence that an IP that appeared on Spamhaus had

<p>Introduction: A merry HighScalability to all and to all a good night:Santa: 3.7 million
appointments; iPad2 == 1986 Cray 2 6 processor super computer; Watson: 200
million pagesof natural language content Funny: a cautionary tale about
storage and backup. Where is my data? I'm kinda big deal after all! I should
have listened to my postdoc, he can build cheaper storage than you can.Nothing
stirs up more energy than when someone says they are abandoning and old
beloved framework for a newer sexier model. Feelings of betrayal and
abandonment leak over everything, which is always a good draw for reality
social networking. Here Paul Querna tells why The Switch: Python to Node.js.
And here we see the response onHacker News. Python got the job done for
cloudkick, they were acquired, but they wanted something more going forward, a
trophy wife if you will, after the first wife put them through law school.
Good discussion all around. You may find something that helps in your own
platform decision. Or you just</p><p>5 0.89464295 <a title="315-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-29-Gone_Fishin%27_Two.html">1350 high scalability-2012-10-29-Gone Fishin' Two</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Well, not exactly Fishin', I'll be on vacation starting today and I'll be back
late November. I won't be posting anything new, so we'll all have a break.
Disappointing, I know, but fear not, I will be posting some oldies for your
re-enjoyment.And If you've ever wanted to write an article for
HighScalability, this would be a great time :-) I especially need help on
writingStuff the Internet Says on Scalabilityas I will be reading the
Interwebs on a much reduced schedule. Shock! Horror! So if the spirit moves
you, please write something.My connectivity in Italy will probably be good, so
I will check in and approve articles on a regular basis.

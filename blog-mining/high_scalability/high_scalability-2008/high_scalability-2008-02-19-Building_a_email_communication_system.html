<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Rodrigo Guzman, CTO ofiDoneThis, which makes status
reporting happen at your company with the lightest possible touch.iDoneThisis
a simple management application that emails your team at the end of every day
to ask, "What'd you get done today?" Just reply with a few lines of what you
got done. The following morning everyone on your team gets a digest with what
the team accomplished the previous day to keep everyone in the loop and
kickstart another awesome day.Before we launched, we built iDoneThis over a
weekend in the most rudimentary way possible. I kid you not, we sent the first
few batches of daily emails using the BCC field of a Gmail inbox. The upshot
is that we've had users on the site from Day 3 of its existence on.We've gone
from launch in January 2011 when we sent hundreds of emails out per day by
hand to sending out over 1 million emails and handling over 200,000 incoming
emails per month. In total, customers have recorded over 1.7 million

an old(2009), yet still very good post byLadar Levisonon Lavabit's

it should give you a general idea what Lavabit was all about.Getting to Know

for?Lavabit is a mid-sized email service provider. We currently have about
140,000 registered users with more than 260,000 email addresses. While most of
our accounts belong to individual users, we also provide corporate email
services to approximately 70 companies.Why did you decide to build this
system?We built the system to compete against the other large free email
providers, with an emphasis on serving the privacy conscious and technically
savvy user.

<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from
over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle
ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the greatMapReduce Versus Database War,
you would be correct.Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail
division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved
their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each
machine approach, to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just
couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that
works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability
potential.Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data
streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful
with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text
files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each
individual machine.

<p>Introduction: Ladar Levison of Lavabit has written anincredible article on howthey took a
centralized off-the-shelf email server that could handle only few thousand
users and built their own custom distributed infrastructure for handling
hundreds of thousands of email users. Lavabit processes 70 gigabytes of data
per day, is made up of 26 servers, hosts 260,000 email addresses, and
processes 600,000 emails a day. That's a lot of email.Lavabit's mission has a
little edge to it too:Lavabit was founded as a direct reaction to the larger
free e-mail services available. We felt it was possible to create an e-mail
service that was fast, reliable, feature rich and didn't achieve profitability
by prostituting its user base to marketers.What I really like about this
article is that Lavabit has some challenging elements in dealing with
different email protocols while being able to scale to a lot of users. There's
more going on than just trying to scale out a database. Many products contain
complicated bits li</p><p>3 0.72082502 <a title="253-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-06-Email_Architecture.html">202 high scalability-2008-01-06-Email Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here's anUpdate On Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes
Python.How do you add realtime functionality to a web scale application?
That's whatAdam Hitchcock, a Software Engineer at Disqus talks about in an
excellent talk: Making DISQUS Realtime (slides).Disqus had to take their
commenting system and add realtime capabilities to it. Not something that's
easy to do when at the time of the talk (2013) they had had just hit a billion
unique visitors a month.What Disqus developed is a realtime commenting system
called "realertime" that was tested to handle 1.5 million concurrently
connected users, 45,000 new connections per second, 165,000 messages/second,
with less than .2 seconds latency end-to-end.The nature of a commenting system
is that it is IO bound and has a high fanout, that is a comment comes in and
must be sent out to a lot of readers. It's a problem very similar to
whatTwitter must solve. Disqus' solution was quite interesting as was the path
to their solution.

<p>Introduction: Shanti Braforddetails how his Ruby on Railsbased website survived a 24 hour
550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup
details, so there's not much I can add.Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web
server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR,
nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved
performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of
the performance boost.Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a
very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>2 0.85705316 <a title="253-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-12-Search_the_tags_across_all_post.html">246 high scalability-2008-02-12-Search the tags across all post</a></p>

<p>Introduction: hi,the website i work for is looking to build a email system that can handle a
fair few emails (up to a hundred thousand a day).These comprise emails like
registration emails, newsletters, lots of user triggered emails and overnight
emails.At present we queue them in SQL and feed them into an smtp server on
one of our web servers when the queue drops below a certain level.this has
caused our mail system to crash as well as hammer our DB server (shared!!!).We
have got an architecture of what we want to build but thought there might be
something we could buy off the shelf that allowed us to keep templated emails,
lists of recipients, schedule sends etc and report on it. We can't find
anythingWhat do big websites like amazon etc use or people a little smaller
but who still send loads of mail (flickr, ebuyer, or other ecommerce
sites)Cheerstarqs</p><p>4 0.84276801 <a title="253-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-03-NoSQL_Means_Never_Having_to_Store_Blobs_Again.html">770 high scalability-2010-02-03-NoSQL Means Never Having to Store Blobs Again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Morgan Tocker has an awesome article and comment thread in theMySQL
Performance BlogaboutWhen should you store serialized objects in the
database?Before the NoSQL age is was very common to simulate schemalessness by
storing blobs in MySQL. Sharding was implemented by running multiple MySQL
instances and spreading writes across them. While not ideal for the purpose,
developers felt comfortable with MySQL. They knew how to install it, back it
up, replicate it, in short:  they knew how to make it work. Yet they also
needed to store objects without the penalty of joins. Searches and aggregate
queries were handled by indexes kept in separate tables, this offloaded the
fast path to objects.This all made perfect sense. Usually we just want stuff
to work and going with what you know is often the best path to that goal. And
what we have known is MySQL. All the different pros and cons of this approach
are covered wonderfully in the post.But the world has changed. With the same
goals in mind I do</p><p>5 0.8288126 <a title="253-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_18%2C_2011.html">992 high scalability-2011-02-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 18, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Performance is critical to the success of any web site, and yet today's web applications push browsers to their limits with increasing amounts of rich content and heavy use of Ajax. In his new book  Even Faster Web Sites: Performance Best Practices for Web Developers  , Steve Souders, web performance evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.  Souders' previous book, the bestselling  High Performance Web Sites , shocked the web development world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on the client side. In Even Faster Web Sites, Souders and eight expert contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your site's performance in three critical categories:

<p>Introduction: OK,     I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll ask here.     Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application" that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server" when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.     The normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let</p><p>4 0.089101337 <a title="298-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-How_many_machines_do_you_need_to_run_your_site%3F.html">70 high scalability-2007-08-22-How many machines do you need to run your site?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the best projects I've ever worked on was creating a large scale web site publishing system that was almost entirely static. A large team of very talented creatives made the art work, writers penned the content, and designers generated templates. All assets were controlled in a database. Then all that was extracted, after applying many different filters, to a static site that was uploaded via ftp to dozens of web servers. It worked great. Reliable, fast, cheap, and simple. Updates were a bit of a pain as it required pushing a lot of files to a lot of servers, and that took time, but otherwise a solid system.
 
 Alas, this elegant system was replaced with a new fangled dynamic database based system. Content was pulled from a database using a dynamic language generated front-end. With a recent series of posts from Amazon's Werner Vogels, chronicling his experience of transforming his   All Things Distributed   blog into a static site using S3's ability to serve web pages, I get th</p><p>6 0.086378336 <a title="298-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-06-Super_Bowl_Advertisers_Ready_for_the_Traffic%3F_Nope..It%27s_Lights_Out..html">1401 high scalability-2013-02-06-Super Bowl Advertisers Ready for the Traffic?

<p>Introduction: Building, scaling, and optimizing the next generation of web applications. Learn the tricks of the trade so you can build and architect applications that scale quickly--without all the high-priced headaches and service-level agreements associated with enterprise app servers and proprietary programming and database products. Culled from the experience of the Flickr.com lead developer, Building Scalable Web Sites offers techniques for creating fast sites that your visitors will find a pleasure to use.     Creating popular sites requires much more than fast hardware with lots of memory and hard drive space. It requires thinking about how to grow over time, how to make the same resources accessible to audiences with different expectations, and how to have a team of developers work on a site without creating new problems for visitors and for each other.

<p>Introduction: Update :   Speed up Apache - how I went from F to A in YSlow .  Good example of using YSlow to speed up a website with solid code examples.  Every layer in the multi-layer cake that is your website contributes to how long a page takes to display.  YSlow , from Yahoo, is a cool tool for discovering how the ingredients of your site's top layer contribute to performance.
 
YSlow analyzes web pages and tells you why they're slow based on the rules for high performance web sites. YSlow is a Firefox add-on integrated with the popular Firebug web development tool.   YSlow gives you:

<p>Introduction: In a presentation originally held at the 4. O2 Hosting Event in Hamburg, I spoke about the technology at a large online marketplace in Germany called  Hitmeister .
              
Â Some of the topics discussed include:
  
 what makes up a marketplace? technically 
 system principles 
 development patterns 
 tools philosophy 
 data model 
 hardware 
  
I am looking forward to comments and suggestions for both the presentation and our work.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88304472 <a title="298-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-07-Lazy_web_sites_run_faster.html">298 high scalability-2008-04-07-Lazy web sites run faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It is fairly obvious that web site performance can be increased by making the code run faster and optimising the response time. But that only scales up to a point. To really take our web sites to the next level, we need to look at the performance problem from a different angle.</p><p>3 0.87690806 <a title="298-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-04-How_Facebook_Handled_the_New_Year%27s_Eve_Onslaught.html">1168 high scalability-2012-01-04-How Facebook Handled the New Year's Eve Onslaught</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How does Facebook handle the massive New Year's Eve traffic spike? Thanks to Mike Swift, in  Facebook gets ready for New Year's Eve , we get a little insight as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still interesting.
  Problem Setup   
 Facebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be shared on New Year's eve. 
 Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average of 130 friends. 
 Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then rendered. 
 Different events put different stresses on different parts of Facebook.       
 
 Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of capacity  
 News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve Jobs drive user status updates

<p>Introduction: In article   Building Super-Scalable Web Systems with REST   Udi Dahan tells an interesting story of how they made a weather reporting system scale for over 10 million users.  So many users hitting their weather database didn't scale. Caching in a straightforward way wouldn't work because weather is obviously local. Caching all local reports would bring  the entire database into memory, which would work for some companies, but wasn't cost efficient for them.   So in typical REST fashion they turned locations into URIs. For example: http://weather.myclient.com/UK/London. This allows the weather information to be cached by intermediaries instead of hitting their servers.  Hopefully for each location their servers will be hit a few times and then the caches will be hit until expiry.
   
 In order to send users directly to the correct location an IP location check is performed on login and stored in a cookie. The lookup is done once and from then on out a GET is performed directly on the r</p><p>5 0.82872999 <a title="298-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Sync_data_on_all_servers.html">98 high scalability-2007-09-18-Sync data on all servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have a few apache servers ( arround 11 atm ) serving a small amount of data ( arround 44 gigs right now ).     For some time I have been using rsync to keep all the content equal on all servers, but the amount of data has been growing, and rsync takes a few too much time to "compare" all data from source to destination, and create a lot of I/O.     I have been taking a look at MogileFS, it seems a good and reliable option, but as the fuse module is not finished, we should have to rewrite all our apps, and its not an option atm.     Any ideas?     I just want a "real time, non resource-hungry" solution alternative for rsync. If I get more features on the way, then they are welcome :)     Why I prefer to use a Distributed File System instead of using NAS + NFS?     - I need 2 NAS, if I dont want a point of failure, and NAS hard is expensive.   - Non-shared hardware, all server has their own local disks.   - As files are replicated, I can save a lot of money, RAID is not a MUST.

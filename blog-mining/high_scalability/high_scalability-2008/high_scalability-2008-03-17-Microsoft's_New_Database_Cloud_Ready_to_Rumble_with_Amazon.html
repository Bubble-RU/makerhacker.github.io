<p>Introduction: Good article from  manageability.com Â summarizing design patterns from Pat Helland's amazing paper  Life beyond Distributed Transactions: an Apostate's Opinion .
  
  Entities are uniquely identified  - each entity which represents disjoint data (i.e. no overlap of data between entities) should have a unique key. 
  Multiple disjoint scopes of transactional serializability  - in other words there are these 'entities' and that you cannot perform atomic transactions across these entities. 
  At-Least-Once messaging  - that is an application must tolerate message retries and out-of-order arrival of messages. 
  Messages are adressed to entities  - that is one can't abstract away from the business logic the existence of the unique keys for addresing entities.  Addressing however is independent of location. 
  Entities manage conversational state per party  - that is, to ensure idemptency an entity needs to remember that a message has been previously processed.  Furthermore, in a world with</p><p>4 0.14793815 <a title="279-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-08-Google_AppEngine_-_A_First_Look.html">301 high scalability-2008-04-08-Google AppEngine - A First Look</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look around their documentation and seeing what stands out  for me. It's not the much speculated   super cluster VM  . AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran a   website out of S3   with a splash of   Heroku   thrown in as a chaser.      The idea is clearly to take advantage of our   massive multi-core future   by creating a shared nothing infrastructure based firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage: email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps.  A shared nothing request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build</p><p>5 0.14416143 <a title="279-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical_Scaling_Ascendant_-_How_are_SSDs_Changing__Architectures%3F.html">1291 high scalability-2012-07-25-Vertical Scaling Ascendant - How are SSDs Changing  Architectures?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With Amazon     announcing new High I/O 2TB SSD instances    the age of SSD has almost arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on demand rate the   price per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:   27 cents ($27K/100K IOPS) per vs    $1.25 for disk   .     With the obvious benefits of giant SSD machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it’s interesting to consider: what architecture decisions might you make differently in the future? 
   More Headroom for Vertical Scaling Simplifies Everything   
 The beauty of higher hardware performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This has always been the allure of    vertical scaling    and is well realized by SSDs through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as important, high densities.

<p>Introduction: Update 35  :   How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational Database  . Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in order to mimic RDBMS joins:   Given the trade off between potential inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the latter.      Update 34  : Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?   Amazon dramatically drops SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB  . This puts SimpleDB on par with   Google App Engine  . They also announced  a few new features:   a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline uploading of multiple items or attributes  . One of the complaints against SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things. These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.

<p>Introduction: Not surprisingly opinions on   SimpleDB   vary from it sucks, don't take my database, to it will change the world, who needs a database anyway? From a   quick survey of the blogosphere  , here's where SimpleDB stands at the moment:       SimpleDB Cons        No SLA. We don't know how reliable it will be, how fast it will be, or how consistent the performance will be.   Consistency constraints are relaxed. Reading data immediately after a write may not reflect the latest updates. To programmers used to transactions, this may be surprising, but many people think this is one of the tradeoffs that needs to be made to scale.   Database is a core competency. If you don't control your database you can't out compete your competition.     When your database is out of your control you can't guarantee it will work properly. You can't create the proper indexes and other optimizations.   No join or IN operator. You'll need to do multiple client side calls to simulate joins, which will be slow.

<p>Introduction: In an audacious move for such an established property, Netflix is moving their website out of the comfort of their own datacenter and into the wilds of the Amazon cloud. This paper by Netflix's Siddharth “Sid” Anand,  Netflix’s Transition to High-Availability Storage Systems , gives a detailed look at this transition and does a deep dive on SimpleDB best practices, focussing especially on techniques useful to those who are making the move from a RDBMS.
 
Sid is going to give a talk at QCon based on this paper and he would appreciate your feedback. So if you have any comments or thoughts please comment here or email Sid at  r39132@hotmail.com  or Twitter at @r39132 Here's the introduction from the paper:
  Circa late 2008, Netflix had a single data center. This single data center raised a few concerns. As a single-point-of-failure (a.k.a. SPOF), it represented a liability – data center outages meant interruptions to service and negative customer impact. Additionally, with growth in both</p><p>6 0.7010029 <a title="279-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-04-Jim_Starkey_is_Creating_a_Brave_New_World_by_Rethinking_Databases_for_the_Cloud.html">1092 high scalability-2011-08-04-Jim Starkey is Creating a Brave New World by Rethinking Databases for the Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since  The Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  was published we've a had few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their  Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East Region . Netlix shared their  Lessons Learned from the AWS Outage  as did Heroku ( How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage ), Smug Mug ( How SmugMug survived the Amazonpocalypse ), and SimpleGeo ( How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS Downtime ). 
 
The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to talk about the event itself.
 
 Lesson for crisis handlers : deep dive post-mortems that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention.</p><p>2 0.9619143 <a title="279-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-25-The_Big_List_of_Articles_on_the_Amazon_Outage.html">1029 high scalability-2011-04-25-The Big List of Articles on the Amazon Outage</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Please see  The Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  for a new improved list. 
 
So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage. Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change remains...cloudy.
 
I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's a resource you think should be added, just let me know.

<p>Introduction: Ali Sadat of  MuleSoft  gave interesting presentation at Saturday's  Talk Cloudy to Me!  event about their experiences moving  Mule iON , their ESB (enterprise service bus) product to the cloud.
 
First, a little about  Talk Cloudy to Me . This event is the second one day cloud event put on by Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, as part of the  Cloud Computing Meetup  group, also created by Sebastian. Sebastian has become a master at running these mini-conference style events. Really a quality job by him and his dedicated crew. These events are free, sponsored by various vendors; they are short, 11-5; the food is good, Thai; the venue is nice, eBay; they are on topic, with cloud and other speakers giving 30-45 minute talks.  More on the event when the video comes out. I type as fast as I can but I can't do much without the video.
 
Back to Ali Sadat. While he gave a lot of lessons--the integration will your billing system will take a lot longer than you think; talk to your Amazon accou</p><p>4 0.87119031 <a title="279-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-29-Strategy%3A_Sample_to_Reduce_Data_Set.html">311 high scalability-2008-04-29-Strategy: Sample to Reduce Data Set</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Arjen  links to video  Supporting Scalable Online Statistical Processing  which shows "rather than doing complete aggregates, use statistical sampling to provide a reasonable estimate (unbiased guess) of the result."  When you have a lot of data,  sampling  allows you to draw conclusions from a much smaller amount of data. That's why sampling is a scalability solution. If you don't have to process all your data to get the information you need then you've made the problem smaller and you'll need fewer resources and you'll get more timely results.
   
 Sampling is not useful when you need a complete list that matches a specific criteria. If you need to know the exact set of people who bought a car in the last week then sampling won't help.  But, if you want to know many people bought a car then you could take a sample and then create estimate of the full data-set. The difference is you won't really know the exact car count. You'll have a confidence interval saying how confident</p><p>5 0.85926276 <a title="279-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in_Architecture_-_Pay_to_Play_to_Keep_a_System_Small__.html">965 high scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in Architecture - Pay to Play to Keep a System Small  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you keep a system small enough, while still being successful, that a simple scale-up strategy becomes the preferred architecture?  StackOverflow , for example, could stick with a tool chain they were comfortable with because they had a natural brake on how fast they could grow: there are only so many programmers in the world. If this doesn't work for you, here's another natural braking strategy to consider:  charge for your service .  Paul Houle  summarized this nicely as:  avoid scaling problems by building a service that's profitable at a small scale .
 
This interesting point, one I hadn't properly considered before, was brought up by Maciej Ceglowski, co-founder of  Pinboard.in , in an interview with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their their  net@night  show.
 
Pinboard is a lean, mean, pay for bookmarking machine, a timely replacement for the nearly departed Delicious. And as a self professed anti-social bookmarking site, it  emphasizes speed over socializing .

<p>Introduction: AWStats  is a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web, streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.</p><p>3 0.091175884 <a title="208-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_Symfony_a_Web_Framework.html">31 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: Symfony a Web Framework</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Symfony  is an open-source PHP web framework based on the best practices of web development, thoroughly tried on several active websites, symfony aims to speed up the creation and maintenance of web applications, and to replace the repetitive coding tasks by power, control and pleasure.  Symfony provides a lot of features seamlessly integrated together, such as:   * simple templating and helpers  * cache management  * smart URLs  * scaffolding  * multilingualism and I18N support  * object model and MVC separation  * Ajax support  * enterprise ready</p><p>4 0.084170073 <a title="208-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-08-Paper%3A_Sharding_with_Oracle_Database.html">487 high scalability-2009-01-08-Paper: Sharding with Oracle Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The upshot of the paper is Oracle rules and MySQL sucks for sharding. Which is technically probable, if you don't throw in minor points like cost and ease of use. The points where they think Oracle wins: online schema changes, more robust replication, higher availability, better corruption handling, better use of large RAM and multiple cores, better and better tested partitioning features, better monitoring, and better gas mileage.</p><p>5 0.082658805 <a title="208-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-02-Database-Clustering%3A_a8cjdbc_-_update%3A_version_1.3.html">170 high scalability-2007-12-02-Database-Clustering: a8cjdbc - update: version 1.3</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The new version of a8cjdbc finished some limitations. Now Clobs and Blobs are supported, and some fixes using binary data. The version was also fully tested with Postgres and mySQL.      Since Version 1.3 there is also a free trail version for download available. Check it out and test yourself...     Take a look at: http://www.activ8.at/homepage/en/a8cjdbc.php     I've downloaded the latest version and setup a environment with one virtual database and two database backends.   I tried to make a "non real life szenario": The first backend was a Postgres node, the second was a mySQL node.   Everything works fine - failover - recoverylog, etc... with to different backend database types.     So check out the trial version and test yourself the clustered driver and give me some results about your experience with a8cjdbc.   As I only tested mySQL and Postgres (and the non real life szenario with two different backend types) - maybe someone else have experiences with out databases?      greeti</p><p>6 0.082658805 <a title="208-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-02-a8cjdbc_-_update_verision_1.3.html">171 high scalability-2007-12-02-a8cjdbc - update verision 1.3</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:   Deployment with Capistrano   by Charles Max Wood.  Nice simple step-by-step for using Capistrano for deployment.
 
From their website:   Simply put,  Capistrano  is a tool for automating tasks on one or more remote servers. It executes commands in parallel on all targeted machines, and provides a mechanism for rolling back changes across multiple machines. It is ideal for anyone doing any kind of system administration, either professionally or incidentally.  *  Great for automating tasks via SSH on remote servers, like software installation, application deployment, configuration management, ad hoc server monitoring, and more. * Ideal for system administrators, whether professional or incidental. * Easy to customize. Its configuration files use the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know Ruby to do most things with Capistrano. * Easy to extend. Capistrano is written in the Ruby programming language, and may be extended easily by writing additional Ruby mod</p><p>3 0.68299079 <a title="208-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA%3A_Badoo%E2%80%99s_journey_into_Continuous_Integration.html">1531 high scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA: Badoo’s journey into Continuous Integration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications stemming from this, we use AIDA.
 
 AIDA  (Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant) is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git, TeamCity and JIRA.
 
In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous integration.
 
We’ll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we’ll discuss AIDA’s major contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.
  Git flow  
The Badoo Team uses Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in JIRA and a description of the problem.

<p>Introduction: From their website:    FAI  is an automated installation tool to install or deploy Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat, autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used for configuration management of a running system.  You can take one or more virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed, configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized management system for your Linux deployment.  
   
  FAI's target group are system administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a rendering farm,</p><p>5 0.63683826 <a title="208-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-16-Product%3A_Func_-_Fedora_Unified_Network_Controller.html">385 high scalability-2008-09-16-Product: Func - Fedora Unified Network Controller</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Func  is used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It  targets easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you know what a total nightmare that can be.  Some example commands:
   Using the command line: func "*.example.org" call yumcmd update  Using the Pthon API: import func.overlord.client as fc client = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com") client.yumcmd.update() client.service.start("acme-server") print client.hardware.info()  
  Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than one</p><p>6 0.6366449 <a title="208-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Product%3A_ISPMan_Centralized_ISP_Management_System_.html">228 high scalability-2008-01-28-Product: ISPMan Centralized ISP Management System </a></p>

<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the application that will become critical over time.</p><p>2 0.99445158 <a title="208-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC_for_web-DB_servers.html">226 high scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC for web-DB servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All,     I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers. I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.     Could anyone share their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube etc..?     Thank you,   Regards,   Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>3 0.99270105 <a title="208-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.    We're basically using a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget). Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.    I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>4 0.98471516 <a title="208-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-UK_Based_CDN.html">324 high scalability-2008-05-19-UK Based CDN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,    I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK.  If they're outside the UK but have decent support then also include.  The service must be cheap and not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?     Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space.  Would S3 be a good starting point?  What is the service like?  I hear mixed reviews about it.     Many thanks,   Jim</p><p>5 0.98211741 <a title="208-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy%3A_Put_Mobile_Video_Into_Cold_Storage_After_30_Days.html">1201 high scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy: Put Mobile Video Into Cold Storage After 30 Days</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Limelight says  95% of Mobile Video Views Take Place in First 90 Days  and 88.8 percent of views take place in the first 30 days.
 
Since a lot of people are working with video, which is expensive to store and serve, the implication: there's little need to keep your video close to the user or on a CDN after 30 days.</p><p>6 0.9790774 <a title="208-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

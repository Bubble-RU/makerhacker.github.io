<p>Introduction: Hibernate and iBATIS and other similar tools have documentation with recommendations for avoiding the "N+1 select" problem.  The problem being that if you wanted to retrieve a set of widgets from a table, one query would be used to to retrieve all the ids of the matching widgets (select widget_id from widget where ...) and then for each id, another select is used to retrieve the details of that widget (select * from widget where widget_id = ?).  If you have 100 widgets, it requires 101 queries to get the details of them all.     I can see why this is bad, but what if you're doing entity caching?  i.e. If you run the first query to get your list of ids, and then for each widget you retrive it from the cache.  Surely in that case, N+1(+caching) is good?  Assuming of course that there is a high probability of all of the matching entities being in the cache.     I may be asking a daft question here - one whose answer is obviously implied by the large scalable mechanisms for storing data th</p><p>3 0.10898729 <a title="293-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-03-MocoSpace_Architecture_-_3_Billion_Mobile_Page_Views_a_Month.html">821 high scalability-2010-05-03-MocoSpace Architecture - 3 Billion Mobile Page Views a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO of  MocoSpace , describing the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile Web; their multi-tiered,  read/write, local/distributed caching system; selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.
 
MocoSpace is a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser, ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web. Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging, music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs.

<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary. Thanks for the thought though.  It's been a long long long process. Importing a largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things. I'll explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia that needs to be handled to make the move complete:

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Hank Williams says  iPhone Background Processing: Not Fixed But Halfway There . Excellent analysis of all the reasons you need real background processing. Hey, you can't even build an alarm clock! Hard to believe some commenters say it's not so.  .    Update: Josh Lowensohn  of Webware tells us  Why users should be scared of Apple's new notification system .      A big item on the iPhone developer iWishlist has been background processing. If you can't write an app to poll for new data in the background how will you keep your even more important non-foreground app in sync? Live from the Apple developer conference we learn the solution is a centralized push based architecture.      Here's the relevant MacRumorsLive transcript:    Thanking the developers for their hard work. Now talking about how the #1 request has been background support. Apple wants to solve this problem.

<p>Introduction: In  Secrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design , Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger shares three strategies Instagram uses to outsmart high latency mobile networks and make mobile apps feel faster than they really are, which helped Instagram reach 12 million users in 12 months:
  
  The motivation:  "mobile experiences fill gaps while we wait. no one wants to wait while they wait" 
  Perform actions optimistically . Make the user feel productive. Likes, comments, and follows are registered on screen while the like operation is being sent in the background.  
  Adaptively preload content . Load content before it's needed. Don't images according to time, it will take too long, instead re-prioritize based on interest. Show what the social network things is the most popular. Listen to what your user's flicks and taps are telling you. 
  Move bits when no-one is watching.  Picture uploading starts  before  you share them, most apps wait until after the share screen. The rule is send data as soo</p><p>3 0.64834023 <a title="293-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-18-The_Clever_Ways_Chrome_Hides_Latency_by_Anticipating_Your_Every_Need.html">1267 high scalability-2012-06-18-The Clever Ways Chrome Hides Latency by Anticipating Your Every Need</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ilya Grigorik has written another wonderful article lavishly detailing the extraordinary tactics Chrome employs to hide network latency from users:  Chrome Networking: DNS Prefetch & TCP Preconnect . Ilya springs some surpising factoids on us, revealing how the web has slowed and super sized:
  
 The size of an average page has grown to 1059kB and is now composed of over  80 subresource requests . 
 An average DNS lookup takes between 60 and 120ms. This creates a 100-200ms of latency before a request can be sent because of th full round-trip (RTT) to perform the TCP handshake. 
 Slow mobile experiences are largely due to the much higher RTT's (200-1000ms) on wireless networks. Reducing the number of outbound connections and the total byte size of your pages is the single best optimization you can make for mobile today.  
  
Chrome reduces apparent latency using a host of clever anticipatory mechanisms:

<p>Introduction: The story of driving the  golden spike  to symbolize the completion of the  transcontinental railroad  is famous in the US. What is not so well known is the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that possibly be?
  Telegraph as Internet  
First, let's establish the telegraph and cable systems was an early version of an Internet.
 
As railroad tracks were being laid a  transcontental telegraph  system was also being constructed. Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could ride.
 
With the  transalantic cable system  information could quickly span continents in minutes:
  

The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to 12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to 110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870, 40</p><p>5 0.60288459 <a title="293-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-13-A_Note_on_How_to_Create_Teasers_When_Posting_.html">210 high scalability-2008-01-13-A Note on How to Create Teasers When Posting </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I fully and enthusiastically encourage anyone who wants to share a relevant topic  to register and post. People have added a lot of good and useful content.  Don't be shy. It's been asked how a  teaser is created when posting so the full article doesn't display on the front page. A teaser is a paragraph interesting enough to convince readers to click on the "read more" link to get the full article.        Creating a teaser in Drupal is accomplished by inserting < ! -- break -- > on a separate line directly after the text you want to be the teaser. Only DO NOT include the spaces.  So your post looks like:   Teaser Content   < ! -- break -- > (no spaces in real life)   Rest of Content     It's a bit kludgey, but it works.</p><p>6 0.56002498 <a title="293-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-11-Strategy%3A_Don%27t_Use_Polling_for_Real-time_Feeds.html">759 high scalability-2010-01-11-Strategy: Don't Use Polling for Real-time Feeds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jean-Paul de Vooght of our Switzerland contingent created a nifty little WidSets widget that lets you better read HighScalability from your mobile phone. I thought untethered readers might like to give it a try. Thanks to Jean-Paul for making it available!     WidSets is:   a simple service that brings you information normally accessed via the Internet by sending it directly to your mobile phone . Using mini-applications called widgets, it sends you the latest updates to your favorite websites. The system uses RSS feeds to push information from these websites directly to your mobile phone the minute theyâ&euro;&trade;re updated  .</p><p>2 0.74847168 <a title="293-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-16-What_if_Cars_Were_Rented_Like_We_Hire_Programmers%3F.html">1388 high scalability-2013-01-16-What if Cars Were Rented Like We Hire Programmers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are hired at many software companies...   Agency  : So sorry you had to wait in the reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?  Applicant  : I drive a 2008 Subaru.  Agency  : That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent you.  Applicant  : That's OK. Any car will do.  Agency  : No, we can only take on clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way. There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take a chance.  Applicant  : I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt.</p><p>3 0.70589477 <a title="293-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-28-A_Practical_Guide_to_Varnish_-_Why_Varnish_Matters.html">996 high scalability-2011-02-28-A Practical Guide to Varnish - Why Varnish Matters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jeff Su  from Factual. 
 
 
  What is Varnish?  
 Varnish  is an open source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for both static and dynamic content.
 
One great thing about Varnish is that it can improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.  If you haven’t heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven’t used it), please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive, but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish’s more advanced features, you’ll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.
 
Some of the high profile companies using Varnish include:  Twitter ,  Facebook ,  Heroku  and  LinkedIn .
  Our Use Case  
One of Factual’s first high profile projects was  Newsweek’s “America’s Best High Schools: The List” . After realizing that we had only a few weeks to increase our</p><p>4 0.69813114 <a title="293-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_18%2C_2011.html">1007 high scalability-2011-03-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 18, 2011</a></p>

 The cloud is falling. Or at least shared networked storage as Reddit has a couple of long periods of downtime.  Good write up at Why reddit was down for 6 of the last 24 hours.  Upshot: Reddit is moving off EBS to local disks.

<p>Introduction: This is an email interview with   Viktor Klang   , Director of Engineering at    Typesafe   , on the    Scala Futures    model &    Akka,    both topics on which is he is immensely passionate and knowledgeable.  
 
How do you structure your application? That’s the question I explored in the article  Beyond Threads And Callbacks . An option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.
   To remedy my oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe’s Viktor Klang, long time Scala hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He’s a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about. 
   I’ve implemented several Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO, service orchestration, failover, etc, so I’m innately skeptical about frameworks that remove control from the programmer at</p><p>6 0.67842567 <a title="293-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-19-Twitter%E2%80%99s_Plan_to_Analyze_100_Billion_Tweets.html">780 high scalability-2010-02-19-Twitter’s Plan to Analyze 100 Billion Tweets</a></p>

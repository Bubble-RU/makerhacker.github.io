<p>Introduction: This website has been a great resource for helping me to understand the
successful (and failed) scalable network designs from organizations that have
actually done it, but I haven't seen any explicite explanations about secure
remote administration of these systems.I understand that the *nix people love
to SSH, and the windows gang has their RDP, but how does one go about creating
a network architecture that both allows one to manage their systems and does
its best to avoid hacker interest? As I imagine, no big website will have the
SSH/RDP/FTP ports open on the web server, so how is it that they go about
remotely administering their geographically diverse groups of servers
securely?</p><p>3 0.11031287 <a title="385-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible_-__A_Simple_Model-Driven_Configuration_Management_and_Command_Execution_Framework.html">1230 high scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible -  A Simple Model-Driven Configuration Management and Command Execution Framework</a></p>

using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate

execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was

<p>Introduction: At37 SignalsJoshua Sierles describes how 37 Signals usesSprinkleto configure
their servers within EC2. Sprinkledefines a domain specific meta-language for
describing and processing the installation of software. You can find an
interesting discussion of Sprinkle's creation story by the creator himself,
Marcus Crafter, inSprinkle Some Powder!.Marcus divides provisioning tools into
two categories:Task Based- the tool issues a list of commands to run on the
remote system, either remotely via a network connection or smart
client.Policy/state Based- the tool determines what needs to be run on the
remote system by examining its current and final state.Sprinkle combines both
models together in a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter approach using normal Ruby
code as the DSL (domain specific language) to declaratively describe remote
system configurations. 37 Signals likes the use of Ruby as the DSL because it
makes learning a separate syntax unnecessary. I've successfully done similar
things in Perl.</p><p>5 0.096891597 <a title="385-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-25-Product%3A_Puppet_the_Automated_Administration_System.html">429 high scalability-2008-10-25-Product: Puppet the Automated Administration System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Digg on their choice and use of Puppet. They chose puppet over
cfengine, and bcfg2 because they liked Puppet's resource abstraction layer
(RAL), the ability to implement configuration management incrementally,
support for bundles, and the overall design philosophy.Puppetimplements a
declarative (what not how) configuration language for automating common
administration tasks. It's the system every large site writes for themselves
and it's already made for you! Ilike was able to "easily" scale from0 to
hundreds of serversusing Puppet. I can't believe I've never seen this before.
It looks really cool. What is Puppet and how can it help you scale your
website operations?breakFrom the Puppet website:Puppet has been developed to
help the sysadmin community move to building and sharing mature tools that
avoid the duplication of everyone solving the same problem. It does so in two
ways:* It provides a powerful framework to simplify the majority of the
technical tasks that sysadmins need</p><p>6 0.082991861 <a title="385-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-13-What%27s_your_scalability_plan%3F.html">248 high scalability-2008-02-13-What's your scalability plan?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: Deployment with Capistrano  by Charles Max Wood.  Nice simple step-by-
step for using Capistrano for deployment.From their website:Simply
put,Capistranois a tool for automating tasks on one or more remote servers. It
executes commands in parallel on all targeted machines, and provides a
mechanism for rolling back changes across multiple machines. It is ideal for
anyone doing any kind of system administration, either professionally or
incidentally.* Great for automating tasks via SSH on remote servers, like
software installation, application deployment, configuration management, ad
hoc server monitoring, and more.* Ideal for system administrators, whether
professional or incidental.* Easy to customize. Its configuration files use
the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know Ruby to do
most things with Capistrano.* Easy to extend. Capistrano is written in the
Ruby programming language, and may be extended easily by writing additional
Ruby modules.breakOne of t</p><p>5 0.69083935 <a title="385-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-08-Product%3A_FAI_-_Fully_Automatic_Installation.html">272 high scalability-2008-03-08-Product: FAI - Fully Automatic Installation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From their website:FAIis an automated installation tool to install or deploy
Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a
Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat,
autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used
for configuration management of a running system.You can take one or more
virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction
necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your
computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized
management system for your Linux deployment.breakFAI's target group are system
administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of
computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general
purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a
rendering farm, a web server</p><p>6 0.69066066 <a title="385-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-29-CTL_-_Distributed_Control_Dispatching_Framework_.html">433 high scalability-2008-10-29-CTL - Distributed Control Dispatching Framework </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>2 0.740394 <a title="385-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson_from_Airbnb%3A_Give_Yourself_Permission_to_Experiment_with_Non-scalable_Changes.html">1458 high scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson from Airbnb: Give Yourself Permission to Experiment with Non-scalable Changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are stuck drowning in too much data and too many options and are
dazzled by all the possibilities of code, here's a helpful bit of advice from
Airbnb's rags to richesorigin story:it's okay to do things that don't scale. A
corollary is the idea of paying attention to and learning from what your users
are actually doing and let that lead you without out that annoying voice in
your head second guessing you, yelling but that will never scale! Worry about
building something good, then worry about making it scale.In Airbnb's case
they noticed people weren't booking rooms because the pictures sucked. So they
flew to New York and shot some beautiful images. This is a very non-scalable
and non-technical solution. Yet it was the turning point for Airbnb and
sparked their climb out of the "trough of sorrow." Previously they had been
limited by the Silicon Valley idea that every feature had to be scalable. Not
every solution can be found behind a computer screen.For the full story please

<p>Introduction: Playing like the big boys may be getting cheaper. The big boys, likeYouTube,
farm the serving of their most popular videos to a third party CDN. A lot of
people were surprised YouTube didn't serve all their content themselves, but
it makes sense. It allows them to keep up with demand without a large hit for
infrastructure build out, much like leasing computers instead of buying
them.breakThe problem has been CDNs are expensive. Om Malik reports inAkamai &
the CDN Price Warsthat may be changing. CDN service could be becoming
affordable enough that you might consider using them as part of your scaling
strategy.Akamai, once the clear leader in the CDN field, is facing strong
competition from the likes of Limelight Networks, Level 3, Internap,
CDNetworks, Panther Express and EdgeCast Networks.Thiscommoditizationmay be
bad for their stock prices, but it's good for website builders looking for new
scaling strategies. EdgeCast, for example, passes on the cost savings when
when their bandwidth</p><p>4 0.59012407 <a title="385-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-26-Lucasfilm%3A_The_Real_Magic_is_in_the_Data_Center.html">396 high scalability-2008-09-26-Lucasfilm: The Real Magic is in the Data Center</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kevin Clark, director of IT operations for Lucasfilm, discusses how their data
center works:* Linux-based platform, SUSE (looking to change), and a lot of
proprietary open source applications for content creation.* 4,500-processor
render farm in the datacenter. Workstations are used off hours.* Developed
their own proprietary scheduler to schedule their 5,500 available processors.*
Render nodes, the blade racks (from Verari), run dual-core dual Opteron chips
with 32GB of memory on board, but are expanding those to quad-core. Are an AMD
shop.* 400TB of storage online for production.* Every night they write out
10-20TB of new data on a render. A project will use up to a hundred-plus
terabytes of storage.* Incremental backups are a challenge because the data
changes up to 50 percent over a week.* NetApps used for storage. They like the
global namespace in the virtual file system.* Foundry Networks architecture

<p>Introduction: Queuing work forprocessing in the backgroundis a time testedscalability
strategy. Queuing also happens to be one of those much needed tools where it
easy enough to forge for your own that we see a lot of different versions
made.Resque is GitHub'stake on a job queue and they've used it to process
million and millions of jobs so far.What is Resque?Redis-backedlibrary for
creating background jobs, placing those jobs on multiple queues, and
processing them later. Background jobs can be any Ruby class or module that
responds to perform. Your existing classes can easily be converted to
background jobs or you can create new classes specifically to do work. Or, you
can do both.GitHub tried and considered many other systems: SQS, Starling,
ActiveMessaging, BackgroundJob, DelayedJob, beanstalkd, AMQP,  and Kestrel,
but found them all wanting in one way are another. The latency for SQS was too
high. Others didn't make full use of Ruby. Others still had a lot of overhead.

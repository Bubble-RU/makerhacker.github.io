Behind the iPhone 3G Glitches:One source says Apple programmed the Infineon
chip to demand a more powerful 3G signal than the iPhone really requires. So
if too many people try to make a call or go on the Internet in a given area,

slower networkâ&euro;&rdquo;even if there is enough 3G bandwidth available.Update:To get a
taste of what will be served,mySQL DBAhas a nice post titledCapacity Planning,
Architecture, Scaling, Response time, Throughput. You learn how to figure out
when your application will break by building a 3rd order polynomial. Cool
stuff!John Allspaw who is the Operations Engineering Manager at Flickr is

<p>Introduction: Unlike Theo Schlossnagle, author ofScalable Internet Architectures, I am not a
stickler for semantics because I have an unswerving faith in the ultimate
unknowability of the world as experienced by others. That's why it is Theo who
bravely tackles the differences in his informative blog postPartitioning vs.
Federation vs. Sharding. Royans Tharakan also talks about it on hisblog.Is
there a difference and does it really matter to all our intrepid scalable
website builders?breakGenerally whatever Theo says is probably close to the
truth. Yet, in my mind I think of partitioning as abasic level categoryand
federation and sharding as more specific (subordinate) instances of
partitioning. And partitioning is a more specific instance of the more more
general (superordinate) category divide-and-conquer. Which isn't a useful way
to think about the topic at all.So, let's say federation is like Star Trek.

<p>Introduction: I've been interested in sharding concepts since first hearing the term "shard"
a few years back. My interest had been piqued earlier, the first time I read
about Google's original approach to distributed search. It was described as a
hashtable-like system in which independent physical machines play the role of
the buckets. More recently, I needed the capacity and performance of a Sharded
system, but did not find helpful libraries or toolkits which would assist with
the configuration for my language of preference these days, which is Python.
And, since I had a few weeks on my hands, I decided I would begin the work of
creating these tools.The result of my initial work the Pyshards project, a
still-incomplete python and MySQL based horizontal partitioning and sharding
toolkit. HighScalability.com readers will already know that horizontal
partitioning is a data segmenting pattern in which distinct groups of physical
row-based datasets are distributed across multiple partitions. When the

<p>Introduction: "For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing
them." -- AristotleA really nice Internet moment happened in the HackerNews
thread Disqus: Scaling the World's Largest Django Application, when David
Kitchen crafted an awesome responseto a questionabout how you learn to build
scalable systems. It's so good I thought I would reproduce it
here.Question:asked by grovulent:Not like this is a problem I have to worry
about. But where on earth does one learn this stuff? The talk is useful - as
an overview of what they use - but I know nothing of how to implement a single
step.Answer: answered by David Kitchenofburo9:It's called experience. Which
perhaps sounds rude, but it's not meant to be.This stuff isn't taught per se,
you learn it bit by bit as you solve each problem that you face.I learned
about HAProxy when my site load exceeded that which a single web server could
manage.I learned about heartbeat when I had to update my HAProxy and it
knocked the site offline.I</p><p>6 0.57836986 <a title="348-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr_Architecture.html">152 high scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a
firm schema. I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the
overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding. The data is
essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song. This
lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and
Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together. This will be in
a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by
artist album or song. By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song
I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by. The problem is
that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to
shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what
are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it? Should I go
with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table? Perhaps it might be

available on how on how Flickr scales its backend to handle tremendous loads.
Some of this information is available inFlickr Architecture, but the paper is
so good it's worth another read. If you want to see sharding done right, at

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.I have a problem I'd like to have your view on. I've
looked around a lot, and I haven't found a definite answer. The question is
this:Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of
users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open
source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will
cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft
licenses(OS, SQL Server, â&euro;Ś)?I am in charge of selecting the technology toolbox
for a startup which is going to build a scalable public web platform. I've
worked as a developer and database developer/admin (mainly as a DBA) using
different platforms and technologies, but my main focus is on Microsoft
technology. I've considered all other important factors for this decision, and
at the end, I always come back to the question of money. When I finish

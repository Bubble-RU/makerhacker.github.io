<p>Introduction: Reducing the costs of IT infrastructure and improving the manageability and efficiency of web services pose significant challenges for many organizations in today's economic climate. Recent studies describe the challenges IT managers face administering the proliferation of x86-based servers used to run web services applications. Those reports reveal that using large number of x86-based systems can increase space and power consumption, as well as cost and asset management overhead. In addition, many of these x86-based systems run a mixture of operating system and application software leading to increased management complexity and potential security concerns.

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment.

These configurations focus on single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the switches.     These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's expertise gained in actual, real-world installations.

<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable solution that</p><p>5 0.17451882 <a title="457-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-24-Scalability_Perspectives_%236%3A_Lew_Tucker_%E2%80%93_Virtual_Data_Centers_in_the_Open_Cloud.html">547 high scalability-2009-03-24-Scalability Perspectives #6: Lew Tucker – Virtual Data Centers in the Open Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sun FireTM X4540 Server as Backup Server for Zmanda's Amanda Enterprise 2.6 Software     by Thomas Hanvey (Sun Microsystems) and Dmitri Joukovski and Ken Crandall (Zmanda)   September, 2008     Explosive data growth, combined with demanding requirements for data availability, has placed a tremendous burden on IT operations staff at businesses of all sizes. Yet, many organizations do not have the staff or budget to purchase and manage complex and expensive backup and recovery software products.     The Sun FireTM X4540 server can deliver massive storage capacity and remarkable throughput so it is well-suited as a nearline storage platform for backup and restore applications. Combining the power of the SolarisTM 10 Operating System with the data integrity and simplified administration of ZFS, the Sun Fire X4540 server can be an ideal candidate for streamlining and improving backup and restore operations.     Amanda Enterprise Edition from Zmanda was designed to address these challenges,</p><p>2 0.82646036 <a title="457-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-01-15_Scalability_and_Performance_Best_Practices.html">668 high scalability-2009-08-01-15 Scalability and Performance Best Practices</a></p>
<p>Introduction: These are from  Laura Thomson of OmniTi :  
  Profile early, profile often.  Pick a profiling tool and learn it in and out.  
  Dev-ops cooperation is essential.  The most critical difference in organizations that handles crises well. 
  Test on production data.  Code behavior (especially performance) is often data driven. 
  Track and trend.  Understanding your historical performance characteristics is essential for spotting emerging problems. 
  Assumptions will burn you.  Systems are complex and often break in unexpected ways. 
  Decouple.  Isolate performance failures. 
  Cache.  Caching is the core of most optimizations. 
  Federate.  Data federation is taking a single data set and spreading it across multiple database/application servers. 
  Replicate.  Replication is making synchronized copies of data available in more than one place. 
  Avoid straining hard-to-scale resources.  Some resources are inherently hard to scale: Uncacheable’ data, Data with a very high read+write rate</p><p>3 0.77200794 <a title="457-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Paper%3A_Designing_Disaster_Tolerant_High_Availability_Clusters.html">25 high scalability-2007-07-25-Paper: Designing Disaster Tolerant High Availability Clusters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Wikipedia and  Wikimedia  have some of the best, most complete real-world documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid, lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN,   how caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of configuration files. This is a really useful resource.

<p>Introduction: Since its inception,  Amazon EC2  has enabled companies to run highly scalable infrastructure with minimal overhead.  Over the years, Amazon Web Services has expanded with new offerings and additional regions around the world.
   
All this growth has made establishing a global footprint easier than ever.  And yet, most EC2 customers still choose to operate in a single region.  While this is fine for many applications, customers with significant web infrastructure are depriving users of drastically improved performance.  Deploying infrastructure in EC2's new regions cuts out one of the biggest sources of latency: distance.
   
In  this post , I describe how  Bizo  significantly reduced load times by implementing Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) to distribute traffic across all Amazon regions.

[sent-1, score-0.503]
</p><p>2 Scalability is linear because as more servers are added data is transparently load balanced across the servers so there is an automated in-memory sharding. [sent-10, score-0.397]
</p><p>3 Net, Java and C/C++      Transparent Services : server farm membership, object placement, scaling, recovery, creating and managing replicas, and handling synchronization on object access. [sent-28, score-0.644]
</p><p>4 Application developers can view the distributed cache as if it were a local cache which is accessed by the customary add, retrieve, update, and remove operations on cached objects. [sent-38, score-0.522]
</p><p>5 Automatically partitions all of distributed cache's stored objects across the farm and simultaneously processes access requests on all servers. [sent-41, score-0.505]
</p><p>6 Likewise, if servers are removed, ScaleOut StateServer coalesces stored objects on the surviving servers and rebalances the storage workload as necessary. [sent-43, score-0.447]
</p><p>7 If a server goes offline or loses network connectivity, ScaleOut StateServer retrieves its objects from replicas stored on other servers in the farm, and it creates new replicas to maintain redundant storage as part of its "self-healing" process. [sent-46, score-0.534]
</p><p>8 Optional object expiration after sliding or fixed timeouts, LRU memory reclamation, or object dependency changes. [sent-49, score-0.502]
</p><p>9 Developers can attach metadata or "tags" to cached objects and query the cache for all matching objects. [sent-55, score-0.417]
</p><p>10 You need to create a means of storing objects across the servers in the farm in a way that will scale as servers are added, such as creating and managing partitions. [sent-91, score-0.547]
</p><p>11 To ensure that objects are available in the case of a server failure, you need to create replicas and have a means of automatically retrieving them in case a server fails. [sent-94, score-0.495]
</p><p>12 The storage, load-balancing, and high availability mechanisms need to make use of efficient, global object naming and lookup so that any client can access any object in the distributed cache, even after load-balancing or recovery actions. [sent-98, score-0.667]
</p><p>13 You need distributed locking to coordinate accesses by different clients so that there are not conflicts or synchronization issues as objects are read, updated and deleted. [sent-100, score-0.422]
</p><p>14 You also will need to build the capability for the cache to handle object timeouts (absolute and sliding) and to make these timeouts highly available. [sent-103, score-0.582]
</p><p>15 You need a means to manage all of the servers in the distributed cache and to collect performance data. [sent-110, score-0.39]
</p><p>16 With our GeoServer product, you can automatically replicate cached information to up to 8 remote data centers. [sent-123, score-0.369]
</p><p>17 Typically a customer might use GeoServer to replicate object data between a primary data center site and a DR site. [sent-139, score-0.436]
</p><p>18 From a single web farm perspective, ScaleOut provides high availability by making either 1 or 2 (this is configurable) replica copies of each master object and storing the replica on an alternate host server in the farm. [sent-143, score-0.55]
</p><p>19 ScaleOut provides uniform access to the object from any server, and protects the object in the case of a server failure. [sent-144, score-0.497]
</p><p>20 It is true that distributed caches typically hold temporary, fast-changing data, but that data can still be very critical to ecommerce, or grid computing applications. [sent-146, score-0.412]

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case. Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on Fotolog in  Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success , which was one of my personal favorites.  Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've developed a</p><p>3 0.2409479 <a title="373-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-13-Sponsored_Post%3A_Cedexis%2C_Callfire%2C_Attribution_Modeling%2C_Logic_Monitor%2C_New_Relic%2C_ScaleOut%2C_AppDynamics%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1156 high scalability-2011-12-13-Sponsored Post: Cedexis, Callfire, Attribution Modeling, Logic Monitor, New Relic, ScaleOut, AppDynamics, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: ScaleOut StateServer  is an in-memory distributed cache across a server farm or compute grid. Unlike middleware vendors, StateServer is aims at being a very good data cache, it doesn't try to handle job scheduling as well.  StateServer is what you might get when you take Memcached and merge in all the value added distributed caching features you've ever dreamed of. True, Memcached is free and ScaleOut StateServer is very far from free, but for those looking a for a satisfying out-of-the-box experience, StateServer may be just the caching solution you are looking for. Yes, "solution" is one of those "oh my God I'm going to pay through the nose" indicator words, but it really applies here. Memcached is a framework whereas StateServer has already prepackaged most features you would need to add through your own programming efforts.  Why use a distributed cache?

<p>Introduction: Infinispan  is a highly scalable, open source licensed data grid platform in the style of  GigaSpaces  and Oracle  Coherence .
 
From their website:
   The purpose of Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent, designed ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core architectures while at the same time providing distributed cache capabilities.  At its core Infinispan exposes a JSR-107 (JCACHE) compatible Cache interface (which in turn extends java.util.Map).  It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer network architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data grid.  Offering high availability via making replicas of state across a network as well as optionally persisting state to configurable cache stores, Infinispan offers enterprise features such as efficient eviction algorithms to control memory usage as well as JTA compatibility.  In addition to the peer-to-peer architecture of Infinispan, on the roadmap is the ability to run f</p><p>3 0.77535421 <a title="373-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-05-Product%3A_Tugela_Cache.html">174 high scalability-2007-12-05-Product: Tugela Cache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tugela Cache  is a cache system like memecached, but instead of storing data just in RAM, it stores data in the file system using a b-tree. You trade latency in order to have a very large cache. It's useful for sites that have caching requirements that exceed their available memory.  It uses the same wire protocol as  memcached  so it can be dropped in without a hassle. From the website:   As large MediaWiki deployments may gain performance using Memcached, at some level cost of RAM to store all objects becomes too high. In order to balance resource usage and make more use of our Apache server disks, Tugela, the distributed cached on-disk hash database, has arrived.  Tugela Cache is derived from Memcached. Much of the code remains the same, but notably, these changes: 
 
 Internal slab allocator replaced by BerkeleyDB B-Tree database. 
 Expiry policy management moved to external program tugela-expire 
 Much statistics code made obsolete.

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case. Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on Fotolog in  Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success , which was one of my personal favorites.  Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've developed a</p><p>5 0.76452708 <a title="373-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-29-Ehcache_-_A_Java_Distributed_Cache_.html">359 high scalability-2008-07-29-Ehcache - A Java Distributed Cache </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ehcache  is a pure Java cache with the following features: fast, simple, small foot print, minimal dependencies,  provides memory and disk stores for scalability into gigabytes, scalable to hundreds of caches is a pluggable cache for Hibernate, tuned for high concurrent load on large multi-cpu servers, provides LRU, LFU and FIFO cache eviction policies, and is production tested. Ehcache is used by  LinkedIn  to cache member  profiles. The user guide says it's possible to get at 2.5 times system speedup for persistent Object Relational Caching, a 1000 times system speedup for Web Page Caching, and a 1.6 times system speedup Web Page Fragment Caching. From the website:
   
  Introduction  Ehcache is a cache library. Before getting into ehcache, it is worth stepping back and thinking about caching generally.

<p>Introduction: CNBC, like many large web sites, relied  on a CDN for content delivery.  Recently, we started looking  to see if we could improve this model.  Our criteria was:     - improve response time  - have better control over traffic (real time reporting, change management and alerting)  - better utilize internal datacenters and their infrastructure  - shield users from any troubles at the origin infrastructure  - cost out       After researching the market, we turned to two vendors: Dyn (Dynamic Network Services) and  aiScaler . We' have had   about a year worth of experience with  aiScaler  (search for "CNBC" to see my previous post ), but Dyn was a new vendor for us.  We started building our relationship at Velocity conference in the summer of 2009.    Dyn has recently started offering a geo-aware DNS load balancing solution, using Anycast and the distributed nature of their DNS presence to enable a key component of what we were trying to achieve: steer users to geographically closest origin</p><p>same-blog 2 0.97615671 <a title="373-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-29-Product%3A_ScaleOut_StateServer_is_Memcached_on_Steroids.html">373 high scalability-2008-08-29-Product: ScaleOut StateServer is Memcached on Steroids</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact socially with friends using  Playfish  games on social platforms like The Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the fastest growing segment of the game industry:  social gaming , which is the love child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by why EA bought them for  $300 million  and they think a  $1 billion game  is possible): building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve systems, agile development and deployment, and  selling virtual good  as a business model.

<p>Introduction: Replication Under Scalable Hashing: A Family of Algorithms for Scalable Decentralized Data Distribution 
 
From the abstract:  Typical algorithms for decentralized data distribution work best in a system that is fully built before it first used; adding or removing components results in either extensive reorganization of data or load imbalance in the system. We have developed a family of decentralized algorithms, RUSH (Replication Under Scalable Hashing), that maps replicated objects to a scalable collection of storage servers or disks. RUSH algorithms distribute objects to servers according to user-specified server weighting. While all RUSH variants support addition of servers to the system, different variants have different characteristics with respect to lookup time in petabyte-scale systems, performance with mirroring (as opposed to redundancy codes), and storage server removal. All RUSH variants redistribute as few objects as possible when new servers are added or existing servers</p><p>5 0.9673776 <a title="373-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-05-10_Things_You_Should_Know_About_Running_MongoDB_at_Scale.html">1606 high scalability-2014-03-05-10 Things You Should Know About Running MongoDB at Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Guest post by  Asya Kamsky , Principal Solutions Architect at MongoDB. 
 
This post outlines ten things you need to know for operating MongoDB at scale based on my experience working with MongoDB customers and open source users:
  
  MongoDB requires DevOps, too.  MongoDB is a database. Like any other data store, it requires capacity planning, tuning, monitoring, and maintenance. Just because it's easy to install and get started and it fits the developer paradigm more naturally than a relational database, don't assume that MongoDB doesn't need proper care and feeding.  And just because it performs super-fast on a small sample dataset in development doesn't mean you can get away without having a good schema and indexing strategy, as well as the right hardware resources in production! But if you prepare well and understand the best practices, operating large MongoDB clusters can be boring instead of nerve-wracking. 
  Successful MongoDB users monitor everything and prepare for growth.</p><p>6 0.96464115 <a title="373-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-29-How_to_Succeed_at_Capacity_Planning_Without_Really_Trying_%3A__An_Interview_with_Flickr%27s_John_Allspaw_on_His_New_Book.html">643 high scalability-2009-06-29-How to Succeed at Capacity Planning Without Really Trying :  An Interview with Flickr's John Allspaw on His New Book</a></p>

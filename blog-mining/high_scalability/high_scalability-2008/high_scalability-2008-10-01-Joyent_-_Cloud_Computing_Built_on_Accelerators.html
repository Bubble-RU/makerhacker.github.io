The template is definitely too long, but it's more just a series of questions to jog people's memories and then they can answer whatever they think is important.     What I want to ask is if you can think of any things to add/delete/change in the template? What do you want to know about the systems people are building?

<p>Introduction: Several months ago I attended a Joyent presentation where the spokesman hinted that Joyent had the chops to support a one billion page per month Facebook Ruby on Rails application. Even under a few seconds of merciless grilling he would not give up the name of the application. Now we have the big reveal: it was LinkedIn's  Bumper Sticker  app. For those not currently sticking things on bumps, Bumper Sticker is quite surprisingly a  viral media sharing application that allows users to express their individuality by sticking small virtual stickers on Facebook profiles . At the time I was quite curious how Joyent's cloud approach could be leveraged for this kind of app. Now that they've released a few details, we get to find out.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Jake in  Does Django really scale better than Rails?  thinks apps like FFS shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.  In a short three months Friends for Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300 million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails,  two part time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: Here's my template for describing the architecture of a system. The idea is to have people fill out this template and that then becomes the basis for a profile. This is how the   Friends for Sale   post was created and I think that turned out well. People always want more detail, but realistically you can only expect so much.     The template is definitely too long, but it's more just a series of questions to jog people's memories and then they can answer whatever they think is important.     What I want to ask is if you can think of any things to add/delete/change in the template? What do you want to know about the systems people are building? So if you have the time, please take a look and tell me what you think.

<p>Introduction: Ever feel like the blogosphere is 500 million channels with nothing on?  Tailrank finds the internet's hottest channels by indexing over 24M weblogs and feeds per hour. That's 52TB of raw blog content (no, not sewage) a month and requires continuously processing 160Mbits of IO. How do they do that?
 
This is an email interview with Kevin Burton,  founder and CEO of Tailrank.com. Kevin was kind enough to take the time to explain how they scale to index the entire blogosphere.
  Sites     Tailrank  - We track the hottest news in the blogosphere!     Spinn3r  - A blog spider you can specialize with your own behavior instead of creating your own.     Kevin Burton's Blog  - his blog is an indexing mix of politics and technical talk. Both are always interesting.

<p>Introduction: Every system has a limit. Although most providers of web hosting services claim to provide "Unlimited", we all know that any web server has physical limits which is usually hard to scale up, especially without taking the machine offline.
 
Most IT hosting companies use stand-alone servers to provide website hosting. A very few use any form of HA clusters. Those web hosts that use stand-alone servers do not feature scalability. Every time they need to upgrade the machines they use, major changes to the systems have to be made. Others which that do clustering are more scalable. They would add additional servers to their systems or to remove machines from the set-ups. There are many scenarios and different models of doing clustering. However I'm not the one who would write about them. Plus this is not the purpose of this article.

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see how!     Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed in a format called   Alexandrian form which draws on constructs used by Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:     The pattern name   The problem the pattern is trying to solve     Context   Solution   Examples   Design rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why experts use it       Patterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context, and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next ‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured col</p><p>3 0.95304137 <a title="399-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere_Commerce_High_Availability_and_Performance_Configurations.html">321 high scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere Commerce High Availability and Performance Configurations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nobody came up with an example of a website powered by a Websphere product (which has a community edition) and backed up by a DB2 database.     I guess you all know about usopen.org so here's the story:       While the re-emergence of 35-year-old Andre Agassi and the continued dominance of wunderkind Maria Sharapova have highlighted the on-court headlines at this year's U.S. Open Tennis Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., IBM is hoping its new Power5 chip-based IT support for USOpen.org can make news among those more interested in .NET than tennis nets.     Big Blue has partnered with the U.S. Tennis Association and the U.S. Open -- the most prestigious tennis tournament in the U.S. -- since 1992. Together, they launched USOpen.org in 1995 so racket heads could follow the matches online.     The iSeries' role this year is in powering a Web-based end-user application called "Point Tracker," a graphics tool using autonomic technology that recreates the trajectory of every shot.

<p>Introduction: Michael Stonebraker sure knows how to stir up a storm. Unlike for others, that doesn't make him a troll in my mind, he's  way too accomplished  in the field to be that, but he does have a bit of Barnum & Bailey in him, which serves to get the discussion flowing, and that's a good thing. A lot of previously hidden wisdom and passion unlocks, which we'll try to capture here.
 
This disturbance in the force is over OldSQL vs NoSQL vs  NewSQL . Warning, these are not crisp categories, there's leakage all over the place, watch your step:
  
  OldSQL  (Oracle, MySQL, etc) refers to what some want to term as legacy relational database like MySQL, that don't scale out horizontally with aplomb. 
  NoSQL  (CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, Riak, Neo4j, etc) refers to, well, a collection of technologies that aren't OldSQL, these often are designed to scale out horizontally, aren't on ACID, and use schemaless non-relational datamodels.

<p>Introduction: GigaSpaces launched   OpenSpaces.org  , a community web site for developers who wish to utilize and contribute to the open source   OpenSpaces development framework  .     OpenSpaces extends the Spring Framework for enterprise Java development, and leverages the   GigaSpaces eXtreme Application Platform   (XAP) for data caching, messaging and as the container for application business logic.  It is designed for building highly-available, scale-out applications in distributed environments, such as SOA, cloud computing, grids and commodity servers.  OpenSpaces is widely used in a variety of industries, including financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing and retail -- and across the web in e-commerce, Web 2.0 applications such as social networking sites, search and more.

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL architecture."
 
 Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores Â overview:
  

Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture, transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or clock synchronization for this coordination.


This paper presents a novel protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could potentially yield a vio</p><p>5 0.10867834 <a title="423-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-17-Some_Services_are_More_Equal_than_Others.html">944 high scalability-2010-11-17-Some Services are More Equal than Others</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Remember  when the iPhone launched? Remember the complaints about the device not  maintaining calls well? Was it really the hardware? Or was it the  service provider network, overwhelmed by not just the call volume but  millions of hyper-customers experimenting with their new toy? Look – a  video! Look a video  and a call.  Hey, I’m on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and streaming audio at the same time I’m making a call! How awesome is that?
 
Meanwhile,  there’s an entire army of operators at a service provider’s NOC who are  stalking through the data center with scissors because it’s the only  way to stop the madness.
 
Service providers, probably better  than any other, understand “services”. For longer than the enterprise  has been talking about them, service providers have been implementing  them. They’ve got their own set of standards and reference architectures  and even language to describe them, but in a nutshell that’s what a  service provider does: offers services.

<p>Introduction: As it is said in the recent article  "Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail - When More Machines Equals Worse Results"  , latency variability has greater impact in larger scale clusters where a typical request is composed of multiple distributed/parallel requests. The overall response time dramatically decreases if latency of each request is not consistent and low. 
 
In dynamically scalable partitioned storage systems, whether it is a NoSQL database, filesystem or in-memory data grid, changes in the cluster (adding or removing a node) can lead to big data moves in the network to re-balance the cluster. Re-balancing will be needed for both primary and backup data on those nodes. If a node crashes for example, dead node’s data has to be re-owned (become primary) by other node(s) and also its backup has to be taken immediately to be fail-safe again. Shuffling MBs of data around has a negative effect in the cluster as it consumes your valuable resources such as network, CPU and RAM. It mig</p><p>4 0.63838619 <a title="423-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-07-Product%3A_Infinispan_-_Open_Source_Data_Grid.html">696 high scalability-2009-09-07-Product: Infinispan - Open Source Data Grid</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Infinispan  is a highly scalable, open source licensed data grid platform in the style of  GigaSpaces  and Oracle  Coherence .
 
From their website:
   The purpose of Infinispan is to expose a data structure that is highly concurrent, designed ground-up to make the most of modern multi-processor/multi-core architectures while at the same time providing distributed cache capabilities.  At its core Infinispan exposes a JSR-107 (JCACHE) compatible Cache interface (which in turn extends java.util.Map).  It is also optionally is backed by a peer-to-peer network architecture to distribute state efficiently around a data grid.  Offering high availability via making replicas of state across a network as well as optionally persisting state to configurable cache stores, Infinispan offers enterprise features such as efficient eviction algorithms to control memory usage as well as JTA compatibility.  In addition to the peer-to-peer architecture of Infinispan, on the roadmap is the ability to run f</p><p>5 0.63479203 <a title="423-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-12-GemStone_Unveils_GemFire_Enterprise_6.0.html">597 high scalability-2009-05-12-GemStone Unveils GemFire Enterprise 6.0</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GemFire Enterprise is in-memory distributed data management platform that pools memory (and CPU, network and optionally local disk) across multiple processes to manage application objects and behavior. With the 6.0 release, GemFire has reached a stage of maturity in its evolution. GemStone touts this version as the true 'best of breed' distributed caching technology, solving scalability issues in all industries.</p><p>6 0.61872792 <a title="423-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling_Social_Ecommerce_Architecture_Case_study.html">1016 high scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling Social Ecommerce Architecture Case study</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Slashdot effect  : overwhelming unprepared sites with an avalanche of reader's clicks after being mentioned on Slashdot. Sure, we now have the "Digg effect" and other hot new stars, but Slashdot was the original. And like many stars from generations past, Slashdot plays the elder statesman's role with with class, dignity, and restraint. Yet with millions and millions of users Slashdot is still box office gold and more than keeps up with the young'ins. And with age comes the wisdom of learning how to handle all those users. Just how does Slashdot scale and what can you learn by going old school?

<p>Introduction: Hello,   I'm developing a product I thought of.   As a part of it, I'm trying to figure out the best architecture for the product.     It's a server application, what is supposed to serve A LOT of users at a time.   Think of an IM application, but not web style, more like ICQ\MSN applications... With web orientation.     I've read all about Meebo, Facebook Chat & etc architectures.   But I'm still not sure where to start on ICQ style (this is the first phase before I go totally web).     Can you direct me to some information on load balancing 10 million users? ;-)   I just don't know here to begin...     Thanks,   Amit</p><p>4 0.94949907 <a title="423-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-31-Performance_in_the_Cloud%3A_Business_Jitter_is_Bad.html">1184 high scalability-2012-01-31-Performance in the Cloud: Business Jitter is Bad</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One  of the benefits of web applications is that they are generally  transported via TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol designed to  assure delivery. TCP has a variety of native mechanisms through which  delivery issues can be addressed – from window sizes to selective acks  to idle time specification to ramp up parameters. All these technical  knobs and buttons serve as a way for operators and administrators to  tweak the protocol, often at run time, to ensure the exchange of  requests and responses upon which web applications rely. This is unlike  UDP, which is more of a “fire and forget” protocol in which the server  doesn’t really care if you receive the data or not.
 
Now, voice  and streaming video and audio over the web has always leveraged UDP and  thus it has always been highly sensitive to jitter. Jitter is, without  getting into layer one (physical) jargon, an undesirable delay in the  otherwise consistent delivery of packets. It causes the delay of and  sometimes</p><p>same-blog 5 0.94548035 <a title="423-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-19-Alternatives_to_Google_App_Engine.html">423 high scalability-2008-10-19-Alternatives to Google App Engine</a></p>

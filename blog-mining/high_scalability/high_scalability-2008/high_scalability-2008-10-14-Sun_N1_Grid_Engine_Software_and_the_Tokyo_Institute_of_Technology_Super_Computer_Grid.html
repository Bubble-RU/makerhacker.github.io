<p>Introduction: This Sun BluePrint article describes the storage architecture of the Tokyo
Institute of Technology TSUBAME grid. The Tokyo Institute of Technology is of
the world's leading technical institutes, and recently created the fastest
supercomputer in Asia, and one of the largest supercomputers outside of the
United States. By deploying Sun Fire x64 servers and data servers in a grid
architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective and flexible supercomputer
consisting of hundreds of systems, thousands of processors, terabytes of
memory and a petabyte of storage that supports users running common off-the-

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes

Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are

<p>Introduction: TheSun Grid Compute Utilityis a simple to use, simple to access data center-
on-demand. Sun Grid delivers enterprise computing power and resources over the
Internet, enabling developers, researchers, scientists and businesses to
optimize performance, speed time to results, and accelerate innovation without
investment in IT infrastructure. No matter the size of your business or the
size of your job -- there is no barrier to entry and exit. This is the future
of computing available today: IT as a service.</p><p>6 0.16971128 <a title="412-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-25-Is_your_cloud_as_scalable_as_you_think_it_is%3F.html">395 high scalability-2008-09-25-Is your cloud as scalable as you think it is?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of
Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of
the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data
servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective,
flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute and data-intensive
applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of
systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory,
and delivers 47.38 trillion floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS)
of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to
users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment
architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future.This

<p>Introduction: Shanti Braforddetails how his Ruby on Railsbased website survived a 24 hour
550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup
details, so there's not much I can add.Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web
server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR,
nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved
performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of
the performance boost.Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a
very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>6 0.76987678 <a title="412-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-20-Alternate_strategy_for_database_sharding.html">546 high scalability-2009-03-20-Alternate strategy for database sharding</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: Jumping around the social mediasphere, it's not uncommon to feel the heat
generated in praise of a favorite this or that over all the clearly inferior
alternatives. Whilst human nature may never cool, I think Old Will had some
insight worth considering the next time a flame threatens to flicker forth:My
mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun (Sonnet 130)My mistress' eyes are
nothing like the sun;Coral is far more red than her lips' red ;If snow be
white, why then her breasts are dun;If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her
head.I have seen roses damask, red and white,But no such roses see I in her
cheeks;And in some perfumes is there more delightThan in the breath that from
my mistress reeks.I love to hear her speak, yet well I knowThat music hath a
far more pleasing sound;I grant I never saw a goddess go;My mistress, when she
walks, treads on the ground:And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rareAs any
she belied with false compare.-William Shakespeare</p><p>6 0.67108804 <a title="213-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-26-Paper%3A_Scalability_by_Design_-_Coding_for_Systems_With_Large_CPU_Counts.html">502 high scalability-2009-01-26-Paper: Scalability by Design - Coding for Systems With Large CPU Counts</a></p>

<p>Introduction: SmugMug's CEO & Chief Geek Don MacAskill smugly (hard to resist) gushes over
finally finding, after a long and arduous quest, their "best bang-for-the-buck
storage array." It's theDell MD300. His in-depth explanation of why he prefers
the MD3000 should help anyone with their own painful storage deliberations.
His key points are:breakThe price is right; DAS via SAS, 15 spindles at 15K
rpm each, 512MB of mirrored battery-backed write cache; You can disable read
caching; You can disable read-ahead prefetching; The stripe sizes are
configurable up to 512KB; The controller ignores host-based flush commands by
default; They support an ‘Enhanced JBOD’ mode.His reasoning for the
desirability each option is astute and he even gives you the configuration
options for carrying out the configuration. This is not your average CEO.Don
also speculates that a three tier system using flash (system RAM + flash
storage + RAID disks) is a possible future direction. Unfortunately, flash may
not be the dream</p><p>2 0.88483608 <a title="213-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-10-Paper%3A_Consensus_Protocols%3A_Paxos___.html">529 high scalability-2009-03-10-Paper: Consensus Protocols: Paxos   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Barbara Liskov's Turing Award, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance.Henry
Robinson has created an excellent series of articles on consensus protocols.
We already covered his2 Phase Commitarticle and he also has a3 Phase
Commitarticle showing how to handle 2PC under single node failures.But that is
not enough! 3PC works well under node failures, but fails for network
failures. So another consensus mechanism is needed that handles both network
and node failures. And that'sPaxos.Paxos correctly handles both types of
failures, but it does this by becoming inaccessible if too many components
fail. This is the "liveness" property of protocols. Paxos waits until the
faults are fixed. Read queries can be handled, but updates will be blocked
until the protocol thinks it can make forward progress.The liveness of Paxos
is primarily dependent on network stability. In a distributed heterogeneous
environment you are at risk of losing the ability to make updates. Users hate
that.breakSo when compani</p><p>same-blog 3 0.87433565 <a title="213-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-15-Does_Sun_Buying_MySQL_Change_Your_Scaling_Strategy%3F.html">213 high scalability-2008-01-15-Does Sun Buying MySQL Change Your Scaling Strategy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sun is buying MySQL for $1 billion. The MySQL team has worked long and hard so
I don't begrudge them their pay day. Strike while the iron is offering a lot
of cash I say. And I have nothing against Sun. Yet I can't help but think this
changes the mental calculation of what database to use. When Oracle acquired
Innobase a new independent storage engine was needed for MySQL. How is this
different? Does this change your thinking any? Would Martha say it's a good
thing? Like Luke I've searched my feelings, but the force is not with me and I
don't really know how I feel about it.</p><p>4 0.86679053 <a title="213-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-20-PaxosLease%3A_Diskless_Paxos_for_Leases.html">710 high scalability-2009-09-20-PaxosLease: Diskless Paxos for Leases</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It looks like I'll have the chance to interview someone tomorrow from
Justin.tv about their architecture, which is pretty exciting given their
leadership role in live broadcasting. They get 30 million uniques a month, can
handle 1 million simultaneous broadcasts and hope to grow another magnitude in
the near future. That must take some doing.Here's your opportunity, especially
if you think my questions suck, to ask your own sucky questions :-) What would
you like to know about Justin.tv?</p><p>6 0.83366877 <a title="213-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-31-Scalable_federated_security_with_Kerberos_.html">832 high scalability-2010-05-31-Scalable federated security with Kerberos </a></p>

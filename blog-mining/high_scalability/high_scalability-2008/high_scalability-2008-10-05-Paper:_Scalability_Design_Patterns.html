<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>3 0.19304737 <a title="402-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-30-Scaling_Out_MySQL.html">292 high scalability-2008-03-30-Scaling Out MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post covers two main options for scaling-out MySql and compare between
them. The first is based on data-base clustering and the second is based on In
Memory clustering a.k.a Data Grid. A special emphasis is given to a pattern
which shows how to scale our existing data base without changing it through a
combination of Data Grid and data base as a background service. This pattern
is referred to as Persistency as a Service (PaaS). It also address many of the
fequently asked question related to how performance, reliability and
scalability is achieved with this pattern.</p><p>4 0.11919566 <a title="402-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-14-Designing_a_Scalable_Twitter.html">568 high scalability-2009-04-14-Designing a Scalable Twitter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There were many talks recently about twitter scalability and their specific
choice of language such as Scala to address their existing Ruby based
scalability. In this post i tried to provide a more methodical approach for
handling twitter scalability challenges that is centered around the right
choice of architecture patterns rather then the language itself.The
architecture pattern are given in a generic fashion that is not specific to
twitter itself and can serve anyone who is looking to build a scalable real
time web application in the near future.</p><p>5 0.072518274 <a title="402-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-Google_App_Engine_-_what_about_existing_applications%3F.html">305 high scalability-2008-04-21-Google App Engine - what about existing applications?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently, Google announced Google App Engine, another announcement in the
rapidly growing world of cloud computing. This brings up some very serious
questions:1. If we want to take advantage of one of the clouds, are we doomed
to be locked-in for life?2. Must we re-write our existing applications to use
the cloud?3. Do we need to learn a brand new technology or language for the
cloud?This post presents a pattern that will enable us to abstract our
application code from the underlying cloud provider infrastructure. This will
enable us to easily migrate our EXISTING applications to cloud based
environment thus avoiding the need for a complete re-write.</p><p>6 0.066895463 <a title="402-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-22-Incremental_deployment.html">754 high scalability-2009-12-22-Incremental deployment</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Space-based architectures are an alternative to the traditional n-tier model
for enterprise applications. Instead of a vertical tier partitioning, space
based applications are partitioned horizontally into self-sufficient units.
This leads to almost linear scalability of stateful, high-performance
applications.This is arecording of a talk I did last monthwhere I introduce
space based programming and demonstrate how that works in practice on the .NET
platform using Oracle Coherence and GigaSpaces.</p><p>5 0.64743847 <a title="402-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-Twitter_as_a_scalability_case_study.html">323 high scalability-2008-05-19-Twitter as a scalability case study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot has been said already about Twitter's scalability issues. Many have
given Twitter as an anti-pattern of how not to deal with scalability and have
suggested different solutions for scaling it. As Twitter is famously a Ruby-
on-Rails deployment, this case has also been used as a weapon in the
language/platform wars between the RoR and Java camps, and to a lesser degree,
also with the LAMP (PHP) camp</p><p>6 0.64710861 <a title="402-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-01-Art_of_scalability_%281%29_-_Scalability_principles.html">552 high scalability-2009-04-01-Art of scalability (1) - Scalability principles</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>4 0.74792451 <a title="402-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-06-Paper%3A_Memory_Barriers%3A_a_Hardware_View_for_Software_Hackers.html">1471 high scalability-2013-06-06-Paper: Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's not often you get so enthusiastic a recommendation for a paper as Sergio
Bossa gives Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers: If you only
want to read one piece about CPUs architecture, cache coherency and memory
barriers, make it this one.It is a clear and well written article. It even has
a quiz. What's it about?So what possessed CPU designers to cause them to
inﬂict memory barriers on poor unsuspecting SMP software designers?In short,
because reordering memory references allows much better performance, and so
memory barriers are needed to force ordering in things like synchronization
primitives whose correct operation depends on ordered memory
references.Getting a more detailed answer to this question requires a good
understanding of how CPU caches work, and especially what is required to make
caches really work well. The following sections:present the structure of a
cache,describe how cache-coherency protocols ensure that CPUs agree on the
value of each location</p><p>5 0.73227 <a title="402-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-17-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_17%2C_2010.html">860 high scalability-2010-07-17-Hot Scalability Links for July 17, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: And by hot I also mean temperature. Summer has arrived. It's sizzling here in
Silicon Valley. Thank you air conditioning!Scale the web by appointing a
Crawler Czar? Tom Foremski has the idea thatGoogle should open up their
indexso sites wouldn't have to endure the constant pounding by ravenous
crawler bots. Don MacAskill of SmugMug estimates50% of our web server CPU
resourcesare spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work
with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but
does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data
over and over again?Tweets of Gold:jamesurquhart:Key to applications is
architecture. Key for infrastructure supporting archs is configurability.

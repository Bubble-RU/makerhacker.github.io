<p>Introduction: Art of Distributed   Part 1: Rethinking about distributed computing models  
I â&euro;&tilde;m getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability, and distributed storage systems.   Download the article in PDF format.   Download the article in MS Word format.   I wait for your comments, and questions, and I will answer it in part two.</p><p>4 0.1540271 <a title="362-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-24-Great_Introductory_Video_on_Scalability_from_Harvard_Computer_Science.html">948 high scalability-2010-11-24-Great Introductory Video on Scalability from Harvard Computer Science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Professor  David Malan  gives a very good lecture on scalability for dynamic websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high availability.
    
 Watch it on  Academic Earth 

  
This is one lecture in a series of 13 lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to:  build dynamic websites  with  Ajax  and with  Linux ,  Apache ,  MySQL , and  PHP  ( LAMP ); set up  domain names  with  DNS ;  structure pages  with  XHTML  and  CSS  how to  program  in  JavaScript  and  PHP ;  configure Apache and  MySQL ; design and  query databases  with  SQL ; use  Ajax  with both  XML  and JSON ;</p><p>5 0.12445892 <a title="362-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-04-Paper%3A_MapReduce%3A_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters.html">483 high scalability-2009-01-04-Paper: MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   MapReduce and PageRank Notes from Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau's Fall 2008 class  . Collects interesting facts about MapReduce and PageRank. For example, the history of the solution to searching for the term "flu" is traced through multiple generations of technology.   With Google entering the cloud space with  Google AppEngine  and a maturing  Hadoop  product, the MapReduce scaling approach might finally become a standard programmer practice. This is the best paper on the subject and is an excellent primer on a content-addressable memory future.  Some interesting stats from the paper: Google executes 100k MapReduce jobs each day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.  One common criticism ex-Googlers have is that it takes months to get up and be productive in the Google environment. Hopefully a way will be found to lower the learning curve a</p><p>6 0.11352886 <a title="362-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Useful_Cloud_Computing_Blogs.html">445 high scalability-2008-11-14-Useful Cloud Computing Blogs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The recent Data-Intensive Computing Symposium brought together experts in system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific applications, and information-based applications to better understand existing capabilities in the development and application of large-scale computing systems, and to explore future opportunities.     Google Fellow Jeff Dean had a very interesting presentation on Handling Large Datasets at Google: Current Systems and Future Directions. He discussed:     • Hardware infrastructure    • Distributed systems infrastructure:    –Scheduling system    –GFS    –BigTable    –MapReduce    • Challenges and Future Directions    –Infrastructure that spans all datacenters    –More automation     It is really like a "How does Google work" presentation in ~60 slides?

<p>Introduction: Vaibhav Puranik  in  Web  serving in the cloud – our experiences with nginx and instance sizes  describes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types. The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference was interesting:
  
 In the long term they will save money using the larger instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes, which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save money even though they are more expensive. Starting new instances also tak</p><p>3 0.73212999 <a title="362-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-05-Paper%3A_MillWheel%3A_Fault-Tolerant_Stream_Processing_at_Internet_Scale.html">1512 high scalability-2013-09-05-Paper: MillWheel: Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ever wonder what powers Google's world spirit sensing  Zeitgeist service ? No, it's not a homunculus of  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel  sitting in each browser. It's actually a stream processing (think streaming MapReduce on steroids) system called MillWheel, described in this very well written paper:  MillWheel: Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale . MillWheel isn't just used for Zeitgeist at Google, it's also used for streaming joins for a variety of Ads customers, generalized anomaly-detection service, and network switch and cluster health monitoring.
 
Abstract:
  MillWheel is a framework for building low-latency data-processing applications that is widely used at Google. Users specify a directed computation graph and application code for individual nodes, and the system manages persistent state and the continuous ﬂow of records, all within the envelope of the framework’s fault-tolerance guarantees.

 


This paper describes MillWheel’s programming model as well as it</p><p>4 0.66635823 <a title="362-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-10-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_10%2C_2013.html">1455 high scalability-2013-05-10-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 10, 2013</a></p>

</p><p>11 That would be akin to running with hares and hunting with the hounds. [sent-17, score-0.145]

<p>Introduction: Update:A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview withGoogle engineer Max Ross on
Hibernate Shards. Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how
it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in
the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to
Google AppEngine (not much).To scale you are supposed to partition your data.
Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all
the details it's not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate
shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for
horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the
shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core
group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although
there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff
in the right way and it's very much worth looking at, especially if you use

<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from
scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.Hibernate Shards
is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by
adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.Hibernate
Shardskey features:Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards
allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love:
SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use
Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards.Flexible sharding
strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of
the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific
logic.Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going
to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one
of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your

<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good
SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and
make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was
written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in A day in the life of a slow page
at Stack Overflow, where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was
possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for
other pages the improvement was 100x.Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of
his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the
tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:Using theirmini-
profiler it was shown that abadge detail pagewas taking 630.3 ms to load,
298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL
queries for the page and how long each took.From the historical logs, which
are stored inHAProxy on a month-by-month basis, Sam was able to determine this

an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

<p>Introduction: This post is byHasan Ceylan, an Open Source software enthusiast from
Istanbul.I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together
with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I
contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.Those were the days
our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and
applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot
of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we
can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml
descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to
use the curse called "XDoclet".On the other side, our company grew steadily,
our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and
ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew
considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of
money.

<p>Introduction: Hi,I am very glad that this site exists, as I have learned more about
clustering on this site than for quite some time reading stuff elsewhere.
Oftentimes, one can find lots of material about clustering, but the practical
real-life information is missing. Not so wih this site.I am currently planning
the development of an application which has a lot of enterprise features and
requirements. On the other side (if the tiny chance of success might strike
us), this application would not be an in-house application of a financial
institution, or something like that, but some kind of communit/web 2.0 web
site. Thus it is an enterprise application with (hopefully, but surely
unlikely) the user numbers of a social networking site. Each user initiated
transaction involves huge resssources business logic wise (including insane
amounts of encryption oprations).Of course, I do not intend to induldge into
premature scaling, but to invest every minute I have into the implementation

<p>Introduction: Searching around the HS website I noticed that there are no articles regarding
db2, which has an express edition, free of charge and from what I know there
aren't any restrictions.Being a powerful database system I thought it could
make be an alternative to MySQL, PostgreSQL databases.Here is the IBM
statement:"DB2 Express Edition for Community (DB2 Express-C) is a no charge
data server for use in development and deployment. DB2 Express-C supports a
full range of APIs, drivers, and interfaces for application development
including PHP, C/C++, and .NET. In addition, DB2 Express-C V9 contains
advanced XML features. DB2 Express-C provides ISVs an ideal starting database
server for Web, enterprise, and eBusiness applications.This IBM Redbook
provides fundamentals of DB2 application development with DB2 Express-C. It

<p>Introduction: Let me begin by saying that I have used and continue to use various ORM
frameworks such as hibernate, ibatis, propel and activerecord in applications
and websites that have a user base ranging from a couple hundred to 500k
users. Especially for projects that have to be up and running in a short
duration of time, ORM frameworks significantly reduce the effort required to
manipulate and persist OOP objects by providing time saving facilities such as
automatically generated model objects, integrated unit testing, secure
variable substitution, etc. Hibernate even supports horizontal data
partitioning via Hibernate Shards.However, the lay of the land is
significantly different in the rarefied space occupied by applications needing
to support millions of users. Profiling an application at this level and
paying particular attention to the operations needed to move data to and from
the database, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the operations
are API related, whereby the ORM fr</p><p>2 0.92464346 <a title="235-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-02-Product%3A_Supervisor_-__Monitor_and_Control_Your_Processes.html">295 high scalability-2008-04-02-Product: Supervisor -  Monitor and Control Your Processes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a sad fact of life, but processes die. I know, it's horrible. You start
them, send them out into process space, and hope for the best. Yet sometimes,
despite your best coding, they core dump, seg fault, or some other calamity
befalls them. Unlike our messy biological world so cruelly ruled by entropy,
in the digital world processes can be given another chance. They can be
restarted. A greater destiny awaits. And hopefully this time the random
lottery of unforeseen killing factors will be avoided and a long productive
life will be had by all.This is fun code to write because it's a lot more
complicated than you might think. And restarting processes is a highly
effective high availability strategy. Most faults are transient, caused by an
unexpected series of events. Rather than taking drastic action, like taking a
node out of production or failing over, transients can be effectively masked
by simply restarting failed processes. Though complexity makes it a fun
problem, it's also why</p><p>3 0.91935366 <a title="235-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN_is_Not_a_Silver_Bullet_for_Network_Scalability.html">1256 high scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN is Not a Silver Bullet for Network Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak(CCIE#1354 Emeritus) is Chief Technology Advisor atNIL Data
Communications,author of numerous webinarsandadvanced networking books, and
aprolific blogger. He's focusing on data center and cloud networking, network
virtualization, and scalable application design.OpenFlow is an interesting
emerging networking technology appearingseemingly out of nowhere with much
hype and fanfarein March 2011. More than a year later, there are two
commercial products based on OpenFlow (NEC's Programmable FlowandNicira's
Network Virtualization Platform) and probably less than a dozen production-
grade implementations (includingGoogle's G-Scale networkandIndiana
University's campus network). Is this an expected result for an emerging
technology or another case of overhyped technology hitting limits imposed by
reality?OpenFlow-based solutions have to overcome numerous problems every
emerging technology is facing, in OpenFlow's case ranging from compatibility

<p>Introduction: Like many other media content providers, libraries and museums are
increasingly moving their content onto the Web.  While the move itself is no
easy process (with digitization, web development, and training costs), being
able to successfully deliver content to a wide audience is an ongoing concern,
particularly for large libraries.Much of the concern is financial, as most
libraries do not have the internal budget or outside investors that for-profit
businesses enjoy.  Even large university libraries will face serious budget
constraints that even other university departments, such as science and
technology would not face.Creating a scalable infrastructure and also
distributing a large digital collection that can handle multiple requests,
requires planning that many librarians have not even imagined.  They must stop
thinking in terms of "one-item-per-customer" and start thinking in terms of
numerous users accessing the same information simultaneously.Content Delivery

<p>Introduction: Limelight says 95% of Mobile Video Views Take Place in First 90 Days and 88.8
percent of views take place in the first 30 days.Since a lot of people are
working with video, which is expensive to store and serve, the implication:
there's little need to keep your video close to the user or on a CDN after 30
days.</p><p>3 0.17576584 <a title="294-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-04-Alternative_Memcache_Usage%3A_A_Highly_Scalable%2C_Highly_Available%2C_In-Memory_Shard_Index.html">482 high scalability-2009-01-04-Alternative Memcache Usage: A Highly Scalable, Highly Available, In-Memory Shard Index</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While working with Memcache the other night, it dawned on me that it’s usage
as a distributed caching mechanism was really just one of many ways to use it.
That there are in fact many alternative usages that one could find for
Memcache if they could just realize what Memcache really is at its core – a
simple distributed hash-table – is an important point worthy of further
discussion.To be clear, when I say “simple”, by no means am I implying that
Memcache’s implementation is simple, just that the ideas behind it are such.
Think about that for a minute. What else could we use a simple distributed
hash-table for, besides caching? How about using it as an alternative to the
traditional shard lookup method we used in our Master Index Lookup scalability
strategy, discussed previously here.</p><p>4 0.15584077 <a title="294-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-16-Justin.tv%27s_Live_Video_Broadcasting_Architecture.html">796 high scalability-2010-03-16-Justin.tv's Live Video Broadcasting Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like?
Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing.
Specifically the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group(IPNSIG
).Ansible-likefaster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical
warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning
telegraph system.It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more
interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that
was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances
and with muchlonger delays:The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also
called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a
set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2]
Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances,
so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to
large delays and errors.[2] While the In</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9661476 <a title="294-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-01-How_to_update_video_views_count_effectively%3F.html">294 high scalability-2008-04-01-How to update video views count effectively?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I am building a video-sharing site and I'm looking for an efficient way to
update video views count.The easiest way would be to perform an SQL update to
increase the "views" counter every time a video is viewed, but naturally I
want to avoid DB write access as much as possible.I am looking for an
efficient temporary storage to which I could connect and say "increment views
of video X". Every so often I would save the changes to my main database, and
remove the counter from this temporary storage.I am having a hard time finding
such temporary storage, however. My first thought was memcache, but it's not
ideal as I wouldn't like to lose the data if memcache goes down. Also,
memcache's increment command requires that the key is already present - that
means that every time a video is viewed, I would have to check if the key
already exists in memcache, before I can actually send the increment
command.What do people use to solve this kind of issues?Kind regards,Tomasz</p><p>3 0.95021719 <a title="294-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL_and_Memcached%3A_End_of_an_Era%3F.html">785 high scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL and Memcached: End of an Era?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you look at the early days of this blog, when web scalability was still in
its heady bloom of youth, many of the articles had to do with
leveragingMySQLandmemcached. Exciting times. Shard MySQL to handle high write
loads, cache objects in memcached to handle high read loads, and then write a
lot of glue code to make it all work together. That was state of the art, that
was how it was done. The architecture of many major sites still follow this
pattern today, largely because with enough elbow grease, it works.This was a
pre-cloud, relational database dominated world, built from parts scrounged
from the remnants of enterprises and datacenters past.TwitterandDiggstarted in
this era, but are evolving into something different, as scaling pressures
increase and new purpose built technologies pop into being.With a little
perspective, it's clear the MySQL+memcached era is passing. It will stick
around for a while. Old technologies seldom fade away completely. Some still
ride horses. Some st</p><p>4 0.94240451 <a title="294-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-11-The_interactive_cloud.html">702 high scalability-2009-09-11-The interactive cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How many times have you been called in the middle of the night by your
operation guys telling you that your application throws some odd red alerts?
How many times did you found out that when those issues happens you don't have
enough information to analyze this incident? have you tried to increase the
log level just to find out that your problem became even worse - now your
application throws tons of information in a continues basis most of which is
complete garbage...The current separation between the way we implement our
application and the way we manage it leads to many of this ridicules
situations. Cloud makes those things even worse.Inthis posti suggest an
alternative approach. Why don't we run our application the way we run our
business? I refer to this approach as the "interactive cloud" where our
application behaves just like our project team and the operations just like
our managers. As with our business our application would need to take more
responsibility to the way it runs</p><p>5 0.93895882 <a title="294-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-01-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_1%2C_2012.html">1255 high scalability-2012-06-01-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 1, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post covers two main options for scaling-out MySql and compare between them. The first is based on data-base clustering and the second is based on In Memory clustering a.k.a Data Grid. A special emphasis is given to a pattern which shows how to scale our existing data base without changing it through a combination of Data Grid and data base as a background service. This pattern is referred to as Persistency as a Service (PaaS).  It also address many of the fequently asked question related to how performance, reliability and scalability is achieved with this pattern.</p><p>4 0.19655769 <a title="400-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-15-The_Common_Principles_Behind_the_NOSQL_Alternatives.html">749 high scalability-2009-12-15-The Common Principles Behind the NOSQL Alternatives</a></p>

The “ High Scalability ” blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not disappoint with a post  highlighting a set of scalability design patterns  that was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on “ 6 Ways to Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way. ”

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a “silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring situation.</p><p>4 0.68904734 <a title="400-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-22-Improving_performance_and_scalability_with_DDD.html">635 high scalability-2009-06-22-Improving performance and scalability with DDD</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Distributed systems are not typically a place domain driven design is applied. Distributed processing projects often start with an overall architecture vision and the idea about a processing model which basically drives the whole thing, including object design if it exists at all. Elaborate object designs are thought of as something that just gets in the way of distribution and performance, so the idea of spending time to apply DDD principles gets rejected in favour of raw throughput and processing power. However, from my experience, some more advanced DDD concepts can significantly improve the performance, scalability and throughput of distributed systems when applied correctly.

<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper:  Pursue robust indefinite scalability , wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural networks, starting from scratch.
 
What is this strange thing called  indefinite scalability ? They sound like words that don't really go together:
  

Indefinite scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-engineered.


Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to program</p><p>6 0.66494745 <a title="400-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-30-NoCAP_%E2%80%93_Part_III_%E2%80%93_GigaSpaces_clustering_explained...html">950 high scalability-2010-11-30-NoCAP – Part III – GigaSpaces clustering explained..</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Forrester released their new wave report:  T he Forrester Wave™: Elastic Caching Platforms, Q2 2010  where they listed GigaSpaces, IBM, Oracle, and Terracotta as leading vendors in the field. In this post I'd like to take some time to explain what some of these terms mean, and why they’re important to you. I’ll start with a definition of Elastic Data Grid (Elastic Caching), how it is different then other caching and NoSQL alternatives, and more importantly -- I'll illustrate how it works through some real code examples.

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see how!     Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed in a format called   Alexandrian form which draws on constructs used by Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:     The pattern name   The problem the pattern is trying to solve     Context   Solution   Examples   Design rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why experts use it       Patterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context, and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next ‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied.

 memcached, repcached, coherence, infinispan, eXtreme scale, jboss cache, velocity, terracoqa 
 
 
  key‐value‐store    
 
 keyspace, flare, schema‐free, RAMCloud 
 
 
 eventually‐consistent key‐value‐store    
 
 dynamo, voldemort, Dynomite, SubRecord, Mo8onDb, Dovetaildb 
 
 
 ordered‐key‐value‐store    
 
 tokyo tyrant, lightcloud, NMDB, luxio, memcachedb, actord

<p>Introduction: Nobody came up with an example of a website powered by a Websphere product (which has a community edition) and backed up by a DB2 database.     I guess you all know about usopen.org so here's the story:       While the re-emergence of 35-year-old Andre Agassi and the continued dominance of wunderkind Maria Sharapova have highlighted the on-court headlines at this year's U.S. Open Tennis Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., IBM is hoping its new Power5 chip-based IT support for USOpen.org can make news among those more interested in .NET than tennis nets.     Big Blue has partnered with the U.S. Tennis Association and the U.S. Open -- the most prestigious tennis tournament in the U.S. -- since 1992. Together, they launched USOpen.org in 1995 so racket heads could follow the matches online.     The iSeries' role this year is in powering a Web-based end-user application called "Point Tracker," a graphics tool using autonomic technology that recreates the trajectory of every shot.

<p>Introduction: In many posts, such as:  The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges  I mentioned that synchronization the access to the shared resource is the major challenge to write parallel code.
 
The synchronization and coordination take long time from the overall execution time, which reduce the benefits of the parallelism; the synchronization and coordination also reduce the scalability.
 
There are many forms of synchronization and coordination, such as:
  
 Create Task object in frameworks such as: Microsoft TPL, Intel TDD, and Parallel Runtime Library. Create and enqueue task objects require synchronization that it’s takes long time especially if we create it into recursive work such as: Quick Sort algorithm. 
 Synchronization the access to shared data. 
  
But there are a few techniques to avoid these issues, such as: Shared-Nothing, Actor Model, and Hyper Object (A.K.A. Combinable Object). Simply if we reduce the shared data by re-architect our code this will gives us a huge benefits</p><p>6 0.7211116 <a title="400-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-24-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_24%2C_2012.html">1311 high scalability-2012-08-24-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 24, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle
traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch
or other very popular websites frontpage).Regular hosting companies
(especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get
crushed under the load in short time.But there is hope. A new breed of hosting
companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability
you need at a fraction of the cost.Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!”
(or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same
thing).Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting
companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of
them).Read the entire article aboutCloud computing, grid computing, utility

<p>Introduction: Art of DistributedPart 1: Rethinking about distributed computing modelsI 'm
getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially
distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can
MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other
technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our
situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two
parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the
difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability,
and distributed storage systems.Download the article in PDF format.Download
the article in MS Word format.I wait for your comments, and questions, and I
will answer it in part two.</p><p>5 0.18615246 <a title="325-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-21-Eucalyptus__-__Build_Your_Own_Private_EC2_Cloud.html">355 high scalability-2008-07-21-Eucalyptus  -  Build Your Own Private EC2 Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:Now that we have a new computing paradigm,
Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data
vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds?
Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space,
and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still
seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids
versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are
a number of issues driving this uncertainty.read more at:BigDataMatters.com</p><p>4 0.8977797 <a title="325-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-21-Eucalyptus__-__Build_Your_Own_Private_EC2_Cloud.html">355 high scalability-2008-07-21-Eucalyptus  -  Build Your Own Private EC2 Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Garry Tan, cofounder of Posterous, lists 12 lessons for scaling that apply to
more than just Rails.Use cloud storage for static files.Use HTTP Cache Control
to tell the browser what it can cache.Use Sphinx for text search.Use InnoDB
for more crash resistant and faster writes.Don't use textbook Rails
ActiveRecord objects. Use New Relic to find exactly what is slow in your
system.Use memcache later so you find your database bottlenecks now.Use
mongrel proctitle to find your slow queries. You are only as fast as your
slowest queries.Use asynchronous job queuing to do work in parallel.Use
monitoring so you'll know when your site went down and why.Learn by reading
the source code, fixing problems, and submitting them back to the
community.Use new plugins. Old plugins can't be trusted.Use new information.
Old information can't be trusted.</p><p>2 0.88965023 <a title="325-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad_Architecture.html">68 high scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TypePad is considered the largest paid blogging service in the world. After
experience problems because of their meteoric growth, they eventually
transitioned to an architecture patterned after their sister company,
LiveJournal.Site: http://www.typepad.com/The
PlatformMySQLMemcachedPerlMogileFSApacheLinuxThe StatsAs of 2005 TypePad sends
250mbps of traffic using multiple network pipes for 3TB of traffic a day. They
were growing by 10-20% each month. I was unable to find more recent
statistics.The ArchitectureOriginal Architecture:- Single server running
Linux, Apache, Postgres, Perl, mod_perl- Storage was NFS on a filer.A
Devastating Crash Caused a New Direction- A RAID controller failed and spewed
data across all RAID disks.- The database was corrupted and the backups were
corrupted.- Their redundant filers suffered from "split brain" syndrome.They

<p>Introduction: This paper is a great overview of different lightweight web servers. A lot of
websites use lightweight web servers to serve images and static content.
YouTube is one example:YouTube Architecture.breakSo if you need to improve
performance consider changing over a different web server for some types of
content.Overview:Recent years have enjoyed a florescence of interesting
implementations of Web servers, including lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel,
among others. These Web servers boast different combinations of performance,
ease of administration, portability, security, and related values. The
following engineering study surveys the field of lightweight Web servers to
help you find one likely to meet the technical requirements of your next
project."Lightweight" Web servers like lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel can
offer dramatic benefits for your projects. This article surveys the
possibilities and shows how they apply to you.Important dimensions for
evaluation of a Web server include:Per</p><p>same-blog 4 0.88736415 <a title="325-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-25-How_do_you_explain_cloud_computing_to_your_grandma%3F.html">325 high scalability-2008-05-25-How do you explain cloud computing to your grandma?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Nice introductory New York Time's articleCloud Computing: So You
Don’t Have to Stand Still. Good example of how Animoto used RightScale and
Amazon to meet a Facebook driven demand of 25,000 test drives an hour.Update:
Peter Laird inUnderstanding the Cloud Computing/SaaS/PaaS markets: a Map of
the Players in the Industrypaints a very cool visual map of all the cloud
service players. It's a larger industry than you might think.Once upon a time
I worked at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch startup. Over a
delicious Christmas punch my grandma asked me what I did for a living that I
could afford such extravagantly inexpensive gifts. Always so subtle. I
explained I worked on an ATM switch. Mistake. She sniffed, said that's nice,
and asked me why the Automated Teller Machine ate her bank card that morning.
No matter how hard I tried I couldn't convince her I didn't work on bank ATMs.
To all future job interrogations I waxed off, protesting I do boring software
stuff that no</p><p>5 0.88162816 <a title="325-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-19-Zynga%27s_Z_Cloud_-_Scale_Fast_or_Fail_Fast_by_Merging_Private_and_Public_Clouds.html">1044 high scalability-2011-05-19-Zynga's Z Cloud - Scale Fast or Fail Fast by Merging Private and Public Clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Release early and often. A/B testing. Creating a landing page and buying ads
on AdSense. All are ways of providing quick feedback in order to validate an
idea. If you are like Zynga, with 250 million active users a month, how do you
cost effectively prove out a game that could flop or get 90 million users
(like CityVille) in an instant?Zynga handles this problem inlle an innovative
way, by inverting the typical cloud burst scenario that has excess traffic
flowing from a datacenter to a cloud, to having a game start in the cloud and
then moving to the datacenter once the game has proved popular enough to
keep.This process is nicely described by Charles Babcock in Lessons From
FarmVille: How Zynga Uses The Cloud, in an interview with Allan Leinwand, CTO
of infrastructure engineering at Zynga.When paired down to its essence,
Zynga's strategy goes something like this:Games are risky.  Even with all
their experience, Zynga can't know how many people will play a game or how
fast the adoption</p><p>6 0.86239791 <a title="325-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-21-Product%3A_Hyperic.html">219 high scalability-2008-01-21-Product: Hyperic</a></p>

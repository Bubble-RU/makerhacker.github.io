<p>Introduction: An unstated assumption is that clouds are scalable. But are they? Stick
thousands upon thousands of machines together and there are a lot of potential
bottlenecks just waiting to choke off your scalability supply. And if the
cloud is scalable what are the chances that your application is really
linearly scalable? At 10 machines all may be well. Even at 50 machines the
seas look calm. But at 100, 200, or 500 machines all hell might break loose.
How do you know?You know through real life testing. These kinds of tests are
brutally hard and complicated. who wants to do all the incredibly precise and
difficult work of producing cloud scalability tests?GridDynamicshas stepped up
to the challenge and has just released theirCloud Performance Reports.The
report is quite detailed so I'll just cover what I found most interesting.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of
Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of
the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data
servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective,
flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute- and data-intensive
applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of
systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory,
and delivers 47.38 trillion1 floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS)
of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to
users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment
architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future. This
Sun BluePrints article provides an overview of the Tokyo Tech grid, named
TSUBAME. The third in a series of Sun BluePrints articles on the TSUBAME grid,

<p>Introduction: SummaryIn this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing
stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services
application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out
model.BioNati Shalom is the CTO and Founder ofGigaSpacesand responsible for
the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed
technology and architecture namely CORBA, Jini, J2EE, Grid and SOA. Nati is

<p>Introduction: GridGainwas kind enough to present at the September 17th instance of
theSilicon Valley Cloud Computing Group. I've been curious about GridGain so I
was glad to see them there. In short GridGain is:an open source computational
grid framework that enables Java developers to improve general performance of
processing intensive applications by splitting and parallelizing the workload.
GridGain can also be thought of as a set of middleware primitives for building
applications. GridGain's peer group of competitors includes GigaSpaces,
Terracotta, Coherence, and Hadoop.The speaker for GridGain was the President
and Founder, Nikita Ivanov. He has a very pleasant down-to-earth way about him
that contrasts nicely with a field given to religious discussions of complex
taxomic definitions. Nikita first talked about cloud computing in general. He
feels Java is the perfect gateway for cloud computing. Which is good
becauseGridGain only works with Java. The Java centricity of GridGain may be

<p>Introduction: Update::Eucalyptus Goes Commercial with $5.5M Funding Round. This removes my
objection that it's an academic project only. Go team go!Rich Wolski,
professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
gave a spirited talk onEucalyptusto a large group of very interested
cloudsters at theEucalyptus Cloud Meetup. If Rich could teach computer science
at every school the state of the computer science industry would be
stratospheric. Rich is dynamic, smart, passionate, and visionary. It's that
vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his
group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and
glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he
decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as
a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement
Eucalyptus and have been improving it and tracking Amazon's changes ever
since.The question I had going into t</p><p>3 0.93305963 <a title="393-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-13-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_Aug_13%2C_2010.html">880 high scalability-2010-08-13-Hot Scalability Links for Aug 13, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ezra Zygmuntowicz in a heart warming account of his4 Years at Engine Yard, has
concluded in his experience that:the true future of cloud computing for
developers is to not think about servers at all. It is now time to focus on
the Application and new levels of abstraction that allow folks to use the
computing resources in easier and easier ways. Tweets of

complicated deployment. Thankfully, there is beer.jkalucki: Twitter isn't
down, you are just using the wrong access methods...andyedinborough: I don't
mean to hate, but why would I give up performance and scalability for a
dynamic language? Honestly, I don't get it.AsitSinha: It's amazing.... to see
the absence of an understanding of how capability plays a role in

<p>Introduction: Twitter Sees Its 20 Billionth Tweet writes  Marshall Kirkpatrick of
ReadWriteWeb.Startups die for not having customers, so STOP thinking about how
to scale. Alessandro Orsi saysfocusing on the architecture and scaling
possibilities of your app for millions of users is just plain
dumb...concentrate on marketing...concentrate on user experience. Alessandro
is perfectly correct, but this isn't the year the 2000 when the default
architecture that is easy is also not scalable and when sites were built from
scratch one painful user at a time.  Today neither is tue. In the era of
social networks, where Facebook has 500 million users, successful applications
can and often do spike to millions of users seemingly overnight. And you have
to have some architecture. With today's tool-chains you don't have to choose
easy and non-scalable. There are other options. Of course, it's all pointless
without customers and that is what you need to worry about, but it's a false
choice in this era to think tha</p><p>5 0.9211272 <a title="393-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-17-Scaling_in_Games_%26_Virtual_Worlds___.html">496 high scalability-2009-01-17-Scaling in Games & Virtual Worlds   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t
be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems
Laboratories* The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds
is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the
high-tech industry.* The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome
of the evolution of these games.* Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore
the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.* The game server is used both to
discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating
(by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the
client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might
seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role
means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the
server component.* Using multiple servers is a basic mechanism for scaling th</p><p>6 0.90600747 <a title="393-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-31-Need_help_on_Site_loading_%26_database_optimization_-_URGENT.html">611 high scalability-2009-05-31-Need help on Site loading & database optimization - URGENT</a></p>

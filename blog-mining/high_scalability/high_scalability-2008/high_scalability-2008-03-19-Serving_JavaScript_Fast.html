<p>Introduction: Like many other media content providers, libraries and museums are
increasingly moving their content onto the Web.  While the move itself is no
easy process (with digitization, web development, and training costs), being
able to successfully deliver content to a wide audience is an ongoing concern,
particularly for large libraries.Much of the concern is financial, as most
libraries do not have the internal budget or outside investors that for-profit
businesses enjoy.  Even large university libraries will face serious budget
constraints that even other university departments, such as science and
technology would not face.Creating a scalable infrastructure and also
distributing a large digital collection that can handle multiple requests,
requires planning that many librarians have not even imagined.  They must stop
thinking in terms of "one-item-per-customer" and start thinking in terms of
numerous users accessing the same information simultaneously.Content Delivery

<p>Introduction: We build web applications…and there are plenty of them around. Now, if we hit
the jackpot and our application becomes very popular, traffic goes up, and our
servers are brought down by the hordes of people coming to our website. What
do we do in that situation?Of course, I am not talking here about the kind of
traffic Digg, Yahoo Buzz or other social media sites can bring to a website,
which is temporary overnight traffic, or a website which uses cloud computing
like Amazon EC2 service, MediaTemple Grid Service or Mosso Hosting Cloud
service.I am talking about traffic that consistently increases over time as
the service achieves success. Google.com, Yahoo.com, Myspace.com,
Facebook.com, Plentyoffish.com, Linkedin.com, Youtube.com and others are
examples of services which have constant high traffic.Knowing that users want
speed from their applications, these services will always use a Content
Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver that speed.What is a Content Delivery

analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what
I mean. Steve Souders, author ofHigh Performance WebsitesandYslow, hasten more

<p>Introduction: If you have a lot of static content to store and you aren't looking forward to
setting up and maintaining your own giganto SAN, maybe you can push off a lot
of the hard lifting to a CDN?Jesse Robbins at O'Reilly Radar posts that you
have a lot more options now because the number ofContent Distribution Networks
have doubled since last year. In fact, Dan Rayburn says there are now28
CDNproviders in the market. Hopefully you can find reasonable pricing at one
of them.Other than easing your burden, why might a CDN work for you? Because
it makes your site faster and customers like that. How can a CDN so
dramatically improve your site's performance?breakSteve Saunders, author
ofHigh Performance Web Sites: Essential Knowledge for Front-End Engineers, has
using a CDN has one of his "Thirteen Simple Rules for Speeding Up Your Web
Site."About CDNs Steve says:Remember that 80-90% of the end-user response time

<p>Introduction: Am I mad to consider using .Net2 and AJAX for a high-scalability application?
In case you wonder why, it's the legacy of a website built on IIS and .Net
1.1, and we're looking for ways to make the content more attractive and
interactive. In this case, it's a medical image library being shared by a few
Wikis and online coursework for medicalstudents ( < 15K users) and doctors ( <
150K users)But I'm worried about the performance overhead. We already have a
performance problem because of personalising the content for users according
to their type (student or doctor), and for doctors, their grade and
speciality.</p><p>6 0.69396502 <a title="285-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-03-SMACKDOWN_%3A%3A_Who_are_the_Open_Source_Content_Management_System_%28CMS%29_market_leaders_in_2008%3F.html">377 high scalability-2008-09-03-SMACKDOWN :: Who are the Open Source Content Management System (CMS) market leaders in 2008?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:GlusterFSis a clustered file-system capable of
scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over
Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64
server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).Cluster file systems are still
not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain
though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of
commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.GlusterFS
achieved35 GBps read throughput. The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was
performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband
interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with
multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB
block size. GlusterFS was configured with unify translator and round-robin
scheduler.The advantage</p><p>3 0.75818551 <a title="285-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Why_doesn%27t_anyone_use_j2ee%3F.html">82 high scalability-2007-09-06-Why doesn't anyone use j2ee?</a></p>

Java, but in a very pragmatic way. They use servlets, an application server,
the JDK, and they do the rest themselves. They skip JSP, entity beans, and
JMS.When you need to scale putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky
strategy. Why use JSP when you can do better? When use entity beans when you
can do better? Use servlets because they are a very effective way of handling
http requests. Use Java because it is fast, runs everywhere, and has a boat
load of libraries you can use to build your build your custom system.Probably
the major reason J2EE is absentee is simply LAMP. LAMP is just so incredibly
functional for most 2-tier shared nothing sites they don't need a better

<p>Introduction: Cal Hendersonwrites at thinkvitamin.com: "With our so-called "Web 2.0'
applications and their rich content and interaction, we expect our
applications to increasingly make use of CSS and JavaScript. To make sure
these applications are nice and snappy to use, we need to optimize the size
and nature of content required to render the page, making sure we're
delivering the optimum experience. In practice, this means a combination of
making our content as small and fast to download as possible, while avoiding
unnecessarily refetching unmodified resources." A lot of good comments too.</p><p>5 0.70427746 <a title="285-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-09-LiveJournal_Architecture.html">3 high scalability-2007-07-09-LiveJournal Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A fascinating and detailed story of how LiveJournal evolved their system to
scale. LiveJournal was an early player in the free blog service race and faced
issues from quickly adding a large number of users. Blog posts come fast and
furious which causes a lot of writes and writes are particularly hard to
scale. Understanding how LiveJournal faced their scaling problems will help

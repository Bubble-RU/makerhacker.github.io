<p>Introduction: With so many database options available these days, like for the rest of life,
it's natural to wonder how it allfits together. Amazon complicated, or rather
expanded the available options by introducing RDS, theirrelational database
service. RDS is MySQL safely cocooned as a manageable cloud element, resting
boldly within an energy providing elasticCPU pool, supported by a
virtuallyinfinite supplyof verycapable virtualized storage.MySQL in AWS isnow
easyto start, stop, monitor, backup, snapshot, expand, and effortlessly move
up and down the instance hierarchy. What it's not, contrary to what you might
expect, is a scale-out solution, it's a scale-up solution. You get more by
buying a bigger instance, not by horizontally adding more instances. There's
alimit. Admittedly a larger limit now with Amazon's newhigh memory
instances.That's OK, well maybe not for people who helped grow Amazon's
ecosystem by offering a similar product, but so many projects use MySQL that

<p>Introduction: Update 8:Introducing MongoDB byEliot Horowit. Update 7: The Future of Scalable
Databases by Robin Mathew.Update 6:NoSQL : If Only it Was that Easy. BJ Clark
lays down the law on which databases are scalable: Tokyo - NO, Redis - NO,
Voldemort - YES, MongoDB - Not Yet, Cassandra - Probably, Amazon S3 - YES * 2,
MySQL - NO.The real thing to point out is that if you are being held back from
making something super awesome because you can't choose a database, you are
doing it wrong.Update 5:Exciting stuff happening in Japan at this Key-Value
Storage meeting in Tokyo. Presentations on Groonga, Senna, Lux IO, Tokyo-

<p>Introduction: Consistent hashing is one of those ideas that really puts the science in
computer science and reminds us why all those really smart people spend years
slaving over algorithms. Consistent hashing is "a scheme that provides hash
table functionality in a way that the addition or removal of one slot does not
significantly change the mapping of keys to slots" and was originally a way of
distributing requests among a changing population of web servers. My first
reaction to the idea was "wow, that's really smart" and I sadly realized I
would never come up with something so elegant. I then immediately saw
applications for it everywhere. And consistent hashing is used everywhere:
distributed hash tables, overlay networks, P2P, IM, caching, and CDNs. Here's
the abstract from the original paper and after the abstract are some links to
a few very good articles with accessible explanations of consistent hashing
and its applications in the real world.breakAbstract:We describe a family of

<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi
Media, Inc:Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS
data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape
of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve
performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom
filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or
document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide
for yourself.Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the
key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database
offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me
after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your
options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)An interesting
observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal to large</p><p>3 0.76387191 <a title="468-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Product%3A_Project_Voldemort_-_A_Distributed_Database.html">651 high scalability-2009-07-02-Product: Project Voldemort - A Distributed Database</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a question asked on theycombinatorlist and there are some good
responses. I gave a quick response, but I particularly like neilk's knock out
of the park insightful answer:Read Cal Henderson's book. (I'd add in Theo's
book and Release It! too)The center of your design should be the data store,
not a process. You transition the data store from state to state, securely and
reliably, in small increments.Avoid globals and session state. The more "pure"
your function is, the easier it will be to cache or partition.Don't make your
data store too smart. Calculations and renderings should happen in a separate,
asynchronous process.The data store should be able to handle lots of
concurrent connections. Minimize locking. (Read about optimistic
locking).Protect your algorithm from the implementation of the data store,
with a helper class or module or whatever. But don't (DO NOT) try to build a
framework for any conceivable query. Just the ones your algorithm
needs.Viewing an application as</p><p>5 0.74000829 <a title="468-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-19-LinkedIn%3A_Creating_a_Low_Latency_Change_Data_Capture_System_with_Databus.html">1211 high scalability-2012-03-19-LinkedIn: Creating a Low Latency Change Data Capture System with Databus</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post bySiddharth Anand, a senior member of LinkedIn's
Distributed Data Systems team.Over the past 3 years, I've had the good fortune
to work with many emerging NoSQL products in the context of supporting the
needs of a high-traffic, customer facing web site.In 2010, I helped Netflix to
successfullytransition its web scale use-cases from Oracle to SimpleDB, AWS'
hosted database service. On completion of that migration, we started a second
migration, this time from SimpleDB to Cassandra. The first transition was key
to our move from our own data center to AWS' cloud. The second was key to our
expansion from one AWS Region to multiple geographically-distributed Regions
-- today Netflix serves traffic out of two AWS Regions, one in Virginia, the
other in Ireland (F1). Both of these transitions have been successful, but
have involved integration pain points such as the creation of database
replication technology.In December 2011, I moved to LinkedIn's Distributed

<p>Introduction: Ringo is an experimental, distributed, replicating key-value store based on
consistent hashing and immutable data. Unlike many general-purpose databases,
Ringo is designed for a specific use case: For archiving small (less than 4KB)
or medium-size data items (<100MB) in real-time so that the data can survive K
- 1 disk breaks, where K is the desired number of replicas, without any
downtime, in a manner that scales to terabytes of data. In addition to
storing, Ringo should be able to retrieve individual or small sets of data
items with low latencies (<10ms) and provide a convenient on-disk format for
bulk data access.Ringo is compatible with themap-reduce framework Discoand it
was started atNokia Research CenterPalo Alto.</p><p>2 0.8145805 <a title="468-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-24-Habits_of_Highly_Scalable_Web_Applications_.html">637 high scalability-2009-06-24-Habits of Highly Scalable Web Applications </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking The
Datacenter as a Computer book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I
would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!John Fries in aG+
commenthas what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the
book:It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by
interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the
entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and
realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter
anymoreIt's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize
simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to
warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware;
datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to
deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key
challenges, which include ra</p><p>4 0.72571921 <a title="468-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-21-Pinterest_Architecture_Update_-_18_Million_Visitors%2C_10x_Growth%2C12_Employees%2C_410_TB_of_Data.html">1248 high scalability-2012-05-21-Pinterest Architecture Update - 18 Million Visitors, 10x Growth,12 Employees, 410 TB of Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There has been an update on Pinterest: Pinterest growth driven by Amazon cloud
scalability since our last post: A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling
3+ Million Users.With Pinterest we see a story very similar to that
ofInstagram. Huge growth, lots of users, lots of data, with remarkably few
employees, all on the cloud.While it's true that both Pinterest and Instagram
are not making great advances inscience and technology, that is more indicator
of the easy power of today's commodity environments rather than a sign of
Silicon Valley's lack of innovation. The numbers are so huge and the
valuations are so high we naturally want some sort of fundamental
technological revolution to underlie their growth. The revolution is more
subtle. It really is just that easy to attain such growth these days, if you
can execute on the right idea. Get used to it. This is the new normal.Here's
what Pinterest looks like today: 80 million objects stored in S3 with 410

<p>Introduction: Salvatore Sanfilippowrote a response to Michel Martens' An Open Minded Reader.
There's nothing in the post or response that's controversial. I was just
struck at what a clear explication the conversation was on all the effort that
goes into optimizing read paths. We optimize reads through denormalisation, a
crazy quilt of caching layers, key-value databases, clustering of related
tables, SSD/RAM, DHTs, moving functions to storage, secondary indexes,
separating OLAP from OLTP, etc etc. We often focus so much on specific
techniques that we can forget the bigger picture of what's going on. This
little exchange made me look again at the forest, not just the trees.Michel
Martens:What does it mean to use Redis as a traditional database? If it means
to save all your data and expect to retrieve it later in new and creative
ways, then we have to agree that better tools are available. It is one of
Redis tradeoffs: you have to think in advance how you will want to get your
data back.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byDave HaglerSystems Architect at AOL.The AOL homepages
receive more than8 million visitors per day.  That's more daily viewers than
Good Morning America or the Today Show on television.  Over a billion page
views are served each month.  AOL.com has been a major internet destination
since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.The architecture
for AOL.com is in it's 5th generation.  It has essentially been rebuilt from
scratch 5 times over two decades.  The current architecture was designed 6
years ago.  Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along
the way, but the overall design remains largely intact.  The code, tools,
development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of
continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very
stable.The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations
andtotals around 25 people.  The majority are in Dulles, Virginia with a
smaller team i</p><p>4 0.12476418 <a title="262-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-27-Updating_distributed_web_applications.html">372 high scalability-2008-08-27-Updating distributed web applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,we've got a web application, which runs without the common standalone
application servers like tomcat or jboss, rather it runs with an embedded
jetty server. Now we are planing to run instances of this application on
multiple machines, with a load balancer serving the requests.The big question
is: is there a common scenario on how to update these applications? Lets think
of 10 instances on 10 machines (one instance per machine), where we want to
update each of these applications version. The brute force approach would be,
to stop all instances, update and then restart it. This is a lot of manual
work ;) Another problem is down-time: so someone must only shutdown one server
after another, but then there are multiple application versions around.Can
someone please provide us with a hint for this problem? Perhaps papers, tools
or something like that?Thanks a lot :)</p><p>5 0.11938266 <a title="262-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-19-Heavy_upload_server_scalability.html">516 high scalability-2009-02-19-Heavy upload server scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,We are running a backup solution that uploads every night the files our
clients worked on during the day (Cabonite-like).We have currently about 10GB
of data per night, via http PUT requests (1 per file), and the files are
written as-is on a NAS.Our architecture is basically compound of a load
balancer (hardware, sticky sessions), 5 servers (Tomcat under RHEL4/5, ) and a
NAS (nfs 3).Since our number of clients is rising, (as is our system load) how
would you recommend we could scale our infrastructure? hardware and software?
Should we go towards NAS sharding, more servers, NIO on tomcat...?Thanks for
your inputs!</p><p>6 0.11832695 <a title="262-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-07-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Web_asset_server_concept_-_3rd_party_software_available%3F.html">1402 high scalability-2013-02-07-Ask HighScalability: Web asset server concept - 3rd party software available?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.They're using a static server to
deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that
the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on
serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.I'm curious how other
people have dealt with this situation.Seperating into two different servers
would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the
premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created
in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>3 0.72605115 <a title="262-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-23-Ask_HighScalability%3A_How_Do_I_Build_My_MegaUpload_%2B_Itunes_%2B_YouTube_Startup%3F.html">1288 high scalability-2012-07-23-Ask HighScalability: How Do I Build My MegaUpload + Itunes + YouTube Startup?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This question was sent in by Val, who asking for a little help in creating the
next big thing. Any ideas?I'm planning to run my own, first startup website
and have been surfing the webs for relevant info to plan the technology I will
use for it (the frontend and the backend, including the software and the
hardware). The website will be something like a combination of:MegaUpload
(users will upload their files)iTunes (users will be paid for their
uploads)and YouTube (in the future I'm planning to let users watch/listen to
the content online, without downloading).I don't have any investors yet, nor
the budget - I'm still preparing the idea and I'm going to create first
implementation (an "alpha version") before I show it to potential investors.
Hence the initial technologies have to be extremely cheap *but* also highly
scalable in the future so that I don't have to redo anything when the website
grows.Unfortunately I don't have much experience in running big wesites but,
on the other hand</p><p>4 0.71184766 <a title="262-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-04-Database_question_for_upcoming_project.html">379 high scalability-2008-09-04-Database question for upcoming project</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We will be developing an RIA that will have a lot of database access. Think
something like a QuickBooks but with about 50 transactions entered per hour
per user. Users will be in the system for 7 to 9 hours a day and there will be
around 20,000 users, all logged in at the same time.Reporting will be done
just like a QuickBooks style app plus a lot of extra things you don't do in
QuickBooks.Our operations is familiar with W2003 Server and MS SQL Server so
they are recommending we stick with that. I originally requested Linux and
PostgreSQL.How far can a single database server get me? If we have a 4
processor, 8 core, 128gb server, how far am I going to get before I need to
shard or do something else? I know there are a lot of factors involved but in
general for this size of a site, what should the strategy be?I've read almost
all articles on this website but most of the applications are not RIA type of
apps with this type of usage or they are architectures for sites with millions
of use</p><p>5 0.71052247 <a title="262-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-31-Need_help_on_Site_loading_%26_database_optimization_-_URGENT.html">611 high scalability-2009-05-31-Need help on Site loading & database optimization - URGENT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site
has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this
day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out
the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was
taking too much load.There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my
database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I
have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain
PHP/HTML coding is used.Technology:PHP -- 5.2MYSQL -- 5.0Apache --

<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if anyone has found any information on how to architect a
system to support high availability file uploads. My scenario: I have an
Apache server proxying requests to a bunch of Tomcat Java application servers.
When I need to upgrade my site, I stop and upgrade each of the Tomcat servers
one at a time. This seems to work well as Apache automatically routes
subsequent requests for the stopped app server to the remaining app servers
that are up. The problem is that if a user is uploading a file when the app
server is stopped, the upload fails and the user has to upload the file again.
This is problematic as uploading files is an integral feature of the site and
it's frustrating for the users to have to restart their uploads every time I
upgrade the site (which I want to be able to do frequently).Has anyone seen
any information on how this can be done or have ideas on how this can be
architected? I imagine sites like Flickr must have a solution to this problem
as I have</p><p>2 0.91583627 <a title="262-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_9%2C_2011.html">1113 high scalability-2011-09-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 9, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important. Jim Scheinman, former Bebo
and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to
scale as why they lost the social networking race:VB: Can you tell me a bit
about what you learned in your time at Friendster? JS:For me, it basically
came down to failed execution on the technology side -- we had millions of
Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log
in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in
to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling
us that if we didn't get our site working better soon, they'd be 'forced to
join' a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpaceâ&euro;Śthe
rest is history. To be fair to Friendster's technology team at the time, they
were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites
simply hadn't had to deal with prior to Friendster. As is often the case, the

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally
successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips
with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these
successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to
multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are
reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we
are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be
squashed.To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a
corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer
2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use
symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to
work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore
designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core
efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtaining</p><p>6 0.88479829 <a title="262-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-09-How_did_Google_Instant_become_Faster_with_5-7X_More_Results_Pages%3F.html">899 high scalability-2010-09-09-How did Google Instant become Faster with 5-7X More Results Pages?</a></p>

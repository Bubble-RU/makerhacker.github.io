<p>Introduction: Building, scaling, and optimizing the next generation of web applications. Learn the tricks of the trade so you can build and architect applications that scale quickly--without all the high-priced headaches and service-level agreements associated with enterprise app servers and proprietary programming and database products. Culled from the experience of the Flickr.com lead developer, Building Scalable Web Sites offers techniques for creating fast sites that your visitors will find a pleasure to use.     Creating popular sites requires much more than fast hardware with lots of memory and hard drive space. It requires thinking about how to grow over time, how to make the same resources accessible to audiences with different expectations, and how to have a team of developers work on a site without creating new problems for visitors and for each other.     Presenting information to visitors from all over the world   * Integrating email with your web applications   * Planning hardware purch</p><p>5 0.13905263 <a title="202-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-How_many_machines_do_you_need_to_run_your_site%3F.html">70 high scalability-2007-08-22-How many machines do you need to run your site?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazingly   TechCrunch   runs their website on one web server and one database server, according to the fascinating survey   What the Web√¢&euro;&trade;s most popular sites are running on   by   Pingdom  , a  provider of uptime and response time monitoring.      Early we learned   PlentyOfFish   catches and releases many millions of hits a day on just 1 web server and three database servers.   Google   runs a   Dalek   army full of servers.   YouSendIt  , a company making it easy to send and receive large files, has 24 web servers,  3 database servers, 170 storage servers, and a few miscellaneous servers.   Vimeo  , a video sharing company, has 100 servers for streaming video, 4 web servers, and 2 database servers.   Meebo  , an AJAX based instant messaging company, uses 40 servers to handle messaging, over 40 web servers,  and 10 servers for forums, jabber, testing, and so on.

<p>Introduction: hi,   the website i work for is looking to build a email system that can handle a fair few emails (up to a hundred thousand a day).     These comprise emails like registration emails, newsletters, lots of user triggered emails and overnight emails.     At present we queue them in SQL and feed them into an smtp server on one of our web servers when the queue drops below a certain level.     this has caused our mail system to crash as well as hammer our DB server (shared!!!).     We have got an architecture of what we want to build but thought there might be something we could buy off the shelf that allowed us to keep templated emails, lists of recipients, schedule sends etc and report on it. We can't find anything     What do big websites like amazon etc use or people a little smaller but who still send loads of mail (flickr, ebuyer, or other ecommerce sites)     Cheers     tarqs</p><p>3 0.68726563 <a title="202-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-12-Should_I_use_LAMP_or_Windows%3F.html">8 high scalability-2007-07-12-Should I use LAMP or Windows?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: OK,     I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll ask here.     Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application" that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server" when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.     The normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let</p><p>6 0.62288553 <a title="202-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-30-Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">551 high scalability-2009-03-30-Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

This source distribution includes code patches that they have added to improve the stability and performance of their clusters. In all cases, these patches have already been contributed back to Apache, but they may not yet be available in an Apache release of Hadoop.

 Good idea:  Open The Index And Speed Up The Internet .  SmugMug estimates 50%  of their CPU is spent serving crawler robots. Having a common meta-data repository wouldn't prevent search engines from having their own special sauce. Then the problem becomes one of syncing data between repositories and processing change events. A generous soul could even offer a shared MapReduce service over the data. Now that would  speed up the internet .

<p>Introduction: A lot has been said already about Twitter's scalability issues. Many have given Twitter as an anti-pattern of how not to deal with scalability and have suggested different solutions for scaling it. As Twitter is famously a Ruby-on-Rails deployment, this case has also been used as a weapon in the language/platform wars between the RoR and Java camps, and to a lesser degree, also with the LAMP (PHP) camp</p><p>5 0.92912686 <a title="202-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL%3A_An_Overview_of_the_Various_Query_Semantics_in_the_Post_Only-SQL_World.html">867 high scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL: An Overview of the Various Query Semantics in the Post Only-SQL World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of  many of the scalability issues that we face today with traditional  database approach.
 
I think that the main reason so many people  have come to see SQL as the source of all evil is the fact that,  traditionally, the query language was burned into the database  implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to the  traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.
 
This view has  brought on a flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a  different aspect that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach,  such as a document model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as  Key/Value query.
 
Most of the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject,  and tend to use query semantics and architecture interchangeably. In  Part I  of this post i tried to provide quick overview of what  each query term stands for in the context of the NoSQL world .

<p>Introduction: All APIs are different. At its core, an API provides direct access deep into a web service (lower case - a service that is provided on the web) and turns it into a Web Service (upper case) that people can use as a building block. What makes it an API is the infrastructure that sits in front of it, attracts developers to use it, secures it from misuse and provides the metrics and management needed to turn an internal web service into a Web Service managed through an effective distribution channel, and providing strategic and/or financial benefit.  While each API is different, the infrastructure I have described is consistent across virtually all of them, so it is neither economical nor effective to reinvent the wheel for each API someone wants to release. It is similar to the concept of an adserver - all websites have different content and fucntionality, but the concept of selecting and serving an ad, tracking it, and targeting it is pretty consistent across sites; as a result, there ar</p><p>5 0.082536221 <a title="440-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-20-Dependency_Injection_and_AOP_frameworks_for_.NET_.html">685 high scalability-2009-08-20-Dependency Injection and AOP frameworks for .NET </a></p>
<p>Introduction: We're looking to implement a framework to do Dependency Injection and AOP for a new solution we're working on.  It will likely get hit pretty hard, so we'd like to chose a framework that's proven to scale well, and operates well under pressure.  Right now, we're looking closely at Spring.NET, Castle Project's Windsor framework, and Unity.

<p>Introduction: All,     My site would have heavy content (video/pictures). I'm looking for an efficient IPS/IDS solution which would not introduce much of latency. I'm more familiar with Cisco ASA and also familiar with Juniper, Foundry and others. I also came across snort but haven't used it before. I'm more of looking for an appliance (for the ease of configuration,support etc...)   Could any one share their thoughts on performane of IPS/IDS from this vendors?   Thanks!

<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch or other very popular websites frontpage).      Regular hosting companies (especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get crushed under the load in short time.     But there is hope. A new breed of hosting companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability you need at a fraction of the cost.     Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!” (or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same thing).     Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of them).

Did you know that 5% of the pageviews on Walmart.com take over 20 seconds to load? Walmart discovered this recently after adding real user measurement (RUM) to analyze their web performance for every single visitor to their site. Walmart used JavaScript to measure their median load time as well as key metrics like their 95th percentile. While 20 seconds is a long time to wait for a website to load,  the Walmart story  is actually not that uncommon. Remember, this is the worst 5% of their pageviews, not the typical experience.
 
Walmart's median load time was reported at around 4 seconds, meaning half of their visitors loaded Walmart.com faster than 4 seconds and the other half took longer than 4 seconds to load. Using this knowledge, Walmart was prepared to act. By reducing page load times by even one second, Walmart found that</p><p>6 0.45919871 <a title="440-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Books%3A_Web_2.0_Architectures_and_Cloud_Application_Architectures.html">539 high scalability-2009-03-16-Books: Web 2.0 Architectures and Cloud Application Architectures</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 4: Heroku versus GAE & GAE/JUpdate 3:Heroku has gone live!.
Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the
relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment
and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.Update 2:Heroku
Architecture. A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests
flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a
Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based
routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your
application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors. Dynos
themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware,
Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as
an application caching layer.Update: Aaron WorshamInterview with James

<p>Introduction: Recently I had to help users on one of my opensource project ISPMan.
http://ispman.netThis project started in 2001 as I was too unwilling to take
care of the DNS and VitualHosting stuff as it was a side-thing to the company
I worked for (so i wrote a software that took care of all these little
details)Summary: A large project that needs a rewrite can be done in a matter
of day.I will not give you a full case study about a project that went through
a re-write but a case study about how easy it is to re-write
something.breakDetails:My boss was cool enough to let me open-source the
project and obviously, I got a lot of cool-cred out of it.Later on I also did
some support and implementation and earned quiet some money with it.Eventually
I had to let the project go out of my hand to the community as I only did it
to facilitate a job that wasnt williing to do. (Setup DNS zones of multiple

<p>Introduction: Ricky HoinScalable System Design Patternshas created a great list of
scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary
of the patterns are:Load Balancer- a dispatcher determines which worker
instance will handle a request based on different policies.Scatter and Gather-
a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will
compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will
consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the
client.Result Cache- a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been
made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save
the actual execution.Shared Space- all workers monitors information from the
shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The
information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached.Pipe and
Filter- all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.MapReduce-
targets batch jobs where disk I/O is th</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89182401 <a title="307-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-Using_Google_AppEngine_for_a_Little_Micro-Scalability.html">307 high scalability-2008-04-21-Using Google AppEngine for a Little Micro-Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the years I've accumulated quite a rag tag collection of personal systems
scattered wide across a galaxy of different servers. For the past month I've
been on a quest to rationalize this conglomeration by moving everything to a
managed service of one kind or another. The goal: lift a load of worry from my
mind. I like to do my own stuff my self so I learn something and have control.
Control always comes with headaches and it was time for a little aspirin. As
part of the process GAE came in handy as a host for a few Twitter related
scripts I couldn't manage to run anywhere else. I recoded my simple little
scripts into Python/GAE and learned a lot in the process.breakIn the move I
exported HighScalability from a VPS and imported it into a shared hosting
service. I could never quite configure Apache and MySQL well enough that they
wouldn't spike memory periodically and crash the VPS. And since a memory crash
did not automatically restarted it was unacceptable. I also wrote a script t</p><p>3 0.86917025 <a title="307-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-20-Ask_HighScalability%3A_How_do_I_organize_millions_of_images%3F.html">1268 high scalability-2012-06-20-Ask HighScalability: How do I organize millions of images?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to store millions of images?
Currently images are stored in a MS SQL database which performance wise isn't
ideal. We'd like to migrate the images over to a file system structure but I'd
assume we don't just want to dump millions of images into a single directory.
Besides having to contend with naming collisions, the windows filesystem might
not perform optimally with that many files.I'm assuming one approach may be to
assign each user a unique CSLID, create a folder based on the CSLID and then
place one users files in that particular folder. Even so, this could result in
hundreds of thousands of folders. Whats the best organizational
scheme/heirachy for doing this?</p><p>4 0.84929663 <a title="307-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-25-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_25%2C_2012.html">1252 high scalability-2012-05-25-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 25, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: ESPN went on airin 1978. In those 30+ years think of the wonders we've seen!
When I think of ESPN I think of a world wide brand that is the very definition
of prime time. And it shows in their stats. ESPN.com peaks at 100,000 requests
per second. Their peak event is, not surprisingly, the World Cup. But would
you be surprised to learn ESPN is powered by only a few hundred servers and a
couple of dozen engineers? I was.And would you be surprised to learn ESPN is
undergoing a fundamental transition from an Enterprise architecture to one
capable of handling web scale loads driven by increasing mobile usage,
personalization, and a service orientation? Again, thinking ESPN was just
about watching sports on TV, I was surprised. ESPN is becoming much more than
that. ESPN is becoming a sports platform. How does ESPN handle all of this
complexity, responsibility, change, and load? Unlike most every other profile
on HighScalability. The fascinating story of ESPN's architecture is told

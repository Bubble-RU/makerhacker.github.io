</p><p>3 Using AppEngine you have no choice but to write an app that can be splayed across a pointy well sharpened CPU grid. [sent-16, score-0.286]
</p><p>4 You basically make a Python app using services and it scales. [sent-33, score-0.355]
</p><p>5 If email needs to be sent every hour, for example, who will invoke your service every hour so you can get the CPU to send the email? [sent-45, score-0.286]
</p><p>6 -  An application can only access other computers on the Internet through the provided URL fetch and email services and APIs. [sent-63, score-0.313]
</p><p>7 An app can read files, but only files uploaded with the application code. [sent-66, score-0.417]
</p><p>8 The app must use the App Engine datastore for all data that persists between requests. [sent-67, score-0.381]
</p><p>9 A request handler cannot spawn a sub-process or execute code after the response has been sent. [sent-69, score-0.3]
</p><p>10 An update of a entity occurs in a transaction that is retried a fixed number of times if other processes are trying to update the same entity simultaneously. [sent-76, score-0.243]

</p><p>13 The mail service also uses Google infrastructure to send email messages. [sent-82, score-0.302]
</p><p>14 You can bundle a framework of your choosing with your application code by copying its code into your application directory. [sent-98, score-0.373]
</p><p>15 Google has their own framework called  webapp . [sent-99, score-0.244]
</p><p>16 Here's a hello world application using webapp:   import wsgiref. [sent-101, score-0.261]
</p><p>17 When webapp receives an HTTP GET request to the URL /, it instantiates the MainPage class and calls the instance's get method. [sent-116, score-0.381]
</p><p>18 webapp sends a response based on the final state of the MainPage instance. [sent-121, score-0.31]
</p><p>19 The parameter debug=true passed to its constructor tells webapp to print stack traces to the browser output if a handler encounters an error or raises an uncaught exception. [sent-124, score-0.285]
</p><p>20 When your application is running on App Engine, users will be directed to the Google Accounts sign-in page, then redirected back to your application after successfully signing in or creating an account. [sent-128, score-0.379]

  App Engine Backends  by Justin Haugh, Greg Darke. One of this biggest complaints about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new Backend node.

<p>Introduction: Update 3 : ReadWriteWeb says  Google App Engine Announces New Pricing Plans, APIs, Open Access . Pricing is specified but I'm not sure what to make of it yet. An image manipulation library is added (thus the need to pay for more CPU :-) and memcached support has been added. Memcached will help resolve the can't write for every read problem that pops up when keeping counters.  Update 2 : onGWT.com threw a GAE load party and a lot of people came. The results at  Load test : Google App Engine = 1, Community = 0 . GAE handled a peak of 35 requests/second and a sustained 10 requests/second. Some think performance was good, others not so good. My GMT watch broke and I was late to arrive. Maybe next time. Also added a few new design rules from the post.   Update : Added a few new rules gleaned from the  GAE Meetup : Design By Explicit Cost Model and Puts are Precious.  How do you structure your database using a distributed hash table like  BigTable ?

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Rumor no more.  Google Jumps Head First Into Web Services With Google App Engine . The quick and dirty of it: developers simply upload their Python code to Google, launch the application, and can monitor usage and other metrics via a multi-platform desktop application.  There were 10,000 developer slots open and of course I was too late. More as the cobra strikes.      Update: TechCrunch reports  Google To Launch BigTable As Web Service  next week. It competes with Amazon's SimpleDB. Though it won't be truly comparable until they also release an EC2 and S3 equivalent. An internet hit for each data access is a little painful. As Jimmy says in Goodfellas, "That's the way. You don't take no sh*t from nobody.

<p>Introduction: The story of driving the  golden spike  to symbolize the completion of the  transcontinental railroad  is famous in the US. What is not so well known is the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that possibly be?
  Telegraph as Internet  
First, let's establish the telegraph and cable systems was an early version of an Internet.
 
As railroad tracks were being laid a  transcontental telegraph  system was also being constructed. Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could ride.
 
With the  transalantic cable system  information could quickly span continents in minutes:
  

The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to 12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to 110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870, 40</p><p>same-blog 2 0.92495471 <a title="301-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-08-Google_AppEngine_-_A_First_Look.html">301 high scalability-2008-04-08-Google AppEngine - A First Look</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look around their documentation and seeing what stands out  for me. It's not the much speculated   super cluster VM  . AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran a   website out of S3   with a splash of   Heroku   thrown in as a chaser.      The idea is clearly to take advantage of our   massive multi-core future   by creating a shared nothing infrastructure based firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage: email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps.  A shared nothing request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build</p><p>3 0.91826534 <a title="301-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_9th%2C_2014.html">1645 high scalability-2014-05-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 9th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Authored by  Chris Fregly   :  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.  
   Ahead of the upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi’s recent    presentation    at an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few of my recent    Fluxcapacitor.com    consulting engagements, I’ve compiled a list of 10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS. 
    1) Query AWS resource metadata  
      
   Can’t remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?     awsnow.info    is the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.  Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You’re in luck.  There’s now a    REST API   , as well! 
   Note:  These are default soft limits and will vary by account. 
    2) Tame your S3 buckets  
       
   Delete an entire S3 bucket with a single CLI command:</p><p>6 0.89642972 <a title="301-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-01-Peecho_Architecture_-_scalability_on_a_shoestring.html">1090 high scalability-2011-08-01-Peecho Architecture - scalability on a shoestring</a></p>

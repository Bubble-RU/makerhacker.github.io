CorinthiansWith this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs.I
like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them
just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.-- Sylvain onGoogle GroupsThe
dream is dead. Google App Engine's boldpay for what you usedream dies as it
leaves childish things behind and becomes areal product.Pricing will change.
Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will
change. But Google App Engine will survive. Google isshutting downmany of
itsprojects. GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank
for it surving the more wood behindmore deadly arrows push? Without a radical

<p>Introduction: Update 6::Back to the Future for Data Storage.We are in the middle of a
renaissance in data storage with the application of many new ideas and
techniques; there's huge potential for breaking out of thinking about data
storage in just one way.Update 5:Building Scalable Web Applications with
Google App Engineby Brett Slatkin.Update 4:Why Google App Engine is broken and
what Google must do to fix itby Aral Balkan.We don't care that it can scale.
We care that it does scale. And that it scales when you need it the
most.Issues: 1MB limit on data structures; 1MB limit on data structures; the
short-term high CPU quota; quotas in general; Admin? What's that?Update 3:

can't do basic filtering and can't search 5,000 records without timing out:

<p>Introduction: Update 35:How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational
Database. Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in
order to mimic RDBMS joins:Given the trade off between potential
inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the
latter.Update 34: Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what
that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?Amazon dramatically drops
SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB. This puts
SimpleDB on par withGoogle App Engine. They also announced a few new
features:a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline
uploading of multiple items or attributes. One of the complaints against
SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things.
These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can
store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.Update 33: Amazon announcesElastic

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>3 0.95664537 <a title="336-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling_Social_Ecommerce_Architecture_Case_study.html">1016 high scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling Social Ecommerce Architecture Case study</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: I follow a certain philosophy when developing system architectures. I assume
that very few systems will ever exist in a consistent form for more than a
short period of time. What constitutes a “short period of time” differs
depending on the specifics of each system, but in an effort to quantify it, I
generally find that it falls somewhere between a week and a month.The driving
forces behind the need for an ever changing architecture are largely business
requirement based. This is a side effect of the reality that software
development, in most cases, is used as a supporting role within the business
unit it serves. As business requirements (i.e. additional features, new
products, etc.) pour forth, it is the developer’s job to evolve their software
system to accommodate these requirements and provide a software based solution
to whatever problems lay ahead.Given that many businesses can be identified as
having the above characteristics, I can now begin to explain why I believe

<p>Introduction: ProfessorDavid Malangives a very good lecture on scalability for dynamic
websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a
great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching
style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible
explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal
scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load
balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high
availability.Watch it onAcademic EarthThis is one lecture in a series of 13
lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to: build dynamic
websites with Ajax and with Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP); set up
domain names with DNS; structure pages with XHTML and CSS how to program in
JavaScript and PHP; configure Apacheand MySQL; design and query databases with
SQL; use Ajax with both XML andJSON;  build mashups.For thelecture notesgo to

<p>Introduction: Art of DistributedPart 1: Rethinking about distributed computing modelsI 'm
getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially
distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can
MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other
technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our
situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two
parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the
difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability,
and distributed storage systems.Download the article in PDF format.Download
the article in MS Word format.I wait for your comments, and questions, and I
will answer it in part two.</p><p>5 0.10941868 <a title="223-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Paper%3A_Graph_Databases_and_the_Future_of_Large-Scale_Knowledge_Management.html">626 high scalability-2009-06-10-Paper: Graph Databases and the Future of Large-Scale Knowledge Management</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most
of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to
the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez
introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide
web of data.Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on
the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10
billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for
applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, withthe
Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible
to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge
structure. This talk will discuss graph databases, their underlying data
model, their querying mechanisms, and the benefits of the graph data structure
for modeling and analysis.</p><p>6 0.10645368 <a title="223-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j_-_a_Graph_Database_that_Kicks_Buttox.html">628 high scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j - a Graph Database that Kicks Buttox</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Marton Trencseni has collected a wonderful list of different papers on
distributed systems. He's organized them into the following sections: The
Google Papers, Distributed Filesystems, Non-relational Distributed Databases,
The Lamport Papers, and Implementation Issues. Many old favorites on the list
and some that are likely new to you. My new favorite is "Frangipani: A
Scalable Distributed File System." How can you not love "Frangipani" as a
word?</p><p>4 0.6623134 <a title="223-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-03-Paper%3A_G2_%3A_A_Graph_Processing_System_for_Diagnosing_Distributed_Systems.html">1136 high scalability-2011-11-03-Paper: G2 : A Graph Processing System for Diagnosing Distributed Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the problems in building distributed systems is figuring out what the
heck is going on. Usually endless streams of log files are consulted like
ancients usingentrailsto divine the will of the Gods.To rise above these
ancient practices we must rise another level of abstraction and that's the
approach described in a Microsoft research paper: G2: A Graph Processing
System for Diagnosing Distributed Systems, which uses execution graphs that
model runtime events and their correlations in distributed systems.The problem
with these schemes is viewing applications, written by programmers in low
level code, as execution graphs. But we're heading in this direction in any
case. To program a warehouse or an internet sized computer we'll have to write
at higher levels of abstraction so code can be executed transparently at
runtime on these giant distributed computers. There are many advantages to
this approach, fault diagnosis and performance monitoring are just one of the
wins.Abstract from</p><p>5 0.65952623 <a title="223-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-23-Behind_The_Scenes_of_Google_Scalability.html">309 high scalability-2008-04-23-Behind The Scenes of Google Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The recent Data-Intensive Computing Symposium brought together experts in
system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific
applications, and information-based applications to better understand existing
capabilities in the development and application of large-scale computing
systems, and to explore future opportunities.Google Fellow Jeff Dean had a
very interesting presentation on Handling Large Datasets at Google: Current
Systems and Future Directions. He discussed:• Hardware infrastructure•
Distributed systems infrastructure:–Scheduling system–GFS–BigTable–MapReduce•
Challenges and Future Directions–Infrastructure that spans all
datacenters–More automationIt is really like a "How does Google work"

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.99886572 <a title="223-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-25-Google%3A_Introduction_to_Distributed_System_Design.html">223 high scalability-2008-01-25-Google: Introduction to Distributed System Design</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites tocache everything? Caching, if
not thesecret sauceof many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But
not so fast says Peter Zaitsev inBeyond great cache hit ratio. The point Peter
makes is that we read about websites likeAmazonandFacebook that can literally
make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome
cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all
those requests takes time. The solution is toremove requests all together. You
do this bycaching larger blocksso you have to make fewer requests. The post
has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small
as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control
invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>6 0.99529332 <a title="223-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>

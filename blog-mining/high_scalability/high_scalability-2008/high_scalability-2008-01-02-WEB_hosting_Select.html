<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle
traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch
or other very popular websites frontpage).Regular hosting companies
(especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get
crushed under the load in short time.But there is hope. A new breed of hosting
companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability
you need at a fraction of the cost.Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!”
(or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same
thing).Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting
companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of
them).Read the entire article aboutCloud computing, grid computing, utility

<p>Introduction: Every system has a limit. Although most providers of web hosting services
claim to provide "Unlimited", we all know that any web server has physical
limits which is usually hard to scale up, especially without taking the
machine offline.Most IT hosting companies use stand-alone servers to provide
website hosting. A very few use any form of HA clusters. Those web hosts that
use stand-alone servers do not feature scalability. Every time they need to
upgrade the machines they use, major changes to the systems have to be made.
Others which that do clustering are more scalable. They would add additional
servers to their systems or to remove machines from the set-ups. There are
many scenarios and different models of doing clustering. However I'm not the
one who would write about them. Plus this is not the purpose of this
article.The reason to start this article at High Scalability is to present

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere

<p>Introduction: Simone Brunozzi, technology evangelist for Amazon Web Services in Europe,
describes how Soocial.com was fully ported to Amazon web services.
----------------This period of the year I decided to dedicate some time to
better understand how our customers use AWS, therefore I spent some online
time with Stefan Fountain and the nice guys at Soocial.com, a "one address
book solution to contact management", and I would like to share with you some
details of their IT infrastructure, which now runs 100% on Amazon Web
Services!In the last few months, they've been working hard to cope with tens
of thousands of users and to get ready to easily scale to millions. To make
this possible, they decided to move ALL their architecture to Amazon Web
Services. Despite the fact that they were quite happy with their previous
hosting provider, Amazon proved to be the way to go.-----------------Read the

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: Amazon has announced the limited beta of Amazon SimpleDB - a simple web
services interface to create and store multiple data sets, query your data
easily, and return the results. Together with the Simple Storage Service (S3),
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and other web services Amazon offers a complete
utility computing platform. SimpleDB was the missing piece of AWS - the

capable of hosting planet-scale applications is the Ambient Cloud. It forms a
sort of digital potluck where everyone contributes memory, network, and other
compute resources from whatever they happen to have available. Top 10 Internet
Startup Scalability Killers. Strategies taken fromThe Art of Scalability. 1\.
Thinking Scalability Is Just About Technology; 2. Overuse of Synchronous

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Nicholas CarrA former executive editor of the Harvard Business
Review, Nicholas Carr writes and speaks on technology, business, and culture.
His provocative 2004 book Does IT Matter? set off a worldwide debate about the
role of computers in business.The Big Switch – Rewiring the World, From Edison
to GoogleCarr's core insight is that the development of the computer and the
Internet remarkably parallels that of the last radically disruptive
technology, electricity. He traces the rapid morphing of electrification from
an in-house competitive advantage to a ubiquitous utility, and how the
business advantage rapidly shifted from the innovators and early adopters to

<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create
a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll
have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own
forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each
group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to
start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups
(this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that
having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that
some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day,
let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active
though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate
which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if
having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>5 0.87220055 <a title="200-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA%3A_Badoo%E2%80%99s_journey_into_Continuous_Integration.html">1531 high scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA: Badoo’s journey into Continuous Integration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot
of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications
stemming from this, we use AIDA.AIDA(Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant)
is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git,
TeamCity and JIRA.In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were
able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous
integration.We'll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use
here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release
branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we'll discuss AIDA's major
contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.Git flowThe Badoo Team uses
Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and
tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in
JIRA and a description of the problem.BFG-

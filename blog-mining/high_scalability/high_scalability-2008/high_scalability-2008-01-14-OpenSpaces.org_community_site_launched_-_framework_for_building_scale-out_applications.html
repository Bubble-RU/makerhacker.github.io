<p>Introduction: Symfonyis an open-source PHP web framework based on the best practices of web
development, thoroughly tried on several active websites, symfony aims to
speed up the creation and maintenance of web applications, and to replace the
repetitive coding tasks by power, control and pleasure.Symfony provides a lot
of features seamlessly integrated together, such as:* simple templating and
helpers* cache management* smart URLs* scaffolding* multilingualism and I18N

<p>Introduction: How do you layer a programmable Internet of smart things on top of the web?
That's the question addressed by Dominique Guinard in his ambitious
dissertation: A Web of Things Application Architecture - Integrating the Real-
World (slides). With the continued siloing of content, perhaps we can keep our
things open and talking to each other?In the architecture things are modeled
using REST, they will be findable via search, they will be social via a social
access controller, and they will be mashupable. Here's great graphical
overview of the entire system: Abstract:A central concern in the area of
pervasive computing has been the integration of digital artifactsts with the
physical world and vice-versa. Recent developments in the fi eld of embedded
devices have led to smart things increasingly populating our daily life. We de
fine smart things as digitally enhanced physical objectsts and devices that
have communication capabilities. Application domains are for instance wireless

<p>Introduction: It started out innocently enough with a simple question, "What exactly *is*
the model for PaaS services scalability? If based on HTTP/REST API
integration, fairly easy. If native middleware… input?" You'll forgive the odd
phrasing - Twitter's limitations sometimes make conversations of this nature …
interesting.The discussion culminated in what appeared to be the sentiment
that middleware was mostly obsolete with respect to PaaS.THE OLD WAYVery
briefly for those of you who are more infrastructure / network minded than
application architecture fluent, let's review the traditional middleware-based
application architecture.Generally speaking, middleware - a.k.a. JMS, MQ
Series and most recently, ESB - is leveraged as means to enable a publish-
subscribe model of sharing data. Basically, it's an integration pattern, but
no one really likes to admit that because of the connotations associated with
the evil word "integration" in the enterprise. But that's what it's used for -
to integrate ap</p><p>6 0.60669148 <a title="212-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-DB2_Express-C.html">320 high scalability-2008-05-17-DB2 Express-C</a></p>

data caching, messaging and as the container for application business logic.
It is designed for building highly-available, scale-out applications in
distributed environments, such as SOA, cloud computing, grids and commodity
servers. OpenSpaces is widely used in a variety of industries, including
financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing and retail -- and across
the web in e-commerce, Web 2.0 applications such as social networking sites,

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Nicholas CarrA former executive editor of the Harvard Business
Review, Nicholas Carr writes and speaks on technology, business, and culture.
His provocative 2004 book Does IT Matter? set off a worldwide debate about the
role of computers in business.The Big Switch – Rewiring the World, From Edison
to GoogleCarr's core insight is that the development of the computer and the
Internet remarkably parallels that of the last radically disruptive
technology, electricity. He traces the rapid morphing of electrification from
an in-house competitive advantage to a ubiquitous utility, and how the
business advantage rapidly shifted from the innovators and early adopters to

Storage Solutions. S3 isn't the only cloud storage service out there. Mosso is
saying they can save you so money while offering support. There are number of
scenarios in their paper, but For 5TB of cloud storage Mosso will save you 17%
over S3 without support and 42% with support. For their CDN on a Global test
Mosso says the average response time is 333ms for CloudFront vs. 107ms for
Cloud Files which means globally, Cloud Files is 3.1 times or 211% faster than

Ambient Cloud. The only independent platform most of us will have access to
capable of hosting planet-scale applications is the Ambient Cloud. It forms a

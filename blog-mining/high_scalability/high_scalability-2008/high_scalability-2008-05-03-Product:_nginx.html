<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Barry Abrahamson, Chief Systems Wrangler at
Automattic, andNginx's Coufounder Andrew Alexeev.WordPress.com serves more
than 33 million sites attracting over 339 million people and 3.4 billion pages
each month. Since April 2008, WordPress.com has experienced about 4.4 times
growth in page views. WordPress.com VIP hosts many popular sites including
CNN's Political Ticker, NFL, Time Inc's The Page, People Magazine's Style
Watch, corporate blogs for Flickr and KROQ, and many more. Automattic operates
two thousand servers in twelve, globally distributed, data centers.
WordPress.com customer data is instantly replicated between different
locations to provide an extremely reliable and fast web experience for
hundreds of millions of visitors.ProblemWordPress.com, which began in 2005,
started on shared hosting, much like all of the WordPress.org sites. It was

<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture
forPoppen.de, a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be
careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they
manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new,
using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached,
RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.What is Poppen.de?Poppen.de (NSFW) is
the top dating website in Germany, and while it may be a small site compared
to giants like Flickr or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to
learn from if you are starting to get some scaling problems.The Stats2.000.000

<p>Introduction: Our last article on Disqus: How Disqus Went Realtime With 165K Messages Per
Second And Less Than .2 Seconds Latency, was a little out of date, but the
folks at Disqus have been busy implementing, not talking, so we don't know a
lot about what they are doing now, but we do have a short update in C1MM and
NGINXby John Watson and an article Trying out this Go thing.So Disqus has
grown a bit:1.3 billion unique visitors10 billion page views500 million users
engaged in discussions3 million communities25 million commentsThey are still
all about realtime, but Go replaced Python in their Realtime system:Original
Realtime backend was written in a pretty lightweight Python + gevent.The
realtime service is a hybrid of CPU intensive tasks + lots of network IO.
Gevent was handling the network IO without an issue, but at higher contention,
the CPU was choking everything. Switching over to Go removed that contention,
which was the primary issue that was being seen.Still runs on 5 machines Nginx

servers.Advantage: You dont have to have a speacial database or ldap schema.

<p>Introduction: A man had a dream. His dream was to blend a bunch of RSS/Atom/RDF feeds into a
single feed. The man is Beau Lebens ofFeedvilleand like most dreamers he was a
little short on coin. So he took refuge in the home of a cheap hosting
provider and Beau realized his dream, creatingFEEDblendr. But FEEDblendr
chewed up so much CPU creating blended feeds that the cheap hosting provider
ordered Beau to find another home. Where was Beau to go? He eventually found a
new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how
Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of
affordable CPU cycles.Site: http://feedblendr.com/The PlatformEC2 (Fedora Core
6 Lite distro)S3ApachePHPMySQLDynDNS (for round robin DNS)The StatsBeau is a
developer with some sysadmin skills, not a web server admin, so a lot of

<p>Introduction: Lighttpd(pronounced "lighty") is a web server which is designed to be secure,
fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-
critical environments. Its low memory footprint (compared to other web
servers), light CPU load and its speed goals make lighttpd suitable for
servers that are suffering load problems, or for serving static media
separately from dynamic content. lighttpd is free software / open source, and
is distributed under the BSD license. lighttpd runs on GNU/Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows.Load-balancing FastCGI, SCGI

<p>Introduction: SinceThe Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage was published we've a had
few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their
Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East
Region. Netlix shared theirLessons Learned from the AWS Outage as did Heroku
(How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage), Smug Mug (How SmugMug survived the
Amazonpocalypse), and SimpleGeo (How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS
Downtime). The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of
response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been
almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon
was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to
talk about the event itself.Lesson for crisis handlers: deep dive post-mortems
that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective
means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention. Amazon's

<p>Introduction: Please seeThe Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage for a new
improved list.So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage.
Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some
chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and
their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the
cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a
prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change
remains...cloudy.I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes
out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's
a resource you think should be added, just let me know.Amazon's Explanation of

<p>Introduction: Update:Arjenlinks to videoSupporting Scalable Online Statistical
Processingwhich shows"rather than doing complete aggregates, use statistical
sampling to provide a reasonable estimate (unbiased guess) of the result."When
you have a lot of data,samplingallows you to draw conclusions from a much
smaller amount of data. That's why sampling is a scalability solution. If you
don't have to process all your data to get the information you need then
you've made the problem smaller and you'll need fewer resources and you'll get
more timely results.breakSampling is not useful when you need a complete list
that matches a specific criteria. If you need to know the exact set of people
who bought a car in the last week then sampling won't help.But, if you want to
know many people bought a car then you could take a sample and then create
estimate of the full data-set. The difference is you won't really know the
exact car count. You'll have a confidence interval saying how confident you
are in your es</p><p>4 0.81612837 <a title="314-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in_Architecture_-_Pay_to_Play_to_Keep_a_System_Small__.html">965 high scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in Architecture - Pay to Play to Keep a System Small  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you keep a system small enough, while still being successful, that a
simple scale-up strategy becomes the preferred architecture?StackOverflow, for
example, could stick with a tool chain they were comfortable with because they
had a natural brake on how fast they could grow: there are only so many
programmers in the world. If this doesn't work for you, here's another natural
braking strategy to consider:charge for your service.Paul Houlesummarized this
nicely as:avoid scaling problems by building a service that's profitable at a
small scale.This interesting point, one I hadn't properly considered before,
was brought up by Maciej Ceglowski, co-founder ofPinboard.in, in an interview
with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their theirnet@nightshow.Pinboard is a
lean, mean, pay for bookmarking machine, a timely replacement for the nearly
departed Delicious. And as a self professed anti-social bookmarking site, it
emphasizes speed over socializing. Maciej considers Pinboard a persona</p><p>same-blog 5 0.81536311 <a title="314-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-03-Product%3A_nginx.html">314 high scalability-2008-05-03-Product: nginx</a></p>

queuing HTTP push server.Update 5: InLoad Balancer UpdateBarry describes how
WordPress.com moved from Pound to Nginx and are now "regularly serving about
8-9k requests/second and about 1.2Gbit/sec through a few Nginx instances and
have plenty of room to grow!".Update 4:Nginx better than Pound for load

and better documented.Update 3: igvita.com combines two cool tools together
for better performance inNginx and Memcached, a 400% boost!.Update 2: Software

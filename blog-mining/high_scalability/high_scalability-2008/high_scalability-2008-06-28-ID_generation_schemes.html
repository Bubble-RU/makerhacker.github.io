<p>Introduction: (Please bare with me, I'm a new, passionate, confident and terrified programmer :D )     Background:   I'm pre-launch and 1 year into the development of my application.  My target is to be able to eventually handle millions of registered users with 5-10% of them concurrent.  Up to this point I've used auto-increment to assign unique identifiers to rows.  I am now considering switching to a non-sequential strategy.  Oh, I'm using the LAMP configuration.     My reasons for avoiding auto-increment:   1.  Complicates replication when scaling horizontally.  Risk of collision is significant (when running multiple masters).  Note: I've read the other entries in this forum that relate to ID generation and there have been some great suggestions -- including a strategy that uses auto-increment in a way that avoids this pitfall... That said, I'm still nervous about it.   2.  Potential bottleneck when retrieving/assigning IDs -- IDs assigned at the database.     My reasons for being nervous about</p><p>3 0.12382729 <a title="346-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark_for_keeping_data_in_browser_in_AJAX_projects.html">565 high scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark for keeping data in browser in AJAX projects</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirming  Curiosity landing on Mars , then this paper,  High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for Main-Memory Databases , has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead on in-memory datastructures:
  A database system optimized for in-memory storage can support  much higher transaction rates than current systems.  However,  standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to  the high transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from updates but differ in  how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions  never block  during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure corr</p><p>5 0.092538863 <a title="346-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-06-Email_Architecture.html">202 high scalability-2008-01-06-Email Architecture</a></p>

They use servlets, an application server, the JDK, and they do the rest themselves.  They skip JSP, entity beans, and JMS.      When you need to scale putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky strategy. Why use JSP when you can do better? When use entity beans when you can do better? Use servlets because they are a very effective way of handling http requests. Use Java because it is fast, runs everywhere, and has a boat load of libraries you can use to build your build your custom system.     Probably the major reason J2EE is absentee is simply LAMP.

<p>Introduction: Building, scaling, and optimizing the next generation of web applications. Learn the tricks of the trade so you can build and architect applications that scale quickly--without all the high-priced headaches and service-level agreements associated with enterprise app servers and proprietary programming and database products. Culled from the experience of the Flickr.com lead developer, Building Scalable Web Sites offers techniques for creating fast sites that your visitors will find a pleasure to use.     Creating popular sites requires much more than fast hardware with lots of memory and hard drive space. It requires thinking about how to grow over time, how to make the same resources accessible to audiences with different expectations, and how to have a team of developers work on a site without creating new problems for visitors and for each other.

<p>Introduction: How do you evaluate and decide which web technologies (and there are myriads out there) to use for your new web application, which one potentially gives you the best performance, which one will likely give you the shortest time-to-market? The Apache incubator project   Olio   might help.     Olio is a is an open source web 2.0 toolkit to help evaluate the suitability, functionality and performance of web technologies. Olio defines an example web2.0 application (an events site somewhat like yahoo.com/upcoming) and provides three initial implementations : PHP, Java EE and RubyOnRails (ROR). The toolkit also defines ways to drive load against the application in order to measure performance.     Apache Olio could be used to     Understand how to use various web 2.0 technologies such as AJAX, memcached, mogileFS etc. Use the code in the application to understand the subtle complexities involved and how to get around issues with these technologies.

<p>Introduction: Shanti Braford  details how his Ruby on Rails  based website survived a 24 hour 550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup details, so there's not much I can add.   Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR, nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of the performance boost.    Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>3 0.80008495 <a title="346-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-14-Sun_N1_Grid_Engine_Software_and_the_Tokyo_Institute_of_Technology_Super_Computer_Grid.html">412 high scalability-2008-10-14-Sun N1 Grid Engine Software and the Tokyo Institute of Technology Super Computer Grid</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective, flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute- and data-intensive applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory, and delivers 47.38 trillion1 floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS) of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future. This Sun BluePrints article provides an overview of the Tokyo Tech grid, named TSUBAME.

<p>Introduction: hi,   the website i work for is looking to build a email system that can handle a fair few emails (up to a hundred thousand a day).     These comprise emails like registration emails, newsletters, lots of user triggered emails and overnight emails.     At present we queue them in SQL and feed them into an smtp server on one of our web servers when the queue drops below a certain level.     this has caused our mail system to crash as well as hammer our DB server (shared!!!).     We have got an architecture of what we want to build but thought there might be something we could buy off the shelf that allowed us to keep templated emails, lists of recipients, schedule sends etc and report on it. We can't find anything     What do big websites like amazon etc use or people a little smaller but who still send loads of mail (flickr, ebuyer, or other ecommerce sites)     Cheers     tarqs</p><p>6 0.77113736 <a title="346-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-03-NoSQL_Means_Never_Having_to_Store_Blobs_Again.html">770 high scalability-2010-02-03-NoSQL Means Never Having to Store Blobs Again</a></p>

when really they were never separate to begin with.The database normalization-

<p>Introduction: Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database
schemas that ensures that the data is optimal for ad-hoc querying and that
modifications such as deletion or insertion of data does not lead to data
inconsistency. Database denormalization is the process of optimizing your
database for reads by creating redundant data. A consequence of
denormalization is that insertions or deletions could cause data inconsistency
if not uniformly applied to all redundant copies of the data within the
database.Read more on Carnage4life blog...</p><p>4 0.1629809 <a title="351-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a
firm schema. I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the
overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding. The data is
essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song. This
lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and
Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together. This will be in
a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by
artist album or song. By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song
I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by. The problem is
that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to
shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what
are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it? Should I go
with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table? Perhaps it might be
best</p><p>5 0.83707649 <a title="351-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-17-7_Lessons_Learned_While_Building_Reddit_to_270_Million_Page_Views_a_Month.html">828 high scalability-2010-05-17-7 Lessons Learned While Building Reddit to 270 Million Page Views a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Huffman, co-founder of social news site Reddit, gave an
excellentpresentation (slides,transcript) on the lessons he learned while
building and growing Reddit to 7.5 million users per month, 270 million page
views per month, and 20+ database servers.Steve says a lot of the lessons were
really obvious, so you may not find a lot of completely new ideas in the
presentation. But Steve has an earnestness and genuineness about him that is
so obviously grounded in experience that you can't help but think deeply about
what you could be doing different. And if Steve didn't know about these
lessons, I'm betting others don't either.There are seven lessons, each has
their own summary section: Lesson one: Crash Often; Lesson 2: Separation of
Services; Lesson 3: Open Schema; Lesson 4: Keep it Stateless; Lesson 5:
Memcache; Lesson 6: Store Redundant Data; Lesson 7: Work Offline.By far the
most surprising feature of their architecture is in Lesson Six, whose

<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use

<p>Introduction: CTLis aflexible distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to
break management processes into reusable control modules and execute them in
distributed fashion over the network.From their website:CTL is a flexible
distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to break management
processes into reusable control modules and execute them in distributed
fashion over the network.What does CTL do?CTL helps you leverage your current
scripts and tools to easily automate any kind of distributed systems
management or application provisioning task. Its good for simplifiying large-
scale scripting efforts or as another tool in your toolbox that helps you
speed through your daily mix of ad-hoc administration tasks.What are CTL's
features?CTL has many features, but the general highlights are:* Execute
sophisticated procedures in distributed environments - Aren't you tired of
writing and then endlessly modifying scripts that loop over nodes and invoke
remote actions? CTL d</p><p>3 0.96050507 <a title="351-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-07-10_Core_Architecture_Pattern_Variations_for_Achieving_Scalability.html">1138 high scalability-2011-11-07-10 Core Architecture Pattern Variations for Achieving Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Srinath Perera has put together astrong list of architecture patternsbased on
three meta patterns:  distribution, caching, and asynchronous processing. He
contends these three are the primal patterns and the following patterns are
but different combinations:LB (Load Balancers) + Shared nothing Units. Units
that do not share anything with each other fronted with a load balancer that
routes incoming messages to a unit based on some criteria.LB + Stateless Nodes
+ Scalable Storage. Several stateless nodes talking to a scalable storage, and
a load balancer distributes load among the nodes.Peer to Peer Architectures
(Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Content Addressable Networks (CAN)).
Algorithm for scaling up logarithmically.Distributed Queues. Queue
implementation (FIFO delivery) implemented as a network
service.Publish/Subscribe Paradigm. Network publish subscribe brokers that
route messages to each other.Gossip and Nature-inspired Architectures. Each

<p>Introduction: Jeff Atwood started a barn burner of a conversation inMaybe Normalizing Isn't
Normalon how to create a fast scalable tagging system. Jeff eventually asks
that terrible question:which is better -- a normalized database, or a
denormalized database?And all hell breaks loose. I know, it's hard to imagine
database debates becoming contentious, but it does happen :-) It's lucky
developers don't have temporal power or rivers of blood would flow.Here are a
few of the pithier points (summarized):breakNormalization is not magical fairy
dust you sprinkle over your database to cure all ills; it often creates as
many problems as it solves. (Jeff)Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until
it works. (Jeff)Use materialized views which are tables created and maintained
by your RDBMS. So a materialized view will act exactly like a de-normalized
table would - except you keep you original normalized structure and any change
to original data will propagate to the view automatically. (Goran)According to

<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom

performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This

<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.Why flash rules for databasesThe economics of
flash memory are staggering.If you're not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.
Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory -
less than 100GB - great for in-memory solutions. There's a place for
rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data.
But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option. For
example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive
is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random
4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB
Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated
as slowest, but our internal testing showing solid performance. Most

architectures as a software thing, but it also applies to hardware. InSecurity
Now 385, that Doyen of Disk,Steve Gibson, tells the fascinating story (@ about
41:30) of how moving to a service oriented architecture in hard drives,
modeling a drive as a linear stream of sectors, helped create the amazing high
density disk drives we enjoy today.When drives switched to use
theIDE(integrated drive electronics) interface, the controller function moved
into the drive instead of the computer. No longer were low level drive signals
moved across cables and into the motherboard. Now we just ask the drive for
the desired sector and the drive takes care of it.This allowed manufacturers
to do anything they wanted to behind the IDE interface. The drive stopped
being dumb, it became smart, providing a sort of sector service. Density sky
rocketed because there was no dependency on the computer. All the internals

<p>Introduction: Update:Final Thoughts on SSD and MySQL AKA Battleship Spinn3r. Tips on how to
make your database 10x faster using solid state drives. Potential exists for
100x speedup.Solid-state drives(SSDs) are the holy grail of storage. The
promise of RAM speeds and hard disk like persistence have for years driven us
crazy with power user lust, but they've stayed tantalizingly just out of
reach. Always too expensive, too small, and oddly too slow. Has that changed?
Can you now miraculously have your cake and eat it too? Can you now have it
both ways? Is balancing work with family life now as easy as tripping over a
terabyte drive?In a pioneering series of blog articles Kevin Burton conducts
original research on next generation SSD drives in real world configurations.

<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To
$20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems hits Hacker News and
generates agood conversation. One of the common sentiments about the cloud was
raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own
hardware instead of using the cloud?Ryan Park, Operations Engineer at
Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfectmodern responseto that
ultimate existential design dilemma:Our #1 requirement has been to keep up
with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that
there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast
enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a
dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which
gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud
providers.AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to
the list price for on-demand instances.

<p>Introduction: The folks atEvernote were kind enough to write up an overview of their
architecture in a post titled Architectural Digest. Dave Engberg describes
their approach to networking, sharding, user storage, search, and some other
custom services.Evernote is a cool application, partially realizingVannevar
Bush's amazing visionof a memex. Wikipedia describes Evernote's features
succinctly: Evernote is a suite of software and services designed for
notetaking and archiving. A "note" can be a piece of formattable text, a full
webpage or webpage excerpt, a photograph, a voice memo, or a handwritten "ink"
note. Notes can also have file attachments. Notes can then be sorted into
folders, tagged, annotated, edited, given comments, and searched. Evernote
supports a number of operating system platforms (including Android, Mac OS X,
iOS, Microsoft Windows and WebOS), and also offers online synchronization and
backup services.Key here is that Evernote stores a lot of data, that must be
searched, and synce</p><p>4 0.79933685 <a title="257-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-21-This_is_why_Microsoft_won._And_why_they_lost..html">1635 high scalability-2014-04-21-This is why Microsoft won. And why they lost.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My favorite kind of histories are those told from an insider's perspective.
The story of Richard the Lionheart is full of great battles and dynastic
intrigue. The story of one of his soldiers, not so much. Yet the soldiers'
story, as someone who has experienced the real consequences of decisions made
and actions taken, is more revealing.We get such a history in Chat Wars, a
wonderful article written by David Auerbach, who in 1998 worked at Microsoft
on MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft's instant messaging app (for a related
story see The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted).It's as
if Herodotus visited Microsoft and wrote down his experiences. It has that
same sort of conversational tone, insightful on-the-ground observations, and
facts no outsider might ever believe.Much of the article is a play-by-play
account of the cat and mouse game David plays changing Messenger to track
AOL's Instant Messenger protocol changes. AOL repeatedly tried to make it so

<p>Introduction: Google's Research Areas of Interest: Building scalable, robust cluster
applications.At Google we see distributed systems as a technology in its
infancy, with huge gaps in the supporting research  that represent some of the
most important problems in the space. Here are some examples:Resource
sharing,Balancing cost, performance, and reliability,Self-maintaining systems.

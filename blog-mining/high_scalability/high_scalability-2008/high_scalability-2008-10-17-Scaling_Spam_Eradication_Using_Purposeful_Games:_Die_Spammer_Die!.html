[sent-18, score-0.822]
</p><p>2 But because it's made into a game people will do it for free! [sent-22, score-0.456]
</p><p>3 An example Labeler session looks like:breakIn the game two people are matched at random to label the same set of images. [sent-23, score-0.532]
</p><p>4 GWAP games include cheating detection mechanisms, but we won't go into detail here, seeDesigning games with a purposefor cheater foiling strategies. [sent-27, score-0.346]
</p><p>5 Tag a Tuneis a game where players hear tunes, describe them, and through the description guess if they are listening to the same tune. [sent-30, score-0.726]
</p><p>6 The task must be structured so that winning enables the system to learn something valid while providing a feeling of game play for the humans. [sent-37, score-0.513]
</p><p>7 Creating a Spam Catcher GameWith the basic ideas in place let's create a game for identifying and filtering out comment spam. [sent-39, score-0.586]
</p><p>8 Two strangers are randomly chosen by the game itself from among all potential players;Rules. [sent-41, score-0.453]
</p><p>9 Game instructions indicate that players should try to produce the same output as their partners. [sent-43, score-0.489]
</p><p>10 Both players must produce the same output; they do not have to produce it at the same time but must produce it at some point while the input is displayed onscreen. [sent-45, score-0.826]
</p><p>11 Integrating the game with a comment system might work something like:User comments are sent from an originating system to a decentralized game comment queue. [sent-49, score-1.268]
</p><p>12 Points are allocated if both players agree that a comment is spam or not spam within a very short period of time. [sent-52, score-0.847]
</p><p>13 With comments latency is the name of the game so they need to be processed as fast as possible. [sent-53, score-0.594]
</p><p>14 Comments and the spam judgments are sent back to the originating system for handling. [sent-54, score-0.411]
</p><p>15 One UI idea it to make the game like a first-person-shooter. [sent-56, score-0.407]
</p><p>16 Oh that would be rewarding, but you can also imagine all the usual game type mechanisms to keep people interested. [sent-58, score-0.556]
</p><p>17 An accuracy feedback loop would be useful to rate players so less accurate players could be dropped from the game. [sent-59, score-0.745]
</p><p>18 Another good source of players is the site owners and the site participants who's sites are the source of comments. [sent-61, score-0.385]
</p><p>19 This would provide a ready pool of motivated players and docents to keep the game running efficiently. [sent-66, score-0.777]
</p><p>20 A nice widget system would make it possible to play the game from any site. [sent-67, score-0.458]

<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact
socially with friends usingPlayfishgames on social platforms like The
Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the
fastest growing segment of the game industry:social gaming, which is the love
child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early
adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud
servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by
why EA bought them for$300 millionand they think a$1 billion gameis possible):
building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile
gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve
systems, agile development and deployment, andselling virtual goodas a
business model.How can a small company make all this happen? To explain the

<p>Introduction: "Everything in war is simple, but theďťż simplest thing is difficult." -- Carl
von ClausewitzGames are proving grounds for software architecture. They
combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost
sensitivity, and the need for profit. And when games have in-game currency,
like EVE Online has, there's money at play, so you can't just get away with a
c'est la vie attitude. Engineering must be applied. InPlanning for war: how

<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson: Game
Industry Legends: Rob Pardo, where the future of gaming is discussed, there
was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot
of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:Q. If the
game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that
can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to
overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of
those technical issues? Rob Pardo: I certainly think there's a lot of
potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of
hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these
servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any
less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with
the infrastructure that can have all those games up there. Another issue the

<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t
be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems
Laboratories* The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds
is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the
high-tech industry.* The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome
of the evolution of these games.* Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore
the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.* The game server is used both to
discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating
(by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the
client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might
seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role
means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the
server component.* Using multiple servers is a basic mechanism for scaling th</p><p>6 0.21035874 <a title="422-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-19-Zynga%27s_Z_Cloud_-_Scale_Fast_or_Fail_Fast_by_Merging_Private_and_Public_Clouds.html">1044 high scalability-2011-05-19-Zynga's Z Cloud - Scale Fast or Fail Fast by Merging Private and Public Clouds</a></p>

be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems
Laboratories* The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds
is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the
high-tech industry.* The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome
of the evolution of these games.* Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore
the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.* The game server is used both to
discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating
(by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the
client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might
seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role
means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the
server component.* Using multiple servers is a basic mechanism for scaling th</p><p>5 0.78164679 <a title="422-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-21-Playfish%27s_Social_Gaming_Architecture_-_50_Million_Monthly_Users_and_Growing.html">904 high scalability-2010-09-21-Playfish's Social Gaming Architecture - 50 Million Monthly Users and Growing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact
socially with friends usingPlayfishgames on social platforms like The
Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the
fastest growing segment of the game industry:social gaming, which is the love
child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early
adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud
servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by
why EA bought them for$300 millionand they think a$1 billion gameis possible):
building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile
gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve
systems, agile development and deployment, andselling virtual goodas a
business model.How can a small company make all this happen? To explain the
magic I interviewed Playfish's Jodi Moran, Senior Director of Engineering, and

<p>Introduction: Update:As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to
dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change.
What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's
link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better
yesterday and a better tomorrow.CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make
CAPTCHA work (Spammers Choose GMail). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't
really work because CAPTCHA solving markets (Inside India's CAPTCHA solving
economy) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken
CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game
over :-)Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the
CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is
with humans.Using Games to Get Humans to Do Work (like CAPTCHA) for FreeHow do

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.I have a problem I'd like to have your view on. I've
looked around a lot, and I haven't found a definite answer. The question is
this:Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of
users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open
source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will
cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft
licenses(OS, SQL Server, â&euro;Ś)?I am in charge of selecting the technology toolbox
for a startup which is going to build a scalable public web platform. I've
worked as a developer and database developer/admin (mainly as a DBA) using
different platforms and technologies, but my main focus is on Microsoft
technology. I've considered all other important factors for this decision, and
at the end, I always come back to the question of money. When I finish
developing the first st</p><p>3 0.85462987 <a title="422-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-28-Product%3A_Happy_%3D_Hadoop_%2B_Python.html">397 high scalability-2008-09-28-Product: Happy = Hadoop + Python</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Has a Java only Hadoop been getting you down? Now you can beHappy. Happy is
aframework for writing map-reduce programs for Hadoop using Jython. It files
off the sharp edges on Hadoop and makes writing map-reduce programs a breeze.
There's really no history yet on Happy, but I'm delighted at the idea of being
able to map-reduce inother languages. The more ways the better.From the
website:Happy is a framework that allows Hadoop jobs to be written and run in
Python 2.2 using Jython. It is aneasy way to write map-reduce programs for
Hadoop, and includes some new useful features as well.The current release
supports Hadoop 0.17.2.Map-reduce jobs in Happy are defined by sub-classing
happy.HappyJob and implementing amap(records, task) and reduce(key, values,
task) function. Then you create an instance of theclass, set the job
parameters (such as inputs and outputs) and call run().When you call run(),
Happy serializes your job instance and copies it and all accompanyinglibraries

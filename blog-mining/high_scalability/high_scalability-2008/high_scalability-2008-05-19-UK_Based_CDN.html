<p>Introduction: Update 17 :  Are Wireless Road Trains the Cure for Traffic Congestion?   BY   ADDY DUGDALE .  The concept of road trains--up to eight vehicles zooming down the road together--has long been considered a faster, safer, and greener way of traveling long distances by car 
 
 Update 16:  The first electric vehicle in the country  powered completely by ultracapacitors . The minibus can be fully recharged in fifteen minutes, unlike battery vehicles, which typically takes hours to recharge.
 
 Update 15:   How to Make UAVs Fully Autonomous . The Sense-and-Avoid system uses a four-megapixel camera on a pan tilt to detect obstacles from the ground. It puts red boxes around planes and birds, and blue boxes around movement that it determines is not an obstacle (e.g., dust on the lens).  Update 14:   ATNMBL is a concept vehicle  for 2040 that represents the end of driving and an alternative approach to car design.

<p>Introduction: Viddler is in the high quality Video as a Service business for a customer who wants to pay a fixed cost, be done with it, and just have it work. Similar to Blip and Ooyala, more focussed on business than YouTube. They serve thousands of business customers, including high traffic websites like FailBlog, Engadget, and Gawker.
 
Viddler is a good case to learn from because they are a small company trying to provide a challenging service in a crowded field. We are catching them just as they transitioning from a startup that began in one direction, as a YouTube competitor, and pivoted into a slightly larger company focussed on paying business customers.
 
Transition is the key word for Viddler: transitioning from a free YouTube clone to a high quality paid service. Transitioning from a few colo sites that didn't work well to a new higher quality datacenter. Transitioning from an architecture that was typical of a startup to one that features redundancy, high availability, and automation.

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100 using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that would otherwise take an eternity to make,  a pile of money to create, and an unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of services. The battle for the future is on.

<p>Introduction: Playing like the big boys may be getting cheaper. The big boys, like  YouTube , farm the serving of their most popular videos to a third party CDN. A lot of people were surprised YouTube didn't serve all their content themselves, but it makes sense. It allows them to keep up with demand without a large hit for infrastructure build out, much like leasing computers instead of buying them.
   
 The problem has been CDNs are expensive.  Om Malik reports in  Akamai & the CDN Price Wars  that may be changing. CDN service could be becoming affordable enough that you might consider using them as part of your scaling strategy.    Akamai , once the clear leader in the CDN field, is facing strong competition from the likes of Limelight Networks, Level 3, Internap, CDNetworks, Panther Express and EdgeCast Networks.  This  commoditization  may be bad for their stock prices, but it's good for website builders looking for new scaling strategies. EdgeCast, for example, passes on the cost savings when</p><p>3 0.78133035 <a title="324-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-23-State_of_the_CDN%3A_More_Traffic%2C_Stable_Prices%2C_More_Products%2C_Profits_-_Not_So_Much.html">1289 high scalability-2012-07-23-State of the CDN: More Traffic, Stable Prices, More Products, Profits - Not So Much</a></p>
<p>Introduction: CDNs ( content delivery networks ) are the secret shadow super powers behind the web and Dan Rayburn at   streamingmedia.com    is the go to investigative reporter for quality information on CDNs. Every year Dan has a Content Delivery Summit on all things CDN and those videos are    now available   . Dan also gives a kind of    state of the industry talk    where he does something wonderful, he gives real numbers and prices. Dan really knows his stuff and is an excellent speaker, so watch the video, but here’s my gloss on the state of the CDN so far this year: 
  
  Massive growth . Large customers are expecting 126% growth in video traffic over last year; medium size customers are seeing 48% traffic growth, small sized customer are seeing 73.3% traffic growth. 
   More traffic != More profit   . Traffic growth doesn’t lead to more profit because the traffic growth is concentrated in larger customers that can make the best deals.

<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novice   x   I am starting a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).      I have done some research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I have some basic knowledge on these.     Following are my requirements     1) My budget is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).   2) I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first 2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)   3) 90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.     Based on the above, could you please answer my following questions?       1) Can I go with just a good dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site gets big? Or do you think its wise</p><p>5 0.77033097 <a title="324-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-21-What_CDN_would_you_recommend%3F.html">576 high scalability-2009-04-21-What CDN would you recommend?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 10:     The Value of CDNs   by Mike Axelrod of Google.  Google implements a distributed content cache from within   large ISPs  . This allows them to serve content from the edge of the network and save bandwidth on the ISPs backbone.    Update 9:     Just Jump: Start using Clouds and CDNs  . Bob Buffone gives a really nice and practical tutorial of how to use CloudFront as your CDN.        Update 8:     Akamai’s Services Become Affordable for Anyone! Blazing Web Site Performance by Distribution Cloud  .   Distribution Cloud starts at $150 per month for access to the best content distribution network in the world and the leader of Content Distribution Networks.     Update 7:     Where Amazon’s Data Centers Are Located  ,   Expanding the Cloud: Amazon CloudFront  .   Why Amazon's CDN Offering Is No Threat To Akamai, Limelight or CDN Pricing  . Amazon has launched their CDN with "“low latency, high data transfer speeds, and no commitments.” The perfect relationship for many.

<p>Introduction: All,     I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers. I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.     Could anyone share their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube etc..?     Thank you,   Regards,   Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.98546338 <a title="324-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-UK_Based_CDN.html">324 high scalability-2008-05-19-UK Based CDN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,    I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK.  If they're outside the UK but have decent support then also include.  The service must be cheap and not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?     Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space.  Would S3 be a good starting point?  What is the service like?  I hear mixed reviews about it.     Many thanks,   Jim</p><p>4 0.97634333 <a title="324-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the application that will become critical over time.</p><p>5 0.96676016 <a title="324-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

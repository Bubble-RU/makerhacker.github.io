originally created with web services in mind, not cloud providers, but I think
it still works in an odd sort of way. Remember, anyone can fill out aprofile

<p>Introduction: There's some amount of debate whether Facebookreallycrossed over the one
trillion page view per month threshold. While one report says it did,another
respected firm says it did not; that its monthly page views are a mere 467
billion per month.In the big scheme of things, the discrepancy is somewhat
irrelevant, as neither show thetrueload on Facebook's infrastructure - which
is far more impressive a set of numbers than its externally measured "page
view" metric.  Mashable reported in "Facebook Surpasses 1 Trillion Pageviews
per Month" that the social networking giant saw "approximately 870 million
unique visitors in June and 860 million in July" and followed up with some per
visitor statistics, indicating "each visitor averaged approximately 1,160 page
views in July and 40 per visit -- enormous by any standard. Time spent on the
site was around 25 minutes per user."From an architectural standpoint it's
notjustabout the page views. It's about requests and responses, many of which

<p>Introduction: One of the best projects I've ever worked on was creating a large scale web
site publishing system that was almost entirely static. A large team of very
talented creatives made the art work, writers penned the content, and
designers generated templates. All assets were controlled in a database. Then
all that was extracted, after applying many different filters, to a static
site that was uploaded via ftp to dozens of web servers. It worked great.
Reliable, fast, cheap, and simple. Updates were a bit of a pain as it required
pushing a lot of files to a lot of servers, and that took time, but otherwise
a solid system.Alas, this elegant system was replaced with a new fangled
dynamic database based system. Content was pulled from a database using a
dynamic language generated front-end. With a recent series of posts from
Amazon's Werner Vogels, chronicling his experience of transforming his All
Things Distributed blog into a static site using S3's ability to serve web
pages, I get the pleasu</p><p>6 0.16076468 <a title="356-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-27-Video%3A_Storage_in_the_Cloud_at_Joyent.html">503 high scalability-2009-01-27-Video: Storage in the Cloud at Joyent</a></p>

<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,
we analyze latencies measured</p><p>3 0.8946566 <a title="356-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-12-The_Rise_of_the_Virtual_Cellular_Machines.html">826 high scalability-2010-05-12-The Rise of the Virtual Cellular Machines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

<p>Introduction: Several months ago I attended a Joyent presentation where the spokesman hinted
that Joyent had the chops to support a one billion page per month Facebook
Ruby on Rails application. Even under a few seconds of merciless grilling he
would not give up the name of the application. Now we have the big reveal: it
was LinkedIn'sBumper Stickerapp. For those not currently sticking things on
bumps, Bumper Sticker is quite surprisingly aviral media sharing application
that allows users to express their individuality by sticking small virtual
stickers on Facebook profiles. At the time I was quite curious how Joyent's
cloud approach could be leveraged for this kind of app. Now that they've
released a few details, we get to find out.Site:

<p>Introduction: Matt, from the ever excellentMySQL Performance Blog, decided to run a test
using a simple scenario drawn from his client experience in the gaming space.
The scenario: read a row based on a primary key, update the row, write it to
disk, and use the row to lookup another row. Matt ran three different tests
explained in a series of three different articles:MySQL and MySQL + Memcached,
Memcached Only, andTokyo Tyrant.The lovingly compiled details along with many
cool graphs are in the articles, but in general the lessons learned are:When
memcached hasenough memory(so records being accessed are in RAM), memcached +
MySQL can provide a10x performance boostover MySQL alone. When the RAM is too
small and hot records, those being accessed a lot, aren't in RAM, or perhaps
applications are doing a sequential scan of a table and the entire table isn't
cached, then memcached won't be the big bang improvement you may be hoping
for.When the database is removed and memcached serves both reads and writ</p><p>3 0.27932578 <a title="360-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-26-Marrying_memcached_and_NoSQL.html">927 high scalability-2010-10-26-Marrying memcached and NoSQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Memcached is one of the most common In-Memory cache implementation.  It was
originally developed by Danga Interactive for LiveJournal, but is now used by
many other sites as a side cache to speed up read mostly operations. It gained
popularity in the non-Java world, too, especially since it's a language-
neutral side cache for which few alternatives existed.  As a side-cache,
Memcache clients relies on the database as the system of record, The database
is still used for write,update and complex query operations.  Since the
memcached specification includes no query operations, memcached is not a
database alternative, unlike most of the NoSQL offerings. It also exclude
memcache from being a real solution for write scalability. As a result of that
many of the heavy sites started to move away from Memcache and replace it with
other NoSQL alternatives as noted in a recent highscalability post MySQL And
Memcached: End Of An Era?The transition away from memcached to NoSQL could
represent a la</p><p>4 0.2584821 <a title="360-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets_to_Fotolog%27s_Scaling_Success.html">106 high scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300
thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially
experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems
and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each
day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly
visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a
very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale
meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?Site:

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Michael Galpin inCache MoneyandCache Discussionslikes memcached for
it's expiry policy, complex graph data, process data, but says MySQL has many
advantages: SQL, Uniform Data Access, Write-through, Read-through,
Replication, Management, Cold starts, LRU eviction.Update:Dormando asksShould
you use memcached? Should you just shard mysql more?. The idea of caching is
the most important part of caching as it transports you beyond a simple CRUD
worldview. Plan for caching and sharding by properly abstracting data access
methods.Brace for change. Be ready to shard, be ready to cache. React and
change to what you push out which is actually popular, vs over planning and
wasting valuable time.Feedster's Franรงois Schiettecatte wondersifFotolog's 21

MySQL servers? He mentions Feedster was able to drop memcached once they
partitioned their data across more servers. The algorithm: partition until all

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>3 0.90125918 <a title="360-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy%3A_Break_Up_the_Memcache_Dog_Pile_.html">673 high scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy: Break Up the Memcache Dog Pile </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog
PileEffectinDog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails. Glenn
Franxman also has a Django solution inMintCache.Data is usually cached because
it's too expensive to calculate for every hit. Maybe it's a gnarly SQL query

<p>Introduction: As a tasty pairing withFacebook And Site Failures Caused By Complex, Weakly
Interacting, Layered Systems, is another excellent tale of caching gone wrong
by Peter Zaitsev, in an exciting twin billing:Cache Miss Stormand More on
dangers of the caches. This is fascinating case where the cause turned out to
be software upgrade that ran long because it had to be rolled back. During the
long recovery time many of the cache entries timed out. When the database came
back, slam, all the clients queried the database to repopulate the cache and
bad things happened to the database. The solution was equally interesting: So
the immediate solution to bring the system up was surprisingly simple. We just
had to get traffic on the system in stages allowing Memcache to be warmed up.
There were no code which would allow to do it on application side so we did it
on MySQL side instead. "SET GLOBAL max_connections=20" to limit number of
connections to MySQL and so let application to err when it tries to put</p><p>5 0.86018741 <a title="360-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-05-Product%3A_Tugela_Cache.html">174 high scalability-2007-12-05-Product: Tugela Cache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tugela Cacheis a cache system like memecached, but instead of storing data
just in RAM, it stores data in the file system using a b-tree. You trade
latency in order to have a very large cache. It's useful for sites that have
caching requirements that exceed their available memory. It uses the same wire
protocol asmemcachedso it can be dropped in without a hassle. From the
website:As large MediaWiki deployments may gain performance using Memcached,
at some level cost of RAM to store all objects becomes too high. In order to
balance resource usage and make more use of our Apache server disks, Tugela,
the distributed cached on-disk hash database, has arrived.Tugela Cache is
derived from Memcached. Much of the code remains the same, but notably, these
changes:Internal slab allocator replaced by BerkeleyDB B-Tree database.Expiry
policy management moved to external program tugela-expireMuch statistics code
made obsolete.An interesting point brought up in the comments is using

<p>Introduction: Someone reading my now ancientC++ coding standardrecommendation for using
doxygen to automatically generate documentation from source code, asked a
great question:I've often considered using doxygen, I always ask myself - is
this really useful? Would I use it if I were new to a project? Would
programmers working on the project use it?I'll rephrase their question to more
conveniently express a point I've thought a lot about: Why do companies put so
little effort into automating their own development process to make
development easier?It's like the hair stylist whose own hair looks like
someone cut it using a late night infomercial vacuum cleaner attachment. Or
it's like the interior decorator whose own house looks like a monk's
cell.Software organizations rarely build software to make developing software
easier. Why is that?Because there are three ways changes are made in an
organization:Top Dog- Someone so high up in the org chart you would need a
telescope to see him decided because h</p><p>2 0.97028112 <a title="360-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-04-11_Strategies_to_Rock_Your_Startup%E2%80%99s_Scalability_in_2010.html">757 high scalability-2010-01-04-11 Strategies to Rock Your Startup’s Scalability in 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest posting by Marty Abbott and Michael Fisher, authors ofThe Art
of Scalability. I'm still reading their book and will have an interview with
them a little later.  If 2010 is the year that you've decided to kickoff your
startup or if you've already got something off the ground and are expecting
double or triple digit growth, this list is for you.  We all
wanttheattentionof usersto achieve viral growth but as manycan attest, too
much attention can bring a startup to its knees. If you've used Twitter for
any amount of time you're sure to have seen the "Fail Whale", which is so
often seen that it has its ownfan club. Take a look at the graph below from
Compete.com showing Twitter's unique visitors. One can argue that limitations
in the product offering have as much to do with the flattening of growthover
the past six monthsas does the availability,butit's hard to believe the
inability of users to actually use the service has not hindered growth. What
should you do if you want</p><p>3 0.96698689 <a title="360-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-04-Alternative_Memcache_Usage%3A_A_Highly_Scalable%2C_Highly_Available%2C_In-Memory_Shard_Index.html">482 high scalability-2009-01-04-Alternative Memcache Usage: A Highly Scalable, Highly Available, In-Memory Shard Index</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While working with Memcache the other night, it dawned on me that it’s usage
as a distributed caching mechanism was really just one of many ways to use it.
That there are in fact many alternative usages that one could find for
Memcache if they could just realize what Memcache really is at its core – a
simple distributed hash-table – is an important point worthy of further
discussion.To be clear, when I say “simple”, by no means am I implying that
Memcache’s implementation is simple, just that the ideas behind it are such.
Think about that for a minute. What else could we use a simple distributed
hash-table for, besides caching? How about using it as an alternative to the
traditional shard lookup method we used in our Master Index Lookup scalability
strategy, discussed previously here.</p><p>4 0.96484739 <a title="360-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-17-Paper%3A_Consistent_Hashing_and_Random_Trees%3A_Distributed_Caching_Protocols_for_Relieving_Hot_Spots_on_the_World_Wide_Web.html">280 high scalability-2008-03-17-Paper: Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Consistent hashing is one of those ideas that really puts the science in
computer science and reminds us why all those really smart people spend years
slaving over algorithms. Consistent hashing is "a scheme that provides hash
table functionality in a way that the addition or removal of one slot does not
significantly change the mapping of keys to slots" and was originally a way of
distributing requests among a changing population of web servers. My first
reaction to the idea was "wow, that's really smart" and I sadly realized I
would never come up with something so elegant. I then immediately saw
applications for it everywhere. And consistent hashing is used everywhere:
distributed hash tables, overlay networks, P2P, IM, caching, and CDNs. Here's
the abstract from the original paper and after the abstract are some links to
a few very good articles with accessible explanations of consistent hashing
and its applications in the real world.breakAbstract:We describe a family of

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.If datacenters are the
new castles, then what will be the new gunpowder? As soon asgunpowdercame on
the scene, castles, which are defensive structures, quickly became the
future's cold, drafty hotels. Gunpowder fueled cannon balls make short work of
castle walls.There's a long history of "gunpowder" type inventions in the tech
industry. PCs took out the timeshare model. The cloud is taking out the PC
model. There must be something that will take out the cloud.Right now it's
hard to believe the cloud will one day be no more. They seem so much the
future, but something will transcend the cloud. We even have a law that says
so:Bell's Law of Computer Classeswhich holds thatroughly every decade a new,
lower priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform,
network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new
industry.Acomputer</p><p>6 0.95786965 <a title="360-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Think_of_Latency_as_a_Pseudo-permanent_Network_Partition.html">879 high scalability-2010-08-12-Think of Latency as a Pseudo-permanent Network Partition</a></p>

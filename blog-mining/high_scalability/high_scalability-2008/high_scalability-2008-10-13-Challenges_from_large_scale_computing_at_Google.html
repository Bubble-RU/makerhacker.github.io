<p>Introduction: The recent Data-Intensive Computing Symposium brought together experts in
system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific
applications, and information-based applications to better understand existing
capabilities in the development and application of large-scale computing
systems, and to explore future opportunities.Google Fellow Jeff Dean had a
very interesting presentation on Handling Large Datasets at Google: Current
Systems and Future Directions. He discussed:• Hardware infrastructure•
Distributed systems infrastructure:–Scheduling system–GFS–BigTable–MapReduce•
Challenges and Future Directions–Infrastructure that spans all
datacenters–More automationIt is really like a "How does Google work"

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally
successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips
with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these
successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to
multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are
reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we
are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be
squashed.To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a
corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer
2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use
symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to
work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore
designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core
efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtaining</p><p>5 0.13212302 <a title="409-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-22-Strategy%3A_Google_Sends_Canary_Requests_into_the_Data_Mine.html">946 high scalability-2010-11-22-Strategy: Google Sends Canary Requests into the Data Mine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Google runs queries against thousands of in-memory index nodes in parallel and
then merges the results. One of the interesting problems with this approach,
explains Google's Jeff Dean in thislecture at Stanford, is theQuery of Death.A
query can cause a program to fail because of bugs or various other issues.
This means that a single query can take down an entire cluster of machines,
which is not good for availability and response times, as it takes quite a
while for thousands of machines to recover. Thus the Query of Death. New
queries are always coming into the system and when you are always rolling out
new software, it's impossible to completely get rid of the problem.Two
solutions:Test against logs. Google replays a month's worth of logs to see if
any of those queries kill anything. That helps, but Queries of Death may still
happen.Send a canary request. A request is sent to one machine. If the request
succeeds then it will probably succeed on all machines, so go ahead with the
quer</p><p>6 0.12108809 <a title="409-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-22-How_can_we_spark_the_movement_of_research_out_of_the_Ivory_Tower_and_into_production%3F.html">863 high scalability-2010-07-22-How can we spark the movement of research out of the Ivory Tower and into production?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The world has changed. And some things that should not have been forgotten,
were lost. I found these words from the Lord of the Rings echoing in my head
as I listened to a fascinating presentation by Luiz Andre Barroso,
Distinguished Engineer at Google, concerning Google's legendary past, golden
present, and apocryphal future. His talk, Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering
the Teenage Decade, was given at theFederated Computing Research Conference.
Luiz clearly knows his stuff and was early at Google, so he has a deep and
penetrating perspective on the technology. There's much to learn from, think
about, and build.Lord of the Rings applies at two levels. At the change level,
Middle Earth went throughthree ages. While listening to Luiz talk, it seems so
has Google: Batch (indexes calculated every month), Warehouse (the datacenter
is the computer), and Instant (make it all real-time). At the "what was
forgot" level, in the Instant Age section of the talk,  a common theme was the

<p>Introduction: In a People of ACM interview withSanjay Ghemawat, a Google Fellow in the
Systems Infrastructure Group (MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, GFS, etc), talks
about a few interesting aspects of Google's culture.What Made Google
GoogleProgress is a modern idea. The conviction that future can be changed for
the better through individual advancement and action has over hundreds of
years driven an exponential growth in the technome.What drives progress?
Challenges. Individuals finding and defeating a challenge. There's usually
something someone wants to do so badly that they put in the effort, the
thought, and the money into solving all the problems. The results are often
something new and amazing.And so it was for Google:The main motivation behind
the development of much of Google's infrastructure was the challenge of
keeping up with ever-growing data sets. For example, at the same time Google's
web search was gaining usage very quickly, we were also scaling up the size of
our index dramatically a</p><p>4 0.76391864 <a title="409-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-13-Google_Reveals_New_MapReduce_Stats.html">211 high scalability-2008-01-13-Google Reveals New MapReduce Stats</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Google Operating System blog has aninteresting poston Google's scale based
on an updated version of Google's paper about MapReduce.The input data for
some of the MapReduce jobs run in September 2007 was 403,152 TB (terabytes),
the average number of machines allocated for a MapReduce job was 394, while
the average completion time was 6 minutes and a half. The paper mentions that
Google's indexing system processes more than 20 TB of raw data.breakNiall
Kennedy calculates that the average MapReduce job runs across a $1 million
hardware infrastructure, assuming that Google still uses the same cluster
configurations from 2004: two 2 GHz Intel Xeon processors with Hyper-Threading
enabled, 4 GB of memory, two 160 GB IDE hard drives and a gigabit Ethernet
link.Greg Linden notices that Google's infrastructure is an important
competitive advantage. "Anyone at Google can process terabytes of data. And
they can get their results back in about 10 minutes, so they can iterate on it

<p>Introduction: From Greg Linden on a talk Google Fellow Jeff Dean gave last week at
University of Washington Computer Science titled "Research Challenges Inspired
by Large-Scale Computing at Google" :Coming away from the talk, the biggest
points for me were the considerable interest in reducing costs (especially
reducing power costs), the suggestion that the Google cluster may eventually
contain 10M machines at 1k locations, and the call to action for researchers
on distributed systems and databases to think orders of magnitude bigger than
they often are, not about running on hundreds of machines in one location, but
hundreds of thousands of machines across many locations.</p><p>2 0.93439209 <a title="409-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-06-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_6%2C_2012.html">1223 high scalability-2012-04-06-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 6, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed

<p>Introduction: Update:VcubeV- an OpenVPN-based solution designed to build and operate a
multisourced infrastructure.True high availability requires a presence in
multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation
like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys
can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers. Cloud
computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling
the playing field. Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk
by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost, Mosso and other
providers.The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk
amongst the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy
Samovskiy in his Linux Journal article titledBuilding aMultisourced
Infrastructure Using OpenVPN.breakDmitriy's idea is to create a secure UDP

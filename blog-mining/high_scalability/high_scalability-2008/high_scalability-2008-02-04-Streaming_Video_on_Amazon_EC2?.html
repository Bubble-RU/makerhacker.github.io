Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai

different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available

<p>Introduction: The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the
hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming
reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality
augmentation, live crab (fresh and local), and live event publishing. One of
the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video
broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a broadcaster and a
consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you
can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a
time shift war. The resources and the engineering needed to make this happened
must be substantial. How do you do that?To find out I talked to Kyle Vogt,
Justin.tv Founder and VP of Engineering. Justin.tv certainly has the numbers.

<p>Introduction: Hi,I am building a video-sharing site and I'm looking for an efficient way to
update video views count.The easiest way would be to perform an SQL update to
increase the "views" counter every time a video is viewed, but naturally I
want to avoid DB write access as much as possible.I am looking for an
efficient temporary storage to which I could connect and say "increment views
of video X". Every so often I would save the changes to my main database, and
remove the counter from this temporary storage.I am having a hard time finding
such temporary storage, however. My first thought was memcache, but it's not
ideal as I wouldn't like to lose the data if memcache goes down. Also,
memcache's increment command requires that the key is already present - that
means that every time a video is viewed, I would have to check if the key
already exists in memcache, before I can actually send the increment
command.What do people use to solve this kind of issues?Kind regards,Tomasz</p><p>6 0.62659085 <a title="239-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting_and_CDN_for_startup_video_sharing_site.html">181 high scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting and CDN for startup video sharing site</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the benefits of web applications is that they are generally
transported via TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol designed to
assure delivery. TCP has a variety of native mechanisms through which delivery
issues can be addressed - from window sizes to selective acks to idle time
specification to ramp up parameters. All these technical knobs and buttons
serve as a way for operators and administrators to tweak the protocol, often
at run time, to ensure the exchange of requests and responses upon which web
applications rely. This is unlike UDP, which is more of a "fire and forget"
protocol in which the server doesn't really care if you receive the data or
not.Now, voice and streaming video and audio over the web has always leveraged
UDP and thus it has always been highly sensitive to jitter. Jitter is, without
getting into layer one (physical) jargon, an undesirable delay in the
otherwise consistent delivery of packets. It causes the delay of and sometimes

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip
than a</p><p>4 0.85290647 <a title="239-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-24-INFOSCALE_2009_in_June_in_Hong_Kong.html">580 high scalability-2009-04-24-INFOSCALE 2009 in June in Hong Kong</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In case you are interested here's the info:INFOSCALE 2009: The 4th
International ICST Conference on Scalable Information Systems. 10-12 June
2009, Hong Kong, China.In the last few years, we have seen the proliferation
of the use of heterogeneous distributed systems, ranging from simple Networks
of Workstations, to highly complex grid computing environments. Such
computational paradigms have been preferred due to their reduced costs and
inherent scalability, which pose many challenges to scalable systems and
applications in terms of information access, storage and retrieval.Grid
computing, P2P technology, data and knowledge bases, distributed information
retrieval technology and networking technology should all converge to address
the scalability concern. Furthermore, with the advent of emerging computing
architectures - e.g. SMTs, GPUs, Multicores. - the importance of designing
techniques explicitly targeting these systems is becoming more and more
important.INFOSCALE 2009 will focus o</p><p>5 0.8418594 <a title="239-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-10-ElasticSearch_-_Open_Source%2C_Distributed%2C_RESTful_Search_Engine.html">775 high scalability-2010-02-10-ElasticSearch - Open Source, Distributed, RESTful Search Engine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: ElasticSearchis an open source, distributed, RESTful search engine built on
top ofLucene. Itsfeaturesinclude:Distributed and Highly Available Search
Engine.Each index is fully sharded with a configurable number of shards.Each
shard can have zero or more replicas.Read / Search operations performed on
either replica shard.Multi Tenant with Multi Types.Support for more than one
index.Support for more than one type per index.Index level configuration
(number of shards, index storage, ...).Various set of APIs.HTTP RESTful
API.Native Java API.All APIs perform automatic node operation
rerouting.Document oriented.No need for upfront schema definition.Schema can
be defined per type for customization of the indexing process.Reliable,
Asynchronous Write Behind for long term persistency.(Near) Real Time
Search.Built on top of Lucene.Each shard is a fully functional Lucene
index.All the power of Lucene easily exposed through simple configuration /
plugins.Per operation consistency.Single document l</p><p>6 0.83750081 <a title="239-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-10-Saying_Yes_to_NoSQL%3B_Going_Steady_with_Cassandra_at_Digg.html">793 high scalability-2010-03-10-Saying Yes to NoSQL; Going Steady with Cassandra at Digg</a></p>

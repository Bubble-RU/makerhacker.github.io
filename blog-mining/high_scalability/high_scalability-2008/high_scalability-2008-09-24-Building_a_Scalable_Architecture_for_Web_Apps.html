<p>Introduction: ProfessorDavid Malangives a very good lecture on scalability for dynamic
websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a
great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching
style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible
explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal
scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load
balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high
availability.Watch it onAcademic EarthThis is one lecture in a series of 13
lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to: build dynamic
websites with Ajax and with Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP); set up
domain names with DNS; structure pages with XHTML and CSS how to program in
JavaScript and PHP; configure Apacheand MySQL; design and query databases with
SQL; use Ajax with both XML andJSON;  build mashups.For thelecture notesgo to

mean several things. Most developers are primarily concerned with are response
time and scalability. Response TimeIs the time taken by web application to
process request and return response. Applications should respond to requests
(response time) within acceptable duration. If application is taking beyond
the acceptable time, it is said to be non-performing or degraded.

<p>Introduction: By George Palmer of 3dogsbark.com. Covers:* How you start out: shared hosting,
web server DB on same machine. Move two 2 machines. Minimal code changes.*
Scaling the database. Add read slaves on their own machines. Then master-
master setup. Still minimal code changes.* Scaling the web server. Load
balance against multiple application servers. Application servers scale but
the database doesn't.* User clusters. Partition and allocate users to their
own dedicated cluster. Requires substantial code changes.* Caching. A large
percentage of hits are read only. Use reverse proxy, memcached, and language
specific cache.* Elastic architectures. Based on Amazon EC2. Start and stop
instances on demand. For global applications keep a cache on each continent,
assign users to clusters by location, maintain app servers on each continent,
use transaction replication software if you must replicate your site globally.</p><p>6 0.68196905 <a title="392-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-18-Real_World_Web%3A_Performance_%26_Scalability.html">684 high scalability-2009-08-18-Real World Web: Performance & Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: By Bhavin Turakhia CEO, Directi. Covers:* Why scalability is important. Viral
marketing can result in instant success. With RSS/Ajax/SOA number of requests
grow exponentially with user base. Goal is to build a web 2.0 app that can
server millions of users with zero downtime.* Introduction to the variables.
Scalability, performance, responsiveness, availability, downtime impact, cost,
maintenance effort.* Introduction to the factors. Platform selection,
hardware, application design, database architecture, deployment architecture,
storage architecture, abuse prevention, monitoring mechanisms, etc.* Building
our own scalable architecture in incremental steps: vertical scaling, vertical
partitioning, horizontal scaling, horizontal partitioning, etc. First buy
bigger. Then deploy each service on a separate node. Then increase the number
of nudes and load balance. Deal with session management. Remove single points
of failure. Use a shared nothing cluster. Choice of master-slave multi-master</p><p>2 0.96482611 <a title="392-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-05-Handling_of_Session_for_a_site_running_from_more_than_1_data_center.html">240 high scalability-2008-02-05-Handling of Session for a site running from more than 1 data center</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If using a DB to store session(used by some app server, ex.. websphere), how
would an enterprise class site that is housed in 2 different data centers(that
are live/live) maintain the session between both data centers.The problem as I
see it is that since each data center has their own session database, if I was
to flip the users to only access Data Center 1(by changing the DNS records for
the site or some other Load balancing technique) then that would cause all
previous Data Center 2 users to lose their session. What would be some pure
hardware based solutions to this that are being used now? That way the
applications supporting the web site can be abstracted from this.As I see now,
a solution is to possibly have the session databases in both centers some how
replicate the data to each other. I just don't see the best way to even
accomplish this you are not even guraunteed that the session ID's will be
unique since it's 2 different Application Server tiers(again websphere). Not

<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: Brian Zimmer, architect at travel startup Yapta, highlights some worst
practices jeopardizing the growth and scalability of a system:* The Golden
Hammer. Forcing a particular technology to work in ways it was not intended is
sometimes counter-productive. Using a database to store key-value pairs is one
example. Another example is using threads to program for concurrency.*
Resource Abuse. Manage the availability of shared resources because when they
fail, by definition, their failure is experienced pervasively rather than in
isolation. For example, connection management to the database through a thread
pool.* Big Ball of Mud. Failure to manage dependencies inhibits agility and
scalability.* Everything or Something. In both code and application dependency
management, the worst practice is not understanding the relationships and
formulating a model to facilitate their management. Failure to enforce
diligent control is a contributing scalability inhibiter.* Forgetting to check
the time. To</p><p>6 0.94769591 <a title="392-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_3%2C_2012.html">1187 high scalability-2012-02-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 3, 2012</a></p>

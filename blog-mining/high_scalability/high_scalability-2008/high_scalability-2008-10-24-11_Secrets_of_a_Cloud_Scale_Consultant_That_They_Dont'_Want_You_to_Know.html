it still works in an odd sort of way. Remember, anyone can fill out aprofile

I worked at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch startup. Over a
delicious Christmas punch my grandma asked me what I did for a living that I
could afford such extravagantly inexpensive gifts. Always so subtle. I
explained I worked on an ATM switch. Mistake. She sniffed, said that's nice,
and asked me why the Automated Teller Machine ate her bank card that morning.
No matter how hard I tried I couldn't convince her I didn't work on bank ATMs.

<p>Introduction: Hi all,I'm a big fan of http://highscalability.com/ and have been looking in
my current development to decompose my application along functional boundaries
as a route to being able to scale out the server side, specifically the
database layer. The problem comes when there are links between the data in
different components, ie one component holds all the user data, but another
component needs to reference a user as being an owner of some piece of data.
I'm currently doing this by holding the primary key information for each side
of the the link (as you would if they all lived in a single database), but
this link table needs to exist in both components to allow lookups to be done
in either direction, ie 'get the things a specific user owns' and 'get the
owners of this specific thing' would each use different components. The
alternative to this would be to store the link data in only one of the
components, but then the reverse lookups would require 2 calls instead of just
one.My question</p><p>5 0.098739579 <a title="428-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Useful_Cloud_Computing_Blogs.html">445 high scalability-2008-11-14-Useful Cloud Computing Blogs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How many times have you been called in the middle of the night by your
operation guys telling you that your application throws some odd red alerts?
How many times did you found out that when those issues happens you don't have
enough information to analyze this incident? have you tried to increase the
log level just to find out that your problem became even worse - now your
application throws tons of information in a continues basis most of which is
complete garbage...The current separation between the way we implement our
application and the way we manage it leads to many of this ridicules
situations. Cloud makes those things even worse.Inthis posti suggest an
alternative approach. Why don't we run our application the way we run our
business? I refer to this approach as the "interactive cloud" where our
application behaves just like our project team and the operations just like
our managers. As with our business our application would need to take more
responsibility to the way it runs</p><p>3 0.70744371 <a title="428-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-06-05-Cloud_Architecture_Revolution.html">1654 high scalability-2014-06-05-Cloud Architecture Revolution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The introduction of cloud technologies is not a simple evolution of existing
ones, but a real revolution.  Like all revolutions, it changes the points of
views and redefines all the meanings. Nothing is as before.  This post wants
to analyze some key words and concepts, usually used in traditional
architectures, redefining them according the standpoint of the cloud.
Understanding the meaning of new words is crucial to grasp the essence of a
pure cloud architecture.<>THOMAS REID, Essays on the
Intellectual Powers of ManNowadays, it is required to challenge the limits of
traditional architectures that go beyond the normal concepts of scalability
and support millions of users (What's Up 500 Million) billions of transactions

Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the
relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment
and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.Update 2:Heroku
Architecture. A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests
flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a
Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based
routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your
application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors. Dynos
themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware,
Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as
an application caching layer.Update: Aaron WorshamInterview with James

<p>Introduction: Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs
in a private cloud or data center and bursts into a public cloud when the
demand for computing capacity spikes. The advantage of such a hybrid cloud
deployment is that an organization only pays for extra compute resources when
they are needed. (Source: SearchCloudComputing)Neal Sample the former CTO -
X.commerce at eBay gave an interesting talk last year on the economic benefit
of Cloud Bursting. Neal pointed out eBay traffic statistics and showed some
real numbers of the business impact of bursting peak load activities using on-
demand cloud resources as presented in the diagram from his talk.In order to
use cloud bursting effectively we need to address the following set of
challenges:Workload migration- specifically the ability to clone our
application environment in a consistent way across sites in an on demand
fashion.Data Synchronization- The ability to maintain real time copy of the

<p>Introduction: OK, there is no "they" and "they" wouldn't care if you knew anyway. After all,
this isn't a blog about really important stuff like investing, acne cures, or
cheap natural cleansing products.But the secrets are real. Super cloud scaling

Split queries between updates and deletes from the startMonitoring process,
resources, and uptime- Process Monitoring, Resource Monitoring, UpTime
MonitoringPerformance Testing and Capacity Planning- Can't make good decisions
without doing some degree of Performance Testing and Capacity planning.Static
vs. Dynamic Content splitting / CDN- Reverse Proxy, Splitting Static and

<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the
Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that
provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It
also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke
about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week - here is the summary
of that presentation.ďťżhttp://gojko.net/2010/01/25/designing-applications-for-

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly
speaking,</p><p>5 0.8930037 <a title="428-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-09-Applications_as_Virtual_States.html">790 high scalability-2010-03-09-Applications as Virtual States</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.As I was writingan
articleon the architecture of theStorm Botnet, I couldn't help but notice the
deep similarity of how Storm works and changes we're seeing in the evolution
of political systems. In particular, the rise of thevirtual-state. As crazy as
this may sound, I think this is also the direction applications will need
follow to survive in a complex world of billions of compute devices.You may
have already heard ofvirtual corporations. Virtual corporations are companies
with limited office space, a distributed workforce, and production facilities
located wherever it is profitable to locate them. The idea is to stay lean and
compete using therapid development and introduction of new products into high
value-added markets. If you spot a market opportunity with a small time
window, building your own factories and hiring and engineering team simply

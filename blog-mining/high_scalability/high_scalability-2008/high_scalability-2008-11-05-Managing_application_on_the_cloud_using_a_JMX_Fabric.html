<p>Introduction: In my lastpost, I outlined considerations that need to be taken into account
when choosing between a centralized and federated security model. So, how do
we implement the chosen model?Based on a real-world case study, I will outline
a Kerberos architecture that enables cutting-edge collaborative research

<p>Introduction: The way this game is played is you read a few statements on some hot topics
below. If you agree with a statement then you "take it"; if you disagree then
you "leave it." And if you are so moved please write a convincing comment as
to why. Got it?Snowden vs. the State.Snowden represents true the spirit of
freedom and is not a threat to all we hold dear.Walled Garden vs. Federated
Freedom.The Walled Garden has won the last decade. The cycle of life will
return the balance and federated services will once again win the day.Mobile +
messaging vs. Le Web.Mobile + messaging is eating search and the web, changing
the way things are found, discovered, and bought.Fiat vs.
Cryptocurrency.BitCoin has had its 400 million dollars of fame, it's on the
way out, a tulip gone out of bloom.True Detective vs. The Field.True Detective
is the best show on TV, ever.

<p>Introduction: Searching around the HS website I noticed that there are no articles regarding
db2, which has an express edition, free of charge and from what I know there
aren't any restrictions.Being a powerful database system I thought it could
make be an alternative to MySQL, PostgreSQL databases.Here is the IBM
statement:"DB2 Express Edition for Community (DB2 Express-C) is a no charge
data server for use in development and deployment. DB2 Express-C supports a
full range of APIs, drivers, and interfaces for application development
including PHP, C/C++, and .NET. In addition, DB2 Express-C V9 contains
advanced XML features. DB2 Express-C provides ISVs an ideal starting database
server for Web, enterprise, and eBusiness applications.This IBM Redbook
provides fundamentals of DB2 application development with DB2 Express-C. It
covers the DB2 Express-C installation and configuration for application
development and skills and techniques for building DB2 applications with XML,

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>5 0.64156121 <a title="438-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-02-The_case_against_ORM_Frameworks_in_High_Scalability_Architectures.html">235 high scalability-2008-02-02-The case against ORM Frameworks in High Scalability Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let me begin by saying that I have used and continue to use various ORM
frameworks such as hibernate, ibatis, propel and activerecord in applications
and websites that have a user base ranging from a couple hundred to 500k
users. Especially for projects that have to be up and running in a short
duration of time, ORM frameworks significantly reduce the effort required to
manipulate and persist OOP objects by providing time saving facilities such as
automatically generated model objects, integrated unit testing, secure
variable substitution, etc. Hibernate even supports horizontal data
partitioning via Hibernate Shards.However, the lay of the land is
significantly different in the rarefied space occupied by applications needing
to support millions of users. Profiling an application at this level and
paying particular attention to the operations needed to move data to and from
the database, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the operations
are API related, whereby the ORM fr</p><p>6 0.63627738 <a title="438-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-26-Web_2.0_Killed_the_Middleware_Star.html">1087 high scalability-2011-07-26-Web 2.0 Killed the Middleware Star</a></p>

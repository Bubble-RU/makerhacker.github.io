<p>Introduction: In case you are interested here's the info:INFOSCALE 2009: The 4th
International ICST Conference on Scalable Information Systems. 10-12 June
2009, Hong Kong, China.In the last few years, we have seen the proliferation
of the use of heterogeneous distributed systems, ranging from simple Networks
of Workstations, to highly complex grid computing environments. Such
computational paradigms have been preferred due to their reduced costs and
inherent scalability, which pose many challenges to scalable systems and
applications in terms of information access, storage and retrieval.Grid
computing, P2P technology, data and knowledge bases, distributed information
retrieval technology and networking technology should all converge to address
the scalability concern. Furthermore, with the advent of emerging computing
architectures - e.g. SMTs, GPUs, Multicores. - the importance of designing
techniques explicitly targeting these systems is becoming more and more
important.INFOSCALE 2009 will focus o</p><p>3 0.13046418 <a title="322-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Well, not exactly Fishin', I'll be on vacation starting today and I'll be back
late November. I won't be posting anything new, so we'll all have a break.
Disappointing, I know, but fear not, I will be posting some oldies for your
re-enjoyment.And If you've ever wanted to write an article for
HighScalability, this would be a great time :-) I especially need help on
writingStuff the Internet Says on Scalabilityas I will be reading the
Interwebs on a much reduced schedule. Shock! Horror! So if the spirit moves
you, please write something.My connectivity in Italy will probably be good, so
I will check in and approve articles on a regular basis. Ciao...</p><p>6 0.077524833 <a title="322-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-01-What_Will_Kill_the_Cloud%3F.html">768 high scalability-2010-02-01-What Will Kill the Cloud?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so
I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if
a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have
attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If
you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in
the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please
comment on that too.Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of
them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade
away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these
days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work.
Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people
do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not. Taking all
that wisdom and stuffing it into a presentations is surprisingly hard wor</p><p>4 0.57900602 <a title="322-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-22-The_high_scalability_community.html">220 high scalability-2008-01-22-The high scalability community</a></p>

architecture. For us building high scalability solutions from the west coast
of (tiny) Norway good input on the subject isn't always abundant.Which leads
me to my next question; Are there any events or conferences on high
scalability / SaaS in the US or internationally that any of you would
recommend architects or data center managers to attend?</p><p>5 0.5512684 <a title="322-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-09-Paper%3A_Propagation_Networks%3A_A_Flexible_and_Expressive_Substrate_for_Computation_.html">839 high scalability-2010-06-09-Paper: Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation Propagation Networks: A
Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation, offers to help us break
free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of
autonomous but interconnected machines.  We can do this byorganizing
computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of
which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the
network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the
structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.The abstract from
his thesis is:In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of
computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The
traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large
memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with
computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected
with stateful storage cells. In so</p><p>6 0.53766721 <a title="322-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-25-Stuff_to_Watch_from_Surge_2010.html">1047 high scalability-2011-05-25-Stuff to Watch from Surge 2010</a></p>

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>2 0.96132332 <a title="322-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to
start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their
application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I
am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I
plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need
to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure
and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the
application that will become critical over time.</p><p>3 0.94999421 <a title="322-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-11-FTP_Sanity%3A_Redundancy%2C_archiving%2C_consolidation..html">208 high scalability-2008-01-11-FTP Sanity: Redundancy, archiving, consolidation.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Limelight says 95% of Mobile Video Views Take Place in First 90 Days and 88.8
percent of views take place in the first 30 days.Since a lot of people are
working with video, which is expensive to store and serve, the implication:
there's little need to keep your video close to the user or on a CDN after 30
days.</p><p>5 0.94076955 <a title="322-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO of  Parallel Universe , a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time applications. 
 
A little over a month ago, we open-sourced a new in-memory data grid called  Galaxy . An in-memory data grid, or IMDG, is a clustered data storage and processing middleware that uses RAM as the authoritative and primary storage, and distributes data over a cluster for purposes of data and processing scalability and high-availability. A common feature of IMDGs is co-location of code and data, meaning that application code runs on all cluster nodes, each instance processing those data items residing in the local node's RAM.
 
While quite a few commercial and open-source IMDGs are available (like Terracotta, Gigaspaces, Oracle Coherence, GemFire, Websphere eXtreme Scale, Infinispan and Hazelcast), Galaxy has adopted a completely different architecture from all other IMDGs, to service some usage scenarios ill-fitted to the othe</p><p>5 0.066988491 <a title="215-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Build_an_Infinitely_Scalable_Infrastructure_for_%24100_Using_Amazon_Services.html">38 high scalability-2007-07-30-Build an Infinitely Scalable Infrastructure for $100 Using Amazon Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100 using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that would otherwise take an eternity to make,  a pile of money to create, and an unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of services. The battle for the future is on.

<p>Introduction: From their website:   Condor  is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial or parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user upon completion.  While providing functionality similar to that of a more traditional batch queueing system, Condor's novel architecture allows it to succeed in areas where traditional scheduling systems fail. Condor can be used to manage a cluster of dedicated compute nodes (such as a "Beowulf" cluster). In addition, unique mechanisms enable Condor to effectively harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop workstations. For instance, Condor can be configured to only use desktop machines where the keyboard</p><p>3 0.72971493 <a title="215-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-13-Product%3A_Gearman_-_Open_Source_Message_Queuing_System.html">491 high scalability-2009-01-13-Product: Gearman - Open Source Message Queuing System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   New Gearman Server & Library in C, MySQL UDFs .   Gearman  is an open source  message queuing  system that makes it easy to do distributed job processing using multiple languages.  With Gearman you:  farm out work to other machines, dispatching function calls to machines that are better suited to do work, to do work in parallel, to load balance lots of function calls, to call functions between languages, spread CPU usage around your network .   Gearman is used by companies like LiveJournal, Yahoo!, and Digg. Digg, for example, runs 300,000 jobs a day through Gearman without any issues. Most large sites use something similar. Why would anyone ever even need a message queuing system?
   
 Message queuing is a handy way to move work off your web servers (like image manipulation),  to generate thousands of documents in the background, to run the multiple requests in parallel needed to build a web page, or to perform tasks that can comfortably be run in the background and not part</p><p>4 0.7166847 <a title="215-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-15-ZooKeeper_-_A_Reliable%2C_Scalable_Distributed_Coordination_System_.html">350 high scalability-2008-07-15-ZooKeeper - A Reliable, Scalable Distributed Coordination System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: ZooKeeper  is a  high available and reliable coordination system. Distributed applications use ZooKeeper to store and mediate updates key configuration information. ZooKeeper can be used for leader election, group membership, and configuration maintenance.  In addition  ZooKeeper can be used  for event notification, locking, and as a priority queue mechanism. It's a sort of  central nervous system for distributed systems where the role of the brain is played by the coordination service, axons are the network, processes are the monitored and controlled body parts, and events are the hormones and neurotransmitters used for messaging. Every complex distributed application needs a coordination and orchestration system of some sort, so the ZooKeeper folks at Yahoo decide to build a good one and open source it for everyone to use.   The target market for ZooKeeper are multi-host, multi-process C and Java based systems that operate in a data center. ZooKeeper works using distributed processes</p><p>5 0.71402317 <a title="215-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-08-Strategy%3A_Flickr_-_Do_the_Essential_Work_Up-front_and_Queue_the_Rest_.html">406 high scalability-2008-10-08-Strategy: Flickr - Do the Essential Work Up-front and Queue the Rest </a></p>
<p>Introduction: This strategy is stated perfectly by Flickr's Myles Grant:   The Flickr engineering team is obsessed with making pages load as quickly as possible. To that end, weâ&euro;&trade;re refactoring large amounts of our code to do only the essential work up front, and rely on our queuing system to do the rest.   Flickr uses a queuing system to process 11 million tasks a day. Leslie Michael Orchard also does a great job explaining the queuing meme in his excellent post   Queue everything and delight everyone  . Asynchronous work queues are how you scalably solve problems that are too big to handle in real-time.     The process:     Identify the minimum feedback the client (UI, API) needs to know an operation succeeded . It's enough, for example, to update a client's view when a posting a message to a microblogging service. The client probably isn't aware of all the other steps that happen when a message is added and doesn't really care when they happen as long as the obvious cases happen in an appropariate</p><p>6 0.69795823 <a title="215-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-11-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Conditioning_Collection.html">1421 high scalability-2013-03-11-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Conditioning Collection</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Atif Ghaffar  has a nice strategy to deal with virus checking uploads:
   Upload item into a safe area. If necessary, the uploader blocks waiting for a result.    Queue a work order into a job system so all the work can be distributed throughout your cluster.    A service in your cluster performs the virus scan and informs the uploader of the result.    Move the vetted item into your system.  This removes the CPU bottleneck from your web servers and distributes it through your cluster.  Keep your web servers providing prompt service to users. Let your cluster do the heavy lifting. This minimizes response time and maximizes throughput. A similar system can be used for creating thumbnails, transcoding, copyright checks, updating indexes, event notification or any other kind of intensive work.</p><p>2 0.74606764 <a title="215-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ.html">592 high scalability-2009-05-06-DyradLINQ</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We usually think of the wonderful advantages of  service oriented architectures  as a software thing, but it also applies to hardware. In  Security Now 385 , that Doyen of Disk,  Steve Gibson , tells the fascinating story (@ about 41:30) of how moving to a service oriented architecture in hard drives, modeling a drive as a linear stream of sectors, helped create the amazing high density disk drives we enjoy today.
 
When drives switched to use the  IDE  (integrated drive electronics) interface, the controller function moved into the drive instead of the computer. No longer were low level drive signals moved across cables and into the motherboard. Now we just ask the drive for the desired sector and the drive takes care of it.
 
This allowed manufacturers to do anything they wanted to behind the IDE interface. The drive stopped being dumb, it became smart, providing a sort of sector service. Density sky rocketed because there was no dependency on the computer. All the internals could co</p><p>4 0.64736921 <a title="215-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie_Lamport_to_Programmers%3A_You%27re_Doing_it_Wrong.html">1625 high scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie Lamport to Programmers: You're Doing it Wrong</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist  Leslie Lamport  is definitely not a  worse is better  kind of guy. In  Computation and State Machines  he wants to make the case that to get better programs we need to teach programmers to think better. And programmers will think better when they learn to think in terms of concepts firmly grounded in the language of mathematics.
 
I was disappointed that there was so much English in the paper. Surely it would have been more convincing if it was written as a mathematical proof. Or would it?
 
This whole topic has been argued extensively throughout thousands of years of philosophy. Mathematics has always been a strange attractor for those trying to escape a flawed human rationality. In the end as alluring as the utopia of mathematics is, it lacks a coherent theory of meaning and programming is not about rearranging ungrounded symbols, it's about manipulating and shaping meaning.
 
For programmers I think  Ludwig Wittgenstein  has the right sense of things.

<p>Introduction: Todd had originally posted an entry on  collectl  here at  Collectl - Performance Data Collector . Collectl collects real-time data from a large number of subsystems like buddyinfo, cpu, disk, inodes, infiniband, lustre, memory, network, nfs, processes, quadrics, slabs, sockets and tcp, all using one tool and in one consistent format.
 
Since then a lot has happened.  It's now part of both Fedora and Debian distros, not to mention several others. There has also been a pretty good summary written up by  Joe Brockmeier . It's also pretty well documented (I like to think) on  sourceforge . There have also been a few blog postings by   Martin Bach   on his blog.
 
Anyhow, awhile back I released a new version of collectl-utils and gave a complete face-lift to one of the utilities, colmux, which is a collectl multiplexor.  This tool has the ability to run collectl on multiple systems, which in turn send all their output back to colmux.  Colmux then sorts the output on a user-specified column</p><p>6 0.59590548 <a title="215-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-28-Strategy%3A_Guaranteed_Availability_Requires_Reserving_Instances_in_Specific_Zones.html">1165 high scalability-2011-12-28-Strategy: Guaranteed Availability Requires Reserving Instances in Specific Zones</a></p>

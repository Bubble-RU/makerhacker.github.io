<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle
traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch
or other very popular websites frontpage).Regular hosting companies
(especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get
crushed under the load in short time.But there is hope. A new breed of hosting
companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability
you need at a fraction of the cost.Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!”
(or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same
thing).Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting
companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of
them).Read the entire article aboutCloud computing, grid computing, utility

<p>Introduction: Art of DistributedPart 1: Rethinking about distributed computing modelsI 'm
getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially
distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can
MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other
technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our
situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two
parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the
difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability,
and distributed storage systems.Download the article in PDF format.Download
the article in MS Word format.I wait for your comments, and questions, and I
will answer it in part two.</p><p>5 0.24243587 <a title="445-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-21-Eucalyptus__-__Build_Your_Own_Private_EC2_Cloud.html">355 high scalability-2008-07-21-Eucalyptus  -  Build Your Own Private EC2 Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:InfoQlinks to a few excellent Eucalyptus updates:Velocity Conference
Video by Rich Wolskiand a Visualization.com interviewRich Wolski on
Eucalyptus: Open Source Cloud Computing.Eucalyptusis generating some
excitement on theCloud Computinggroup as a potential vendor neutral EC2
compatible cloud platform. Two reasons why Eucalyptus is potentially
important: private clouds and cloud portability:breakPrivate clouds. Let's say
you want a cloud like infrastructure for architectural purposes but you want
it to run on your own hardware in your own secure environment. How would you
do this today? Hm....Cloud portability. With the number of cloud offerings
increasing how can you maintain some level of vendor neutrality among this
"swarm" of different options? Portability is a key capability for cloud
customers as the only real power customers have is in where they take their
business and the only way you can change suppliers is if there's a ready
market of fungible services.

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:Now that we have a new computing paradigm,
Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data
vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds?
Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space,
and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still
seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids
versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are
a number of issues driving this uncertainty.read more at:BigDataMatters.com</p><p>4 0.89426517 <a title="445-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-22-Cloud_computing%2C_grid_computing%2C_utility_computing_-_list_of_top_providers.html">386 high scalability-2008-09-22-Cloud computing, grid computing, utility computing - list of top providers</a></p>

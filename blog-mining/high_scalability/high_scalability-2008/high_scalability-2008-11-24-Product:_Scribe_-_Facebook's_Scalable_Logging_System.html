<p>Introduction: breakThis JoelOnSoftwarethreadasks the age old question of what and how to
log. The usual trace/error/warning/info advice is totally useless in a large
scale distributed system. Instead, you need tolog everything all the timeso
you can solve problems that have already happened across a potentially huge
range of servers. Yes, it can be done.To see why the typical logging approach
is broken, imagine this scenario: Your site has been up and running great for
weeks. No problems. A foreshadowing beeper goes off at 2AM. It seems some
users can no longer add comments to threads. Then you hear the debugging
deathknell: it's an intermittent problem and customers are pissed. Fix it.
Now.So how are you going to debug this? The monitoring system doesn't show any
obvious problems or errors. You quickly post a comment and it works fine. This
won't be easy. So you think. Commenting involves a bunch of servers and
networks. There's the load balancer, spam filter, web server, database server,

<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from
over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle
ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the greatMapReduce Versus Database War,
you would be correct.Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail
division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved
their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each
machine approach, to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just
couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that
works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability
potential.Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data
streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful
with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text
files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each
individual machine. Then came a</p><p>4 0.14828289 <a title="449-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-22-Facebook%27s_New_Realtime_Analytics_System%3A_HBase_to_Process_20_Billion_Events_Per_Day.html">1008 high scalability-2011-03-22-Facebook's New Realtime Analytics System: HBase to Process 20 Billion Events Per Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook did it again. They've built another system capable of doing something
useful with ginormous streams of realtime data. Last time we saw Facebook
release their New Real-Time Messaging System: HBase To Store 135+ Billion
Messages A Month. This time it's a realtime analytics system handlingover 20
billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30
seconds. Alex Himel, Engineering Manager at Facebook, explains what they've
built (video) and the scale required:Social plugins have become an important
and growing source of traffic for millions of websites over the past year. We
released a new version of Insights for Websites last week to give site owners
better analytics on how people interact with their content and to help them
optimize their websites in real time. To accomplish this, we had to engineer a
system that could process over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per
second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds. Alex does an excellent job with

<p>Introduction: AWStatsis a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web,
streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works
as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log
contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be
able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files
from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log
format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of
other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.</p><p>6 0.13075462 <a title="449-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-21-Processing_100_Million_Pixels_a_Day_-_Small_Amounts_of_Contention_Cause_Big_Problems_at_Scale.html">1390 high scalability-2013-01-21-Processing 100 Million Pixels a Day - Small Amounts of Contention Cause Big Problems at Scale</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byGordon Worley, a Software Engineer atKorrelate, where
they correlate (see what they did there) online purchases to offline
purchases.Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every
server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not
making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come
online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were
originally told to expect. I wouldn't say we panicked, but the office was
certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks
both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the
added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.At
Korrelate, we deploytracking pixels, also known beacons or web bugs, that our
partners use to send us information about their users. These tiny web objects
contain no visible content, but may include transparent 1 by 1 gifs or
Javascript,</p><p>4 0.82412571 <a title="449-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Product%3A_Smart_Inspect.html">541 high scalability-2009-03-16-Product: Smart Inspect</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Smart Inspecthas added quite a few features specifically tailored to
highscalability and high performance environments to our tool over the
years.This includes the ability to log to memory and dump log files on
demand(when a crash occurs for example), special backlog queue features, a
logservice application for central log storage and a lot more.
Additionally,our SmartInspect Console (the viewer application) makes viewing,

<p>Introduction: InLog Everything All the TimeI advocate applications shouldn't bother logging
at all. Why waste all that time and code? No, wait, that's not right. I preach
logging everything all the time. Doh. Facebook obviously feels similarly which
is why they opened sourcedScribe, their internal logging system, capable of
logging 10s of billions of messages per day. These messages include access
logs, performance statistics, actions that went to News Feed, and many
others.Imagine hundreds of thousands of machines across many geographical
dispersed datacenters just aching to send their precious log payload to the
central repository off all knowledge. Because really, when you combine all the
meta data with all the events you pretty much have a complete picture of your
operations. Once in the central repository logs can be scanned, indexed,
summarized, aggregated, refactored, diced, data cubed, and mined for every
scrap of potentially useful information.Just imagine the log stream from all

will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind. Warning #2: this post is wild.Kevin KellyKevin Kelly is Senior
Maverick at Wired magazine. He helped launch Wired in 1993, and served as its
Executive Editor until January 1999. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers'
Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online
service started in 1985. He authored the best-sellingNew Rules for the New
Economyand the classic book on decentralized emergent systems,Out of

<p>Introduction: In the past year, Intel issued a series of powerful chips under the new
Nehalem microarchitecture, with large numbers of cores and extensive memory
capacity. This new class of chips is is part of a bigger Intel initiative
referred to as Tera-Scale Computing. Cisco has released their Unified
Computing System (UCS) equipped with a unique extended memory and high speed
network within the box, which is specifically geared to take advantage of this
type of CPU architecture .This new class of hardware has the potential to
revolutionize the IT landscape as we know it.In  this post, I want to focus
primarily on the potential implications on application architecture, more
specifically on the application platform landscape.  more...</p><p>5 0.84834015 <a title="449-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-10-Facebook_Chat_Architecture.html">563 high scalability-2009-04-10-Facebook Chat Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Recently I had to help users on one of my opensource project ISPMan.  http://ispman.net   This project started in 2001 as I was too unwilling to take care of the DNS and VitualHosting stuff as it was a side-thing to the company I worked for (so i wrote a software that took care of all these little details)     Summary: A large project that needs a rewrite can be done in a matter of day.   I will not give you a full case study about a project that went through a re-write but a case study about how easy it is to re-write something.       Details:     My boss was cool enough to let me  open-source the project and obviously,  I got a lot of cool-cred out of it.   Later on I also did some support and implementation  and earned quiet some money with it.     Eventually I had to let the project go out of my hand to the community as I only did it to facilitate a job  that wasnt williing to do.

<p>Introduction: Update:   VcubeV  - an OpenVPN-based solution designed to build and operate a multisourced infrastructure.   True high availability requires a presence in multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers.  Cloud computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling the playing field.  Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost,  Mosso and other providers.  The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk amongst  the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy Samovskiy in his Linux Journal article titled  Building a  Multisourced Infrastructure Using OpenVPN  .
   
 Dmitriy's idea is to create a secure UDP tunnel  between different data centers over public internet links so your applicatio</p><p>4 0.1206986 <a title="228-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With Lavabit  shutting down  under  murky circumstances , it seems fitting to  repost an old  (2009), yet still very good post by  Ladar Levison  on Lavabit's architecture. I don't know how much of this information is still current, but it should give you a general idea what Lavabit was all about.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by    Nick Burling , VP of Product Management of  Bluestripe . 
   Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis — you hear about them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS. 
   People don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work. 
  At BlueStripe, we work with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it the  Hidden DNS Tax .
   What is the Hidden DNS Tax?     The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune 10 company.</p><p>6 0.096413389 <a title="228-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-14-Ask_HS%3A_Design_and_Implementation_of_scalable_services%3F.html">1578 high scalability-2014-01-14-Ask HS: Design and Implementation of scalable services?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From their website:    SystemImager  is software that makes the installation of Linux to masses of similar machines relatively easy. It makes software distribution, configuration, and operating system updates easy, and can also be used for content distribution.  SystemImager makes it easy to do automated installs (clones), software distribution, content or data distribution, configuration changes, and operating system updates to your network of Linux machines. You can even update from one Linux release version to another!  
   
  It can also be used to ensure safe production deployments. By saving your current production image before updating to your new production image, you have a highly reliable contingency mechanism. If the new production enviroment is found to be flawed, simply roll-back to the last production image with a simple update command!

<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server, e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.     The problem is that I'm still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my qu</p><p>5 0.71643043 <a title="228-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-08-Product%3A_FAI_-_Fully_Automatic_Installation.html">272 high scalability-2008-03-08-Product: FAI - Fully Automatic Installation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From their website:    FAI  is an automated installation tool to install or deploy Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat, autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used for configuration management of a running system.  You can take one or more virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed, configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized management system for your Linux deployment.

<p>Introduction: Guys,  At one of my jobs I have to administer a CISCO ACE (application control engine) hardware load-balancer. I don't particularly love this beast, but it's very very powerful.  There appears to be little real-world info out there, so it could be interesting writing an article on that.  But I don't have other HW LB's to compare it to and I don't want to rehash the product page.   What would interest you in a 'product review' of a loadbalancer? No replies means it's not an interesting topic, so no article then ;-)</p><p>same-blog 3 0.80011576 <a title="228-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Product%3A_ISPMan_Centralized_ISP_Management_System_.html">228 high scalability-2008-01-28-Product: ISPMan Centralized ISP Management System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  FRESH Ports  and their website:    ISPman  is an ISP management software written in perl, using an LDAP backend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP.  It can be used to manage, DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration, cyrus mail boxes, proftpd etc.    
 
 ISPMan was written as a management tool for the network at 4unet where between 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is crazily growing. Managing these domains and their users was a little time consuming, and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these daemons fluently.  Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and users.  LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server can be scaled from 1 to n as required.  An LDAP entry called maildrop tells the SMTP server (postfix) where to deliver the mail.  The SMTP servers can be loadbalanced with one of many load balancing techniques.  The program is written with scalability and High availability in mind.  This may not be the right s</p><p>4 0.74982822 <a title="228-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-14-Sun_Storage_and_Archive_Solution_for_HPC.html">413 high scalability-2008-10-14-Sun Storage and Archive Solution for HPC</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When designing data storage solutions for High Performance Computing (HPC) environments, IT architects strive to balance complex and often conflicting requirements. The need to manage a skyrocketing amount of data, along with the goals of controlling cost and immediate data availability, can make it difficult to meet HPC application demands within the constraints of today's IT budgets. To help customers address an almost bewildering set of architectural challenges, Sun has developed the Sun Storage and Archive Solution for HPC, a reference architecture that can be easily customized to meet specific application goals and business requirements.     This article is intended for IT managers and storage architects familiar with HPC applications and data requirements in the organization. It assumes that the audience has a technical background and some familiarity with issues surrounding the task of configuring systems and storage.</p><p>5 0.74556261 <a title="228-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_Web_Log_Expert.html">36 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: Web Log Expert</a></p>

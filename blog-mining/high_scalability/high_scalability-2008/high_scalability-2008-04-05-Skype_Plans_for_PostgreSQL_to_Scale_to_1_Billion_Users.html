<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage
of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with
CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable
solution that</p><p>4 0.1646736 <a title="297-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Dealing_with_multi-partition_transactions_in_a_distributed_KV_solution.html">623 high scalability-2009-06-10-Dealing with multi-partition transactions in a distributed KV solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've been getting asked about this a lot lately so I figured I'd just blog
about it. Products like WebSphere eXtreme Scale work by taking a dataset,
partitioning it using a key and then assigning those partitions to a number of
JVMs. Each partition usually has a primary and a replica. These 'shards' are
assigned to JVMs. A transactional application typically interacts with the
data on a single partition at a time. This means the transaction is executed
in a single JVM. A server box will be able to do M of those transactions per
second and it scales because N boxes does MN (M multiplied by N) transactions
per second. Increase N, you get more transactions per second. Availability is
very good because a transaction only depends on 1 of the N servers that are
currently online. Any of the other (N-1) servers can go down or fail with no
impact on the transaction. So, single partition transactions can scale
indefinitely from a throughput point of view, offer very consistent response
times and</p><p>5 0.16260307 <a title="297-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-20-Strategy%3A_Front_S3_with_a_Caching_Proxy.html">353 high scalability-2008-07-20-Strategy: Front S3 with a Caching Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Given S3'srecent failure(Cloud Statustells the tale)Kevin Burtonmakes
theexcellent suggestion of fronting S3with acaching proxy server.A caching
proxy servercan reply to service requests without contacting the specified
server, by retrieving content saved from a previous request, made by the same
client or even other clients. This is called caching. Caching proxies keep
local copies of frequently requested resources.In normal operation when an
asset (a user's avatar, for example) is requested the cache is tried first. If
the asset is found in the cache then it's returned. If the asset is not in the
cache it's retrieved from S3 (or wherever) and cached. So when S3 goes down
it's likely you can ride out the down time by serving assets out of the
cache.This strategy only works when using S3 as aCDN. If you are using S3 for
its "real" purpose, as a storage service, then a caching proxy can't help
you...breakAmazon doesn't used S3 as a CDN eitherAmazon Not Building Out AWS

<p>Introduction: I met the CodeFutures folks, makers ofdbShards, atGluecon. They occupy an
interesting niche in the database space, somewhere betweenNoSQL, which
jettisons everything SQL, and high end analytics platformsthat completely
rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.High concept: I think of
dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from HSCALE
(partitioning) +MySQL Proxy (transparent intermediate layer) +Memcached
(client side sharding) +Gigaspaces(parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).You
may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out
writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would
prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about
dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult
questions (not really).Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was
dbShards created to solve?I'm Cory Isaacson, CEO/CTO of CodeFutures
Corporation, the makers of dbShards. dbSha</p><p>4 0.77577049 <a title="297-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-13-DbShards_Part_Deux_-_The_Internals.html">857 high scalability-2010-07-13-DbShards Part Deux - The Internals</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a follow up article byCory Isaacson to the first article on DbShards,
Product: dbShards - Share Nothing. Shard Everything, describing some of the
details about how DbShards works on the inside.The dbShards architecture is a
true "shared nothing" implementation of Database Sharding. The high-level view
of dbShards is shown here:The above diagram shows how dbShards works for
achieving massive database scalability across multiple database servers, using
native DBMS engines and our dbShards components. The important components
are:dbS/Client: A design goal of dbShards is to make database sharding as
seamless as possible to an application, so that application developers can
write the same type of code they always have. A key component to making this
possible is the dbShards Client. The dbShards Client is our intelligent driver
that is an exact API emulation of a given vendor's database driver. For
example, with MySQL we have full support for JDBC, and the the MySQL C driver

<p>Introduction: Perditionis a fully featured POP3 and IMAP4 proxy server. It is able to handle
both SSL and non-SSL connections and redirect users to a real-server based on
a database lookup. Perdition supports modular based database access. ODBC,
MySQL, PostgreSQL, GDBM, POSIX Regular Expression and NIS modules ship with
the distribution. The API for modules is open allowing arbitrary modules to be
written to allow access to any data store.Perdition has many uses. Including,
creating large mail systems where an end-user's mailbox may be stored on one
of several hosts, integrating different mail systems together, migrating
between different email infrastructures, and bridging plain-text, SSL and TLS
services. It can also be used as part of a firewall. The use of perditon to
scale mail services beyond a single box is discussed in high capacity email.</p><p>6 0.75070673 <a title="297-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc_-_Database_Clustering_via_JDBC.html">151 high scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc - Database Clustering via JDBC</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scoblethe Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video
channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that
have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things
you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off
the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.For a strategy hit
he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about
when makingFeedBlendr:One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services
you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up
and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up
and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He
told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in
designing their architecture.</p><p>2 0.96561182 <a title="297-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-05-Pairing_NoSQL_and_Relational_Data_Storage%3A_MySQL_with_MongoDB.html">872 high scalability-2010-08-05-Pairing NoSQL and Relational Data Storage: MySQL with MongoDB</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the "NoSQL vs.
Relational" conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about
currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to
build in, I'd like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint.
In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I've inadvertently given myself
plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches,
and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say
with a fair amount of certainty, that I've found a good compromise. You can

<p>Introduction: This article is from an interview withZuhaib Siddique, a production engineer
atHipChat, makers ofgroup chat and IM for teams.HipChat started in an unusual
space, one you might not think would have much promise, enterprise group
messaging, but as we are learning there is gold in them thereenterprise hills.
Which is why Atlassian, makers of well thought of tools like JIRA and
Confluence,acquired HipChat in 2012.And in a tale not often heard, the
resources and connections of a larger parent have actually helped HipChat
enter anexponential growth cycle. Having reached the 1.2 billion message
storage mark they are now doubling the number of messages sent, stored, and
indexed every few months.That kind of growth puts a lot of pressure on a once
adequate infrastructure. HipChat exhibited a common scaling pattern. Start
simple, experience traffic spikes, and then think what do we do now? Using
bigger computers is usually the first and best answer. And they did that. That

<p>Introduction: Skypeuses PostgreSQL as their backend database. PostgreSQL doesn't get enough
run in the database world so I was excited to see how PostgreSQL is used "as
the main DB for most of [Skype's] business needs." Their approach is to use a
traditional stored procedure interface for accessing data and on top of that
layer proxy servers which hash SQL requests to a set of database servers that
actually carry out queries. The result is a horizontally partitioned system
that they think will scale to handle 1 billion users.Skype's goal is an
architecture that can handle 1 billion plus users. This level of scale isn't
practically solvable with one really big computer, so our masked superhero
horizontal scaling comes to the rescue.Hardware is dual or quad Opterons with
SCSI RAID.Followed common database progression: Start with one DB. Add new
databases partitioned by functionality. Replicate read-mostly data for better
read access. Then horizontally partition data across multiple nodes..In a

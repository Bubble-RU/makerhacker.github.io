<p>Introduction: Update 2:Sorting 1 PB with MapReduce. PB is not peanut-butter-and-jelly
misspelled. It's 1 petabyte or 1000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes.It took
six hours and two minutes to sort 1PB (10 trillion 100-byte records) on 4,000
computersand the results were replicated thrice on 48,000 disks.Update:Greg
Lindenpoints to a new Google articleMapReduce: simplified data processing on
large clusters. Some interesting stats: 100k MapReduce jobs are executed each
day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k
MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with
gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.Google is the King of scalability.
Everyone knows Google for their large, sophisticated, and fast searching, but
they don't just shine in search. Their platform approach to building scalable
applications allows them to roll out internet scale applications at an
alarmingly high competition crushing rate. Their goal is always to build a

<p>Introduction: Update 3:Presentation from theNoSQL Conference:slides,video.Update 2:Jim
Wilson helps with theUnderstanding HBase and BigTableby explaining them from a
"conceptual standpoint."Update:InfoQ interview:HBase Leads Discuss Hadoop,
BigTable and Distributed Databases. "MapReduce (both Google's and Hadoop's) is
ideal for processing huge amounts of data with sizes that would not fit in a
traditional database. Neither is appropriate for transaction/single request
processing."Hbaseis the open source answer to BigTable, Google's highly
scalable distributed database. It is built on top of Hadoop (product), which
implements functionality similar to Google's GFS and Map/Reduce systems. Both
Google's GFS and Hadoop's HDFS provide a mechanism to reliably store large
amounts of data. However, there is not really a mechanism for organizing the
data and accessing only the parts that are of interest to a particular
application.Bigtable (and Hbase) provide a means for organizing and

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.How do you scale anAWS(Amazon Web Services) infrastructure?
This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can
use to make the most of Amazon's dynamic approach, and the architectural model
you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.I base my report on my
experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming
(Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS
(Geographic Information System). It's true that my experience in gaming
(IsCool, The Game) is currently the most representative in terms of
scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU - daily active
users - at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my
experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different
view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability
and data management. I will therefore</p><p>5 0.11652674 <a title="227-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-04-Number_of_load_balanced_servers.html">111 high scalability-2007-10-04-Number of load balanced servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:Yahoo! Launches World's Largest Hadoop Production Application. A 10,000
core Hadoop cluster produces data used in every Yahoo! Web search query. Raw
disk is at 5 Petabytes. Their previous 1 petabyte database couldn't handle the
load and couldn't grow larger.Greg Lindenthinks the Google cluster has way
over 133,000 machines.From an InfoQinterviewwith project lead Doug Cutting, it
appearsHadoop, an open source distributed computing platform, is making good
progress towards their 1.0 release. They've successfully reached a 1000 node
cluster size, improved file system integrity, and jacked performance by 20x in
the last year.How they are making progress could be a good model for
anyone:breakThe speedup has been an aggregation of our work in the past few
years, and has been accomplished mostly by trial-and-error. We get things
running smoothly on a cluster of a given size, then double the size of the
cluster and see what breaks. We aim for performance to scale linearly as you

<p>Introduction: Wackamoleis an application that helps with making a cluster highly available.
It manages a bunch of virtual IPs, that should be available to the outside
world at all times. Wackamole ensures that a single machine within a cluster
is listening on each virtual IP address that Wackamole manages.If it discovers
that particular machines within the cluster are not alive, it will almost
immediately ensure that other machines acquire these public IPs. At no time
will more than one machine listen on any virtual IP. Wackamole also works
toward achieving a balanced distribution of number IPs on the machine within
the cluster it manages.There is no other software like Wackamole. Wackamole is
quite unique in that it operates in a completely peer-to-peer mode within the
cluster. Other products that provide the same high-availability guarantees use
a "VIP" method.Wackamole is an application that runs as root in a cluster to
make it highly available. It uses the membership notifications provided by th</p><p>4 0.64351183 <a title="227-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Product%3A_ISPMan_Centralized_ISP_Management_System_.html">228 high scalability-2008-01-28-Product: ISPMan Centralized ISP Management System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: FromFRESH Portsand their website:ISPmanis an ISP management software written
in perl, using an LDAPbackend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP. It can be
used to manage,DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration,
cyrusmail boxes, proftpd etc.ISPMan was written as a management tool for the
network at 4unet wherebetween 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is
crazily growing.Managing these domains and their users was a little time
consuming,and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these
daemonsfluently. Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and
users.LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server canbe
scaled from 1 to n as required. An LDAP entry called maildroptells the SMTP
server (postfix) where to deliver the mail. The SMTPservers can be
loadbalanced with one of many load balancingtechniques. The program is written
with scalability and Highavailability in mind.This may not be the right
software for you if you want to run a sm</p><p>5 0.63443327 <a title="227-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-27-Product%3A_System_Imager_-_Automate_Deployment_and_Installs.html">263 high scalability-2008-02-27-Product: System Imager - Automate Deployment and Installs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From their website:SystemImageris software that makes the installation of
Linux to masses of similar machines relatively easy. It makes software
distribution, configuration, and operating system updates easy, and can also
be used for content distribution.SystemImager makes it easy to do automated
installs (clones), software distribution, content or data distribution,
configuration changes, and operating system updates to your network of Linux
machines. You can even update from one Linux release version to
another!breakIt can also be used to ensure safe production deployments. By
saving your current production image before updating to your new production
image, you have a highly reliable contingency mechanism. If the new production
enviroment is found to be flawed, simply roll-back to the last production
image with a simple update command!Some typical environments include: Internet

<p>Introduction: Kevin Burton calculates thatBlekko, one of the barbarian hoard storming
Google's search fortress, would need to spend $5 million just to buy enough
weapons, er storage.Kevin estimates storing a deep crawl of the internet would
take about 5 petabytes. At a projected $1 million per petabyte that's a paltry
$5 million. Less than expected. Imagine in days of old an ambitious noble
itching to raise an army to conquer a land and become its new prince. For a
fine land, and the search market is one of the richest, that would be a smart
investment for a VC to make.In these situations I always ask: What would
Machiavelli do?breakMachiavelli taught some lands are hard to conquer and easy
to keep and some are easy to conquer and hard to keep. A land like France was
easy to conquer because it was filled with nobles. You can turn nobles on each
other because they always hate each other for some reason or another. But it's
hard to keep a land of nobles because they all think they are as good as you

<p>Introduction: Before you proceed make sure you have physical volume(something like
/dev/sda1, /dev/sda4, etc) with no data. This is going to be the gfs volume
which you will export to other nodes. It should be on the node which is going
to be your gnbd server. If you dont have such volume create one using fdisk.I
used mounted gfs volume as a DOCUMENT ROOT for my Apache server nodes(Load
Balanced).I tried it on FC4 64-bit. If you plan to try it on any other
distribution or 32-bit arch.. still the procedure remains same. Since I built
it from source but not RPMs, you may have to simply supply config options with
a different CFLAGS.Full details at http://linuxsutra.chakravaka.com/redhat-

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: Quotable Quotes:@ibogost: Disabling features
of SimCity due to ineffective central infrastructure is probably the most
realistic simulation of the modern city.antirez: The point is simply to show
how SSDs can't be considered, currently, as a bit slower version of memory.
Their performance characteristics are a lot more about, simply, "faster
disks".@jessenoller: I only use JavaScript so I can gain maximum scalability
across multiple cores. Also unicorns. Paint thinner gingerbread@liammclennan:
high-scalability ruby. Why bother?@scomma: Problem with BitCoin is not
scalability, not even usability. It's whether someone will crack the algorithm
and render BTC entirely useless.@webclimber: Amazing how often I find myself
explaining that scalability is not magical@mvmsan: Flash as Primary Storage -
Highest Cost, Lack of HA, scalability and management features #flash #SSD

<p>Introduction: One of the top recommendations from the collective wisdom contained inReal
Life Architecturesis to addmonitoringto your system. Now! Loud is the lament
for not adding monitoring early and often. The reason is easy to understand.
Without monitoring you don't know what your system is doing which means you
can't fix it and you can't improve it. Feedback loops require data.Some
popular monitor options are Munin, Nagios, Cacti and Hyperic. A relatively new
entrant is a product called Reconnoiter from Theo Schlossnagle, President and
CEO of OmniTI, leading consultants on solving problems of scalability,
performance, architecture, infrastructure, and data management. Theo's name
might sound familiar. He gives lots of talks and is the author of the very
influentialScalable Internet Architecturesbook.So right away you know
Reconnoiter has a good pedigree. As Theo says, their products are born of
pain, from the fire of solving real-life problems and that's always a
harbinger of good things to co</p><p>6 0.68937308 <a title="227-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-04-Dremel%3A_Interactive_Analysis_of_Web-Scale_Datasets_-_Data_as_a_Programming_Paradigm.html">871 high scalability-2010-08-04-Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets - Data as a Programming Paradigm</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 10:     The Value of CDNs   by Mike Axelrod of Google.  Google implements a distributed content cache from within   large ISPs  . This allows them to serve content from the edge of the network and save bandwidth on the ISPs backbone.    Update 9:     Just Jump: Start using Clouds and CDNs  . Bob Buffone gives a really nice and practical tutorial of how to use CloudFront as your CDN.        Update 8:     Akamai’s Services Become Affordable for Anyone! Blazing Web Site Performance by Distribution Cloud  .   Distribution Cloud starts at $150 per month for access to the best content distribution network in the world and the leader of Content Distribution Networks.     Update 7:     Where Amazon’s Data Centers Are Located  ,   Expanding the Cloud: Amazon CloudFront  .   Why Amazon's CDN Offering Is No Threat To Akamai, Limelight or CDN Pricing  .

<p>Introduction: Like many other media content providers, libraries and museums are increasingly moving their content onto the Web.  While the move itself is no easy process (with digitization, web development, and training costs), being able to successfully deliver content to a wide audience is an ongoing concern, particularly for large libraries.
 
Much of the concern is financial, as most libraries do not have the internal budget or outside investors that for-profit businesses enjoy.  Even large university libraries will face serious budget constraints that even other university departments, such as science and technology would not face.
 
Creating a scalable infrastructure and also distributing a large digital collection that can handle multiple requests, requires planning that many librarians have not even imagined.  They must stop thinking in terms of "one-item-per-customer" and start thinking in terms of numerous users accessing the same information simultaneously.

<p>Introduction: If you have a lot of static content to store and you aren't looking forward to setting up and maintaining your own giganto SAN,  maybe you can push off a lot of the hard lifting to a CDN?     Jesse Robbins at O'Reilly Radar posts that you have a lot more options now because the number of   Content Distribution Networks have doubled since last year  . In fact, Dan Rayburn says there are now   28 CDN   providers in the market. Hopefully you can find reasonable pricing at one of them.      Other than easing your burden, why might a CDN work for you? Because it makes your site faster and customers like that. How can a CDN so dramatically improve your site's performance?

<p>Introduction: Akamai  transparently mirrors content (usually media objects such as audio, graphics, animation, video) stored on customer servers. Though the domain name is the same, the IP address points to an Akamai server rather than the customer's server.  In addition to image caching, Akamai provides services which accelerate dynamic and personalized content, J2EE-compliant applications, and streaming media.</p><p>5 0.71291733 <a title="382-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-07-Can_you_profit_from_the_coming_Content_Delivery_Network_wars%3F.html">60 high scalability-2007-08-07-Can you profit from the coming Content Delivery Network wars?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Playing like the big boys may be getting cheaper. The big boys, like  YouTube , farm the serving of their most popular videos to a third party CDN. A lot of people were surprised YouTube didn't serve all their content themselves, but it makes sense. It allows them to keep up with demand without a large hit for infrastructure build out, much like leasing computers instead of buying them.
   
 The problem has been CDNs are expensive.  Om Malik reports in  Akamai & the CDN Price Wars  that may be changing. CDN service could be becoming affordable enough that you might consider using them as part of your scaling strategy.    Akamai , once the clear leader in the CDN field, is facing strong competition from the likes of Limelight Networks, Level 3, Internap, CDNetworks, Panther Express and EdgeCast Networks.  This  commoditization  may be bad for their stock prices, but it's good for website builders looking for new scaling strategies. EdgeCast, for example, passes on the cost savings when</p><p>6 0.71042711 <a title="382-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-01-HOW_CDN_works.html">198 high scalability-2008-01-01-HOW CDN works</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We build web applications…and there are plenty of them around. Now, if we hit the jackpot and our application becomes very popular, traffic goes up, and our servers are brought down by the hordes of people coming to our website. What do we do in that situation?     Of course, I am not talking here about the kind of traffic Digg, Yahoo Buzz or other social media sites can bring to a website, which is temporary overnight traffic, or a website which uses cloud computing like Amazon EC2 service, MediaTemple Grid Service or Mosso Hosting Cloud service.     I am talking about traffic that consistently increases over time as the service achieves success. Google.com, Yahoo.com, Myspace.com, Facebook.com, Plentyoffish.com, Linkedin.com, Youtube.com and others are examples of services which have constant high traffic.     Knowing that users want speed from their applications, these services will always use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver that speed.      What is a Content Delivery Ne</p><p>2 0.9642871 <a title="382-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-27-Zoosk_-_The_Engineering_behind_Real_Time_Communications.html">1312 high scalability-2012-08-27-Zoosk - The Engineering behind Real Time Communications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by   Peter Offringa, VP of engineering at    Zoosk  . Zoosk is a 50 million member romantic social network.  
 
Our members get the most rewarding experience from Zoosk when they can interact in real-time. After all, a future relationship is potentially at the other end of every connection a user makes. The excitement and richness of this situation can only be fully realized in real-time. The suite of Zoosk services facilitating these interactions are referred to by the general description of real-time communications (RTC). These communications are delivered using the XMPP protocol, which also powers other popular instant messaging products. Zoosk members experience real-time communications within three distinct interactions:
  
  Presence .  When a member is actively connected to the Zoosk RTC infrastructure, their public status appears as ‘available’. If they are idle for a period of time, their state transitions to ‘away’. Their presence automatically changes to</p><p>3 0.94768739 <a title="382-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-20-VMware_to_bridge_a_DMZ.__.html">686 high scalability-2009-08-20-VMware to bridge a DMZ.  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey guys,  There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy vmware...everywhere.  I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when it comes to resources.  What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.  Today we get lots of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well.  40x HP blades, apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's.  (20 servers in 2 datacentres).  The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our internal networks.  This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have ever lived by while working on the inet.  No airgaps from the unknown to the known!  I am interested in feedback on this scenario.  From a resource perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.  Do you think t</p><p>4 0.94401866 <a title="382-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-29-Performance_data_for_LevelDB%2C_Berkley_DB_and_BangDB_for_Random_Operations.html">1364 high scalability-2012-11-29-Performance data for LevelDB, Berkley DB and BangDB for Random Operations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Sachin Sinha , Founder of  Iqlect  and developer of  BangDB . 
 
The goal for the paper is to provide the performances data for following embedded databases under various scenarios for random operations such as write and read. The data is presented in graphical manner to make the data self explanatory to some extent.
  
  LevelDB :

LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values. Leveldb is based on LSM (Log-Structured Merge-Tree) and uses SSTable and MemTable for the database implementation. It's written in C++ and availabe under BSD license. LevelDB treats key and value as arbitrary byte arrays and stores keys in ordered fashion. It uses snappy compression for the data compression. Write and Read are concurrent for the db, but write performs best with single thread whereas Read scales with number of cores

 
   
  BerkleyDB :

BerkleyDB (BDB) is a library that provides high perf</p><p>5 0.94266301 <a title="382-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-12-The_CIO%E2%80%99s_Problem%3A_Cloud_%E2%80%9CMess%E2%80%9D_or_Cloud_%E2%80%9CMash%E2%80%9D.html">918 high scalability-2010-10-12-The CIO’s Problem: Cloud “Mess” or Cloud “Mash”</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days – you only needed one, but then came along the AS400’s and soon you had ten – but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh sh%# – now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and datacenter operations!
 
 Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path? 
 
As a technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other CIO’s on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context to how they can leverage SpringCM’ s easy, fast and affordable cloud Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud services.
 
 What options do I have?

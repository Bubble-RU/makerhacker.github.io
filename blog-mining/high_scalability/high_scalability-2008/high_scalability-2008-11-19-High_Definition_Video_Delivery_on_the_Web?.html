<p>Introduction: The BBC's iPlayer site averages 8 million page views a day for 1.3 million users. Technical Architect Simon Frost describes how they scaled their site in   Scaling the BBC iPlayer to handle demand :
  
  Use frameworks . Frameworks support component based development which makes it convenient for team development, but can introduce delays that have to be minimized. Zend/PHP is used because it supports components and is easy to recruit for.Â  MySQL is used for program metadata. CouchDB is used for key-value access for fast read/write of user-focused data. 
  Prove architecture before building it . Eliminate guesswork by coming up with alternate architectures and create prototypes to determine which option works best. Balance performance with factors like ease of development.  
  Cache a lot . Data is cached in memcached for a few seconds to minutes. Short cache invalidation periods keep the data up to date for the users, but even these short periods make a huge difference in performance.</p><p>3 0.19122326 <a title="447-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-16-Paper%3A_An_Experimental_Investigation_of_the_Akamai_Adaptive_Video_Streaming.html">991 high scalability-2011-02-16-Paper: An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how to make it work. Dan Rayburn  has a post  pointing to a fascinating paper:  An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming , which talks in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the Internet. For Akamai they found:
  
 Each video is encoded in five versions at different bit rates and stored in separate files. 
 The client sends commands to the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds.  
 Akamai uses only the video level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame rate of the video is kept constant. 
 When a sudden drop in the available bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to the a large actuation delay.

<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:   My recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid expiration headers) is employ a    reverse proxy    as mentioned in this article.   In the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.  It's trivial to implement for anyone interested...</p><p>same-blog 2 0.85578299 <a title="447-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-19-High_Definition_Video_Delivery_on_the_Web%3F.html">447 high scalability-2008-11-19-High Definition Video Delivery on the Web?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How would you architect and implement an SD and HD internet video delivery system such as the BBC iPlayer or   Recast Digital's RDV1  . What do you need to consider on top of the Lessons Learned section in the   YouTube Architecture   post?     How is it possible to compete with the big players like Google? Can you just use a CDN and scale efficiently? Would Amazon's cloud services be a viable platform for high-definition video streaming?</p><p>3 0.84885526 <a title="447-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of  Dr. Indranil Gupta 's  CS 525 Spring 2011 Advanced Distributed Systems  class, he has collected an incredible  list of resources on distributed systems . His  research group  is also doing some interesting work.
 
The  various topics  include: Before there Were Clouds, Cloud Computing, P2P Systems, Basic Distributed Computing Concepts, Sensor Networks, Overlays and DHTs, Cloud Programming, Cloud Scheduling, Key-Value Stores, Storage, Sensor Net Routing, Geo-Distribution, P2P Apps, In-network processing, Epidemics, Probabilistic Membership Protocols, Distributed Monitoring and  Management, Publish-Subscribe/CDNs, Measurement Studies, Old Wine: Stale or Vintage?, In Byzantium, Cloud Pricing, Other Industrial Systems, Structure of Networks, Completing the Circle, Green Clouds, Distributed Debugging, Flash!, The Middle or the End?, Availability-Aware Systems, Design Methodologies, Handling Stress, Sources of unreliability in networks, Handling Stress, Selfish algorithms, Securi</p><p>4 0.81626731 <a title="447-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">191 high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across data centers,  then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What is  ChironFS  and how does it work?
 
Adapted from the ChironFS website:   The Chiron Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not FILESYSTEMS.  Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become a real nightmare!</p><p>6 0.79792082 <a title="447-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-27-Product%3A_Sequoia_Database_Clustering_Technology.html">102 high scalability-2007-09-27-Product: Sequoia Database Clustering Technology</a></p>

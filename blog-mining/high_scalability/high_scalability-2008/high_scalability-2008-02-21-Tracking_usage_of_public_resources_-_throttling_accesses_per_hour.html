<p>Introduction: Hi everybody :)We have a bunch of webservers (about 14 at this time) running
Apache. As application framework we're using PHP with the APC Cache installed
to improve performance. For load balancing we're using a Big F5 system with
dynamic ratio (SNMP driven)To sync new/updated sourcecode we're using
subversion to "automaticly" update these servers with our latest software
relases. After updating the new source to these production servers the load of
the mashines is raising to hell.While updating the servers, they are still in
"production", serving webpages to the users. Otherwise the process of updating
would take ages. Most of the time we're only updating in the morning hours
while less users are online, because of the above issue.My guess is, that the
load is raising that high, because APC needs to recompile a bunch of new files
each time. Before and while compiling the performance simply is "bad".My goal
would be to find a better solution. We want to "sync" code no matter how many

<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We
are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple
(any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would
be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally
there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database
server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that
particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and
how you resolved it?Thanks,Scott</p><p>3 0.65135324 <a title="256-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture_to_Allow_High_Availability_File_Upload.html">262 high scalability-2008-02-26-Architecture to Allow High Availability File Upload</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if anyone has found any information on how to architect a
system to support high availability file uploads. My scenario: I have an
Apache server proxying requests to a bunch of Tomcat Java application servers.
When I need to upgrade my site, I stop and upgrade each of the Tomcat servers
one at a time. This seems to work well as Apache automatically routes
subsequent requests for the stopped app server to the remaining app servers
that are up. The problem is that if a user is uploading a file when the app
server is stopped, the upload fails and the user has to upload the file again.
This is problematic as uploading files is an integral feature of the site and
it's frustrating for the users to have to restart their uploads every time I
upgrade the site (which I want to be able to do frequently).Has anyone seen
any information on how this can be done or have ideas on how this can be
architected? I imagine sites like Flickr must have a solution to this problem
as I have</p><p>4 0.643641 <a title="256-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-26-Facebook%27s_Memcached_Multiget_Hole%3A_More_machines_%21%3D_More_Capacity_.html">728 high scalability-2009-10-26-Facebook's Memcached Multiget Hole: More machines != More Capacity </a></p>
<p>Introduction: When you are on the bleeding edge of scale like Facebook is, you run into some
interesting problems. As of 2008Facebook had over 800 memcached
serverssupplying over 28 terabytes of cache. With those staggering numbers
it's a fair bet to think they've seen their share of Dr. House worthy
memcached problems.Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at
Facebook,describes one such problemthey've dubbed theMultiget Hole.You fall
into the multiget hole when memcached servers areCPU bound, adding more
memcached servers seems like the right way to add more capacity so more
requests can be served, but against all logic adding servers doesn't help
serve more requests. This puts you in a hole that simply adding more servers
can't dig you out of. What's the treatment?Dr. House would immediately notice
the hidden clue, we are talking requests not memory. We aren't running out of
memory to store stuff, we arerunning out of CPU power to process requests.
What happens when you add more servers is</p><p>5 0.63749236 <a title="256-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-04-7_Life_Saving_Scalability_Defenses_Against_Load_Monster_Attacks.html">1415 high scalability-2013-03-04-7 Life Saving Scalability Defenses Against Load Monster Attacks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We talked about42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase. Here are a
few ways you can defend yourself, secrets revealed by scaling masters across
the ages. Note that these are low level programming level moves, not large
architecture type strategies.Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed LimitThis
is probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an
application. What it means:Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you
know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of
objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of
objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion.Devise ways of tying
what you need to do to the individual resources.Some examples:Keep a list of
purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep a list of
the line items because the number of items can be much larger than the number
of purchase orders. You have kept the resource usage proportional to the
number</p><p>6 0.62762201 <a title="256-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-27-Updating_distributed_web_applications.html">372 high scalability-2008-08-27-Updating distributed web applications</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Robert Haas in hisSURGE Recap of theSurgeconference, reflected a bit, and came
up with an interesting checklist of general themes from what he was seeing.
I'm directly quoting his post, so please see the post for a full discussion.
He uses this framework to think about the larger picture and where PostgreSQL
stands in its progression.Make use of the academic literature.Inventing your
own way to do something is fine, but at least consider the possibility that
someone smarter than you has thought about this problem before.Failures are
inevitable, so plan for them.  Try to minimize the possibility of cascading
failures, and plan in advance how you can operate in degraded mode if disaster
(or the Slashdot effect) strikes.Disk technology matters.Drive firmware bugs
are common and nightmarish, and you can expect very limited help from the
manufacturer, especially if the drive is billed as consumer-grade rather than
enterprise-grade. SSDs can save you a lot of money, both because a given

<p>Introduction: Cloud computing promises a number of advantages for the deployment of data-
intensive applications. Most prominently, these include reducing cost with a
pay-as-you-go pricing model and (virtually) unlimited throughput by adding
servers if the workload increases. At theSystems Group, ETH Zurich, we did an
extensiveend-to-end performance studyto compare the major cloud offerings
regarding their ability to fulfill these promises and their implied cost.The
focus of the work is on transaction processing (i.e., read and update work-
loads), rather than analytics workloads. We used theTPC-W, a standardized
benchmark simulating a Web-shop, as the baseline for our comparison. The TPC-W
defines that users are simulated through emulated browsers (EB) and issue page
requests, called web-interactions (WI), against the system. As a major
modification to the benchmark, we constantly increase the load from 1 to 9000
simultaneous users to measure the scalability and cost variance of the system.

<p>Introduction: Hi,We have an application that allows the user to define a publicly available
resource with an ID. The ID can then be accessed via an HTTP call, passing the
ID. While we're not a picture site, thinking of a resource like a picture may
help understand what is going on.We need to be able to stop access to the
resource if it is accessed 'x' times in an hour, regardless of who is
requesting it.We see two options- go to the database for each request to see
if the # of returned in the last hour is within the limit.- keep a counter in
each of the application servers and sync the counters every few minutes or #
of requests to determine if we've passed the limit. The sync point would be
the database.Going to the database (and updating it!) each time we get a
request isn't very attractive.We also have a load balanced farm of servers, so
we know 'x' is going to have to be a soft limit if we count in the app
serevrs. (We know there will be a period of time between syncing the counts in
the app ser</p><p>4 0.92421609 <a title="256-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-31-Biggest_Under_Reported_Story%3A_Google%27s_BigTable_Costs_10_Times_Less_than_Amazon%27s_SimpleDB.html">336 high scalability-2008-05-31-Biggest Under Reported Story: Google's BigTable Costs 10 Times Less than Amazon's SimpleDB</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Why isn't Google's aggressive new database pricing strategy getting more pub?
That's whatBill Katz, instigator of theGAE Meetupand prize winningscience
fiction authoris wondering:It's surprising that the blogosphere hasn't picked
up the biggest difference in pricing:Google's datastore is less than a tenth
of the price of Amazon's SimpleDB while offering a better API.If money matters
to you then the burn rate under GAE could be convincingly lower. Let's compare
the numbers:breakGAE pricing:* $0.10 - $0.12 per CPU core-hour* $0.15 - $0.18
per GB-month of storage* $0.11 - $0.13 per GB outgoing bandwidth* $0.09 -
$0.11 per GB incoming bandwidthSimpleDB Pricing:* $0.14 per Amazon SimpleDB
Machine Hour consumed* Structured Data Storage - $1.50 per GB-month* $0.100
per GB - all data transfer in* $0.170 per GB - first 10 TB / month data

competitive with Amazon. We may see a response by Amazon in the near feature,

<p>Introduction: This website has been a great resource for helping me to understand the
successful (and failed) scalable network designs from organizations that have
actually done it, but I haven't seen any explicite explanations about secure
remote administration of these systems.I understand that the *nix people love
to SSH, and the windows gang has their RDP, but how does one go about creating
a network architecture that both allows one to manage their systems and does
its best to avoid hacker interest? As I imagine, no big website will have the
SSH/RDP/FTP ports open on the web server, so how is it that they go about
remotely administering their geographically diverse groups of servers
securely?</p><p>4 0.078016967 <a title="433-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle_-_Provisioning_Tool_to_Build_Remote_Servers.html">461 high scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle - Provisioning Tool to Build Remote Servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At37 SignalsJoshua Sierles describes how 37 Signals usesSprinkleto configure
their servers within EC2. Sprinkledefines a domain specific meta-language for
describing and processing the installation of software. You can find an
interesting discussion of Sprinkle's creation story by the creator himself,
Marcus Crafter, inSprinkle Some Powder!.Marcus divides provisioning tools into
two categories:Task Based- the tool issues a list of commands to run on the
remote system, either remotely via a network connection or smart
client.Policy/state Based- the tool determines what needs to be run on the
remote system by examining its current and final state.Sprinkle combines both
models together in a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter approach using normal Ruby
code as the DSL (domain specific language) to declaratively describe remote
system configurations. 37 Signals likes the use of Ruby as the DSL because it
makes learning a separate syntax unnecessary. I've successfully done similar
things in Perl.</p><p>5 0.06536445 <a title="433-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-25-Product%3A_Puppet_the_Automated_Administration_System.html">429 high scalability-2008-10-25-Product: Puppet the Automated Administration System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Digg on their choice and use of Puppet. They chose puppet over
cfengine, and bcfg2 because they liked Puppet's resource abstraction layer
(RAL), the ability to implement configuration management incrementally,
support for bundles, and the overall design philosophy.Puppetimplements a
declarative (what not how) configuration language for automating common
administration tasks. It's the system every large site writes for themselves
and it's already made for you! Ilike was able to "easily" scale from0 to
hundreds of serversusing Puppet. I can't believe I've never seen this before.
It looks really cool. What is Puppet and how can it help you scale your
website operations?breakFrom the Puppet website:Puppet has been developed to
help the sysadmin community move to building and sharing mature tools that
avoid the duplication of everyone solving the same problem. It does so in two

<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>4 0.73694086 <a title="433-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-20-Product%3A_SmartFrog_a_Distributed_Configuration_and_Deployment_Framework.html">161 high scalability-2007-11-20-Product: SmartFrog a Distributed Configuration and Deployment Framework</a></p>
<p>Introduction: FromWikipedia:SmartFrogis an open-source software framework, written in Java,
that manages the configuration, deployment and coordination of a software
system broken into components. These components may be distributed across
several network hosts. The configuration of components is described using a
domain-specific language, whose syntax resembles that of Java. It is a
prototype-based object-oriented language, and may thus be compared to Self.
The framework is used internally in a variety of HP products. Also, it is
being used by HP Labs partners like CERN.Related ArticlesDistributed Testing

<p>Introduction: Update: Deployment with Capistrano  by Charles Max Wood.  Nice simple step-by-

put,Capistranois a tool for automating tasks on one or more remote servers. It
executes commands in parallel on all targeted machines, and provides a
mechanism for rolling back changes across multiple machines. It is ideal for
anyone doing any kind of system administration, either professionally or
incidentally.* Great for automating tasks via SSH on remote servers, like
software installation, application deployment, configuration management, ad
hoc server monitoring, and more.* Ideal for system administrators, whether
professional or incidental.* Easy to customize. Its configuration files use
the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know Ruby to do
most things with Capistrano.* Easy to extend. Capistrano is written in the
Ruby programming language, and may be extended easily by writing additional
Ruby modules.breakOne of t</p><p>6 0.72090769 <a title="433-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible_-__A_Simple_Model-Driven_Configuration_Management_and_Command_Execution_Framework.html">1230 high scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible -  A Simple Model-Driven Configuration Management and Command Execution Framework</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,I saw an year ago that Netapp sold netcache to blu-coat, my site is a heavy
NetCache user and we cached 83% of our site. We tested with Blue-coat and F5
WA and we are not getting same performce as NetCache.Any of you guys have the
same issue? or somebody knows another product can handle much
traffic?ThanksRodrigo</p><p>same-blog 2 0.86938083 <a title="433-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-29-CTL_-_Distributed_Control_Dispatching_Framework_.html">433 high scalability-2008-10-29-CTL - Distributed Control Dispatching Framework </a></p>
<p>Introduction: CTLis aflexible distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to
break management processes into reusable control modules and execute them in
distributed fashion over the network.From their website:CTL is a flexible
distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to break management
processes into reusable control modules and execute them in distributed
fashion over the network.What does CTL do?CTL helps you leverage your current
scripts and tools to easily automate any kind of distributed systems
management or application provisioning task. Its good for simplifiying large-
scale scripting efforts or as another tool in your toolbox that helps you
speed through your daily mix of ad-hoc administration tasks.What are CTL's
features?CTL has many features, but the general highlights are:* Execute
sophisticated procedures in distributed environments - Aren't you tired of
writing and then endlessly modifying scripts that loop over nodes and invoke
remote actions? CTL d</p><p>3 0.84108013 <a title="433-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-17-Five_Misconceptions_on_Cloud_Portability.html">1144 high scalability-2011-11-17-Five Misconceptions on Cloud Portability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for
"CloudAPIportability," which implies a series of misconceptions.If we break
away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud
portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly
simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without
settling on a common CloudAPI.In this post i'll be covering five common
misconceptions people haveWRTto cloud portability.Cloud portability = Cloud
API portability. API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.The
main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in.Cloud
portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-
in.Cloud portability isn't for startups. Every startup that is expecting rapid
growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability
rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared
to do so.Cloud portability = Compromising on t</p><p>4 0.83892035 <a title="433-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce_With_Ruby_Using_Hadoop.html">968 high scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce With Ruby Using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use

<p>Introduction: Companies earnings outstripforecasts, consumer confidence is retuning and city
bonuses areback. What does this mean for business? Growth! After the recent
years of cost cutting in IT budgets, there is the sudden fear induced from
increased demand. Pre-existing trouble points in IT infrastructures that have
lain dormant will suddenly be exposed. Monthly reporting and real time
analytics will suffer as data grows. IT departments across the land will be
crying out "The engine canna take no more captain". What can be done?.entry-
bodyWhat we need is a scalable system that grows with the business. A system
that can handle sudden increases in data growth without falling over. There
are two core principles to a scalable system (1) Users experience constant QoS
as demand grows (2) System Architects can grow system capacity proportionally
with the available resources. In other words, if demand increases twofold, it
is "enough" to purchase twice the hardware.This is linear growth. Is it enough

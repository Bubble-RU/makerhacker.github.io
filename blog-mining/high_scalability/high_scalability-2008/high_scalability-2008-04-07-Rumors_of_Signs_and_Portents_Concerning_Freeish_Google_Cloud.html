<p>Introduction: Update 6: :  Back to the Future for Data Storage .  We are in the middle of a renaissance in data storage with the application of many new ideas and techniques; there's huge potential for breaking out of thinking about data storage in just one way.   Update 5 :  Building Scalable Web Applications with Google App Engine  by Brett Slatkin.
 
 Update 4 :  Why Google App Engine is broken and what Google must do to fix it  by Aral Balkan.  We don't care that it can scale. We care that it does scale. And that it scales when you need it the most.   Issues: 1MB limit on data structures; 1MB limit on data structures; the short-term high CPU quota; quotas in general; Admin? What's that?  Update 3 : BigTable  Blues . Catherine Devlin couldn't port an application to GAE because it can't do basic filtering and can't search 5,000 records without timing out: "Querying from 5000 records - too much for the mighty BigTable, apparently."

<p>Introduction: Update:     How do you design and handle peak load on the Cloud?   by Cloudiquity. Gives a formula to try and predict and plan for peak load and talks about how GigaSpaces XAP, Scalr, RightScale and FreedomOSS can be used to handle peak load within EC2.     Theo Schlossnagle, with his usual insight, talks about in   Dissecting today's surges   how the nature of internet traffic has evolved over time. Traffic now spikes like a heart attack, larger and more quickly than ever from traffic inflow sources like Digg and The New York Times. Theo relates how   At least eight times in the past month, we've experienced from 100% to 1000% sudden increases in traffic across many of our clients   and those spike can happen as quickly as 60 seconds. To me this sounds a lot like   Punctuated equilibrium   in evolution, a force that accounts for much creative growth in species...       VMs don't spin up in less than 60 seconds so your ability to respond to such massive quick spikes is limited.

<p>Introduction: After poking around the   Google Compute Engine    (GCE) documentation I had some trouble creating a mental model of how GCE works. Is it like AWS, GAE, Rackspace, just what is it? After watching    Google I/O 2012 - Introducing Google Compute Engine    and    Google Compute Engine -- Technical Details   , it turns out my initial impression, that GCE is disarmingly straightforward, turns out to be the point.     The focus of GCE is on the C, which stands for Compute, and that’s what GCE is all about: deploying lots of servers to solve computationally hard problems. What you get with GCE is a Super Datacenter on Google Steroids.     If you are wondering how you will run the next Instagram on GCE then that would be missing the point. GAE is targeted at applications. GCE is targeted at:

<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look around their documentation and seeing what stands out  for me. It's not the much speculated   super cluster VM  . AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran a   website out of S3   with a splash of   Heroku   thrown in as a chaser.      The idea is clearly to take advantage of our   massive multi-core future   by creating a shared nothing infrastructure based firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage: email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps.  A shared nothing request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure.

The idea is clearly to take advantage of our   massive multi-core future   by creating a shared nothing infrastructure based firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage: email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps.  A shared nothing request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build</p><p>4 0.78540945 <a title="299-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-12-Google%2B_is_Built_Using_Tools_You_Can_Use_Too%3A_Closure%2C_Java_Servlets%2C_JavaScript%2C_BigTable%2C_Colossus%2C_Quick_Turnaround.html">1078 high scalability-2011-07-12-Google+ is Built Using Tools You Can Use Too: Closure, Java Servlets, JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his picture), in  I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything , reveals the stack used for building Google+:
  Our stack is pretty standard fare for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily most people don't run</p><p>5 0.78268075 <a title="299-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-22-SLAs_in_the_SaaS_space.html">475 high scalability-2008-12-22-SLAs in the SaaS space</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This may be a bit higher level then the general discussion here, but I think this is an important issue in how it relates to reliability and uptime. What kind of SLAs should we be expecting from SaaS services and platforms (e.g. AWS, Google App Engine, Google Premium Apps, salesforce.com, etc.)? Up to today, most SaaS services either have no SLAs or offer very weak penalties. What will it take to get these services up to the point where they can offer the SLAs that users (and more importantly, businesses) require? I presume most of the members here want to see more movement into the cloud and to SaaS services, and I'm thinking that until we see more substantial SLA guarantees, most businesses will continue to shy away as long as they can.     Would love to hear what others think. Or am I totally off base?</p><p>6 0.77726209 <a title="299-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-21-Google_AppEngine_-_A_Second_Look.html">517 high scalability-2009-02-21-Google AppEngine - A Second Look</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In his blog post,  Scaling WSO2 Stratos , Srinath Perera explains the scaling architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure. It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.
 
Overall, WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the paper     WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing .   
  Problem  
 Stratos is   multi-tenanted  . In other words, there are many tenants. Each tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants, where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products (e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, a</p><p>2 0.93726653 <a title="299-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-Google_Wave_Architecture.html">618 high scalability-2009-06-05-Google Wave Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   Good Vibrations  by Radovan Semančík. Lot's of interesting questions about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.   Google Wave  is a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new, convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users of  Google Wave  and we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to "federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.

<p>Introduction: Being an authentic human being is difficult and apparently authenticating all those S3 requests can be a bit overwhelming as well. Amazon fingered a lot of processor heavy authentication requests as the reason for their downtime:        Early this morning, at 3:30am PST, we started seeing elevated levels of authenticated requests from multiple users in one of our locations.  While we carefully monitor our overall request volumes and these remained within normal ranges, we had not been monitoring the proportion of authenticated requests.  Importantly, these cryptographic requests consume more resources per call than other request types.  Shortly before 4:00am PST, we began to see several other users significantly increase their volume of authenticated calls.  The last of these pushed the authentication service over its maximum capacity before we could complete putting new capacity in place.  In addition to processing authenticated requests, the authentication service also performs accou</p><p>4 0.9214415 <a title="299-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-10-Building_Scalable_Databases%3A_Denormalization%2C_the_NoSQL_Movement_and_Digg.html">698 high scalability-2009-09-10-Building Scalable Databases: Denormalization, the NoSQL Movement and Digg</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database schemas that ensures that the data is optimal for ad-hoc querying and that modifications such as deletion or insertion of data does not lead to data inconsistency. Database denormalization is the process of optimizing your database for reads by creating redundant data. A consequence of denormalization is that insertions or deletions could cause data inconsistency if not uniformly applied to all redundant copies of the data within the database.

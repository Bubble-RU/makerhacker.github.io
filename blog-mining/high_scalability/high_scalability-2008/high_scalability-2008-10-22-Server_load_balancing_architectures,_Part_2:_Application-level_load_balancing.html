<p>Introduction: Server farms achieve high scalability and high availability through server load balancing, a technique that makes the server farm appear to clients as a single server. In this two-part article, Gregor Roth explores server load balancing architectures, with a focus on open source solutions. Part 1 covers server load balancing basics and discusses the pros and cons of transport-level server load balancing.         The barrier to entry for many Internet companies is low. Anyone with a good idea can develop a small application, purchase a domain name, and set up a few PC-based servers to handle incoming traffic. The initial investment is small, so the start-up risk is minimal. But a successful low-cost infrastructure can become a serious problem quickly. A single server that handles all the incoming requests may not have the capacity to handle high traffic volumes once the business becomes popular. In such a situations companies often start to scale up: they upgrade the existing infrastruc</p><p>3 0.25921682 <a title="427-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-03-Save_on_a_Load_Balancer_By_Using_Client_Side_Load_Balancing.html">109 high scalability-2007-10-03-Save on a Load Balancer By Using Client Side Load Balancing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture principles then take a look at Will Larson's  Introduction to Architecting Systems for Scale . Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:
  
    Load Balancing: Scalability & Redundancy . Horizontal scalability and redundancy are usually achieved via load balancing, the spreading of requests across multiple resources.    
 
    Smart Clients . The   client has a list of hosts and load balances across that list of hosts. Upside is simple for programmers. Downside is it's hard to update and change. 
    Hardware Load Balancers . Targeted at larger companies, this is dedicated load balancing hardware. Upside is performance. Downside is cost and complexity. 
    Software Load Balancers . The recommended approach, it's  software that handles load balancing, health checks, etc.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Load Balancing in Amazon EC2 with HAProxy.  Grig Gheorghiu writes a nice post  on HAProxy functionality and configuration: Emulating virtual servers, Logging, SSL, Load balancing algorithms, Session persistence with cookies, Server health checks, etc.  Adapted From the website:    HAProxy  is a free, very fast and reliable solution offering high availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It is particularly suited for web sites crawling under very high loads while needing persistence or Layer7 processing. Supporting tens of thousands of connections is clearly realistic with todays hardware. Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing architectures very easy and riskless, while still offering the possibility not to expose fragile web servers to the Net.

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released information on  Pregel . Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip. Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure...
   ...to mine a wide range of graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's topology.  Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

<p>Introduction: Update:   How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences .  Shows how to analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and how to resolve them.  80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what I mean. Steve Souders, author of  High Performance Websites  and  Yslow , has  ten more best practices to speed up your website :
  Split the initial payload   Load scripts without blocking   Don’t scatter scripts   Split dominant content domains   Make static content cookie-free   Reduce cookie weight   Minify CSS   Optimize images   Use iframes sparingly   To www or not to www  Sadly, according to String Theory, there are only 26.7 rules left, so get them while they're still in our dimension.  Here are  slides  on the first few rules. Love the speeding dog slide.

<p>Introduction: The transport-level server load balancing architectures described in   the first half of this article   are more than adequate for many Web sites, but more complex and dynamic sites can't depend on them. Applications that rely on cache or session data must be able to handle a sequence of requests from the same client accurately and efficiently, without failing. In this follow up to his introduction to server load balancing, Gregor Roth discusses various application-level load balancing architectures, helping you decide which one will best meet the business requirements of your Web site.           The first half of this article   describes transport-level server load balancing solutions, such as TCP/IP-based load balancers, and analyzes their benefits and disadvantages. Load balancing on the TCP/IP level spreads incoming TCP connections over the real servers in a server farm. It is sufficient in most cases, especially for static Web sites. However, support for dynamic Web sites often re</p><p>5 0.92513061 <a title="427-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-01-S3_for_image_storing.html">199 high scalability-2008-01-01-S3 for image storing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all,     Has anyone got any experience with using Amazon S3 as an uploaded photo store?      I'm writing a website that I need to keep as low budget as possible, and I'm investigating solutions for storing uploaded photos from users - not too many, probably in the low thousands. The site is commercial so I'm straying away from the Flickrs of the world. S3 seems to offer a solution but I'd like to hear from those who have used it before.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest repost by  Venkatesh CM  at  Architecture Issues Scaling Web Applications . 
 
I will cover architecture issues that show up while scaling and performance tuning large scale web application in this blog.
 
Lets start by defining few terms to create common understanding and vocabulary. Later on I will go through different issues that pop-up while scaling web application like
  
 Architecture bottlenecks

 CPU Bound Application 
 IO Bound Application 
  
 Determining optimal thread pool size of an web application  will be covered in next blog.
  Performance  
Term performance of web application is used to mean several things. Most developers are primarily concerned with are response time and scalability.
  
 

  Response Time 


Is the time taken by web application to process request and return response. Applications should respond to requests (response time) within acceptable duration. If application is taking beyond the acceptable time, it is said to</p><p>3 0.091310553 <a title="250-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-16-Database_Sharding_for_startups.html">492 high scalability-2009-01-16-Database Sharding for startups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The most important aspect of a scalable web architecture is data partitioning. Most components in a modern data center are completely stateless, meaning they just do batches of work that is handed to them, but don't store any data long-term. This is true of most web application servers, caches like memcached, and all of the network infrastructure that connects them. Data storage is becoming a specialized function, delegated most often to relational databases. This makes sense, because stateless servers are easiest to scale - you just keep adding more. Since they don't store anything, failures are easy to handle too - just take it out of rotation.         Stateful servers require more careful attention. If you are storing all of your data in a relational database, and the load on that database exceeds its capacity, there is no automatic solution that allows you to simply add more hardware and scale up. (One day, there will be, but that's for another post). In the meantime, most websites</p><p>4 0.086299367 <a title="250-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization_and_Cloud_Computing_is_Changing_the_Network_to_East-West_Routing.html">1157 high scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization and Cloud Computing is Changing the Network to East-West Routing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s  called “east-west” networking, which when compared to its predecessor,  “north-south” networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane  winds and tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation  between the transformative shift this change in networking patterns has  on the data center with that of El Niño’s transformative power upon the  weather patterns across the globe.
  

    Traditionally,  data center networks have focused on North-South network traffic. The  assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly communicate with  servers at the core, rather than across the network to other clients. 


 But  server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual  appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical  infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with  workloads moving to different physical locations on the network as  virtual servers are migrated (in the case of data center networks) and  clients move</p><p>5 0.085046083 <a title="250-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-05-Handling_of_Session_for_a_site_running_from_more_than_1_data_center.html">240 high scalability-2008-02-05-Handling of Session for a site running from more than 1 data center</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If using a DB to store session(used by some app server, ex.. websphere), how would an enterprise class site that is housed in 2 different data centers(that are live/live) maintain the session between both data centers.      The problem as I see it is that since each data center has their own session database, if I was to flip the users to only access Data Center 1(by changing the DNS records for the site or some other Load balancing technique) then that would cause all previous Data Center 2 users to lose their session. What would be some pure hardware based solutions to this that are being used now? That way the applications supporting the web site can be abstracted from this.     As I see now, a solution is to possibly have the session databases in both centers some how replicate the data to each other. I just don't see the best way to even accomplish this you are not even guraunteed that the session ID's will be unique since it's 2 different Application Server tiers(again websphere)</p><p>6 0.082056366 <a title="250-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-20-Should_you_build_your_next_website_using_3tera%27s_grid_OS%3F.html">126 high scalability-2007-10-20-Should you build your next website using 3tera's grid OS?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill  wrote an interesting article on O’Reilly Radar covering the current solutions for running  Big Data in the Cloud   
  Big data and cloud technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing, which clouds can readily provide.
   Big PaaS 
  Edd touched briefly on the role of PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloud
  Beyond IaaS, several cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes referred to as managed solutions, or  platform as a service   (PaaS), these services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce, reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass those savings on to the customer.
 
To put it simply, managing data clusters is one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we need to think about when we’re dealing with application platforms, as I no</p><p>3 0.72062021 <a title="250-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-05-SLA_monitoring.html">241 high scalability-2008-02-05-SLA monitoring</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,      We're running a enterprise SaaS solution that currently holds about 700 customers with up to 50.000 users per customer (growing quickly). Our customers have SLA agreements with us that contains guaranteed uptimes, response times and other performance counters. With an increasing number of customers and traffic we find it difficult to provide our customer with actual SLA data. We could set up external probes that monitors certain parts of the application, but this is time consuming with 700 customers (we do it today for our biggest clients). We can also extract data from web logs but they are now approaching about 30-40 GB a day.      What we really need is monitoring software that not only focuses on the internal performance counters but also lets us see the application from the customers viewpoint and allows us to aggregate data in different ways. Would the best approach be to develop a custom solution (for instance a distributed app that aggregates data from different logs e</p><p>4 0.70197529 <a title="250-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-20-VMware_to_bridge_a_DMZ.__.html">686 high scalability-2009-08-20-VMware to bridge a DMZ.  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey guys,  There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy vmware...everywhere.  I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when it comes to resources.  What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.  Today we get lots of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well.  40x HP blades, apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's.  (20 servers in 2 datacentres).  The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our internal networks.  This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have ever lived by while working on the inet.  No airgaps from the unknown to the known!  I am interested in feedback on this scenario.  From a resource perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.  Do you think t</p><p>5 0.69827366 <a title="250-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-22-Applying_Scalability_Patterns_to_Infrastructure_Architecture.html">906 high scalability-2010-09-22-Applying Scalability Patterns to Infrastructure Architecture</a></p>

The “ High Scalability ” blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not disappoint with a post  highlighting a set of scalability design patterns  that was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on “ 6 Ways to Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way. ”

<p>Introduction: Perhaps this question is borderline off-topic but since high scalability solutions often have a global aspect I will give it a try...     Have anybody had any experience with different techniques for speeding up their application to places that have a problem with poor ping response time? Ideally I would love to be running only one data center world-wide but one day I know that our sales department will sign up a customer with an unacceptable response time... Could installing a web-accelerator in front of our application extend the reach of our current data center or will we just add complexity and another source of potential errors?</p><p>2 0.85826862 <a title="250-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-04-Performance_Anti-Pattern.html">555 high scalability-2009-04-04-Performance Anti-Pattern</a></p>

I owe High Scalability a great deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used at  Tumblr , and it kicked some ideas into gear.  This article is about what happened from that idea.
 
My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't been good at all three jobs.
 
My other observation (not from the article) was that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of</p><p>5 0.74591666 <a title="250-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-20-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Aug_20%2C_2010.html">883 high scalability-2010-08-20-Hot Scalability Links For Aug 20, 2010</a></p>

   Membase, powering Farmville's 500k operations *per second* . Of course, some people contend they could do this on their old Vic-20, but this is a useful, vigorous discussion thread on Reddit. 
 Tweets of Gold:        
 
  kbsingh : I dont understand why some developers think its ok to leave operations people out of scalability decisions 
  karmazilla : I find it a little odd when a database claims to support "massive scalability" when it is not distributed. 
  pcapr : OH: teenagers are eventually consistent 
  tv : Verb suggestion for the act of mapreducing data: "marinating". "Then we marinade it to get the n-gram frequencies."

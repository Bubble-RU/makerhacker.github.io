<p>Introduction: Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to store millions of images?
Currently images are stored in a MS SQL database which performance wise isn't
ideal. We'd like to migrate the images over to a file system structure but I'd
assume we don't just want to dump millions of images into a single directory.
Besides having to contend with naming collisions, the windows filesystem might
not perform optimally with that many files.I'm assuming one approach may be to
assign each user a unique CSLID, create a folder based on the CSLID and then
place one users files in that particular folder. Even so, this could result in
hundreds of thousands of folders. Whats the best organizational
scheme/heirachy for doing this?</p><p>3 0.20525019 <a title="319-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-10-mixi.jp__Architecture.html">5 high scalability-2007-07-10-mixi.jp  Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is whatMike Peters says he can do: make your site run 10 times faster.
His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40
IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50
concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively
handling 500 concurrent connections per second with CPU at 8% and no
degradation in performance."Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:Database
write access (read is cheaper)Database read accessPHP, ASP, JSP and any other
server side scriptingClient side JavaScriptMultiple/Fat Images, scripts or css
files from different domains on your pageSlow keep-alive client connections,
clogging your available socketsMike's solutions:breakSwitch all database
writes to offline processingMinimize number of database read access to the
bare minimum. No more than two queries per page.Denormalize your database and

<p>Introduction: Am I mad to consider using .Net2 and AJAX for a high-scalability application?
In case you wonder why, it's the legacy of a website built on IIS and .Net
1.1, and we're looking for ways to make the content more attractive and
interactive. In this case, it's a medical image library being shared by a few
Wikis and online coursework for medicalstudents ( < 15K users) and doctors ( <
150K users)But I'm worried about the performance overhead. We already have a
performance problem because of personalising the content for users according
to their type (student or doctor), and for doctors, their grade and
speciality.</p><p>4 0.7510938 <a title="319-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-29-20_New_Rules_for_Faster_Web_Pages.html">291 high scalability-2008-03-29-20 New Rules for Faster Web Pages</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.They're using a static server to
deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that
the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on
serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.I'm curious how other
people have dealt with this situation.Seperating into two different servers
would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the
premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created
in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>6 0.65119159 <a title="319-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>same-blog 2 0.82907963 <a title="319-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-14-Scaling_an_image_upload_service.html">319 high scalability-2008-05-14-Scaling an image upload service</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,First of all I want to to say that this is an extremely interesting and
informative website. i have enjoyed reading the various posts on how the big
sites scale to meet the needs of their customers.The service we are developing
is a webcam service. The client application sends images to the server via
HTTP POST and they are saved in folder specified by the users id. When a new
image is sent to the server it will overwrite the current image.Users can then
view the images via our web server.Ideally we want the images to upload as
quickly as possible and allow users to view them as quickly as possible.Would
I be correct to assume that when the number of uploading clients exceeds the
capability of the server the only way to scale is to add more hardware.Also I
assume that to use HTTP accelerator caches will not speed up viewing the
images as the new images will invalidate the cache.I appreciate any input on
the subject.</p><p>3 0.80899072 <a title="319-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-16-WTF_is_Elastic_Data_Grid%3F_%28By_Example%29.html">843 high scalability-2010-06-16-WTF is Elastic Data Grid? (By Example)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Forrester released their new wave report:  The Forrester Waveâ&bdquo;˘: Elastic
Caching Platforms, Q2 2010where they listed GigaSpaces, IBM, Oracle, and
Terracotta as leading vendors in the field. In this post I'd like to take some
time to explain what some of these terms mean, and why they're important to
you. I'll start with a definition of Elastic Data Grid (Elastic Caching), how
it is different then other caching and NoSQL alternatives, and more
importantly -- I'll illustrate how it works through some real code
examples.You can read the full storyhere.</p><p>4 0.80777478 <a title="319-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere_Commerce_High_Availability_and_Performance_Configurations.html">321 high scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere Commerce High Availability and Performance Configurations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nobody came up with an example of a website powered by a Websphere product
(which has a community edition) and backed up by a DB2 database.I guess you
all know about usopen.org so here's the story:breakWhile the re-emergence of
35-year-old Andre Agassi and the continued dominance of wunderkind Maria
Sharapova have highlighted the on-court headlines at this year's U.S. Open
Tennis Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., IBM is hoping its new Power5
chip-based IT support for USOpen.org can make news among those more interested
in .NET than tennis nets.Big Blue has partnered with the U.S. Tennis
Association and the U.S. Open -- the most prestigious tennis tournament in the
U.S. -- since 1992. Together, they launched USOpen.org in 1995 so racket heads
could follow the matches online.The iSeries' role this year is in powering a
Web-based end-user application called "Point Tracker," a graphics tool using
autonomic technology that recreates the trajectory of every shot. On-court

<p>Introduction: NorthScale's Steven Yen in his highly entertaining NoSQL is a Horseless
Carriage presentation has come up with a NoSQL taxonomy that thankfully
focuses a little more on what NoSQL is, thanwhat it

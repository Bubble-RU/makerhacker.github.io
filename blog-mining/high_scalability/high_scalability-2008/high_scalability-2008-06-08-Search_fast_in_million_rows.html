top ofLucene. Itsfeaturesinclude:Distributed and Highly Available Search
Engine.Each index is fully sharded with a configurable number of shards.Each
shard can have zero or more replicas.Read / Search operations performed on
either replica shard.Multi Tenant with Multi Types.Support for more than one

<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi
Media, Inc:Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS
data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape
of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve
performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom
filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or
document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide
for yourself.Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the
key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database
offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me
after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your
options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)An interesting
observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal to large</p><p>4 0.16372018 <a title="342-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-23-Which_Key_value_pair_database_to_be_used.html">578 high scalability-2009-04-23-Which Key value pair database to be used</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My Table has 2 columsn .Column1 is id,Column2 contains information given by
user about item in Column1 .User can give 3 types of information about item.I
separate the opinion of single user by comma,and opinion of another user by
;.Example-23-34,us,56;78,in,78I need to calculate opinions of all users very
fast.My idea is to have index on key so the searching would be very
fast.Currently i m using mysql .My problem is that maximum column size is
below my requirement .If any overflow occurs i make new row with same id and
insert data into new row.Practically I would have around maximum 5-10 for each
row.I think if there is any database which removes this application code.I
just learn about key value pair database which is exactly i needed .But which
doesn't put constraint(i mean much better than RDMS on column size.This
application is not in production.</p><p>5 0.16292354 <a title="342-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-28-Job_queue_and_search_engine.html">332 high scalability-2008-05-28-Job queue and search engine</a></p>

<p>Introduction: WhileKnginejust announcesome improvement and new features, I would like you
take you in small trip in Snippet Search research project at Kngine. What is
Kngine?Kngine is startup company working in Searching technologies, We in
Kngine aims to organize the human beingsSystematic KnowledgeandExperiencesand
make it accessible to everyone. We aim to collect and organize all objective
data, and make it possible and easy to access. Our goal is to buildWeb 3.0 Web
Search Engineon the advances of Web Search Engine, Semantic Web, Data
Representation technologies a new form of Web Search Engine that will unleash
a revolution of new possibilities. Introduction to Snippet SearchToday, The
Web Search Engine's is the Web getaway, especially to get specific
information. But unfortunately the search engines didn't changed mush as the
Web changed from 90's.Since the 90's the Web search engine still provide the
same kind of results: Links to documents. We in Kngine think that it's the
time to rethink abo</p><p>5 0.79557896 <a title="342-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-14-kngine_%27Knowledge_Engine%27_milestone_2.html">630 high scalability-2009-06-14-kngine 'Knowledge Engine' milestone 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kngine is Knowledge Web search engine designed to provide meaningful search
results, such as: semantic information about the keywords/concepts, answer the
user's questions, discover the relations between the keywords/concepts, and
link the different kind of data together, such as: Movies, Subtitles, Photos,
Price at sale store, User reviews, and Influenced storyGoalsKngine long-term
goal is to make all human beings systematic knowledge and experience
accessible to everyone. I aim to collect and organize all objective data, and
make it possible and easy to access. Our goal is to build on the advances of
Web search engine, semantic web, data representation technologies a new form
of Web search engine that will unleash a revolution of new
possibilities.Kngine tries to combine the power of Web search engines with the
power of Semantic search and the data representation to provide meaningful
search results compromising user needs.StatusKngine starts as a research
project in October 2008. Ov</p><p>6 0.78792965 <a title="342-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex_Architecture.html">258 high scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yes, I just got through watching the Superbowl so chips and salsa are on my
mind and in my stomach. In recreational eating more chips requires downing
more salsa. With mulitcore chips it turns out as cores go up salsa goes down,
salsa obviously being a metaphor for speed.Sandia National Laboratories found
in their simulations:a significant increase in speed going from two to four
multicores, but an insignificant increase from four to eight multicores.
Exceeding eight multicores causes a decrease in speed. Sixteen multicores
perform barely as well as two, and after that, a steep decline is registered
as more cores are added. The problem is the lack of memory bandwidth as well
as contention between processors over the memory bus available to each
processor.The implication for those following a diagonal scaling strategy is
to work like heck to make your system fit within eight multicores. After that
you'll need to consider some sort of partitioning strategy. What's interesting

<p>Introduction: I have a table .This table has many columns but search performed based on 1
columns ,this table can have more than million rows.The data in these columns
is something like funny,new york,hollywoodUser can search with parameters as
funny hollywood .I need to take this 2 words and then search on column whether
that column contain this words and how many times .It is not possible to index
here .If the results return say 1200 results then without comparing each and
every column i can't determine no of results.I need to compare for each and
every column.This query is very frequent .How can i approach for this
problem.What type of architecture,tools is helpful.I just know that this can
be accomplished with distributed system but how can i make this system. I also
see in this website that LinkedIn uses Lucene for search .Is Lucene is helpful
in my case.My table has also lots of insertion ,however updation in not very
frequent.</p><p>3 0.69236743 <a title="342-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-09-Batoo_JPA_-_The_new_JPA_Implementation_that_runs_over_15_times_faster....html">1336 high scalability-2012-10-09-Batoo JPA - The new JPA Implementation that runs over 15 times faster...</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is byHasan Ceylan, an Open Source software enthusiast from
Istanbul.I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together
with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I
contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.Those were the days
our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and
applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot
of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we
can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml
descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to
use the curse called "XDoclet".On the other side, our company grew steadily,
our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and
ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew
considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of
money. The challenge we h</p><p>4 0.67705584 <a title="342-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-27-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_27%2C_2012.html">1182 high scalability-2012-01-27-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 27, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dr. Daniel Abadi, author of theDBMS Musings blog and Cofounder ofHadapt, which
offers a product improving Hadoop performance by 50x on relational data, is
now taking his talents to graph data in Hadoop's tremendous inefficiency on
graph data management (and how to avoid it), which shares the secrets of
getting Hadoop to perform 1000x better on graph data.TL;DR:Analysing graph
data is at the heart ofimportant data mining problems.Hadoop is the tool of
choice for many of these problems.Hadoop style MapReduce works best on
KeyValue processing, not graph processing, and can be well over a factor of
1000 less efficient than it needs to be.Hadoop inefficiency has consequences
in real world. Inefficiencies on graph data problems like improving power
utilization, minimizing carbon emissions, and improving product designs, leads
to a lot value being left on the table in the form of negative environmental
consequences, increased server costs, increased data center space, and
increased energy cos</p><p>6 0.65947795 <a title="342-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com.html">177 high scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com</a></p>

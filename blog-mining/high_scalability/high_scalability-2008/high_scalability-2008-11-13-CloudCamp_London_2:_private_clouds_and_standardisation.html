<p>Introduction: The first meeting of this Online Gaming High Scalability SIG will be on the
9th of July 2009 in central London, starting at 10 AM and finishing around
5PM.The main topic of this meeting will be potentials for using cloud and grid
technologies in online gaming systems. In addition to experience reports from
the community, we have invited some of the leading cloud experts in the UK to
discuss the benefits such as resource elasticity and challenges such as
storage and security that companies from other industries have experienced. We
will have a track for IT managers focused on business opportunities and issues
and a track for architects and developers more focused on implementation
issues.The event is free but up-front registration is required for capacity
planning, so please let us know in advance, if you are planning to attend by
completing the registration form on this pageTo propose a talk or for
programme enquiries, contact meetings [at] gamingscalability [dot] org.Note:

<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the
Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that
provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It
also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke
about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week - here is the summary
of that presentation.ďťżhttp://gojko.net/2010/01/25/designing-applications-for-

<p>Introduction: The GigaOM Network today announces its second Structure conference after the
runaway success of the 2008 event. The Structure 09 conference returns to San
Francisco, Calif., on June 25th, 2009.Structure 09 (http://structureconf.com)
is a conference designed to explore the next generations of Internet
infrastructure. Over a year ago, The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik saw that
the platforms on which we have done business for over a decade were starting
to provide diminishing returns, and smart money was seeking new options.
Structure 09 looks at the changing needs and rapid growth in the Internet
infrastructure sector, and this year's event will consider the impact of the
global economy. "I cannot remember a time when a new technology had so much
relevance to our industry as cloud computing does in the current economic
climate," said The GigaOM Network Founder Om Malik. "We all need to find ways
to leverage what we have and cut costs without compromising future options.

<p>Introduction: Update:InfoQlinks to a few excellent Eucalyptus updates:Velocity Conference
Video by Rich Wolskiand a Visualization.com interviewRich Wolski on
Eucalyptus: Open Source Cloud Computing.Eucalyptusis generating some
excitement on theCloud Computinggroup as a potential vendor neutral EC2
compatible cloud platform. Two reasons why Eucalyptus is potentially
important: private clouds and cloud portability:breakPrivate clouds. Let's say
you want a cloud like infrastructure for architectural purposes but you want
it to run on your own hardware in your own secure environment. How would you
do this today? Hm....Cloud portability. With the number of cloud offerings
increasing how can you maintain some level of vendor neutrality among this
"swarm" of different options? Portability is a key capability for cloud
customers as the only real power customers have is in where they take their
business and the only way you can change suppliers is if there's a ready
market of fungible services.

everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this
case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help?
Here's Robert's plight:I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest
interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.It’s on
Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.Look at
who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind
WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of
FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the
“don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million

<p>Introduction: The essence of my work is coming into daily contact with innovative
technologies. A recent example was at the request of a partner company who
wanted to answer- which one of these tools will best solve my virtualized
datacenter headache? After initial analysis all the products could be
classified as tools that troubleshoot VM sprawl, but there was no universally
accepted term for them. The most descriptive term  that I found was Virtual
Resource Manager (VRM) from DynamicOps. As I delved deeper into their
workings, the distinction between VRMs and Private Clouds became blurred. What
are the differences?Read more

<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node
then that root node can become overwhelmed:The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for
either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal
with the flood of requests.The network interface becomes a bottleneck because
a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then
clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an
undisciplined system.One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.
Jeff Dean, Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this
Stanford video presentation:Tree Distribution of Requests and
Responses.Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat
topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a
number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes.
Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset of
the leaf nodes.With this</p><p>6 0.35164666 <a title="441-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-17-Intro_to_Caching%2CCaching_algorithms_and_caching_frameworks_part_1.html">495 high scalability-2009-01-17-Intro to Caching,Caching algorithms and caching frameworks part 1</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a part interview part guest with Sebastian Stadil, founder ofScalr, a
cheaper open-source version of RightScale. Scalr takes care of all the web
site infrastructure bits to on Amazon (and other clouds) so you don't have
to.I first met Sebastian at one of the original Silicon Valley Cloud Computing
Group meetups, a group which he founded. The meetings started in the tiny
offices of Intalio where Sebastian was working with this new fangled Amazon
thing to create an auto-scaling server farm on EC2. I remember distinctly how
Sebastian met everyone at the door with a handshake and a smile, making us all
feel welcome. Later I took one of the classes he created on how to use AWS. I
guess he figured all this cloud stuff was going somewhere and decided to start
Scalr.My only regret about this post is that the name Amazon does not begin
with the letter 'S', that would have made for an epic title.Getting to Know

<p>Introduction: A man had a dream. His dream was to blend a bunch of RSS/Atom/RDF feeds into a
single feed. The man is Beau Lebens ofFeedvilleand like most dreamers he was a
little short on coin. So he took refuge in the home of a cheap hosting
provider and Beau realized his dream, creatingFEEDblendr. But FEEDblendr
chewed up so much CPU creating blended feeds that the cheap hosting provider
ordered Beau to find another home. Where was Beau to go? He eventually found a
new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how
Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of
affordable CPU cycles.Site: http://feedblendr.com/The PlatformEC2 (Fedora Core

<p>Introduction: If you just want to visit Rome and not go full on Cloud Native like Netflix,
thenSoundslice'sAdrian HolovatyinWhy I left Heroku, and notes on my new AWS
setup provides a simple guide for helping make your first trip a good
one.First, let's dispose of why Soundslice left Heroku. The essence is because
of various issues "Heroku lost my trust." YMMV, but once a fact, what do you
do?After a consultation withScott VanDenPlas, former director of dev ops for
the Obama reelection tech team, they came up a simple transition guide that I
think is quite good and generally useful (full details in theoriginal post):
Bake an AMI. Install all the stuff you need on an AMI and use that as your
deployment unit. This works well for Netflix and for users who value a certain
sort of simplicity more than flexibility. There were a lot of comments saying
how it's better to use Chef/Puppet and configure instances on the fly, but
there's a confidence that only a baked image provides.Set up auto-scaling
rules. T</p><p>5 0.11299543 <a title="300-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-13-Automation_on_AWS_with_Ruby_and_Puppet.html">1058 high scalability-2011-06-13-Automation on AWS with Ruby and Puppet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Urbandiveis an immersive view service launched by theFrench
YellowPageswhich allows you to travel in cities in France thanks to a 360Â°
view. Urbandive focuses on providing high definition pictures and accurate
professional and social content. One of the biggest jobs was to enable a fast
scalable architecture, because it was really difficult to forecast the traffic
load at production time. Traffic load may be influenced if the service
receives attention from users as a result of advertising.Below you will find a
summary of the goals we achieve by using a Ruby scheduler built on top
ofPuppetonAWSto create a complete infrastructure.Workflow & XTR-LucidOur
scalability combo is : a home-made Ruby scheduler (XTR-Lucid) to deal with AWS
APIs + the Puppet Master to install services and configure EC2 instances and
keep them up-to-date during all the production time. This leads to full
automation.Here is</p><p>6 0.10926287 <a title="300-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-26-WordPress.com_Serves_70%2C000_req-sec_and_over_15_Gbit-sec_of_Traffic_using_NGINX.html">1329 high scalability-2012-09-26-WordPress.com Serves 70,000 req-sec and over 15 Gbit-sec of Traffic using NGINX</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and
single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can
finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in
an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly
DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we
don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is
addingElastic IP AddressesandAvailability Zones.Elastic IP addresses are far
better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight withJessica
Albaand they are:breakStatic IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud
computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a
particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to
explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however,
Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures
by programmatically remapping your public</p><p>4 0.68932116 <a title="300-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-06-Going_global_on_EC2.html">824 high scalability-2010-05-06-Going global on EC2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since its inception,Amazon EC2has enabled companies to run highly scalable
infrastructure with minimal overhead.  Over the years, Amazon Web Services has
expanded with new offerings and additional regions around the world.All this
growth has made establishing a global footprint easier than ever.  And yet,
most EC2 customers still choose to operate in a single region.  While this is
fine for many applications, customers with significant web infrastructure are
depriving users of drastically improved performance.  Deploying infrastructure
in EC2's new regions cuts out one of the biggest sources of latency:
distance.Inthis post, I describe howBizosignificantly reduced load times by
implementing Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) to distribute traffic across
all Amazon regions.Click here to read more on Bizo's dev blog</p><p>5 0.66190308 <a title="300-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-22-7_Secrets_to_Successfully_Scaling_with_Scalr_%28on_Amazon%29_by_Sebastian_Stadil.html">798 high scalability-2010-03-22-7 Secrets to Successfully Scaling with Scalr (on Amazon) by Sebastian Stadil</a></p>

<p>Introduction: And by hot I also mean temperature. Summer has arrived. It's sizzling here in
Silicon Valley. Thank you air conditioning!Scale the web by appointing a
Crawler Czar? Tom Foremski has the idea thatGoogle should open up their
indexso sites wouldn't have to endure the constant pounding by ravenous
crawler bots. Don MacAskill of SmugMug estimates50% of our web server CPU
resourcesare spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work
with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but
does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data
over and over again?Tweets of Gold:jamesurquhart:Key to applications is
architecture. Key for infrastructure supporting archs is configurability.
Configurability==features.tjake:  People who choose their datastore based oh
hearsay and not their own evaluation are doomed.b6n:No global lock ever goes

<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>3 0.9040134 <a title="300-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-02-Total_Cost_of_Ownership_for_different_web_development_frameworks.html">338 high scalability-2008-06-02-Total Cost of Ownership for different web development frameworks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 3PAR Remote Copyis a uniquely simple and efficient replication technology that
allows customers to protect and share any application data affordably. Built
upon 3PAR Thin Copy technology, Remote Copy lowers the total cost of storage
by addressing the cost and complexity of remote replication.Common Uses of
3PAR Remote Copy:Affordable Disaster Recovery: Mirror data cost-effectively
across town or across the world.Centralized Archive: Replicate data from
multiple 3PAR InServs located in multiple data centers to a centralized data
archive location.Resilient Pod Architecture: Mutually replicate tier 1 or 2
data to tier 3 capacity between two InServs (application pods).Remote Data
Access: Replicate data to a remote location for sharing of data with remote
users.</p><p>5 0.88397074 <a title="300-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-29-Amazon%3A_Creating_a_Customer_Utopia_One_Culture_Hack_at_a_Time.html">1466 high scalability-2013-05-29-Amazon: Creating a Customer Utopia One Culture Hack at a Time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will. --Steve Jobs  America as
the New World has a long history of inspiring Utopian communities. Early
experiments were famously religious. But there have been many others as new
waves of thought have inspired people to organize and try something
different.In the 1840s Transcendentalists, believing the true path lay in the
perfection of the individual, created intentional communities likeBrook Farm.
We've also seensocialist, anarchist,hippy, and virtually every other kind of
Utopia in-between. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote an infamous book,Walden
Two, with a more "scientific" take on creating a Utopian community and Ayn
Rand inAtlas Shrugged had her free market version.I believe in startup
organizations we see the modern version of Utopian energy in action. We now
call it by names like "culture hacking", but the goal is the same: to create a
new form of human community to achieve a profound goal. You may think startups
are only about m</p><p>6 0.87943649 <a title="300-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-05-Paper%3A_Scalability_Design_Patterns.html">402 high scalability-2008-10-05-Paper: Scalability Design Patterns</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Current disk based RDBMS can run out of steam when processing large data. Can these problems be solved by migrating from a disk based RDBMS to an IMDB? Any limitations? To find out, I tested one of each from the two leading vendors who together hold 70% of the market share - Oracle's  11g  and  TimesTen 11g , and IBM's  DB2 v9.5  and  solidDB 6.3 .

<p>Introduction: We're implementing a website which should be oriented to content and with massive access by public and we would need a search engine to index and execute queries on the indexes of contents (stored in a database, most likely MySQL InnoDB or Oracle).      The solution we found is to implement a separate service to make index constantly the contents of the database at regular intervals. Anyway, this is a complex and not optimal solution, since we would like it to index in real time and make it searchable.     Could you point me to some examples or articles I could review to design a   solution for such this context?</p><p>5 0.092370093 <a title="451-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-13-Design_Preparations_for_Scaling.html">91 high scalability-2007-09-13-Design Preparations for Scaling</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi, if you were to design your own highly scalable website from scratch, what technologies would you use?     Based on Web 2.0 popularity, LAMP seems to be high in the running.  But would you tack on CakePHP?  Drupal?  or build your framework/CMS from scratch?     What version of Linux runs best for a scalable website?       Would you consider Windows and .NET?  Java?  Or do you want to throw a brick at me for even suggesting such heresies?     Would you prefer Postgres, Tomcat, Perl, Python, or any of that other *NIX fancy stuff...why or why not?     Please forget for the moment, "use what you know" argument.  I am pretty versatile, and can look for an expert in whatever platform I choose.  So all skills being equal, I'm looking for the best community support, the fastest development time and most importantly, the best scaling approach.       Let's say, for fun, that I'm planning for the website to have as many messages going back & forth as an eBay.

<p>Introduction: This question was sent in by Val, who asking for a little help in creating the next big thing. Any ideas? 
 
I'm  planning to run my own, first startup website and have been surfing the  webs for relevant info to plan the technology I will use for it (the  frontend and the backend, including the software and the hardware). The  website will be something like a combination of:
  
  MegaUpload (users will upload their files) 
  iTunes (users will be paid for their uploads) 
  and YouTube (in the future I'm planning to let users watch/listen to the content online, without downloading). 
  
I don't have any investors yet, nor the budget - I'm still preparing the  idea and I'm going to create first implementation (an "alpha version")  before I show it to potential investors. Hence the initial technologies  have to be extremely cheap *but* also highly scalable in the future so  that I don't have to redo anything when the website grows.    Unfortunately I don't have much experience in running</p><p>4 0.7298708 <a title="451-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-05-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Memcached_and_Relations.html">1399 high scalability-2013-02-05-Ask HighScalability: Memcached and Relations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi everybody
 
I'm wondering what you would do: I develop a webapp using Grails, Memcached and Mysql as persistence. Now, I have following domain classes (simplified):
 
 Product : Can be in one category  Category : Can have nested children, and have multiple products.
 
I need to access all product objects by id which led me to the idea to store all products in one big Memcached-entry with a key: PRODUCTMAP and as value, all product attributes as array, like: [productId1: [title: 'title'], productId2: [title: 'title']]
 
If I browse to category 4, I simply get my map categoryMap with value [cateoryId: [productId1, productId2]] I also can list all products of a certain category by providing that id. 
 
The bad thing about this is that I always have to put back everything if I modify a single product.
 
Who can give advice how to realize that? Any help will be appreciated! 
 
Thanks,
 
Best Sullivan</p><p>5 0.72195077 <a title="451-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-16-Do_you_have_any_questions_for_the_Elastra_CEO%3F.html">277 high scalability-2008-03-16-Do you have any questions for the Elastra CEO?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It looks like in the near future I'll have a chance to interview the Elastra CEO. Elastra provides standard   databases--MySQL, EnterpriseDB and PostgreSQL-- on top of EC2 and S3. They are selling aggressive pricing, expandable and contactable database resource usage in response to demand, and a simple management and operations interface to well known databases deployed in a cloud. Elastra could be an important option for developers looking for a more traditional cloudy database.      I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions for questions you would like answered? What would you like to know about their service? What are you looking for in a cloudy database? What would stop you from adopting it or what would make you decide to adopt it? Any ideas you have would help a lot and will probably be better than anything I have.</p><p>6 0.71835941 <a title="451-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-01-A_Scalability_checklist%3F.html">375 high scalability-2008-09-01-A Scalability checklist?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges    Research and education in Parallel computing technologies is more important than ever. Here I present a perspective on the past contributions, current status, and future direction of the parallelism technologies.     While machine power will grow impressively, increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be driving force in computing in the foreseeable future. This ongoing shift toward parallel architectural paradigms is one of the greatest challenges for the microprocessor and software industries. In 2005, Justin Ratter, chief technology officer of Intel Corporation, said ‘We are at the cusp of a transition to multicore, multithreaded architectures, and we still have not demonstrated the ease of programming the move will require…’      Key points:       A Little history   Parallelism Challenges   Under the hood, Parallelism Challenges    Synchronization problems   CAS problems       The future of the parallelism</p><p>2 0.89953279 <a title="451-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-30-Strategy%3A_Get_Servers_for_Free_and_Make_Users_Happy_by_Turning_on_Compression.html">1254 high scalability-2012-05-30-Strategy: Get Servers for Free and Make Users Happy by Turning on Compression</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edward Capriolo has a really interesting article on his dramatic performance expanding experience of   turning on compression for Cassandra   .   The idea: 
  
  Enabling compression shrunk 71GB of data down to  31GB, which caused more data to fit in RAM, which reduced disk IO to nearly nothing.  
  Compression means more data can be stored, which is like buying more machines without having to spend more money.  
  Compression means serving more data out of RAM, which means clients are happier because of the performance improvements.  
  The cost is higher CPU usage to perform the encrypt/decrypt. But disk IO is orders of magnitude slower than decompression and most servers have CPU to burn.  
  
 Edward's article is well written, has the specifics on how to turn on compression for Cassandra, pretty graphs, and lots more details.</p><p>3 0.89412123 <a title="451-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-23-Economies_of_Scale_in_the_Datacenter%3A_Gmail_is_100x_Cheaper_to_Run_than_Your_Own_Server.html">1310 high scalability-2012-08-23-Economies of Scale in the Datacenter: Gmail is 100x Cheaper to Run than Your Own Server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle , infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made a  really interesting statement  about the economics of scale in the datacenter:
  

Weâ&euro;&trade;ve shown that when you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.

  
My first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>4 0.87446278 <a title="451-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-30-Strategy%3A_Use_Your_Quantum_Computer_Lab_to_Tell_Intentional_Blinks_from_Involuntary_Blinks.html">1540 high scalability-2013-10-30-Strategy: Use Your Quantum Computer Lab to Tell Intentional Blinks from Involuntary Blinks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Oh, you don't have a Quantum Computer Lab staffed with researchers? Well, Google does. Here they are  on G+ . To learn what they are up to the Verge has  A first look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab . The lab is partnership between NASA, Google, and a 512-qubit D-Wave Two quantum computer.  
 
One result from the lab is:
  

The first practical application has been on Google Glass, as engineers put the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks. For engineering reasons, the quantum processor can never be installed in Glass, but together with Google's conventional server centers, it can point the way to a better blink-detecting algorithm. That would allow the Glass processor to detect blinks with better accuracy and using significantly less power. If successful, it could be an important breakthrough for wink-triggered apps, which have struggled with the task so far.

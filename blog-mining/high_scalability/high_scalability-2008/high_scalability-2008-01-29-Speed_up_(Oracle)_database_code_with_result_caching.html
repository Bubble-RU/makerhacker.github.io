<p>Introduction: Martin Thompson wrote a really interestingarticleon the beneficial performance
impact of taking advantage of Processor Affinity:The interesting thing I've
observed is that the unpinned test will follow a step function of
unpredictable performance.  Across many runs I've seen different patterns but
all similar in this step function nature.  For the pinned tests I get
consistent throughput with no step pattern and always the greatest
throughput.The idea is by assigning a thread to a particular CPU that when a
thread is rescheduled to run on the same CPU, it can take advantage of the
"accumulated  state in the processor, including instructions and data in the
cache."  With multi-core chips the norm now, you may want to decide for
yourself how to assign work to cores and not let the OS do it for you. The
results are surprisingly strong.</p><p>4 0.1120808 <a title="230-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-29-Ehcache_-_A_Java_Distributed_Cache_.html">359 high scalability-2008-07-29-Ehcache - A Java Distributed Cache </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ehcacheis a pure Java cache with the following features: fast, simple, small
foot print, minimal dependencies, provides memory and disk stores for
scalability into gigabytes, scalable to hundreds of cachesis a pluggable cache
for Hibernate, tuned for high concurrent load on large multi-cpu servers,
provides LRU, LFU and FIFO cache eviction policies, and is production tested.
Ehcache is used byLinkedInto cache member profiles. The user guide says it's
possible to get at 2.5 times system speedup for persistent Object Relational
Caching, a 1000 times system speedup for Web Page Caching, and a 1.6 times

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ashwanth Fernando, Software Engineer from the trenches
at large scale internet companies.Inspired by the book "Effective Java" by
Joshua Bloch, I wanted to share my holistic recommendations on building high
traffic web software (i.e. web applications/services that serve high traffic
loads). Some of these items may not be just about software design but also
around surrounding areas such as the engineering organization, culture etc.Two
disclaimers up front:1) This is my opinion.2) There will be real world
situations where the below principles will be wrong as in all things
"software". Please use common sense all the time.Consider using more than one
datacenterThere have been numerous horror stories about businesses, ahem going
out of business because they just had a single datacenter. Its really
important to have more than one data center if you want to protect yourself
from natural disasters or electrical supply failures. Run all your datacenters

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeff Sufrom Factual.What is Varnish?Varnishis an open
source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack
and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for
both static and dynamic content.One great thing about Varnish is that it can
improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.
If you haven't heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven't used it),
please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive,
but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish's more advanced
features, you'll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.Some
of the high profile companies using Varnish include: Twitter, Facebook, Heroku
and LinkedIn.Our Use CaseOne of Factual's first high profile projects was
Newsweek's "America's Best High Schools: The List". After realizing that we
had only a few weeks to increase our throughput by tenfold, we looked into a</p><p>3 0.69520521 <a title="230-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-12-We_want_to_cache_a_lot_%3A%29_How_do_we_go_about_it_%3F.html">247 high scalability-2008-02-12-We want to cache a lot :) How do we go about it ?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We have a lot of dependencies to our SQL databases and we have heard that
caching does help a lot as we move into scaling and providing better
performance.So the question is what are some reliable software products out
there that we could consider in this space ? We want to put a lot of
frequently called database calls that do not change frequently into this
caching layer.Also what would be an easy way to move only those database
changes into the cache as opposed to reloading or pulling it into cache every
few mins or hours.We need something smart that would just push changes to the
caching layer as it happens. I guess we could build our own, but are there any
good reliable products out there ? Please also mention how they play with
regards to pricing 'cos that would be a determining factor as well.Thanks</p><p>4 0.68592346 <a title="230-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-16-Six_Lessons_Learned_the_Hard_Way_About_Scaling_a_Million_User_System_.html">1633 high scalability-2014-04-16-Six Lessons Learned the Hard Way About Scaling a Million User System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ever come to a point where you feel you've learned enough to share your
experiences in the hopes of helping others traveling the same road? That's
whatMartin Kleppmannhas done in an lovingly written Six things I wish we had
known about scaling, an article well worth your time.It's not advice about
scaling a Twitter, but of building a million user system, which is the sweet
spot for a lot of projects. His conclusion rings true:Building scalable
systems is not all sexy roflscale fun. It's a lot of plumbing and yak shaving.
A lot of hacking together tools that really ought to exist already, but all
the open source solutions out there are too bad (and yours ends up bad too,
but at least it solves your particular problem).Here's a gloss on the six
lessons (plus a bonus lesson):Realistic load testing is hard. Testing a large
distributed system is not like a scientific experiment that can be conducted
under ideal conditions. This is hard for the scientific minded to accept.

<p>Introduction: InHow to launch in a month and scale to a million users,Joseph Perla, Former
VP of Technology and founding team of Turntable.fm, shares techniques he used
to build and quickly scale his startups. The post is very well written and a
must read. Here are the essentials:Keep it simple.Build API's before making
the website or mobile apps. Keep interfaces small and single-purpose. Get it
right.Build in automated tests from the start. Create function tests, module
level tests, and full integration tests. Run tests on every commit. No new
code written while bugs exist.Don't hide power.UsePebblesto write bug-free
Javascript, a library to create complicated AJAX interactions by writing 0
javascript by adding a few extra HTML tags to code.Use procedure arguments to
provide flexibility in an interface.Pass functions instead of parameters to
support complicated scenarios. For example, a filter function return a
boolean.Leave it to the client.Keep the server simple and move as much

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time (Good luck today):A Friday the 13th
Postmorterama:James Hamilton with somehigh powered perspectiveon the report
for the Fukushima Nuclear Accident. Apparently they haven't heard of the
blameless post-mortem. Lots of interesting stuff, but this is a potentially
disaster saving general lesson learned: operators can't figure out what is
happening or take appropriate action without detailed visibility into the
state of the system.Evernote with a nicely detailed noteon a recent outage. A
kernel panic happened while upgrading two new "shard" servers with 3x as much
RAM, SSDs instead of 15krpm disks, bonded networking, and an updated kernel.
They had to revert and shite loves to happen when other shite happens.Heroku
with theirpostmortem on what happenedwhen AWS went down. They lost 30% of
their instances across 3 AZs in the US-East region. Rich detail on the impact
of the AWS, but not much on what they can do about it in the future, probably
because there's not much</p><p>2 0.99141675 <a title="230-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-30-Facebook_and_Site_Failures_Caused_by_Complex%2C_Weakly_Interacting%2C_Layered_Systems.html">910 high scalability-2010-09-30-Facebook and Site Failures Caused by Complex, Weakly Interacting, Layered Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook has been so reliable that when a site outage does occur it's a
definite learning opportunity. Fortunately for us we can learn something
because in More Details on Today's Outage, Facebook'sRobert Johnson gave a
pretty candid explanation of what caused a rare 2.5 hour period of down time
for Facebook. It wasn't a simple problem. The root causes were feedback loops
and transient spikes caused ultimately by the complexity of weakly interacting
layers in modern systems. You know, the kind everyone is building these days.
Problems like this are notoriously hard to fix and finding a real solution may
send Facebook back to the whiteboard. There's a technical debt that must be
paid. The outline and my interpretation (reading between the lines) of what
happened is:Remember that Facebookcaches everything. They
have28terabytesofmemcacheddata on 800 servers. The database is the system of
record, but memory is where the action is. So when a problem happens that
involves the caching layer,</p><p>3 0.99097246 <a title="230-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-10-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_10%2C_2012.html">1190 high scalability-2012-02-10-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 10, 2012</a></p>

Million Slices: Dominos @ Super Bowl;500K requests per second: S3; The great
mobile money drain. Mobile: high resource costs, low revenue. Mobile traffic
on Plenty of Fish is growing at 3% a month, rising to 3 Billion pageviews a
month, 40% of signups are mobile, and all traffic will soon be 60-70% mobile.
The problem: how do you make money on mobile?Time to chuck microprocessors for

Computing Problems: Computer scientists prove that networks of cells can
compute as efficiently as networks of computers linked via the internet. We
believe that there is a need for a network model, where nodes are by design

machines.Unrelated? GDrive at last and S3 Drops Storage Pricing.If you

<p>Introduction: Are long VM instance spin-up times in the cloud costing you money? That's the
question that immediately came to mind whenJames Urquhart, in an interview at
the Stata Conference, made this thought provoking comment:the faster you can
get the resources into the hands of the people who use them, the more money
you save overall.One of the many super powers of the cloud iselasticity, the
ability to dynamically acquire and release resources in response to demand.
But like any good superhero, their strength must also form the basis of a not
quite fatal flaw. Years and years of angsty episodes are usually required to
explore this contradiction.In the case of the cloud, the weakness reveals
itself in slow VM spin-up times. Spinning up a VM in EC2 can take a little as
1-3 minutes, or can average 5-10 minutes, or it can take much longer if
there's heavy usage in your availability zone. EC2 is not alone. A common
complaint about Google App Engine is thecold-start problem. When a request
comes in,</p><p>5 0.99075252 <a title="230-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling_Twitter%3A_Making_Twitter_10000_Percent_Faster.html">639 high scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling Twitter: Making Twitter 10000 Percent Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived
processes) and why they moved toScalato program against it (high level

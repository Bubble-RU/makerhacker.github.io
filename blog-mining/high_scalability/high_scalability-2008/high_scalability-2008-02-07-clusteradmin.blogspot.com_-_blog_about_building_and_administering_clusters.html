<p>Introduction: When designing data storage solutions for High Performance Computing (HPC)
environments, IT architects strive to balance complex and often conflicting
requirements. The need to manage a skyrocketing amount of data, along with the
goals of controlling cost and immediate data availability, can make it
difficult to meet HPC application demands within the constraints of today's IT
budgets. To help customers address an almost bewildering set of architectural
challenges, Sun has developed the Sun Storage and Archive Solution for HPC, a
reference architecture that can be easily customized to meet specific
application goals and business requirements.This article is intended for IT
managers and storage architects familiar with HPC applications and data
requirements in the organization. It assumes that the audience has a technical
background and some familiarity with issues surrounding the task of
configuring systems and storage.</p><p>3 0.19334781 <a title="243-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-14-Implementing_the_Lustre_File_System_with_Sun_Storage%3A_High_Performance_Storage_for_High_Performance_Computing.html">411 high scalability-2008-10-14-Implementing the Lustre File System with Sun Storage: High Performance Storage for High Performance Computing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Much of the focus of high performance computing (HPC) has centered on CPU
performance. However, as computing requirements grow, HPC clusters are
demanding higher rates of aggregate data throughput. Today's clusters feature
larger numbers of nodes with increased compute speeds. The higher clock rates
and operations per clock cycle create increased demand for local data on each
node. In addition, InfiniBand and other high-speed, low-latency interconnects
increase the data throughput available to each node.Traditional shared file
systems such as NFS have not been able to scale to meet this growing demand
for data throughput on HPC clusters. Scalable cluster file systems that can
provide parallel data access to hundreds of nodes and petabytes of storage are
needed to provide the high data throughput required by large HPC applications,
including manufacturing, electronic design, and research.This paper describes
an implementation of the Sun Lustre file system as a scalable storage cluster

<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund not only put together a few interesting scalability patterns,
he also came up with a few interesting scalability lessons:Lesson #1. Put
Smarty compile and template caches on an active-active DRBD cluster with high
load and your servers will DIE!Lesson #2. Don't use out-of-the-box
configurations.Lesson #3. Single points of contention will eventually become a
bottleneck.Lesson #4. Plan in advance. Lesson #5. Offload your databases as
much as possible.Lesson #6. File systems matter and can run out of space /
inodes.For more details and explanations see the original post.</p><p>5 0.58107668 <a title="243-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-07-10_Core_Architecture_Pattern_Variations_for_Achieving_Scalability.html">1138 high scalability-2011-11-07-10 Core Architecture Pattern Variations for Achieving Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Srinath Perera has put together astrong list of architecture patternsbased on
three meta patterns:  distribution, caching, and asynchronous processing. He
contends these three are the primal patterns and the following patterns are
but different combinations:LB (Load Balancers) + Shared nothing Units. Units
that do not share anything with each other fronted with a load balancer that
routes incoming messages to a unit based on some criteria.LB + Stateless Nodes
+ Scalable Storage. Several stateless nodes talking to a scalable storage, and
a load balancer distributes load among the nodes.Peer to Peer Architectures
(Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Content Addressable Networks (CAN)).
Algorithm for scaling up logarithmically.Distributed Queues. Queue
implementation (FIFO delivery) implemented as a network
service.Publish/Subscribe Paradigm. Network publish subscribe brokers that
route messages to each other.Gossip and Nature-inspired Architectures. Each
node randomly pick and exchange info</p><p>6 0.56734389 <a title="243-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-13-High_Performance_Web_Pages_%E2%80%93_Real_World_Examples%3A_Netflix_Case_Study.html">566 high scalability-2009-04-13-High Performance Web Pages – Real World Examples: Netflix Case Study</a></p>

<p>Introduction: SmugMug's CEO & Chief Geek Don MacAskill smugly (hard to resist) gushes over
finally finding, after a long and arduous quest, their "best bang-for-the-buck
storage array." It's theDell MD300. His in-depth explanation of why he prefers
the MD3000 should help anyone with their own painful storage deliberations.
His key points are:breakThe price is right; DAS via SAS, 15 spindles at 15K
rpm each, 512MB of mirrored battery-backed write cache; You can disable read
caching; You can disable read-ahead prefetching; The stripe sizes are
configurable up to 512KB; The controller ignores host-based flush commands by
default; They support an ‘Enhanced JBOD’ mode.His reasoning for the
desirability each option is astute and he even gives you the configuration
options for carrying out the configuration. This is not your average CEO.Don
also speculates that a three tier system using flash (system RAM + flash
storage + RAID disks) is a possible future direction. Unfortunately, flash may

<p>Introduction: In my lastpost, I outlined considerations that need to be taken into account
when choosing between a centralized and federated security model. So, how do
we implement the chosen model?Based on a real-world case study, I will outline
a Kerberos architecture that enables cutting-edge collaborative research
through federated sharing of resources.Read more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>5 0.65454191 <a title="243-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-20-PaxosLease%3A_Diskless_Paxos_for_Leases.html">710 high scalability-2009-09-20-PaxosLease: Diskless Paxos for Leases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: PaxosLeaseis a distributed algorithm for lease negotiation. It is based on
Paxos, but does not require disk writes or clock synchrony. PaxosLease is used

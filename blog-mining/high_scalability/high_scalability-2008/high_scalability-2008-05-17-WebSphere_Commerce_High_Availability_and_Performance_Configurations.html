<p>Introduction: In theAmazon Servicesarchitecture article the podcast mentions Mashery. I went
to their site at http://www.mashery.com/, but I can't quite figure out what it
is. They want to:Unleash and manage channels for your API responsibly with
Masheryâ&euro;&trade;s combination of security, usage, access management, tracking,
metrics, commerce, performance optimization and developer community tools.An
example would help, because I am not getting it.</p><p>3 0.14315394 <a title="321-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-05-Handling_of_Session_for_a_site_running_from_more_than_1_data_center.html">240 high scalability-2008-02-05-Handling of Session for a site running from more than 1 data center</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If using a DB to store session(used by some app server, ex.. websphere), how
would an enterprise class site that is housed in 2 different data centers(that
are live/live) maintain the session between both data centers.The problem as I
see it is that since each data center has their own session database, if I was
to flip the users to only access Data Center 1(by changing the DNS records for
the site or some other Load balancing technique) then that would cause all
previous Data Center 2 users to lose their session. What would be some pure
hardware based solutions to this that are being used now? That way the
applications supporting the web site can be abstracted from this.As I see now,
a solution is to possibly have the session databases in both centers some how
replicate the data to each other. I just don't see the best way to even
accomplish this you are not even guraunteed that the session ID's will be
unique since it's 2 different Application Server tiers(again websphere). Not

<p>Introduction: 99designs is a crowdsourced design contest marketplace based out of Melbourne
Australia. The idea is that if you have a design you need created you create a
contest and designers compete to give you the best design within your
budget.If you are a medium sized commerce site this is a clean example
architecture of a site that reliably supports a lot of users and a complex
workflow on the cloud. Lars Yencken wrote a nicely written overview of the
architecture behind 99designs in Infrastructure at 99designs. Here's a gloss
on their architecture:StatsTeam has 8 devs, 2 dev ops, 2 ux/designersHundreds

<p>Introduction: Searching around the HS website I noticed that there are no articles regarding
db2, which has an express edition, free of charge and from what I know there
aren't any restrictions.Being a powerful database system I thought it could
make be an alternative to MySQL, PostgreSQL databases.Here is the IBM
statement:"DB2 Express Edition for Community (DB2 Express-C) is a no charge
data server for use in development and deployment. DB2 Express-C supports a
full range of APIs, drivers, and interfaces for application development
including PHP, C/C++, and .NET. In addition, DB2 Express-C V9 contains
advanced XML features. DB2 Express-C provides ISVs an ideal starting database
server for Web, enterprise, and eBusiness applications.This IBM Redbook
provides fundamentals of DB2 application development with DB2 Express-C. It
covers the DB2 Express-C installation and configuration for application
development and skills and techniques for building DB2 applications with XML,
PHP, C/C++, Java, and .NET.</p><p>6 0.075195119 <a title="321-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-27-Sponsored_Post%3A__Akiban%2C_Booking%2C_Teradata_Aster%2C_Hadapt%2C_Zoosk%2C_Aerospike%2C_Server_Stack%2C_Wiredrive%2C_NY_Times%2C_CouchConf%2C_FiftyThree%2C_Percona%2C_ScaleOut%2C_New_Relic%2C_NetDNA%2C_GigaSpaces%2C_AiCache%2C_Logic_Monitor%2C_AppDynamics.html">1363 high scalability-2012-11-27-Sponsored Post:  Akiban, Booking, Teradata Aster, Hadapt, Zoosk, Aerospike, Server Stack, Wiredrive, NY Times, CouchConf, FiftyThree, Percona, ScaleOut, New Relic, NetDNA, GigaSpaces, AiCache, Logic Monitor, AppDynamics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Building, scaling, and optimizing the next generation of web applications.
Learn the tricks of the trade so you can build and architect applications that
scale quickly--without all the high-priced headaches and service-level
agreements associated with enterprise app servers and proprietary programming
and database products. Culled from the experience of the Flickr.com lead
developer, Building Scalable Web Sites offers techniques for creating fast
sites that your visitors will find a pleasure to use.Creating popular sites
requires much more than fast hardware with lots of memory and hard drive
space. It requires thinking about how to grow over time, how to make the same
resources accessible to audiences with different expectations, and how to have
a team of developers work on a site without creating new problems for visitors
and for each other.Presenting information to visitors from all over the world*
Integrating email with your web applications* Planning hardware purchases and

<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site
has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this
day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out
the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was
taking too much load.There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my
database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I
have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain
PHP/HTML coding is used.Technology:PHP -- 5.2MYSQL -- 5.0Apache --

<p>Introduction: OK,I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any
sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll
ask here.Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application"
that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good
consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen
sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but
no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server"
when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously
useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-
alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.The
normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page
like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy
page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let a user
"in" a</p><p>6 0.72002119 <a title="321-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-Profiling_WEB_applications.html">71 high scalability-2007-08-22-Profiling WEB applications</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured

<p>Introduction: In many posts, such as: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges I
mentioned that synchronization the access to the shared resource is the major
challenge to write parallel code.The synchronization and coordination take
long time from the overall execution time, which reduce the benefits of the
parallelism; the synchronization and coordination also reduce the
scalability.There are many forms of synchronization and coordination, such
as:Create Task object in frameworks such as: Microsoft TPL, Intel TDD, and
Parallel Runtime Library. Create and enqueue task objects require
synchronization that it's takes long time especially if we create it into
recursive work such as: Quick Sort algorithm.Synchronization the access to
shared data.But there are a few techniques to avoid these issues, such as:
Shared-Nothing, Actor Model, and Hyper Object (A.K.A. Combinable Object).
Simply if we reduce the shared data by re-architect our code this will gives
us a huge benefits in performance and s</p><p>6 0.75509214 <a title="321-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_FastStats_Log_Analyzer_.html">35 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: FastStats Log Analyzer </a></p>

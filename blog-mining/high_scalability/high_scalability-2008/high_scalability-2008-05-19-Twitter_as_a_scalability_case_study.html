<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived
processes) and why they moved toScalato program against it (high level

<p>Introduction: There were many talks recently about twitter scalability and their specific
choice of language such as Scala to address their existing Ruby based
scalability. In this post i tried to provide a more methodical approach for
handling twitter scalability challenges that is centered around the right
choice of architecture patterns rather then the language itself.The
architecture pattern are given in a generic fashion that is not specific to
twitter itself and can serve anyone who is looking to build a scalable real
time web application in the near future.</p><p>5 0.13081683 <a title="323-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-11-So%2C_Why_is_Twitter_Really_Not_Using_Cassandra_to_Store_Tweets%3F.html">855 high scalability-2010-07-11-So, Why is Twitter Really Not Using Cassandra to Store Tweets?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A firestorm of accusations circled around recently saying that Cassandra, the
elected-by-major-adopters emperor of the NoSQL movement, has no clothes. It
was said Twitter was dumping Cassandra; Reddit outages were linked to
Cassandra; and even Facebook, Cassandra's cradle of birth, was said to have
abandoned Cassandra. Shouts of NoSQL Fail! were heard in the streets. Much
gloating followed. Is the emperor really naked? Casually dressed maybe, but
not naked.(Note: after this point the article contains a flow chart that is
NSFW. Some people are very sensitive about cussing, so if that's you, please
go back, don't read on. Danger! There are no nude pictures or anything, just
some strong language. But this is my most favorite flow chart of all time, so
it's worth it :-)Is Twitter really abandoning Cassandra? Not according to
Twitter, which came out with a post,Cassandra at Twitter Today, explaining
that they are using Cassandra in production for geolocation and analytics.

<p>Introduction: This is the intriguing quote by Bill Venners in an interview with Twitter's
Alex Payne on Twitter's heretical switch from a pure Ruby stack to a Ruby on
Rails stack on the front-end and JVM/Scala on the back-end:So performance was
also one of the problems with JRuby, which I [Bill Venners] think helps
explain better why they'd [Twitter] prefer Scala over Ruby or JRuby for some
things.I have often heard Rubyists say that although Ruby is slower than Java,
for many things it is plenty fast enough, and they are right. The logic goes
further, saying that servers are cheap, and programmers expensive, so it makes
sense to tradeoff some runtime performance for programmer productivity. And I
think that's very often true too, but not always.If you have enough traffic,
at some point the cost of servers outweighs the cost of programmers. I'm not
sure whether Twitter is past that point, but they get a lot of traffic. And
frankly this isn't an intrinsic tradeoff. Other dynamic languages are faster</p><p>5 0.76129919 <a title="323-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-07-Six_Ways_Twitter_May_Reach_its_Big_Hairy_Audacious_Goal_of_One_Billion_Users.html">837 high scalability-2010-06-07-Six Ways Twitter May Reach its Big Hairy Audacious Goal of One Billion Users</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi, I stumbled on your site and I am thinking about starting a website. I
haven't received a good answer about what I should use to buildit, so I
thought I would give it a shot.I am a windows guy. I know .Net and ASP and how
to build web sites using that stack. But I notice most sites use LAMP and
that's what most people talk about using. What's wrong with using Windows?.Net

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:Now that we have a new computing paradigm,
Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data
vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds?
Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space,
and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still
seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids
versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are
a number of issues driving this uncertainty.read more at:BigDataMatters.com</p><p>5 0.97452021 <a title="323-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-23-When_to_migrate_your_database%3F.html">782 high scalability-2010-02-23-When to migrate your database?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming
your business - reports are out of date, your batch processing window is
nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database
consolidation - remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database
environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware,
OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are
clear,  what now?ďťżRead more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>6 0.97386891 <a title="323-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Paper%3A_Pig_Latin%3A_A_Not-So-Foreign_Language_for_Data_Processing.html">443 high scalability-2008-11-14-Paper: Pig Latin: A Not-So-Foreign Language for Data Processing</a></p>

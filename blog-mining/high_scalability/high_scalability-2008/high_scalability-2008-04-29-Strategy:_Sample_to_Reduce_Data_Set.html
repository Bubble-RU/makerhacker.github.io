<p>Introduction: From theirwebsite:There are a number of times in which you find yourself
needing performance data. These can include benchmarking, monitoring a
system's general heath or trying to determine what your system was doing at
some time in the past. Sometimes you just want to know what the system is
doing right now. Depending on what you're doing, you often end up using
different tools, each designed to for that specific situation. Features
include:You are be able to run with non-integral sampling
intervals.Collectluses very little CPU. In fact it has been measured to use
<0.1% when run as a daemon using the default sampling interval of 60 seconds
for process and slab data and 10 seconds for everything else.Brief, verbose,
and plot formats are supported.You can report aggregated performance numbers
on many devices such as CPUs, Disks, interconnects such as Infiniband or
Quadrics, Networks or even Lustre file systems.Collectl will align its
sampling on integral second boundaries.Supports proce</p><p>3 0.16345103 <a title="311-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-27-Paper%3A__Dapper%2C_Google%27s_Large-Scale_Distributed_Systems_Tracing_Infrastructure.html">815 high scalability-2010-04-27-Paper:  Dapper, Google's Large-Scale Distributed Systems Tracing Infrastructure</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Imagine a single search request coursing through Google's massive
infrastructure. A single request can run across thousands of machines and
involve hundreds of different subsystems. And oh by the way, you are
processing more requests per second than any other system in the world. How do
you debug such a system? How do you figure out where the problems are? How do
you determine if programmers are coding correctly? How do you keep sensitive
data secret and safe? How do ensure products don't use more resources than
they are assigned? How do you store all the data? How do you make use of
it?That's where Dapper comes in. Dapper is Google's tracing system and it was
originally created to understand the system behaviour from a search request.
Now Google's production clustersgenerate more than 1 terabyte of sampled trace
data per day. So how does Dapper do what Dapper does?Dapper is described in an
very well written and intricately detailed paper:Dapper, a Large-Scale

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are
hired at many software companies...Agency: So sorry you had to wait in the
reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally
found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you
may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our
manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so
I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?Applicant: I
drive a 2008 Subaru.Agency: That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent
you.Applicant: That's OK. Any car will do.Agency: No, we can only take on
clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way.
There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take
a chance.Applicant: I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been
driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt. Agency: We

DUGDALE.The concept of road trains--up to eight vehicles zooming down the road
together--has long been considered a faster, safer, and greener way of

<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word
alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and
the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world
is:the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more
dough for many more cookies. Itâ€™s the difference between making enough dough
in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.Hey, pretty close to
the website notion. Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be
tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed
to do (quoted from the article):Be Patient- When making large batches of
cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.Use
Fresh Ingredients- This is always an important thing to keep in mind.Donâ€™t use
as much leavening- When youâ€™re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember
to scale down the amount of baking powder that you use.Watch the spice- As a

<p>Introduction: Every time a technological innovation has spurred automation - since the time
of Henry Ford right up to a minute ago - someone has claimed that machines
will displace human beings. But the rainbow and unicorn dream attributed to
business stakeholders everywhere, i.e. the elimination of IT, is just that - a
dream. It isn't realistic and in fact it's downright silly to think that
systems that only a few years ago were unable to automatically scale up and
scale down will suddenly be able to perform the complex analysis required of
IT to keep the business running.The rare reports of the elimination of IT
staff due tocloud computingand automation are highlighted in the news because
they evoke visceral reactions in technologists everywhere and, to be honest,
they get the click counts rising. But thejury remains out on this oneand in
fact many postulate that it is not a reduction in staff that will occur, but
atransformationof staff, which may eliminate some old timey positions (think

by Avinash Agrawal on the black art of capacity planning:How to get started
with sizing and capacity planning, assuming we don't know the software
behavior and its completely new product to deal with?Gil Tene, Vice President
of Technology and CTO & Co-Founder, wrote a very understandable and useful
answer that is worth highlighting:Start with requirements. I see way too many
"capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some
irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this
thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.There are two key
sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:In the
"How Much" part, you need to establish, based on expected business needs,

<p>Introduction: Wired has awonderful interview with Clayton Christensen, author of the tech
ninja's bible, Innovator's Dilemma. Innovation is the name of the game in
Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this
article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained
with compelling examples by the man himself.Just as every empire has fallen,
every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become
comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of
mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the
disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.He also talks
about his new book,The Capitalist's Dilemma, which addresses this puzzle: if
corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?If someone can
help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a
fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here's a

<p>Introduction: SinceThe Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage was published we've a had
few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their
Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East
Region. Netlix shared theirLessons Learned from the AWS Outage as did Heroku
(How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage), Smug Mug (How SmugMug survived the
Amazonpocalypse), and SimpleGeo (How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS
Downtime). The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of
response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been
almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon
was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to
talk about the event itself.Lesson for crisis handlers: deep dive post-mortems
that are timely, long, honestish, and highly technical are the most effective
means of staunching the downward spiral of media attention. Amazon's

<p>Introduction: Update:Arjenlinks to videoSupporting Scalable Online Statistical
Processingwhich shows"rather than doing complete aggregates, use statistical
sampling to provide a reasonable estimate (unbiased guess) of the result."When
you have a lot of data,samplingallows you to draw conclusions from a much
smaller amount of data. That's why sampling is a scalability solution. If you
don't have to process all your data to get the information you need then
you've made the problem smaller and you'll need fewer resources and you'll get
more timely results.breakSampling is not useful when you need a complete list
that matches a specific criteria. If you need to know the exact set of people
who bought a car in the last week then sampling won't help.But, if you want to
know many people bought a car then you could take a sample and then create
estimate of the full data-set. The difference is you won't really know the
exact car count. You'll have a confidence interval saying how confident you
are in your es</p><p>3 0.81830633 <a title="311-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-03-Product%3A_nginx.html">314 high scalability-2008-05-03-Product: nginx</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 6:nginx_http_push_module. Turn nginx into a long-polling message
queuing HTTP push server.Update 5: InLoad Balancer UpdateBarry describes how
WordPress.com moved from Pound to Nginx and are now "regularly serving about
8-9k requests/second and about 1.2Gbit/sec through a few Nginx instances and
have plenty of room to grow!".Update 4:Nginx better than Pound for load
balancing.Pound spikes at 80% CPU, Nginx uses 3% and is easier to understand
and better documented.Update 3: igvita.com combines two cool tools together
for better performance inNginx and Memcached, a 400% boost!.Update 2: Software

<p>Introduction: Please seeThe Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage for a new
improved list.So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage.
Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some
chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and
their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the
cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a
prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change
remains...cloudy.I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes
out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's
a resource you think should be added, just let me know.Amazon's Explanation of

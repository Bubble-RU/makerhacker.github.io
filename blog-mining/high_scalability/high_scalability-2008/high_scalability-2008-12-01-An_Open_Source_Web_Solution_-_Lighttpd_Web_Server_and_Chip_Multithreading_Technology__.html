<p>Introduction: Hi everybody :)We have a bunch of webservers (about 14 at this time) running
Apache. As application framework we're using PHP with the APC Cache installed
to improve performance. For load balancing we're using a Big F5 system with
dynamic ratio (SNMP driven)To sync new/updated sourcecode we're using
subversion to "automaticly" update these servers with our latest software
relases. After updating the new source to these production servers the load of
the mashines is raising to hell.While updating the servers, they are still in
"production", serving webpages to the users. Otherwise the process of updating
would take ages. Most of the time we're only updating in the morning hours
while less users are online, because of the above issue.My guess is, that the
load is raising that high, because APC needs to recompile a bunch of new files
each time. Before and while compiling the performance simply is "bad".My goal
would be to find a better solution. We want to "sync" code no matter how many

<p>Introduction: If you are interested in future foward OS designs then you might find Akaros
worth a look. It's an operating system designed for many-core architectures
and large-scale SMP systems, with the goals of:Providing better support for
parallel and high-performance applicationsScaling the operating system to a
large number of cores A more indepth explanation of the motiviation behind
Akaros can be found inImproving Per-Node Efﬁciency in the Datacenter with
NewOS Abstractions by Barret Rhoden, Kevin Klues, David Zhu, and Eric
Brewer.The abstract:We believe datacenters can beneﬁt from more focus on per-
node efﬁciency, performance, and predictability, versus the more common focus
so far on scalability to a large number of nodes. Improving per-node efﬁciency
decreases costs and fault recovery because fewer nodes are required for the
same amount of work. We believe that the use of complex, general-purpose
operating systems is a key contributing factor to these inefﬁciencies.

many organizations. Demand is rising, and companies are looking for ways to

without raising IT operational expenses. Today companies are turning to

<p>Introduction: Scale-up solutions in the form of large SMPs have represented the mainstream
of commercial computing for the past several years. The major server vendors
continue to provide increasingly larger and more powerful machines. More
recently, scale-out solutions, in the form of clusters of smaller machines,
have gained increased acceptance for commercial computing.Scale-out solutions
are particularly effective in high-throughput web-centric applications.In this
paper, we investigate the behavior of two competing approaches to parallelism,
scale-up and scale-out, in an emerging search application. Our conclusions
show that a scale-out strategy can be the key to good performance even on a
scale-up machine.Furthermore, scale-out solutions offer better
price/performance, although at an increase in management complexity.Read more
about scaling out/up and about the conclusions here (PDF - you can also

<p>Introduction: This and the next post will discuss how virtualization and cloud computing, as
we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today's IT
inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much
simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core
inefficiencies lie. Virtualization principles must be extended to higher
levels of the application stack, to make it easier for all of us to manage,
tune and integrate applications. Otherwise we will continue to spend most of
our time on things that don't provide real value to the business.Read the full

<p>Introduction: Since its inception,Amazon EC2has enabled companies to run highly scalable
infrastructure with minimal overhead.  Over the years, Amazon Web Services has
expanded with new offerings and additional regions around the world.All this
growth has made establishing a global footprint easier than ever.  And yet,
most EC2 customers still choose to operate in a single region.  While this is
fine for many applications, customers with significant web infrastructure are
depriving users of drastically improved performance.  Deploying infrastructure
in EC2's new regions cuts out one of the biggest sources of latency:
distance.Inthis post, I describe howBizosignificantly reduced load times by
implementing Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) to distribute traffic across

<p>Introduction: I am excited about the upcoming release of two books on Web 2.0 and Cloud
Application Architectures by O'Reilly.Web 2.0 Architectures(estimated release
in May 2009)What entrepreneurs and information architects need to knowUsing
several high-profile Web 2.0 companies as examples, authors Duane Nickull,
Dion Hinchcliffe, and James Governor have distilled the core patterns of Web
2.0 coupled with an abstract model and reference architecture. The result is a
base of knowledge that developers, business people, futurists, and
entrepreneurs can understand and use as a source of ideas and inspiration.
Featured architectures include Google, Flickr, BitTorrent, MySpace, Facebook,
and Wikipedia.Cloud Application Architectures(estimated release in April
2009)Building Applications and Infrastructure in the CloudThis book by George
Reese offers tested techniques for creating web applications on cloud
computing infrastructures and for migrating existing systems to these
environments. Specifically, yo</p><p>6 0.61703271 <a title="452-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-13-10_Hot_Scalability_Links_for_January_13%2C_2010.html">760 high scalability-2010-01-13-10 Hot Scalability Links for January 13, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With more users interacting, working, purchasing, and communicating over the
network than ever before, Web 2.0 infrastructure is taking center stage in
many organizations. Demand is rising, and companies are looking for ways to
tackle the performance and scalability needs placed on Web infrastructure
without raising IT operational expenses. Today companies are turning to
efďŹ cient, high-performance, open source solutions as a way to decrease
acquisition, licensing, and other ongoing costs and stay within budget
constraints.</p><p>2 0.84405768 <a title="452-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-27-Video%3A_Storage_in_the_Cloud_at_Joyent.html">503 high scalability-2009-01-27-Video: Storage in the Cloud at Joyent</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,First of all; thanks for a creating a GREAT resource on high scalability
architecture. For us building high scalability solutions from the west coast
of (tiny) Norway good input on the subject isn't always abundant.Which leads
me to my next question; Are there any events or conferences on high
scalability / SaaS in the US or internationally that any of you would
recommend architects or data center managers to attend?</p><p>4 0.7946381 <a title="452-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-The_cost_of_High_Availability_%28HA%29_with_Oracle_.html">813 high scalability-2010-04-19-The cost of High Availability (HA) with Oracle </a></p>
<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000
or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is
estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High
Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as
uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.This post focuses on a
customer's backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a
dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA
features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the
challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services
and annual support?Read more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>5 0.77005655 <a title="452-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-10-When_optimizing_-_don%27t_forget_the_Java_Virtual_Machine_%28JVM%29_.html">701 high scalability-2009-09-10-When optimizing - don't forget the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently, I was working on a project that was coming to a close. It was
related to optimizing a database using a Java based in-memory cache to reduce
the load. The application had to process up to a million objects per day and
was characterized by its heavy use of memory and the high number of read,
write and update operations. These operations were found to be the most
costly, which meant that optimization efforts were concentrated here.The
project had already achieved impressive performance increases, but one
question remained unanswered - would changing the JVM increase
performance?Read more at:http://bigdatamatters.com/bigdatamatters/2009/08/jvm-

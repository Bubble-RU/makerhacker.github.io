Wilson helps with theUnderstanding HBase and BigTableby explaining them from a
"conceptual standpoint."Update:InfoQ interview:HBase Leads Discuss Hadoop,
BigTable and Distributed Databases. "MapReduce (both Google's and Hadoop's) is
ideal for processing huge amounts of data with sizes that would not fit in a
traditional database. Neither is appropriate for transaction/single request
processing."Hbaseis the open source answer to BigTable, Google's highly
scalable distributed database. It is built on top of Hadoop (product), which
implements functionality similar to Google's GFS and Map/Reduce systems. Both
Google's GFS and Hadoop's HDFS provide a mechanism to reliably store large
amounts of data. However, there is not really a mechanism for organizing the
data and accessing only the parts that are of interest to a particular
application.Bigtable (and Hbase) provide a means for organizing and

amount of hardware that matters. It's the architecture of the application. You
have to work at making your app architecture so that it takes advantage of
Amazon. You have to have complete fluidity with the storage tier, the web
tier. We are running our own data centers. We are looking more at doing our
own data centers with more of a private cloud.Love the sensing making

<p>Introduction: A group of top Silicon Valley engineers (ex-Yahoo, Facebook, Google) have come
together to launch a new startup calledCloudera.Not yet launched, it intends
to help other companies adopt a promising software platform called
Hadoop.Hadoopis an open-source software project (written in Java) designed to
let developers write and run applications that process huge amounts of data.
While it could potentially improve a wide range of other software, the
ecosystem supporting its implementation is still developing. Which is where
Cloudera hopes to make a place for itself.More on Hadoop: It uses the Google-
introduced MapReduce systems framework that divides applications into small
blocks of work, creating multiple replicas of data blocks that it places on
various computer nodes.It is already in use at large companies likeYahoo.Read

<p>Introduction: FromWikipedia:SmartFrogis an open-source software framework, written in Java,
that manages the configuration, deployment and coordination of a software
system broken into components. These components may be distributed across
several network hosts. The configuration of components is described using a
domain-specific language, whose syntax resembles that of Java. It is a
prototype-based object-oriented language, and may thus be compared to Self.
The framework is used internally in a variety of HP products. Also, it is
being used by HP Labs partners like CERN.Related ArticlesDistributed Testing

<p>Introduction: Update:Streamy Explains CAP and HBase's Approach to CAP.We plan to employ
inter-cluster replication, with each cluster located in a single DC. Remote
replication will introduce some eventual consistency into the system, but each
cluster will continue to be strongly consistent.Ryan Barrett, Google App
Engine datastore lead, gave this talkTransactions Across Datacenters (and
Other Weekend Projects)at the Google I/O 2009 conference.While the talk
doesn't necessarily break new technical ground, Ryan does an excellent job
explaining and evaluating the different options you have when architecting a
system to work across multiple datacenters. This is calledmultihoming,
operating from multiple datacenters simultaneously.As multihoming is one of
the most challenging tasks in all computing, Ryan's clear and thoughtful style
comfortably leads you through the various options. On the trip you learn:The
differentmulti-homing optionsare: Backups, Master-Slave, Multi-Master, 2PC,
and Paxos.

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: In Google+ Is Built Using Tools You Can Use Too: Closure, Java Servlets,
JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround we glimpsed inside Google's
technology stack for building Google+. Mark Knichel, an engineer on the
Google+ infrastructure team, has helped us look alittle deeper on how
Javascript is handled in Google+.  Here's a quick look:They loveClosure for
its library, templates, compiler, and strict type checking. Compilation is now
required for good performance. I've wondered if GWT will be killed off as have
other Google properties, but I've been told GWT is being used heavily inside
Google, so thankfully that probably won't happen.Closure templatesare used
both Java and JavaScript to render pages server-side and in the browser. Just-
in-time JavaScript. Code is split into modules so the minimum amount of
JavaScript is loaded asynchronously in the background as necessary. Navigation
happens without loading the page.Page navigation happens without page reloads.

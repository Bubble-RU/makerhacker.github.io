<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage
of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with
CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable
solution that</p><p>3 0.17672785 <a title="465-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-21-Running_TPC-C_on_MySQL-RDS.html">1065 high scalability-2011-06-21-Running TPC-C on MySQL-RDS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently came across a TPC-C benchmark results held on MySQL based RDS
databases. You can see ithere. I think the results may bring light to many
questions concerning MySQL scalability in general and RDS scalability in
particular. (For disclosure, I'm working forScaleBasewhere we run an internal
scale out TPC-C benchmark these days, and will publish results soon).TPC-
CTPC-C is a standard database benchmark, used to measure databases. The
database vendors invest big bucks in running this test, and showing off which
database is faster, and can scale better.It is a write intensive test, so it
doesn't necessarily reflect the behavior of the database in your application.
But it does give some very important insights on what you can expect from your
database under heavy load.The Benchmark ProcessFirst of all, I have some
comments for the benchmark method itself.Generally - the benchmarks were held
in an orderly fashion and in a rather methodological way - which increases the

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good
SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and
make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was
written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in A day in the life of a slow page
at Stack Overflow, where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was
possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for
other pages the improvement was 100x.Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of
his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the
tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:Using theirmini-
profiler it was shown that abadge detail pagewas taking 630.3 ms to load,
298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL
queries for the page and how long each took.From the historical logs, which
are stored inHAProxy on a month-by-month basis, Sam was able to determine this

doesn't work on more cores without substantial redesign. For a taste of the
issues take a look atNo new global mutexes! (and how to make the
thread/connection pool work), which shows some of the difficulties of making
MySQL perform on SMP servers.In this paper, Richard Smith, a -Staff Engineer
at Sun, goes into some nice detail on multi-core issues. His take home lessons
are:Use fine-grained locking or lock-free strategyDocument the strategy,
including correctnesscriteria (invariants)Keep critical sections shortProfile

<p>Introduction: MySQL Expert Ronald Bradford explains how one key way to improve the
scalability of a MySQL server, and undoubtedly nearly every other server, is
toeliminate unnecessary SQL, saying the most efficient way to improve an SQL
statement is to eliminate it:The MySQL kernel can only physically process a
certain number of SQL statements for a given time period (e.g. per second).
Regardless of the type of machine you have, there is a physical limit. If you
eliminate SQL statements that are unwarranted and unnecessary, you
automatically enable more important SQL statements to run. There are numerous
other downstream affects, however this is the simple math. To run more SQL,
reduce the number of SQL you need to run.Ronald shows how to use mk-query-
digest to look at query execution times and determine which ones can be
profitably whacked. Related ArticlesQuora:What are the best methods for

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released
information onPregel. Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip.
Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure......to mine a wide range of
graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each
iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages
sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify
its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's
topology.Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this
limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but
so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing
problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much
faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to
use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

<p>Introduction: When you have a large population of servers you have both the opportunity and
the incentive to perform interesting studies. Authors from Google and the
University of California in Optimizing Google's Warehouse Scale Computers: The
NUMA Experience conducted such a study, taking a look at how jobs run on
clusters of machines using a NUMA architecture. Since NUMA is common on server
class machines it's a topic of general interest for those looking to maximize
machine utilization across clusters.Some of the results are surprising:The
methodology of how to attribute such fine performance variations to NUMA
effects within such a complex system is perhaps more interesting than the
results themselves. Well worth reading just for that story.The performance
swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on
Intel Westmere for Web-search frontend. Memory locality is not always King.
Because of the interaction between NUMA and cache sharing/contention it turns

<p>Introduction: Update: How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences. Shows how to
analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what
I mean. Steve Souders, author ofHigh Performance WebsitesandYslow, hasten more

without blockingDon't scatter scriptsSplit dominant content domainsMake static

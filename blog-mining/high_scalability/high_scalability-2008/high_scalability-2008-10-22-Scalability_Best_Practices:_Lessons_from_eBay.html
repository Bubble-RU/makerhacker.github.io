<p>Introduction: Update 2:  EBay's Randy Shoup spills the secrets of how to service hundreds of millions of users and over two billion page views a day in Scalability  Best Practices: Lessons from eBay  on InfoQ. The practices: Partition by Function, Split Horizontally, Avoid Distributed Transactions,  Decouple Functions Asynchronously, Move Processing To Asynchronous Flows, Virtualize At All Levels, Cache Appropriately.  Update:   eBay Serves 5 Billion API Calls Each Month .  Aren't we seeing more and more traffic driven by mashups composed on top of open APIs? APIs are no longer a bolt on, they are your application. Architecturally that argues for implementing your own application around the same APIs developers and users employ.   Who hasn't wondered how eBay does their business?

<p>Introduction: For solutions take a look at:  7 Life Saving Scalability Defenses Against Load Monster Attacks . 
 
This is a look at all the bad things that can happen to your carefully crafted program as loads increase: all hell breaks lose. Sure, you can scale out or scale up, but you can also choose to program better. Make your system handle larger loads. This saves money because fewer boxes are needed and it will make the entire application more reliable and have better response times. And it can be quite satisfying as a programmer.
  Large Number Of Objects  
We usually get into scaling problems when the number of objects gets  larger. Clearly resource usage of all types is stressed as the number of objects grow.
  Continuous Failures Makes An Infinite Event Stream  
During large network failure scenarios there is never time for the system recover. We are in a continual state of stress.
  Lots of High Priority Work  
For example, rerouting is a high priority activity.

<p>Introduction: There’s some amount of debate whether Facebook  really  crossed over the one trillion page view per month threshold. While one report says it did,  another respected firm says it did not ; that its monthly page views are a mere 467 billion per month.


In the big scheme of things, the discrepancy is somewhat irrelevant, as neither show the  true  load on Facebook’s infrastructure – which is far more impressive a set of numbers than its externally measured “page view” metric.  Mashable reported in “ Facebook Surpasses 1 Trillion Pageviews per Month ” that the social networking giant saw “approximately 870 million unique visitors in June and 860 million in July” and followed up with some per visitor statistics, indicating “each visitor averaged approximately 1,160 page views in July and 40 per visit — enormous by any standard. Time spent on the site was around 25 minutes per user.”


From an architectural standpoint it’s not  just  about the page views. It’s about requests and responses,</p><p>5 0.11206616 <a title="425-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-17-10_eBay_Secrets_for_Planet_Wide_Scaling.html">742 high scalability-2009-11-17-10 eBay Secrets for Planet Wide Scaling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You don't even have to make a bid, Randy Shoup, anÂ eBay Distinguished Architect, gives this  presentation  on how eBay scales, for free. Randy has done a fabulous job in this presentation and in other talks listed at the end of this post getting at the heart of the principles behind scalability. It's more about ideas of how things work and fit together than a focusing on a particular technology stack.

<p>Introduction: In the era of Web 2.0 traditional approaches to capacity planning are often difficult to implement. Guerrilla Capacity Planning facilitates rapid forecasting of capacity requirements based on the opportunistic use of whatever performance data and tools are available.  One unique Guerrilla tool is Virtual Load Testing, based on Dr. Gunther's "Universal Law of Computational Scaling", which provides a highly cost-effective method for assessing application scalability. Neil Gunther, M.Sc., Ph.D. is an internationally recognized computer system performance consultant who founded Performance Dynamics Company in 1994.  Some reasons why you should understand this law:   1. A lot of people use the term "scalability" without clearly defining it, let alone defining it quantitatively. Computer system scalability must be quantified. If you can't quantify it, you can't guarantee it. The universal law of computational scaling provides that quantification.   2. One the greatest impediments to applying</p><p>3 0.70657307 <a title="425-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-06-Scalability_for_Startups%3A_How_to_Grow_Up_without_Blowing_Up.html">404 high scalability-2008-10-06-Scalability for Startups: How to Grow Up without Blowing Up</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a useful post by Frank Mashraqi, Director of Business Operations & Technical Strategy for a top 50 website that delivers billions of page views per month.          Since scalability is considered a non-functional requirement, it is often overlooked in the hopes of decreasing time to market. Adding scalability down the road can decrease the time to market but only after assuming significant technical debt.         Balancing performance and scalability vs. fast iteration and cost efficiency can be a significant challenge for startups. The good news is that achieving this balance is not impossible.

<p>Introduction: Disqus - Scaling the Worlds Largest Django App.  Interesting overview of a commenting system with 75 million comments and 250 million visitors. Lots of good details on how they partition their database, testing, continuous integration, feature switches, caching, delayed signals, and more. 
 
  Things I learnt tracking a billion events in 24 hours : Know your host, Scaling isn't just servers, My servers need to talk to me more, Kill switches for users, What you don't know is the problem, Don't mix server roles, Know your most important users outside of your site.

<p>Introduction: At the  Future of Web Apps  conference  Kevin Rose  (Digg, Pownce, Wefollow) gave a  cool presentation  on the  top 10 down and dirty ways you can grow your web app . He took the questions he's most often asked and turned it into a very informative talk.  This isn't the typical kind of scalability we cover on this site. There aren't any infrastructure and operations tips. But the reason we care about scalability is to support users and Kevin has a lot of good techniques to help your user base bloom.  Here's a summary of the 10 ways to grow your consumer web application:   1. Ego.  Ask does this feature increase the users self-worth or stroke the ego?

<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech has  developed AdHoc , an advanced framework for sharing geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective. The premise of AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access to his or her resources without an IT administrator’s help, and with high security level of any exposed data or applications assured. It takes 3 easy steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization, add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join forces for more efficient results.  AdHoc was initially created for a consortium of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the administration</p><p>5 0.92549717 <a title="425-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-07-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_10_Ways_to_Take_your_Site_from_One_to_One_Million_Users_by_Kevin_Rose__.html">1356 high scalability-2012-11-07-Gone Fishin': 10 Ways to Take your Site from One to One Million Users by Kevin Rose  </a></p>

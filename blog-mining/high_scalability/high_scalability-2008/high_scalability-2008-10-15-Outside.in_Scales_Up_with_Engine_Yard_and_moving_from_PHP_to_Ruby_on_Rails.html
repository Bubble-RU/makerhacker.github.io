<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived
processes) and why they moved toScalato program against it (high level

<p>Introduction: This is the intriguing quote by Bill Venners in an interview with Twitter's
Alex Payne on Twitter's heretical switch from a pure Ruby stack to a Ruby on
Rails stack on the front-end and JVM/Scala on the back-end:So performance was
also one of the problems with JRuby, which I [Bill Venners] think helps
explain better why they'd [Twitter] prefer Scala over Ruby or JRuby for some
things.I have often heard Rubyists say that although Ruby is slower than Java,
for many things it is plenty fast enough, and they are right. The logic goes
further, saying that servers are cheap, and programmers expensive, so it makes
sense to tradeoff some runtime performance for programmer productivity. And I
think that's very often true too, but not always.If you have enough traffic,
at some point the cost of servers outweighs the cost of programmers. I'm not
sure whether Twitter is past that point, but they get a lot of traffic. And
frankly this isn't an intrinsic tradeoff. Other dynamic languages are faster</p><p>4 0.1314594 <a title="417-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-02-Friends_for_Sale_Architecture_-_A_300_Million_Page_View-Month_Facebook_RoR_App.html">313 high scalability-2008-05-02-Friends for Sale Architecture - A 300 Million Page View-Month Facebook RoR App</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: I'm not sure what I was expecting the stack GOV.UK used at launch to look
like. Maybe some messenger owls and lots of cobwebs? But not so at all. So
much not so I thought any organization looking at their own stack for ideas
could learn something from the considered choices of others.The diversity of
technologies used was surprising. They use "at least five different
programming languages, three separate database types, two versions of an
operating system." Some may think of this as a weakness, but they think it a
strength:The reason we operate such a diverse ecosystem is that we are focused
on solving real problems. Our first task is to understand the problem or need
we are solving and then to choose the best tool for the job. If we restrict
ourselves to moulding the need to the tools we already have, then we risk not
solving the initial problem in the best way possible for the user. By
restricting software diversity or enforcing rigid organisational standards on
a project, there is a</p><p>6 0.12389086 <a title="417-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_eAccelerator_a_PHP_Accelerator.html">32 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: eAccelerator a PHP Accelerator</a></p>

<p>Introduction: eAcceleratoris a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic
content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in
their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely
eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution.
eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP
code by 1-10 times.</p><p>4 0.62502617 <a title="417-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-09-Site_Moves_from_PHP_to_Facebook%27s_HipHop%2C_Now_Pages_Load_in_.6_Seconds_Instead_of_Five.html">1561 high scalability-2013-12-09-Site Moves from PHP to Facebook's HipHop, Now Pages Load in .6 Seconds Instead of Five</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you code in PHP have you ever wondered about moving to Facebook'sHipHop JIT
Virtual Machine for PHP? With HipHop Facebook achieved over a 9x increase in
web request throughput and over a 5x reduction in memory consumption compared
to Zend PHP 5.2 engine + APC.But will HipHop really work for you? Is it really
drop-in compatible? Is it really as fast as they say?To answer questions like
this nothing beats a good experience report and here's a great one:Adventures
in Configuring and Running Facebook's HipHopVM (hhvm) JIT Compiler for PHP by
Yermo Lamers.Yermo selected PHP to implement a number of content web sites. He
took an interesting approach, he created a forms, views, validation, and
business logic description language to remove the drudgery of creating the
same code over and over again for each page. Having done this in Perl I think
it's a great a approach. The problem is it can be slow. PHP's slow string
handling makes dynamically evaluating a description template for each page</p><p>5 0.52131093 <a title="417-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-17-Moving_old_to_new._Do_not_be_afraid_of_the_re-write_--_but_take_some_help.html">218 high scalability-2008-01-17-Moving old to new.

<p>Introduction: Recently I had to help users on one of my opensource project ISPMan.
http://ispman.netThis project started in 2001 as I was too unwilling to take
care of the DNS and VitualHosting stuff as it was a side-thing to the company
I worked for (so i wrote a software that took care of all these little
details)Summary: A large project that needs a rewrite can be done in a matter
of day.I will not give you a full case study about a project that went through
a re-write but a case study about how easy it is to re-write
something.breakDetails:My boss was cool enough to let me open-source the
project and obviously, I got a lot of cool-cred out of it.Later on I also did
some support and implementation and earned quiet some money with it.Eventually
I had to let the project go out of my hand to the community as I only did it
to facilitate a job that wasnt williing to do. (Setup DNS zones of multiple
servers, find out which host should host the website and put VirtualHost
section there, find out which m</p><p>6 0.51025438 <a title="417-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable_Web_Architectures_and_Application_State.html">656 high scalability-2009-07-16-Scalable Web Architectures and Application State</a></p>

scaled up its service and moved from PHP to Ruby on Rails (they moved maybe
because Ruby code seemed to be more maintanable that PHP code?).The whole

<p>Introduction: The Declarative Imperative: Experiences and Conjectures in Distributed Logic
is written by UC Berkeley's Joseph Hellersteinfor a keynote speech he gave at
PODS. The video version of the talk is here. You may have heard about Mr.
Hellerstein through theBerkeley Orders Of Magnitude project (BOOM), whose
purpose is to help people build systems that are OOM (orders of magnitude)
bigger than are building today, with OOM less effort than traditional
programming methodologies. A noble goal which may be why BOOM was rated as a
top 10 emerging technology for 2010 byMIT Technology Review. Quite an
honor.The motivation for the talk is a familiar one: it's a dark period for
computer programming and if we don't learn how to write parallel programs the
children of Moore's law will destroy us all. We have more and more processors,
yet we are stuck on figuring out how the average programmer can exploit them.
The BOOM solution is the Bloom language which is based onDedalus: Dedalus is a

<p>Introduction: I currently use BerkeleyDB as an embedded
databasehttp://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/a decision which was
initially brought on by learning that Google used BerkeleyDB for their
universal sign-on feature.Lustre looks impressive, but their white paper shows
speeds of 800 files created per second, as a good number. However, BerkeleyDB
on my mac mini does 200,000 row creations per second, and can be used as a
distributed file system.I'm having I/O scalability issues with BerkeleyDB on
one machine, and about to implement their distributed replication feature (and
go multi-machine), which in effect makes it work like a distributed file
system, but with local access speeds. That's why I was looking at Lustre.The
key feature difference between BerkeleyDB and Lustre is that BerkeleyDB has a
complete copy of all the data on each computer, making it not a viable
solution for massive sized database applications. However, if you have < 1TB
(ie, one disk) of total possible data, it seems to</p><p>4 0.95851791 <a title="417-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-12-Netflix%3A_Developing%2C_Deploying%2C_and_Supporting_Software_According_to_the_Way_of_the_Cloud.html">1155 high scalability-2011-12-12-Netflix: Developing, Deploying, and Supporting Software According to the Way of the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At a Cloud Computing Meetup, Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a
merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:Keeping Movies Running
Amid Thunderstorms. While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the
cloud, issues with capacity planning,thundering herds, latency problems,
andsimian armageddon, I found myself most taken with how they handlesoftware
deployment in the cloud.I've worked on half a dozen or more build and
deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large
organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability
that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant
software deployments:the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to
completely run a new release while running the old release at the same
time.The process goes something like: Acanary machineis launched first with
the new software load running real traffic to sanity test the load in a
production environment. If the ca</p><p>5 0.95760715 <a title="417-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Letting_Clients_Know_What%27s_Changed%3A_Push_Me_or_Pull_Me%3F.html">205 high scalability-2008-01-10-Letting Clients Know What's Changed: Push Me or Pull Me?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a false beliefI thought I came here to stayWe're all just visitingAll
just breaking like wavesThe oceans made me, but who came up with me?Push me,
pull me, push me, or pull me out .So true Perl Jam(Push me Pull me lyrics), so
true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes.
Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from
servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.breakTo pull
events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server.
This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a
list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has
changed and makes those changes available to you. Knowing what has changed can
be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very
complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state
on what I client still needs to see.Polling is heavy man. Imagine all your

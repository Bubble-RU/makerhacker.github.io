<p>Introduction: Power on a cell phone is like water in a desert. It’s the very stuff of life. If you take the same naive programming techniques you learned when programming on a server in a datacenter your cell phone will die of thirst.
 
This is dramatically shown by   Reto Meier   , Tech Lead for the Android Developer Relations Team, in a remarkable series of instructional videos:

   Remarkable because these videos are short, to the point, and chocked full of useful ideas and techniques. Though Android is targeted specifically, most of content should be generally useful.

<p>Introduction: There has been a lot of speculation over how Apple's  iCloud  would work. With the  Apple Worldwide Developers Conference  keynotes having just completed, we finally learned the truth. We can handle it. They made some interesting and cost effective architecture choices that preserved the value of their devices and the basic model of how their existing services work.
 
A lot of pundits foretold that with all the datacenters Apple was building we would get a streaming music solution. Only one copy of music would be stored and then streamed on demand to everyone. Or they could go the Google brute force method and copy up all a user's music and play it on demand.
 
Apple did neither. The chose an interesting middle path that's not Google, Amazon, or even MobileMe.
 
They key idea is you no longer need a PC. Device content is now synced over the air and is managed by the cloud, not your legacy computer. Your data may not even be stored in the cloud, but the whole management, syncing, and co</p><p>4 0.15580201 <a title="343-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Letting_Clients_Know_What%27s_Changed%3A_Push_Me_or_Pull_Me%3F.html">205 high scalability-2008-01-10-Letting Clients Know What's Changed: Push Me or Pull Me?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a false belief I thought I came here to stay We're all just visiting All just breaking like waves The oceans made me, but who came up with me? Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out .     So true Perl Jam   (Push me Pull me lyrics)  , so true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes. Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.       To pull events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server. This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has changed and makes those changes available to you.  Knowing what has changed can be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state on what I client still needs to see.     Polling is heavy man.</p><p>5 0.14713883 <a title="343-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-23-Sponsored_Post%3A_Apple%2C_Surge%2C_Change%2C_Booking%2C_Rackspace%2C_aiCache%2C_Aerospike%2C_ScaleOut%2C_New_Relic%2C_LogicMonitor%2C_AppDynamics%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1496 high scalability-2013-07-23-Sponsored Post: Apple, Surge, Change, Booking, Rackspace, aiCache, Aerospike, ScaleOut, New Relic, LogicMonitor, AppDynamics, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ivan Zuzak wrote a fascinating article on  Real-time feed processing and filtering  using Google App Engine to build  Feed-buster , a service that  inserts MediaRSS tags into feeds that don't have them . He talks about using polling and  PubSubHubBub  (real-time) to process FriendFeed feeds. Ivan is trying to devise a separate filtering service where:

<p>Introduction: Wildly popular VC blogger  Fred Wilson  defines in an excellent  27 minute video  the ten most important criteria he uses when deciding to give the gold, that is, fund a web application. Note, this video is  from 2010 , so no doubt the ideas are still valid, but the importance of mobile vs web apps has probably shifted to mobile, as Mr. Wilson says in a recent post:  mobile is growing like a weed . 
  
   Speed  - speed is more than a feature, it's a requirement. Mainstream users are unforgiving. If something is slow they won't use it. Pingdom is used to track speed across their portfolio. A trend they've noticed is that as an application slows down they don't grow as quickly.   
   Instant Utility  - a service must be instantly useful to users. Lengthy setup and configuration is a killer. Tricks like crawling the web to populate information you expect to get from your users later makes the service initially useful. YouTube won, for example, with instant availability of uploaded video.</p><p>5 0.6710397 <a title="343-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-20-Netflix%3A_Use_Less_Chatty_Protocols_in_the_Cloud_-_Plus_26_Fixes.html">960 high scalability-2010-12-20-Netflix: Use Less Chatty Protocols in the Cloud - Plus 26 Fixes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  5 Lessons We’ve Learned Using AWS , Netflix's John Ciancutti says one of the big lessons they've learned is to create less  chatty protocols :
  
 In the Netflix data centers, we have a high capacity, super fast, highly reliable network. This has afforded us the luxury of designing around chatty APIs to remote systems. AWS networking has more variable latency. We’ve had to be much more structured about “over the wire” interactions, even as we’ve transitioned to a more highly distributed architecture. 
  
There's not a lot of advice out there on how to create protocols. Combine that with a rush to the cloud and you have a perfect storm for chatty applications crushing application performance. Netflix is far from the first to be surprised by the less than stellar networks inside AWS. 
 
A chatty protocol is one where a client makes a series of requests to a server and the client must wait on each reply before sending the next request. On a LAN this can work great. LAN's are typically</p><p>6 0.66778648 <a title="343-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-31-Read_HighScalability_on_Your_Mobile_Phone_Using_WidSets_Widgets.html">293 high scalability-2008-03-31-Read HighScalability on Your Mobile Phone Using WidSets Widgets</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Todd had originally posted an entry on  collectl  here at  Collectl - Performance Data Collector . Collectl collects real-time data from a large number of subsystems like buddyinfo, cpu, disk, inodes, infiniband, lustre, memory, network, nfs, processes, quadrics, slabs, sockets and tcp, all using one tool and in one consistent format.
 
Since then a lot has happened.  It's now part of both Fedora and Debian distros, not to mention several others. There has also been a pretty good summary written up by  Joe Brockmeier . It's also pretty well documented (I like to think) on  sourceforge . There have also been a few blog postings by   Martin Bach   on his blog.
 
Anyhow, awhile back I released a new version of collectl-utils and gave a complete face-lift to one of the utilities, colmux, which is a collectl multiplexor.  This tool has the ability to run collectl on multiple systems, which in turn send all their output back to colmux.  Colmux then sorts the output on a user-specified column</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96049041 <a title="343-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-09-Apple%27s_iPhone_to_Use_a_Centralized_Push_Based_Notification_Architecture.html">343 high scalability-2008-06-09-Apple's iPhone to Use a Centralized Push Based Notification Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Hank Williams says  iPhone Background Processing: Not Fixed But Halfway There . Excellent analysis of all the reasons you need real background processing. Hey, you can't even build an alarm clock! Hard to believe some commenters say it's not so.  .    Update: Josh Lowensohn  of Webware tells us  Why users should be scared of Apple's new notification system .      A big item on the iPhone developer iWishlist has been background processing. If you can't write an app to poll for new data in the background how will you keep your even more important non-foreground app in sync?

<p>Introduction: Atif Ghaffar  has a nice strategy to deal with virus checking uploads:
   Upload item into a safe area. If necessary, the uploader blocks waiting for a result.    Queue a work order into a job system so all the work can be distributed throughout your cluster.    A service in your cluster performs the virus scan and informs the uploader of the result.    Move the vetted item into your system.  This removes the CPU bottleneck from your web servers and distributes it through your cluster.  Keep your web servers providing prompt service to users. Let your cluster do the heavy lifting. This minimizes response time and maximizes throughput. A similar system can be used for creating thumbnails, transcoding, copyright checks, updating indexes, event notification or any other kind of intensive work.</p><p>4 0.95136279 <a title="343-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie_Lamport_to_Programmers%3A_You%27re_Doing_it_Wrong.html">1625 high scalability-2014-04-03-Leslie Lamport to Programmers: You're Doing it Wrong</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist  Leslie Lamport  is definitely not a  worse is better  kind of guy. In  Computation and State Machines  he wants to make the case that to get better programs we need to teach programmers to think better. And programmers will think better when they learn to think in terms of concepts firmly grounded in the language of mathematics.
 
I was disappointed that there was so much English in the paper. Surely it would have been more convincing if it was written as a mathematical proof. Or would it?
 
This whole topic has been argued extensively throughout thousands of years of philosophy. Mathematics has always been a strange attractor for those trying to escape a flawed human rationality. In the end as alluring as the utopia of mathematics is, it lacks a coherent theory of meaning and programming is not about rearranging ungrounded symbols, it's about manipulating and shaping meaning.
 
For programmers I think  Ludwig Wittgenstein  has the right sense of things.

<p>Introduction: We usually think of the wonderful advantages of  service oriented architectures  as a software thing, but it also applies to hardware. In  Security Now 385 , that Doyen of Disk,  Steve Gibson , tells the fascinating story (@ about 41:30) of how moving to a service oriented architecture in hard drives, modeling a drive as a linear stream of sectors, helped create the amazing high density disk drives we enjoy today.
 
When drives switched to use the  IDE  (integrated drive electronics) interface, the controller function moved into the drive instead of the computer. No longer were low level drive signals moved across cables and into the motherboard. Now we just ask the drive for the desired sector and the drive takes care of it.
 
This allowed manufacturers to do anything they wanted to behind the IDE interface. The drive stopped being dumb, it became smart, providing a sort of sector service. Density sky rocketed because there was no dependency on the computer.

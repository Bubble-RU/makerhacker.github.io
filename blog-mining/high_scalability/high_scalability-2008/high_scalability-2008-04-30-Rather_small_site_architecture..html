<p>Introduction: Drupal 7 is having a scalability makeover. Karoly Negyesi, Drupal Core Developer and Public Development Team Lead, explains the process in this video:  Drupal 7 APIs, scalability mindset . Karoly states the general theme of the changes as:  You give up some control and you get back scalability . An interesting comment on the politics of scalability?
 
Makeover may not be quite the right word though. A makeover implies a cosmetic change, looking better by changing the surface. Drupal's changes will go deeper than that, right to Drupal's core. It's a genuine and authentic change that will hopefully allow one of the Internet's most venerable Content Management Systems (CMSs) to compete with a constant stream of younger and sexier models.
 
Drupal is based on an older LAMP stack approach where PHP modules are scooped up and merged together each time a request is made to Drupal. Drupal's most intriguing idea is how it is built, expands, and changes by  weaving together a single system  out</p><p>3 0.13496959 <a title="312-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-Too_many_databases.html">231 high scalability-2008-01-29-Too many databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,         I am using drupal for my clients website, and was thinking is it possible to host all ( about 500) of them on the same server(maybe VPS or dedicated).       Here is the situation..... Each clients website has a database with about 50 tables each, all the databases are small in size about 2-5 MB .... and the websites are low traffic websites with say.. 50 hits/day on avg.... that means about 2000 queries/db/day ..... (avg 40 queries per hit)....         Wanted to know if it is possible to have so many databases about 500 on the same server?         what are the things that i should look into if i should make this happen?</p><p>4 0.11120933 <a title="312-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-16-What_tech_is_used_to_build_your_favorite_site%3F.html">66 high scalability-2007-08-16-What tech is used to build your favorite site?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Find out with Builtwith.com. It scans a site and guesses how the site is built. I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows,  PHP, Adsense, RSS, CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which AJAX library is used. Though it's kind of cool to see which sites use PHP and other technologies.</p><p>5 0.10925068 <a title="312-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Book%3A_High_Performance_MySQL.html">16 high scalability-2007-07-16-Book: High Performance MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!, maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life environments.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture for  Poppen.de , a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new, using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached, RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.
  What is Poppen.de?  
Poppen.de (NSFW) is the top dating website in  Germany, and while it may be a small site compared to giants like Flickr  or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to learn from if you  are starting to get some scaling problems.
  The  Stats   
 2.000.000 users 
 20.000  concurrent users 
 300.000 private messages per day 
 250.000  logins per day 
 We have a team  of  eleven developers, two designers and two sysadmins for this project. 
   Business Model

<p>Introduction: This  post  on www.ilovebonnie.net documents some impressive system performance improvements by the addition of  Squid Cache  (a caching proxy) and  APC Cache  (opcode cache for PHP). 
 
 Apache is able to deliver roughly 700% more requests per second with Squid when serving 1KB and 100KB images. 
 Server load is reduced using Squid because the server does not have to create a bunch of Apache processes to handle the requests. 
 APC Cache took a system that could barely handle 10-20 requests per second to handling 50-60 requests per second. A 400% increase. 
 APC allowed the load times to remain under 5 seconds even with 200 concurrent threads slamming on the server. 
 These two caches are easy to setup and install and allow you to get a lot more performance out of them. 
 
The post has an in-depth discussion and a number of supporting charts. The primary point is how simple it can be to improve performance and scalability by adding caching.</p><p>5 0.66344672 <a title="312-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-23-6_Ways_to_Kill_Your_Servers_-__Learning_How_to_Scale_the_Hard_Way.html">884 high scalability-2010-08-23-6 Ways to Kill Your Servers -  Learning How to Scale the Hard Way</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steffen Konerow, author of the    High Performance Blog   .  
 
Learning how to scale isn’t easy without any prior experience. Nowadays you have plenty of websites like  highscalability.com  to get some inspiration, but unfortunately there is no solution that fits all websites and needs. You still have to think on your own to find a concept that works for your requirements. So did I.
 
A few years ago, my bosses came to me and said “We’ve got a new project for you. It’s the relaunch of a website that has already 1 million users a month. You have to build the website and make sure we’ll be able to grow afterwards”. I was already an experienced coder, but not in these dimensions, so I had to start learning how to scale – the hard way.

<p>Introduction: Cloud computing promises a number of advantages for the deployment of data-intensive applications. Most prominently, these include reducing cost with a pay-as-you-go pricing model and (virtually) unlimited throughput by adding servers if the workload increases. At the  Systems Group , ETH Zurich, we did an extensive  end-to-end performance study  to compare the major cloud offerings regarding their ability to fulfill these promises and their implied cost.
 
The focus of the work is on transaction processing (i.e., read and update work-loads), rather than analytics workloads. We used the  TPC-W , a standardized benchmark simulating a Web-shop, as the baseline for our comparison. The TPC-W defines that users are simulated through emulated browsers (EB) and issue page requests, called web-interactions (WI), against the system. As a major modification to the benchmark, we constantly increase the load from 1 to 9000 simultaneous users to measure the scalability and cost variance of the syst</p><p>4 0.75974751 <a title="312-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-08-4_Scalability_Themes_from_Surgecon.html">917 high scalability-2010-10-08-4 Scalability Themes from Surgecon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Haas in his  SURGE Recap  of the  Surge  conference, reflected a bit, and came up with an interesting checklist of general themes from what he was seeing. I'm directly quoting his post, so please see the post for a full discussion. He uses this framework to think about the larger picture and where PostgreSQL stands in its progression.
  
  Make use of the academic literature .  Inventing your own way to do something is fine, but at least consider the possibility that someone smarter than you has thought about this problem before.  
  Failures are inevitable, so plan for them .   Try to minimize the possibility of cascading failures, and plan in advance how you can operate in degraded mode if disaster (or the Slashdot effect) strikes.  
  Disk technology matters .  Drive firmware bugs are common and nightmarish, and you can expect very limited help from the manufacturer, especially if the drive is billed as consumer-grade rather than enterprise-grade. SSDs can save you a lot of m</p><p>5 0.73884398 <a title="312-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-24-4_New_Podcasts_for_Scalable_Summertime_Reading.html">864 high scalability-2010-07-24-4 New Podcasts for Scalable Summertime Reading</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just  let the  random chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting  content." #fail. While someone says this I imagine them flicking their  hair back in a "I can't be bothered with true understanding" disdain. And  where does random chance get its content? From people like these. So:  support your local blog! 
 
If you would like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts that you may not know about and that I've found interesting:

doesn't work on more cores without substantial redesign. For a taste of the
issues take a look atNo new global mutexes! (and how to make the

MySQL perform on SMP servers.In this paper, Richard Smith, a -Staff Engineer
at Sun, goes into some nice detail on multi-core issues. His take home lessons
are:Use fine-grained locking or lock-free strategyDocument the strategy,

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Douglas Wilson, EMEA Field Application Engineer at
Raima, based on insights from biulding theirRaima Database Manager.Scalability
and HardwareScalability is the ability to maintain performance as demands on
the system increase, by adding further resources. Normally those resources
will be in the form of hardware. Since processor speeds are no longer
increasing much, scaling up the hardware normally means adding extra
processors or cores, and more memory.Scalability and SoftwareHowever,
scalability requires software that can utilize the extra hardware effectively.
The software must be designed to allow parallel processing. In the context of
a database engine this means that the server component must be multi-threaded,
to allow the operating system to schedule parallel tasks on all the cores that
are available. Not only that, but the database engine must provide an
efficient way to break its workload into as many parallel tasks as there are
cores. So, for example,</p><p>5 0.093544103 <a title="421-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-29-eHarmony.com_describes_how_they_use_Amazon_EC2_and_MapReduce_.html">644 high scalability-2009-06-29-eHarmony.com describes how they use Amazon EC2 and MapReduce </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 3:A Comparison of Approaches to Large-Scale Data Analysis: MapReduce
vs. DBMS Benchmarks.Although the process to load data into and tune the
execution of parallel DBMSs took much longer than the MR system, the observed
performance of these DBMSs was strikingly better.Update 2:H-Store: A Next
Generation OLTP DBMSis the project implementing the ideas in this paper:The
goal of the H-Store project is to investigate how these architectural and
application shifts affect the performance of OLTP databases, and to study what
performance benefits would be possible with a complete redesign of OLTP
systems in light of these trends. Our early results show that a simple
prototype built from scratch using modern assumptions can outperform current
commercial DBMS offerings by around a factor of 80 on OLTP workloads.Update:

<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are
continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand
and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable,
which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.Abstract:The long-running
nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow
processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across
multiplequeries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their
constituent, stateful operators - e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators.
To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a
shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static
techniquesfor partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as
workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue
to function robustly inthe face of these imbalances. To address this
challenge, we introduce a dataflo</p><p>4 0.65451211 <a title="421-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-30-Paper%3A_GraphLab%3A_A_New_Framework_For_Parallel_Machine_Learning.html">850 high scalability-2010-06-30-Paper: GraphLab: A New Framework For Parallel Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the never ending quest to figure out how to do something useful with never
ending streams of data, GraphLab: A New Framework For Parallel Machine
Learning wants to go beyond low-level programming, MapReduce, and dataflow
languages with a new parallel framework for ML (machine learning) which
exploits the sparse structure and common computational patterns of ML
algorithms. GraphLab enables ML experts to easily design and implement
efﬁcient scalable parallel algorithms by composing problem speciﬁc
computation, data-dependencies, and scheduling.  Our main contributions
include: A graph-based data model which simultaneously represents data and
computational dependencies. A set of concurrent access models which provide a
range of sequential-consistency guarantees. A sophisticated modular scheduling
mechanism. An aggregation framework to manage global state. From the

<p>Introduction: The paper MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O
(video,slides) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a
better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started
with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support
for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling
to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they
created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented
workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."The result:
MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29% (for long connections) and
582% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed
version of memcached between 15% and 320%. For a workload based on real-world
HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of nginx by 75%.What's this most

<p>Introduction: This is so funny I laughed until I cried! Definitely NSFW. OMG it's hilarious,
but it's also not a bad overview of the issues. Especially loved:You read the
latest post on HighScalability.com and think you are a f*cking Google and
architect and parrot slogans like Web Scale and Sharding but you have no idea
what the f*ck you are talking about. There are so many more gems like
that.Thanks to Alex Popescu for posting this on MongoDB is Web Scale. Whoever
made this deserves a Webby.</p><p>2 0.86339891 <a title="421-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-12-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Hilarious_Video%3A_Relational_Database_Vs_NoSQL_Fanbois.html">1357 high scalability-2012-11-12-Gone Fishin': Hilarious Video: Relational Database Vs NoSQL Fanbois</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Abstract--This paper presents the architecture andcharacteristics of a memory
database intended to be used as acache engine for web applications. Primary
goals of this databaseare speed and efficiency while running on SMP systems
withseveral CPU cores (four and more). A secondary goal is thesupport for
simple metadata structures associated with cacheddata that can aid in
efficient use of the cache. Due to these goals,some data structures and
algorithms normally associated withthis field of computing needed to be
adapted to the newenvironment.</p><p>4 0.66942245 <a title="421-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-What_I%27m_Thankful_For_on_Thanksgiving.html">747 high scalability-2009-11-26-What I'm Thankful For on Thanksgiving</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be
thankful for thesongof the tinniestsparrowatsunrise, I'll save you from all
that. It's hard to tie scalability and thegiving of thankstogether, especially
as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of
time. But I think I found a sentiment in A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and
MIRACLES byJames Bridlethat manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving
thanks meaningfully together:I distrust commercial definitions of innovation,
and particularly of awesomeness. It's an overused term. When I think of
awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.So I
started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for
me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.We're not actually very good
about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use
metaphors and examples. Douglas Adams writes somewhere about how big the
Hitchhiker's Guid</p><p>5 0.64794147 <a title="421-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-29-Presentations%3A_MySQL_Conference_%26_Expo_2009.html">586 high scalability-2009-04-29-Presentations: MySQL Conference & Expo 2009</a></p>

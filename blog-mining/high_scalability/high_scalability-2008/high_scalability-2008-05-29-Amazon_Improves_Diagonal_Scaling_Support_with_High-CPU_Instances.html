<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Dan Bartow, VP ofSOASTA, talking about how they pelted
MySpace with 1 million concurrent users using 800 EC2 instances. I thought
this was an interesting story because: that's a lot of users, it takes big
cajones to test your live site like that, and not everything worked out quite
as expected. I'd like to thank Dan for taking the time to write and share this
article.In December of 2009 MySpace launched a new wave of streaming music
video offerings in New Zealand, building on the previous success of MySpace
music.  These new features included the ability to watch music videos, search
for artist's videos, create lists of favorites, and more. The anticipated load
increase from a feature like this on a popular site like MySpace is huge, and
they wanted to test these features before making them live. If you manage the
infrastructure that sits behind a high traffic application you don't want any
surprises.  You want to understand your breaking points, define your cap</p><p>4 0.18719575 <a title="334-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-05-Product%3A_Amazon_Simple_Storage_Service.html">525 high scalability-2009-03-05-Product: Amazon Simple Storage Service</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:HostedFTP.com - Amazon S3 Performance Report. How fast is S3? Based on
their own study HostedFTP.com has found: 10 to 12 MB/second when storing and
receiving files and 140 ms per file stored as a fixed overhead
cost.breakUpdate:A Quantitative Comparison of Rackspace and Amazon Cloud
Storage Solutions. S3 isn't the only cloud storage service out there. Mosso is
saying they can save you so money while offering support. There are number of
scenarios in their paper, but For 5TB of cloud storage Mosso will save you 17%
over S3 without support and 42% with support. For their CDN on a Global test
Mosso says the average response time is 333ms for CloudFront vs. 107ms for
Cloud Files which means globally, Cloud Files is 3.1 times or 211% faster than
CloudFront.Amazon S3is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-
scale computing easier for developers.This service allows you to link directly
to files at a cost of 15 cents per GB of storage, and 20 cents per GB
transfer.</p><p>5 0.16074976 <a title="334-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-05-Strategy%3A__In_Cloud_Computing_Systematically_Drive_Load_to_the_CPU.html">526 high scalability-2009-03-05-Strategy:  In Cloud Computing Systematically Drive Load to the CPU</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:Linear Bloom Filtersby Edward Kmett. A Bloom filter is a novel data
structure for approximating membership in a set. A Bloom join conserves
network bandwith by exchanging cheaper, more plentiful local CPU utilization
and disk IO.Update:What are Amazon EC2 Compute Units?. Cloud providers charge
for CPU time in voodoo units like "compute units" and "core hours." Geva Perry
takes on the quest of figuring out what these mean in real life.breakI
attended Sebastian Stadil'sAWS Training CampSaturday and during the class
Sebastian brought up a wonderfully counter-intuitive idea:CPU (EC2) costs a
lot less than storage (S3, SDB) so you should systematically move as much work
as you can to the CPU. This is said to be theClient-Cloud Paradigm. It
leverages the well pummeled trend that CPU power follows Moore's Law while
storage followsThe Great Plains' Law(flat). And what sane computing
professional would do battle with Sir Moore and histrusty battle swordof a
law?Embedded systems often m</p><p>6 0.12662017 <a title="334-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud.html">40 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Why isn't Google's aggressive new database pricing strategy getting more pub?
That's whatBill Katz, instigator of theGAE Meetupand prize winningscience
fiction authoris wondering:It's surprising that the blogosphere hasn't picked
up the biggest difference in pricing:Google's datastore is less than a tenth
of the price of Amazon's SimpleDB while offering a better API.If money matters
to you then the burn rate under GAE could be convincingly lower. Let's compare
the numbers:breakGAE pricing:* $0.10 - $0.12 per CPU core-hour* $0.15 - $0.18
per GB-month of storage* $0.11 - $0.13 per GB outgoing bandwidth* $0.09 -

<p>Introduction: People sometimes wonder why Oracle isn't mentioned on this site more. Maybe it
will now asMichael Nygard reportsOracle 11g now does read/write splitting with
theirActive Data Guardproduct. Average replication latency was 1 second and
it's accomplished with standard Oracle JDBC drivers. They see a 250% increase
in transactions per service for read-write service. And a 110% improvement in
tps for read-only service was found. You see a change in hardware architecture
with the new setup. They now recommend using a primary and multiple standby
servers, a single controller per server, and a single set of disks in RAID1.
Previously the recommendation was to have a primary and secondary server with
two controllers per server and a set of mirrored disks per controller. The
changes increase performance, availability, and hardware utilization. They
also have a useful looking best practices document for High Availability
calledMaximum Availability Architecture (MAA).</p><p>2 0.94642788 <a title="334-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Book%3A_High_Performance_MySQL.html">16 high scalability-2007-07-16-Book: High Performance MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues
of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well
documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an
insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has
managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!,
maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at
conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing
major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of
their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High
Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in
depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn
practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information
that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life
environments.

<p>Introduction: Now you can buy more cores on EC2 without adding more machines:The High-CPU
Medium Instance is billed at $0.20 (20 cents) per hour. It features 1.7 GB of
memory, 5 EC2 Compute Units (2 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units Each),
and 350 GB of instance storage, all on a 32-bit platform.The High-CPU Extra
Large Instance is billed at $0.80 (80 cents) per hour. It features 7 GB of
memory, 20 EC2 Compute Units (8 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units

<p>Introduction: I've been trying to find a high availability file storage solution without
success. I tried GlusterFS which looks very promising but experienced problems
with stability and don't want something I can't easily control and rely on.
Other solutions are too complicated or have a SPOF.So I'm thinking of the
following setup:Two NFS servers, a primary and a warm backup. The primary
server will be rsynced with the warm backup every minute or two. I can do it
so frequently as a PHP script will know which directories have changed
recently from a database and only rsync those. Both servers will be NFS
mounted on a cluster of web servers as /mnt/nfs-primary (sym linked as
/home/websites) and /mnt/nfs-backup.I'll then use Ucarp
(http://www.ucarp.org/project/ucarp) to monitor both NFS servers availability
every couple of seconds and when one goes down, the Ucarp up script will be
set to change the symbolic link on all web servers for the /home/websites dir
from /mnt/nfs-primary to /mnt/nfs-backupThe</p><p>6 0.92133474 <a title="334-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling_Social_Ecommerce_Architecture_Case_study.html">1016 high scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling Social Ecommerce Architecture Case study</a></p>

<p>Introduction: All,     I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers. I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.     Could anyone share their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube etc..?     Thank you,   Regards,   Janakan Rajendran.</p><p>3 0.19300659 <a title="204-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-04-IPS-IDS_for_heavy_content_site.html">238 high scalability-2008-02-04-IPS-IDS for heavy content site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All,     My site would have heavy content (video/pictures). I'm looking for an efficient IPS/IDS solution which would not introduce much of latency. I'm more familiar with Cisco ASA and also familiar with Juniper, Foundry and others. I also came across snort but haven't used it before. I'm more of looking for an appliance (for the ease of configuration,support etc...)   Could any one share their thoughts on performane of IPS/IDS from this vendors?   Thanks!

<p>Introduction: Hi all,     Has anyone got any experience with using Amazon S3 as an uploaded photo store?      I'm writing a website that I need to keep as low budget as possible, and I'm investigating solutions for storing uploaded photos from users - not too many, probably in the low thousands. The site is commercial so I'm straying away from the Flickrs of the world. S3 seems to offer a solution but I'd like to hear from those who have used it before.     Thanks     Andy</p><p>5 0.14176612 <a title="204-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Flickr.html">41 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Flickr</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Flickr  offers a free basic account with limited upload bandwidth and limited storage. Download bandwidth is unlimited. Upgrading to a paid Pro account for $25/year removes all upload and storage restrictions.

<p>Introduction: All,     I'm just new to this and have a basic understanding how CDN works? My questions are:     1. How does CDN sync data with web servers for video/images? If I have a user to upload a video to my site, will it get stored directly in CDN or it comes to my webserver first and then sync-ed with cache server?     2. How to have only the dynamic video/image delivered through CDN while the rest is served by a webserver?   3. How sync happens and who pays for the bandwidth for sync?       I'd appreciate if someone could explain this.

<p>Introduction: Akamai  transparently mirrors content (usually media objects such as audio, graphics, animation, video) stored on customer servers. Though the domain name is the same, the IP address points to an Akamai server rather than the customer's server.  In addition to image caching, Akamai provides services which accelerate dynamic and personalized content, J2EE-compliant applications, and streaming media.</p><p>5 0.64563084 <a title="204-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-12-Creating_Scalable_Digital_Libraries.html">856 high scalability-2010-07-12-Creating Scalable Digital Libraries</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Like many other media content providers, libraries and museums are increasingly moving their content onto the Web.Â  While the move itself is no easy process (with digitization, web development, and training costs), being able to successfully deliver content to a wide audience is an ongoing concern, particularly for large libraries.
 
Much of the concern is financial, as most libraries do not have the internal budget or outside investors that for-profit businesses enjoy.Â  Even large university libraries will face serious budget constraints that even other university departments, such as science and technology would not face.
 
Creating a scalable infrastructure and also distributing a large digital collection that can handle multiple requests, requires planning that many librarians have not even imagined.Â  They must stop thinking in terms of "one-item-per-customer" and start thinking in terms of numerous users accessing the same information simultaneously.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Jake in  Does Django really scale better than Rails?  thinks apps like FFS shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.  In a short three months Friends for Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300 million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails,  two part time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?Â

<p>Introduction: Kent Langley   was kind enough to create a   profile template   for   Joyent  , Kent's new employer.   Joyent is an infrastructure and development company that has put together a multi-site, multi-million dollar hosting setup for their own applications and for the use of others  . Joyent competes with the likes of Amazon and GoGrid in the multi-player cloud computing game and hosts   Bumper Sticker: A 1 Billion Page Per Month Facebook RoR App  .     The template was originally created with web services in mind, not cloud providers, but I think it still works in an odd sort of way. Remember, anyone can fill out a   profile template   for their system and share their wonderfulness with the world.      Getting to Know You        What is the name of your system and where can we find out more about it?  Joyent Accelerator Cloud Computing IaaS  My name is Kent Langley, Sr. Director, Joyent, Inc.

<p>Introduction: With Lavabit  shutting down Â under  murky circumstances , it seems fitting to  repost an old  (2009), yet still very good post by  Ladar Levison  on Lavabit's architecture. I don't know how much of this information is still current, but it should give you a general idea what Lavabit was all about.

 What is your system for? 

Lavabit is a mid-sized email service provider. We currently have about 140,000 registered users with more than 260,000 email addresses. While most of our accounts belong to individual users, we also provide corporate email services to approximately 70 companies.

 Why did you decide to build this system?

<p>Introduction: Kent Langley   was kind enough to create a   profile template   for   Joyent  , Kent's new employer.   Joyent is an infrastructure and development company that has put together a multi-site, multi-million dollar hosting setup for their own applications and for the use of others  . Joyent competes with the likes of Amazon and GoGrid in the multi-player cloud computing game and hosts   Bumper Sticker: A 1 Billion Page Per Month Facebook RoR App  .     The template was originally created with web services in mind, not cloud providers, but I think it still works in an odd sort of way. Remember, anyone can fill out a   profile template   for their system and share their wonderfulness with the world.      Getting to Know You        What is the name of your system and where can we find out more about it?  Joyent Accelerator Cloud Computing IaaS  My name is Kent Langley, Sr. Director, Joyent, Inc.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Jake in  Does Django really scale better than Rails?  thinks apps like FFS shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.  In a short three months Friends for Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300 million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails,  two part time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?Â

<p>Introduction: Ever feel like the blogosphere is 500 million channels with nothing on?  Tailrank finds the internet's hottest channels by indexing over 24M weblogs and feeds per hour. That's 52TB of raw blog content (no, not sewage) a month and requires continuously processing 160Mbits of IO. How do they do that?
 
This is an email interview with Kevin Burton,  founder and CEO of Tailrank.com. Kevin was kind enough to take the time to explain how they scale to index the entire blogosphere.

<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is  indeed the case:
 
 Research  conducted by HP   found that the majority of businesses in the EMEA region  are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the cloud. Of the 940  respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-critical apps at some  point over the next two to five years.
 
A more recent  survey, by research firm  MeriTalk   and sponsored by VMware and EMC (NYSE: EMC  ), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to  move some mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within  two years, the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their  mission-critical apps to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of  their mission-critical apps to run in the cloud.

<p>Introduction: How do you layer a programmable Internet of smart things on top of the web? That's the question addressed byÃÂ  Dominique Guinard ÃÂ in his ambitious dissertation:ÃÂ  A Web of Things Application Architecture - Integrating the Real-World ÃÂ ( slides ). With the continuedÃÂ siloing of content, perhaps we can keep our things open and talking to each other?
 
In the architecture things are modeled using REST, they will be findable via search, they will be social via a social access controller, and they will be mashupable. Here's great graphical overview of the entire system:

  Abstract:   

A central concern in the area of pervasive computing has been the integration of digital artifactsts with the physical world and vice-versa. Recent developments in the field of embedded devices have led to smart things increasingly populating our daily life. We define smart things as digitally enhanced physical objectsts and devices that have communication capabilities.

Tailrank finds the internet's hottest channels by indexing over 24M weblogs

and requires continuously processing 160Mbits of IO. How do they do that?This
is an email interview with Kevin Burton, founder and CEO of Tailrank.com.

entire blogosphere.SitesTailrank- We track the hottest news in the

<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is
indeed the case:Research conducted by HPfound that the majority of businesses
in the EMEA region are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the
cloud. Of the 940 respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-
critical apps at some point over the next two to five years.A more
recentsurvey, by research firm MeriTalkand sponsored by VMware and EMC
(NYSE:EMC), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to move some
mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within two years,
the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their mission-critical apps
to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of their mission-
critical apps to run in the cloud.The Challenge - How to Bring Hundreds of
Enterprise Apps to the CloudThe reality is that cloud economics only start
making sense when there are true workloads that utilize the cloud
infrastructure.If the large majority of</p><p>2 0.96193266 <a title="259-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-25-Architecture_Template_Advice_Needed.html">260 high scalability-2008-02-25-Architecture Template Advice Needed</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you layer a programmable Internet of smart things on top of the web?
That's the question addressed by Dominique Guinard in his ambitious
dissertation: A Web of Things Application Architecture - Integrating the Real-
World (slides). With the continued siloing of content, perhaps we can keep our
things open and talking to each other?In the architecture things are modeled
using REST, they will be findable via search, they will be social via a social
access controller, and they will be mashupable. Here's great graphical
overview of the entire system: Abstract:A central concern in the area of
pervasive computing has been the integration of digital artifactsts with the
physical world and vice-versa. Recent developments in the fi eld of embedded
devices have led to smart things increasingly populating our daily life. We de

have communication capabilities. Application domains are for instance wireless

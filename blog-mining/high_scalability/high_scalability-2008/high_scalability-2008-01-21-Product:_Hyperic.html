hosts and services that you specify, alerting you when things go bad and again
when they get better. It also provides historical charting and event
correlation for faster problem identification.The Hyperic HQ server is a

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things we are seeing is more tools and tool chains for
performing very high level operations quite simply.Vagrantis such a tool
forbuilding and distributing virtualized development environments.Web
developers use virtual environments every day with their web applications.
From EC2 and Rackspace Cloud to specialized solutions such as EngineYard and
Heroku, virtualization is the tool of choice for easy deployment and
infrastructure management. Vagrant aims to take those very same principles and
put them to work in the heart of the application lifecycle. By providing easy
to configure, lightweight, reproducible, and portable virtual machines
targeted at development environments, Vagrant helps maximize your productivity
and flexibility.If you've created a build and deployment system before Vagrant

<p>Introduction: This is guest post byMichael DeHaan(@laserllama), a software developer and
architect, on Ansible, a simple deployment, model-driven configuration
management, and command execution framework.I owe High Scalability a great
deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>4 0.75048453 <a title="219-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-16-Product%3A_Func_-_Fedora_Unified_Network_Controller.html">385 high scalability-2008-09-16-Product: Func - Fedora Unified Network Controller</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>5 0.74938124 <a title="219-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-21-Product%3A_Capistrano_-_Automate_Remote_Tasks_Via_SSH.html">255 high scalability-2008-02-21-Product: Capistrano - Automate Remote Tasks Via SSH</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Deployment with Capistrano  by Charles Max Wood.  Nice simple step-by-
step for using Capistrano for deployment.From their website:Simply
put,Capistranois a tool for automating tasks on one or more remote servers. It
executes commands in parallel on all targeted machines, and provides a
mechanism for rolling back changes across multiple machines. It is ideal for
anyone doing any kind of system administration, either professionally or
incidentally.* Great for automating tasks via SSH on remote servers, like
software installation, application deployment, configuration management, ad
hoc server monitoring, and more.* Ideal for system administrators, whether
professional or incidental.* Easy to customize. Its configuration files use
the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know Ruby to do
most things with Capistrano.* Easy to extend. Capistrano is written in the
Ruby programming language, and may be extended easily by writing additional
Ruby modules.breakOne of t</p><p>6 0.73506707 <a title="219-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-25-Product%3A_Puppet_the_Automated_Administration_System.html">429 high scalability-2008-10-25-Product: Puppet the Automated Administration System</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Garry Tan, cofounder of Posterous, lists 12 lessons for scaling that apply to
more than just Rails.Use cloud storage for static files.Use HTTP Cache Control
to tell the browser what it can cache.Use Sphinx for text search.Use InnoDB
for more crash resistant and faster writes.Don't use textbook Rails
ActiveRecord objects. Use New Relic to find exactly what is slow in your
system.Use memcache later so you find your database bottlenecks now.Use
mongrel proctitle to find your slow queries. You are only as fast as your
slowest queries.Use asynchronous job queuing to do work in parallel.Use
monitoring so you'll know when your site went down and why.Learn by reading
the source code, fixing problems, and submitting them back to the
community.Use new plugins. Old plugins can't be trusted.Use new information.
Old information can't be trusted.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90764326 <a title="219-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-21-Product%3A_Hyperic.html">219 high scalability-2008-01-21-Product: Hyperic</a></p>
<p>Introduction: FromWikipedia:HypericHQ is a popular open source IT Operations computer system
and network monitoring application software. It auto-discovers all system
resources and their metrics, including hardware, operating systems,
virtualization, databases, middleware, applications, and services. It watches
hosts and services that you specify, alerting you when things go bad and again
when they get better. It also provides historical charting and event
correlation for faster problem identification.The Hyperic HQ server is a
distributed J2EE application that runs on top of the open source JBoss
Application Server. It is written in Java and portable C code and runs on
Linux, Windows, Solaris, HP-UX and Mac OS X. Hyperic HQ Portal is a Java and

Peter Laird inUnderstanding the Cloud Computing/SaaS/PaaS markets: a Map of
the Players in the Industrypaints a very cool visual map of all the cloud
service players. It's a larger industry than you might think.Once upon a time
I worked at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch startup. Over a
delicious Christmas punch my grandma asked me what I did for a living that I
could afford such extravagantly inexpensive gifts. Always so subtle. I
explained I worked on an ATM switch. Mistake. She sniffed, said that's nice,
and asked me why the Automated Teller Machine ate her bank card that morning.
No matter how hard I tried I couldn't convince her I didn't work on bank ATMs.

<p>Introduction: Release early and often. A/B testing. Creating a landing page and buying ads
on AdSense. All are ways of providing quick feedback in order to validate an
idea. If you are like Zynga, with 250 million active users a month, how do you
cost effectively prove out a game that could flop or get 90 million users
(like CityVille) in an instant?Zynga handles this problem inlle an innovative
way, by inverting the typical cloud burst scenario that has excess traffic
flowing from a datacenter to a cloud, to having a game start in the cloud and
then moving to the datacenter once the game has proved popular enough to
keep.This process is nicely described by Charles Babcock in Lessons From
FarmVille: How Zynga Uses The Cloud, in an interview with Allan Leinwand, CTO
of infrastructure engineering at Zynga.When paired down to its essence,
Zynga's strategy goes something like this:Games are risky.  Even with all
their experience, Zynga can't know how many people will play a game or how
fast the adoption</p><p>6 0.85495341 <a title="219-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Paper%3A_Lightweight_Web_servers.html">26 high scalability-2007-07-25-Paper: Lightweight Web servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>4 0.19304737 <a title="292-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-05-Paper%3A_Scalability_Design_Patterns.html">402 high scalability-2008-10-05-Paper: Scalability Design Patterns</a></p>

<p>Introduction: SummaryIn this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing
stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services
application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out
model.BioNati Shalom is the CTO and Founder ofGigaSpacesand responsible for
the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed
technology and architecture namely CORBA, Jini, J2EE, Grid and SOA. Nati is

<p>Introduction: Space-based architectures are an alternative to the traditional n-tier model
for enterprise applications. Instead of a vertical tier partitioning, space
based applications are partitioned horizontally into self-sufficient units.
This leads to almost linear scalability of stateful, high-performance
applications.This is arecording of a talk I did last monthwhere I introduce
space based programming and demonstrate how that works in practice on the .NET
platform using Oracle Coherence and GigaSpaces.</p><p>4 0.63209045 <a title="292-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-25-Is_your_cloud_as_scalable_as_you_think_it_is%3F.html">395 high scalability-2008-09-25-Is your cloud as scalable as you think it is?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An unstated assumption is that clouds are scalable. But are they? Stick
thousands upon thousands of machines together and there are a lot of potential
bottlenecks just waiting to choke off your scalability supply. And if the
cloud is scalable what are the chances that your application is really
linearly scalable? At 10 machines all may be well. Even at 50 machines the
seas look calm. But at 100, 200, or 500 machines all hell might break loose.
How do you know?You know through real life testing. These kinds of tests are
brutally hard and complicated. who wants to do all the incredibly precise and
difficult work of producing cloud scalability tests?GridDynamicshas stepped up
to the challenge and has just released theirCloud Performance Reports.The
report is quite detailed so I'll just cover what I found most interesting.

<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the
DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that
will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains
mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web
server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server,
e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use
reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to
get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been
reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on
how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but
I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.The problem is that I'm
still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some
company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my questio</p><p>3 0.93089867 <a title="292-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-08-Art_of_Parallelism_presentation.html">652 high scalability-2009-07-08-Art of Parallelism presentation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My Table has 2 columsn .Column1 is id,Column2 contains information given by
user about item in Column1 .User can give 3 types of information about item.I
separate the opinion of single user by comma,and opinion of another user by
;.Example-23-34,us,56;78,in,78I need to calculate opinions of all users very
fast.My idea is to have index on key so the searching would be very
fast.Currently i m using mysql .My problem is that maximum column size is
below my requirement .If any overflow occurs i make new row with same id and
insert data into new row.Practically I would have around maximum 5-10 for each
row.I think if there is any database which removes this application code.I
just learn about key value pair database which is exactly i needed .But which
doesn't put constraint(i mean much better than RDMS on column size.This
application is not in production.</p><p>5 0.92743158 <a title="292-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-What_is_Network-based_Application_Virtualization_and_Why_Do_You_Need_It%3F.html">924 high scalability-2010-10-21-What is Network-based Application Virtualization and Why Do You Need It?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>6 0.92469925 <a title="292-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-21-Processing_100_Million_Pixels_a_Day_-_Small_Amounts_of_Contention_Cause_Big_Problems_at_Scale.html">1390 high scalability-2013-01-21-Processing 100 Million Pixels a Day - Small Amounts of Contention Cause Big Problems at Scale</a></p>

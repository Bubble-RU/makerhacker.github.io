<p>Introduction: From their website:    FAI  is an automated installation tool to install or deploy Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat, autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used for configuration management of a running system.  You can take one or more virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed, configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized management system for your Linux deployment.  
   
  FAI's target group are system administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a rendering farm,</p><p>3 0.14298955 <a title="263-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-09-High_Load_on_production_Webservers_after_Sourcecode_sync.html">118 high scalability-2007-10-09-High Load on production Webservers after Sourcecode sync</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi everybody :)     We have a bunch of webservers (about 14 at th  i  s time) running Apache. As app  l  ication framework we're using PHP with the APC Cache insta  l  led to improve performance. For load ba  l  ancing we're using a Big F5 system with dynamic ratio (SNMP driven)     To sync new/updated sourcecode we're using subversion to "automaticly" update these servers w  i  th our latest software relases. After updating the new source to these production servers the load of the mashines is ra  i  sing to hell.     While updating the servers, they are sti  l  l in "production", serving webpages to the users. Otherwise the process of updating wou  l  d take ages. Most of the time we're only updating in the morning hours while less users are online, because of the above issue.     My guess is, that the load is raising that h  i  gh, because APC needs to recompile a bunch of new f  i  les each time. Before and while compi  l  ing the performance simply is "bad".     My goal would be t</p><p>4 0.11253078 <a title="263-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-11-ATMCash_Exploits_Virtualization_for_Security_-_Immutability_and_Reversion.html">1077 high scalability-2011-07-11-ATMCash Exploits Virtualization for Security - Immutability and Reversion</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ran Grushkowsky , Head of Technology at ATMCash. 
 
Virtualization and cloud-based systems are very hype in the industry; however, most financial companies stray from those solutions. At ATMCash, we’ve approached virtualization not for the usual reason of scalability, but for the usually missed value of security.
 
In this article, I will introduce the concept of security added value in the utilization of virtualization and why people should consider deploying mini-clouds for those use-cases. 
  How do virtual machines help mitigate risk?  
I am sure most of you have heard of the recent  hacking in the financial sector . Financial companies are under constant hacking attempts and security is of the utmost importance. One of the bigger risks in system deployment is a breach in one of the stack components. Regular system patches and maintenance fix known exploits and issues, however, sometimes it may be too late and the component has already been breached.

<p>Introduction: From  FRESH Ports  and their website:    ISPman  is an ISP management software written in perl, using an LDAP backend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP.  It can be used to manage, DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration, cyrus mail boxes, proftpd etc.    
 
 ISPMan was written as a management tool for the network at 4unet where between 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is crazily growing. Managing these domains and their users was a little time consuming, and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these daemons fluently.  Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and users.  LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server can be scaled from 1 to n as required.  An LDAP entry called maildrop tells the SMTP server (postfix) where to deliver the mail.  The SMTP servers can be loadbalanced with one of many load balancing techniques.  The program is written with scalability and High availability in mind.

<p>Introduction: Lustre速  is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system. It is designed, developed and maintained by Cluster File Systems, Inc.  The central goal is the development of a next-generation cluster file system which can serve clusters with 10,000's of nodes, provide petabytes of storage, and move 100's of GB/sec with state-of-the-art security and management infrastructure.  Lustre runs on many of the largest Linux clusters in the world, and is included by CFS's partners as a core component of their cluster offering (examples include HP StorageWorks SFS, and the Cray XT3 and XD1 supercomputers). Today's users have also demonstrated that Lustre scales down as well as it scales up, and runs in production on clusters as small as 4 and as large as 25,000 nodes.  The latest version of Lustre is always available from Cluster File Systems, Inc. Public Open Source releases of Lustre are available under the GNU General Public License. These releases are found here, and are used</p><p>5 0.73840803 <a title="263-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible_-__A_Simple_Model-Driven_Configuration_Management_and_Command_Execution_Framework.html">1230 high scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible -  A Simple Model-Driven Configuration Management and Command Execution Framework</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is guest post by  Michael DeHaan  (@laserllama), a software developer and architect, on  Ansible , a simple deployment, model-driven configuration management, and command execution framework. 
 
I owe High Scalability a great deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used at  Tumblr , and it kicked some ideas into gear.  This article is about what happened from that idea.
 
My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't been good at all three jobs.
 
My other observation (not from the article) was that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of</p><p>6 0.70790303 <a title="263-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle_-_Provisioning_Tool_to_Build_Remote_Servers.html">461 high scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle - Provisioning Tool to Build Remote Servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent applications. Furthermore,  over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are more likely to make a purchase after “liking” a brand they find online. ( source  ) 
 
Sears Architect Tomer Gabel provides an insightful overview on how they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:
  
 the architectural considerations behind their solution 
 why they chose memory over disk 
 how they partitioned the data to gain scalability 
 why they chose to execute code with the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution framework 
 how they integrated with Facebook 
 why they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-memory caching and scale

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL architecture."
 
 Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores Â overview:
  

Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture, transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or clock synchronization for this coordination.


This paper presents a novel protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could potentially yield a vio</p><p>4 0.92854327 <a title="263-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Book%3A_High_Performance_MySQL.html">16 high scalability-2007-07-16-Book: High Performance MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!, maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life environments. And you</p><p>5 0.92175037 <a title="263-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-25-Make_Your_Site_Run_10_Times_Faster.html">261 high scalability-2008-02-25-Make Your Site Run 10 Times Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is what  Mike Peters says he can do : make your site run 10 times faster. His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40 IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50 concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively handling 500 concurrent connections per second with CPU at 8% and no degradation in performance."  Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:
   Database write access (read is cheaper)    Database read access    PHP, ASP, JSP and any other server side scripting    Client side JavaScript    Multiple/Fat Images, scripts or css files from different domains on your page    Slow keep-alive client connections, clogging your available sockets   Mike's solutions:      Switch all database writes to offline processing    Minimize number of database read access to the bare minimum. No more than two queries per page.

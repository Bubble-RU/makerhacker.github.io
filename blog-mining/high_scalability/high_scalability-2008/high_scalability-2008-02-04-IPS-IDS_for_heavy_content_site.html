<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers Show 41 episode was to reveal and
ruminate over the horrors of a successfulattack on RSA, which puts the whole
world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there
was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost
datacenter.Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile
back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by
summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal: Look at
Arista and Juniper. JuniperHas a range of stackable switches, which includes
some 10 gig.If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on
their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric
solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric.
Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.
Thinks Juniper would make a good deal in order to get a few reference sites
for QFX.Arista Networks</p><p>5 0.10468958 <a title="238-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-12-Product%3A_rPath_-_Creating_and_Managing_Virtual_Appliances.html">245 high scalability-2008-02-12-Product: rPath - Creating and Managing Virtual Appliances</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:GIGAOM onrPath Burns EC2 Appliances in a Web Portal. rBuilder adds a
portal that lets users turn software into virtual appliances.rPathdemoed their
virtual appliance management system at Monday'sAWS Meetup. What they do is
help you build a generic virtual machine image deployable on Amazon, VMWare,
Xen and other targets. The idea is to build your software application
independent of the underlying operating system and deploy it in your own or
someone else's datacenter without worrying about all the details.To put their
service in context think of rPath as how you build, deploy, and upgrade images
and someone likeRight Scalehas how you can run and managed a cluster of
deployed images.breakTo build a Virtual Appliance you pull together all your
packages through their web interface or through a Python based "recipe"
system, select a VM target, and "cook" it all into a VM image you can
immediately deploy and run.To make this magic happen they use theConary

start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their
application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I
am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I
plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need
to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure
and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the
application that will become critical over time.</p><p>4 0.66497338 <a title="238-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.  Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if

<p>Introduction: Update: Deployment with Capistrano  by Charles Max Wood.  Nice simple step-by-
step for using Capistrano for deployment.From their website:Simply
put,Capistranois a tool for automating tasks on one or more remote servers. It
executes commands in parallel on all targeted machines, and provides a
mechanism for rolling back changes across multiple machines. It is ideal for
anyone doing any kind of system administration, either professionally or
incidentally.* Great for automating tasks via SSH on remote servers, like
software installation, application deployment, configuration management, ad
hoc server monitoring, and more.* Ideal for system administrators, whether
professional or incidental.* Easy to customize. Its configuration files use
the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know Ruby to do
most things with Capistrano.* Easy to extend. Capistrano is written in the
Ruby programming language, and may be extended easily by writing additional
Ruby modules.breakOne of t</p><p>3 0.1035277 <a title="369-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-15-Outside.in_Scales_Up_with_Engine_Yard_and_moving_from_PHP_to_Ruby_on_Rails.html">417 high scalability-2008-10-15-Outside.in Scales Up with Engine Yard and moving from PHP to Ruby on Rails</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At37 SignalsJoshua Sierles describes how 37 Signals usesSprinkleto configure
their servers within EC2. Sprinkledefines a domain specific meta-language for
describing and processing the installation of software. You can find an
interesting discussion of Sprinkle's creation story by the creator himself,
Marcus Crafter, inSprinkle Some Powder!.Marcus divides provisioning tools into
two categories:Task Based- the tool issues a list of commands to run on the
remote system, either remotely via a network connection or smart
client.Policy/state Based- the tool determines what needs to be run on the
remote system by examining its current and final state.Sprinkle combines both
models together in a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter approach using normal Ruby
code as the DSL (domain specific language) to declaratively describe remote
system configurations. 37 Signals likes the use of Ruby as the DSL because it
makes learning a separate syntax unnecessary. I've successfully done similar
things in Perl.</p><p>5 0.092558578 <a title="369-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-25-Make_Your_Site_Run_10_Times_Faster.html">261 high scalability-2008-02-25-Make Your Site Run 10 Times Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is whatMike Peters says he can do: make your site run 10 times faster.
His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40
IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50
concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively
handling 500 concurrent connections per second with CPU at 8% and no
degradation in performance."Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:Database
write access (read is cheaper)Database read accessPHP, ASP, JSP and any other
server side scriptingClient side JavaScriptMultiple/Fat Images, scripts or css
files from different domains on your pageSlow keep-alive client connections,
clogging your available socketsMike's solutions:breakSwitch all database
writes to offline processingMinimize number of database read access to the
bare minimum. No more than two queries per page.Denormalize your database and

<p>Introduction: Recently I had to help users on one of my opensource project ISPMan.
http://ispman.netThis project started in 2001 as I was too unwilling to take
care of the DNS and VitualHosting stuff as it was a side-thing to the company
I worked for (so i wrote a software that took care of all these little
details)Summary: A large project that needs a rewrite can be done in a matter
of day.I will not give you a full case study about a project that went through
a re-write but a case study about how easy it is to re-write
something.breakDetails:My boss was cool enough to let me open-source the
project and obviously, I got a lot of cool-cred out of it.Later on I also did
some support and implementation and earned quiet some money with it.Eventually
I had to let the project go out of my hand to the community as I only did it
to facilitate a job that wasnt williing to do. (Setup DNS zones of multiple
servers, find out which host should host the website and put VirtualHost
section there, find out which m</p><p>4 0.72528005 <a title="369-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible_-__A_Simple_Model-Driven_Configuration_Management_and_Command_Execution_Framework.html">1230 high scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible -  A Simple Model-Driven Configuration Management and Command Execution Framework</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is guest post byMichael DeHaan(@laserllama), a software developer and
architect, on Ansible, a simple deployment, model-driven configuration
management, and command execution framework.I owe High Scalability a great
deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>5 0.70515233 <a title="369-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-11-FTP_Sanity%3A_Redundancy%2C_archiving%2C_consolidation..html">208 high scalability-2008-01-11-FTP Sanity: Redundancy, archiving, consolidation.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: G'day,I'm building an application to manage WordPress PHP code on many
servers. Our application will push down code updates to each server, as well
as performing backups and testing.I'm considering different methods of pushing
updated code onto the individual servers. I'm considering something like
Capistrano (I've no experience in Ruby though). I've also considered using
subversion and then remotely calling svn commands via SSH.Are there any other
tools specifically for this purpose? The servers will have persistent data
(the WordPress databases) so I don't want to re-image them every update. Plus,
they will each have a different set of plugins / themes, so building many
images would be too complex.If there are any papers on code deployment, or
other recommended reading, please point the links my way.Likewise, if anyone
has any suggestions, or would like more details, just let me know.Cheers
-Callum.</p><p>2 0.91188264 <a title="369-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-07-RAFT_-_In_Search_of_an_Understandable_Consensus_Algorithm.html">1498 high scalability-2013-08-07-RAFT - In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If like many humans you've found evenPaxos Made Simplea bit difficult to
understand, you might enjoy RAFT as described inIn Search of an Understandable
Consensus Algorithm by Stanford'sDiego Ongaroand John Ousterhout. The video
presentation of the paper is given byJohn Ousterhout. Both the paper and the
video are delightfully accessible.mcherm has a good summary of the paper:A
consensus algorithm is: a cluster of servers should record a series of records
("log entries") in response to requests from clients of the cluster. (It may
also take action based on those entries.) It does so in a way that guarantees
that the responses seen by clients of the cluster will be consistent EVEN in
the face of servers crashing in unpredictable ways (but not loosing data that
was synched to disk), and networks introducing unpredictable delays or
communication blockages.Here's what Raft does. First, it elects a leader, then
the leader records the master version of the log, telling other cluster
servers w</p><p>3 0.89333695 <a title="369-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-15-Using_HTTP_cache_headers_effectively.html">571 high scalability-2009-04-15-Using HTTP cache headers effectively</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,Some time ago , martin fowler bloged about how HTTP cache headers can be
very effectively used in web site
design.http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/SegmentationByFreshness.htmlHow
actively HTTP cache headers are considered in web site design? I think it is a
great tool to reduce lot of load on server and should be considered before
designing any complex caching strategy.

<p>Introduction: Why is there something rather than nothing? That's the kind of question
theLarge Hadron Colliderin CERN is hopefully poised to answer. And what is the
output of this beautiful 17-mile long,6 billion dollar wabi-sabishproton
smashing machine? Data. Great heaping torrents of Grand Canyon sized data. 15
million gigabytes every year. That's 1000 times the information printed in
books every year. It's so much data 10,000 scientists will use agridof80,000+
computers, in 300 computer centers , in 50 different countries just to help
make sense of it all.How will all this data be collected, transported, stored,
and analyzed? It turns out, using what amounts to sort of Internet of
Particles instead of an Internet of Things.Two good articles have recently
shed some electro-magnetic energy in the human visible spectrum on the IT
aspects of the collider:LHC computing grid pushes petabytes of data, beats

<p>Introduction: It's a little known fact that Santa Clause was an early queue innovator. Faced
with the problem of delivering a planet full of presents in one night, Santa,
in his hacker's workshop, created a Present Distribution System using
thousands of region based priority present queues for continuous delivery by
the Rudolphs. Rudolphs? You didn't think there was only one Rudolph did you?
Presents are delivered in parallel by a cluster of sleighs, each with
redundant reindeer in a master-master configuration. Each Rudolph is a cluster
leader and they coordinate work using an early and more magical version of the
ZooKeeper protocol.Programmers have followed Santa's lead and you can find
amessage queue in nearly every major architecture profile onHighScalability.
Historically they may have been introduced after a first generation
architecture needed to scale up from their two tier system into something a
little more capable (asynchronicity, work dispatch, load buffering, database
offloading, etc).</p><p>6 0.87445509 <a title="369-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_18%2C_2011.html">1145 high scalability-2011-11-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 18, 2011</a></p>

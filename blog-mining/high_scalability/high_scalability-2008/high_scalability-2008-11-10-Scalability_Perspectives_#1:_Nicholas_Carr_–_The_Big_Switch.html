<p>Introduction: Update 2:   Overcast: Conversations on Cloud Computing . Listened to the first two podcasts and they're doing a great job.  Worth a look. The singing and dance routines are way over the top however :-)  Update:   9 Sources of Cloud Computing News You May Not Know About  by James Urquhart. I folded in these recommendations.  Can't get enough cloud computing? Then you must really be a glutton for punishment! But just in case, here are some cloud computing resources, collected from various sources, that will help you transform into a Tesla silently flying solo down the diamond lane.

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Nice introductory New York Time's article  Cloud Computing: So You Don’t Have to Stand Still . Good example of how Animoto used RightScale and Amazon to meet a Facebook driven demand of 25,000 test drives an hour.     Update: Peter Laird in  Understanding the Cloud Computing/SaaS/PaaS markets: a Map of the Players in the Industry  paints a very cool visual map of all the cloud service players. It's a larger industry than you might think.      Once upon a time I worked at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch startup. Over a delicious Christmas punch my grandma asked me what I did for a living that I could afford such extravagantly inexpensive gifts. Always so subtle. I explained I worked on an ATM switch. Mistake. She sniffed, said that's nice, and asked me why the Automated Teller Machine ate her bank card that morning. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't convince her I didn't work on bank ATMs. To all future job interrogations I waxed off, protesting I do boring soft</p><p>5 0.12957878 <a title="439-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  A Brief History of the Internet  it was revealed that the Internet was  based on the idea that there would be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary design. The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying  technical idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In this  approach, the choice of any individual network technology was not  dictated  by a particular network architecture but rather could be selected freely   by a provider and made to interwork with the other networks through  a meta-level "Internetworking Architecture".   
 
With the cloud we are in the same situation today, just a layer or two higher up the stack. We have independent clouds that we would like to connect and work seamlessly together, preferably with the ease at which we currently connect nodes to a network and networks to the Internet. This technology seems to be called the  Intercloud : an interconnected global "cloud of  clouds " as apposed to the  Internet  which is a "network</p><p>3 0.76265669 <a title="439-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-19-RAD_Lab_is_Creating_a_Datacenter_Operating_System.html">284 high scalability-2008-03-19-RAD Lab is Creating a Datacenter Operating System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The RAD Lab (Reliable Adaptive Distributed Systems Laboratory) wants to leapfrog the Big Switch and create The Next Big Switch, skipping the cloud/utility evolutionary stage altogether. This hyper-evolutionary niche buster develops technology so advanced the cloud disperses and you can go back to building your own personal datacenters again. Where Google took years to create their datacenters, using a prefab Datacenter Operating System you might create your own in a long holiday weekend. Not St. Patrick's of course.     Their vision:   Enable one person to invent and run the next revolutionary IT service, operationally expressing a new business idea as a multi-million-user service over the course of a long weekend. By doing so we hope to enable an Internet "Fortune 1 million".        How? By wizardry in the form of a “datacenter operating system” created from a pinch of "statistical machine learning (SML)" and a tincture of "recent insights from networking and distributed systems."

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking  The Datacenter as a Computer  book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!
 
John Fries in a  G+ comment  has what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the book:
  

It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter anymore

<p>Introduction: James Hamilton in  Counting Servers is Hard  has an awesome breakdown of what  one million plus servers  really means in terms of resource usage. The summary from his calculations are eye popping:   
 
 Facilities: 15 to 30 large datacenters 
 Capital expense: $4.25 Billion 
 Total power: 300MW 
 Power Consumption: 2.6TWh annually 
 
  
The power consumption is about the same as  used by Nicaragua  and the capital cost is about a third of what Americans  spent on video games  in 2012. Now that's web scale.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89593124 <a title="439-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-10-Scalability_Perspectives_%231%3A_Nicholas_Carr_%E2%80%93_The_Big_Switch.html">439 high scalability-2008-11-10-Scalability Perspectives #1: Nicholas Carr – The Big Switch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.     Nicholas Carr    A former executive editor of the Harvard Business Review, Nicholas Carr writes and speaks on technology, business, and culture. His provocative 2004 book Does IT Matter? set off a worldwide debate about the role of computers in business.    The Big Switch – Rewiring the World, From Edison to Google    Carr's core insight is that the development of the computer and the Internet remarkably parallels that of the last radically disruptive technology, electricity. He traces the rapid morphing of electrification from an in-house competitive advantage to a ubiquitous utility, and how the business advantage rapidly shifted from the innovators and early adop</p><p>3 0.86027992 <a title="439-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-21-Hot_Holiday_Scalability_Links_for_2009.html">753 high scalability-2009-12-21-Hot Holiday Scalability Links for 2009</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:   HostedFTP.com - Amazon S3 Performance Report . How fast is S3? Based on their own study HostedFTP.com has found: 10 to 12 MB/second when storing and receiving files and 140 ms per file stored as a fixed overhead cost.
   
  Update:   A Quantitative Comparison of Rackspace and Amazon Cloud Storage Solutions . S3 isn't the only cloud storage service out there. Mosso is saying they can save you so money while offering support. There are number of scenarios in their paper, but For 5TB of cloud storage Mosso will save you 17% over S3 without support and 42% with support. For their CDN on a Global test Mosso says the average response time is 333ms for CloudFront vs. 107ms for Cloud Files which means globally, Cloud Files is 3.1 times or 211% faster than CloudFront.   Amazon S3  is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.  This service allows you to link directly to files at a cost of 15 cents per GB of storage, and 20 cents per GB</p><p>5 0.84704703 <a title="439-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA%3A_Badoo%E2%80%99s_journey_into_Continuous_Integration.html">1531 high scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA: Badoo’s journey into Continuous Integration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications stemming from this, we use AIDA.
 
 AIDA  (Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant) is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git, TeamCity and JIRA.
 
In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous integration.
 
We’ll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we’ll discuss AIDA’s major contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.
  Git flow  
The Badoo Team uses Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in JIRA and a description of the problem.

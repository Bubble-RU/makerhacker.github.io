<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model,
which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model,
networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as
services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the
datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed
application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing
sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the
datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to
scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt
easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sun's VeriScale architecture
provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun
Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures
for more than a decade. The features of these architectures, such as
elasticity, ar</p><p>4 0.15736756 <a title="444-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-21-The_Conspecific_Hybrid_Cloud.html">1212 high scalability-2012-03-21-The Conspecific Hybrid Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When you're looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium ecosystem,
one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular breed of fish is
amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are not, which means if you
put them together in a confined space, they're going to fight. Viciously. To
the death. Responsible aquarists try to avoid such situations, so careful
attention to theconspecificityof animals is a must.Now, while in many respects
the data center ecosystem correlates well to an aquarium ecosystem, in this
case it does not. It's what you usually get, today, but its not actually the
best model. That's because what you want in the data center ecosystem -
particularly when it extends to include publiccloud computingresources - is
conspecificity in infrastructure.This desire and practice is being seen both
in enterprise data center decision making as well as in startups suddenly

<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days - you only needed one, but then came along the
AS400's and soon you had ten - but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh
sh%# - now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and
datacenter operations!Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path?As a
technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other
CIO's on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context
to how they can leverage SpringCM' s easy, fast and affordable cloud
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done
in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a
combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those
services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be
outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud
services.What options do I have?In a recent conversation with a CIO

<p>Introduction: Data centers are reshaping themselves by taking ideas from public cloud
providers, such as Amazon and Google. The idea is to make the data center more
cost-effective by enabling on-demand utility-based computing rather than
dedicated machines. At the same time, it is clear that to make IT operations
more effective, it doesn't make sense to run all the applications that are
currently hosted in a company's data center in the private cloud. This calls
for an integration between private and public cloud. In this post i discuss
some of the challenges involved in making that happen:1. How do we design
applications to be cloud-agnostic?2. How do we enable seamless fail-over to a
public cloud?3. Future-proofing: There are many cases in which we can't make a
clear decision as to where our application should be running at the time of
writing or developing the application. We would like to be in a position to
change the decision as to where our application will be running even after our
applicati</p><p>2 0.92746538 <a title="444-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-30-10_Tips_for_Optimizing_NGINX_and_PHP-fpm_for_High_Traffic_Sites.html">1640 high scalability-2014-04-30-10 Tips for Optimizing NGINX and PHP-fpm for High Traffic Sites</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adrian Singer has boiled down 7 years of experience to a set of 10 very useful
tips on how to bestoptimize NGINX and PHP-fpm for high traffic sites:Switch
from TCP to UNIX domain sockets. When communicating to processes on the same
machine UNIX sockets have better performance the TCP because there's less
copying and fewer context switches.Adjust Worker Processes. Set the
worker_processes in your nginx.conf file to the number of cores your machine
has and  increase the number of worker_connections.Setup upstream load
balancing. Multiple upstream backends on the same machine produce higher
throughout than a single one.Disable access log files. Log files on high
traffic sites involve a lot of I/O that has to be synchronized across all
threads. Can have a big impact.Enable GZip. Cache information about frequently
accessed files. Adjust client timeouts.Adjust output buffers./etc/sysctl.conf
tuning.Monitor. Continually monitor the number of open connections, free
memory and number of waiting</p><p>3 0.91655111 <a title="444-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-21-In_Memory_Data_Grid_Technologies.html">1160 high scalability-2011-12-21-In Memory Data Grid Technologies</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After winning a CSC Leading Edge Forum (LEF) research grant, I (Paul Colmer)
wanted to publish some of the highlights of my research to share with the
wider technology community.What is an In Memory Data Grid?It is not an in-
memory relational database, a NOSQL database or a relational database.  It is
a different breed of software datastore.In summary an IMDG is an 'off the
shelf' software product that exhibits the following characteristics:The data
model is distributed across many servers in a single location or across
multiple locations.  This distribution is known as a data fabric.  This
distributed model is known as a 'shared nothing' architecture.All servers can
be active in each site.All data is stored in the RAM of the servers.Servers
can be added or removed non-disruptively, to increase the amount of RAM
available.The data model is non-relational and is object-based. Distributed
applications written on the .NET and Java application platforms are
supported.The data fabric is re</p><p>4 0.91510361 <a title="444-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons_Learned_at_208K%3A_Towards_Debugging_Millions_of_Cores.html">484 high scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons Learned at 208K: Towards Debugging Millions of Cores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we debug and profile a cloud full of processors and threads? It's a
problem more will be seeing as we code big scary programs that run on even
bigger scarier clouds. Logging gets you far, but sometimes finding the root
cause of problem requires delving deep into a program's execution. I don't
know about you, but setting up 200,000+ gdb instances doesn't sound all that
appealing. Tools like STAT (Stack Trace Analysis Tool) are being developed to
help with this huge task. STAT "gathers and merges stack traces from a
parallel application's processes." So STAT isn't a low level debugger, but it
will help you find the needle in a million haystacks.Abstract:Petascale
systems will present several new challenges to performance and correctness
tools. Such machines may contain millions of cores, requiring that tools use
scalable data structures and analysis algorithms to collect and to process
application data. In addition, at such scales, each tool itself will become a
large parallel app</p><p>5 0.91351777 <a title="444-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-14-Implementing_the_Lustre_File_System_with_Sun_Storage%3A_High_Performance_Storage_for_High_Performance_Computing.html">411 high scalability-2008-10-14-Implementing the Lustre File System with Sun Storage: High Performance Storage for High Performance Computing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Much of the focus of high performance computing (HPC) has centered on CPU
performance. However, as computing requirements grow, HPC clusters are
demanding higher rates of aggregate data throughput. Today's clusters feature
larger numbers of nodes with increased compute speeds. The higher clock rates
and operations per clock cycle create increased demand for local data on each
node. In addition, InfiniBand and other high-speed, low-latency interconnects
increase the data throughput available to each node.Traditional shared file
systems such as NFS have not been able to scale to meet this growing demand
for data throughput on HPC clusters. Scalable cluster file systems that can
provide parallel data access to hundreds of nodes and petabytes of storage are
needed to provide the high data throughput required by large HPC applications,
including manufacturing, electronic design, and research.This paper describes
an implementation of the Sun Lustre file system as a scalable storage cluster

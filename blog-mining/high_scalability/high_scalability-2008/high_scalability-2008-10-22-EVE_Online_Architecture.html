<p>Introduction: "Everything in war is simple, but theďťż simplest thing is difficult." -- Carl
von ClausewitzGames are proving grounds for software architecture. They
combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost
sensitivity, and the need for profit. And when games have in-game currency,
like EVE Online has, there's money at play, so you can't just get away with a
c'est la vie attitude. Engineering must be applied. InPlanning for war: how
the EVE Online servers deal with a 3,000 person battle, we learn some
techniques EVE Online uses to handle large games:7 Sensible...Do nothing.Most
games are manageable or have spikes that quickly dissipate. Run it Hot.
There's nothing to throttle as servers run at 100%. Why waste money? Use all
your CPU.Shard it. Games are sharded by solar system and multiple solar

world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average
of 130 friends.Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a
homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those
requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then
rendered.Different events put different stresses on different parts of

socially with friends usingPlayfishgames on social platforms like The
Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the
fastest growing segment of the game industry:social gaming, which is the love
child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early
adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud
servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by
why EA bought them for$300 millionand they think a$1 billion gameis possible):
building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile
gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve
systems, agile development and deployment, andselling virtual goodas a
business model.How can a small company make all this happen? To explain the

<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t
be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems
Laboratories* The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds
is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the
high-tech industry.* The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome
of the evolution of these games.* Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore
the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.* The game server is used both to
discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating
(by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the
client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might
seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role
means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the
server component.* Using multiple servers is a basic mechanism for scaling th</p><p>4 0.75474668 <a title="424-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-17-Scaling_Spam_Eradication_Using_Purposeful_Games%3A_Die_Spammer_Die%21.html">422 high scalability-2008-10-17-Scaling Spam Eradication Using Purposeful Games: Die Spammer Die!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to
dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change.
What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's
link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better
yesterday and a better tomorrow.CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make
CAPTCHA work (Spammers Choose GMail). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't
really work because CAPTCHA solving markets (Inside India's CAPTCHA solving
economy) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken
CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game
over :-)Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the
CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is
with humans.Using Games to Get Humans to Do Work (like CAPTCHA) for FreeHow do

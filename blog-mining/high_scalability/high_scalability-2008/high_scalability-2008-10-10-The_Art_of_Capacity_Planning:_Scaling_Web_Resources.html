<p>Introduction: Here's a common situation and question from themechanical-sympathyGoogle group
by Avinash Agrawal on the black art of capacity planning:How to get started
with sizing and capacity planning, assuming we don't know the software
behavior and its completely new product to deal with?Gil Tene, Vice President
of Technology and CTO & Co-Founder, wrote a very understandable and useful
answer that is worth highlighting:Start with requirements. I see way too many
"capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some
irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this
thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.There are two key
sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:In the
"How Much" part, you need to establish, based on expected business needs,
Numbers for things (like connections, users, streams, transactions or messages
per second) that you expect to interact with at the peak time of normal
operations, and</p><p>5 0.13307442 <a title="407-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-08-Guerrilla_Capacity_Planning_and_the_Law_of_Universal_Scalability.html">381 high scalability-2008-09-08-Guerrilla Capacity Planning and the Law of Universal Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the era of Web 2.0 traditional approaches to capacity planning are often
difficult to implement. Guerrilla Capacity Planning facilitates rapid
forecasting of capacity requirements based on the opportunistic use of
whatever performance data and tools are available.One unique Guerrilla tool is
Virtual Load Testing, based on Dr. Gunther's "Universal Law of Computational
Scaling", which provides a highly cost-effective method for assessing
application scalability. Neil Gunther, M.Sc., Ph.D. is an internationally
recognized computer system performance consultant who founded Performance
Dynamics Company in 1994.Some reasons why you should understand this law:1. A
lot of people use the term "scalability" without clearly defining it, let
alone defining it quantitatively. Computer system scalability must be
quantified. If you can't quantify it, you can't guarantee it. The universal
law of computational scaling provides that quantification.2. One the greatest
impediments to applying queueing</p><p>6 0.12065759 <a title="407-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Flickr.html">41 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Flickr</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Unlike Theo Schlossnagle, author ofScalable Internet Architectures, I am not a
stickler for semantics because I have an unswerving faith in the ultimate
unknowability of the world as experienced by others. That's why it is Theo who
bravely tackles the differences in his informative blog postPartitioning vs.
Federation vs. Sharding. Royans Tharakan also talks about it on hisblog.Is
there a difference and does it really matter to all our intrepid scalable
website builders?breakGenerally whatever Theo says is probably close to the
truth. Yet, in my mind I think of partitioning as abasic level categoryand
federation and sharding as more specific (subordinate) instances of
partitioning. And partitioning is a more specific instance of the more more
general (superordinate) category divide-and-conquer. Which isn't a useful way
to think about the topic at all.So, let's say federation is like Star Trek.

<p>Introduction: Update 3:The book was released! Find it on Amazon atThe Art of Capacity
Planning.Update 2:Maybe the iPhone can use a little capacity planning?What's
Behind the iPhone 3G Glitches:One source says Apple programmed the Infineon
chip to demand a more powerful 3G signal than the iPhone really requires. So
if too many people try to make a call or go on the Internet in a given area,
some of the devices will decide there's insufficient power and switch to the
slower networkâ&euro;&rdquo;even if there is enough 3G bandwidth available.Update:To get a
taste of what will be served,mySQL DBAhas a nice post titledCapacity Planning,
Architecture, Scaling, Response time, Throughput. You learn how to figure out
when your application will break by building a 3rd order polynomial. Cool
stuff!John Allspaw who is the Operations Engineering Manager at Flickr is
about to publish a book with O'Reilly.There are not much details so far but it
seems interesting and relevant to High Scalability.Allspaw combines personal

<p>Introduction: Piccolo(notthisorthis) is a system for distributed computing, Piccolo is a new
data-centric programming model for writing parallel in-memory applications in
data centers. Unlike existing data-ﬂow models, Piccolo allows computation
running on different machines to share distributed, mutable state via a key-
value table interface. Traditional data-centric models (such as Hadoop) which
present the user a single object at a time to operate on, Piccolo exposes a
global table interface which is available to all parts of the computation
simultaneously. This allows users to specify programs in an intuitive manner
very similar to that of writing programs for a single machine.Using an in-
memory key-value store is a very different approach from the canonical map-
reduce, which is based on using distributed file systems. The results are
impressive:Experiments have shown that Piccolo is fast and pro-vides excellent
scaling for many applications. The performance of PageRank and k-means on

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byNick Burling, VP of Product Management
ofBluestripe.Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance
optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis -- you hear about
them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest
technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS.People
don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an
infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work.At BlueStripe, we work
with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a
day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team
never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it theHidden DNS
Tax.What is the Hidden DNS Tax?The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance
hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end
architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune
10 company.A DNS lookup can fail, the user gets</p><p>4 0.92641062 <a title="407-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-18-New_Relic_Architecture_-_Collecting_20%2B_Billion_Metrics_a_Day.html">1082 high scalability-2011-07-18-New Relic Architecture - Collecting 20+ Billion Metrics a Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Brian Doll, Application Performance Engineer at New
Relic.New Relic's multitenant, SaaS web application monitoring service
collects and persists over 100,000 metrics every second on a sustained basis,
while still delivering an average page load time of 1.5 seconds.  We believe
that good architecture and good tools can help you handle an extremely large
amount of data while still providing extremely fast service.  Here we'll show
you how we do it. New Relic is Application Performance Management (APM) as a
Service In-app agent instrumentation (bytecode instrumentation, etc.) Support
for 5 programming languages (Ruby, Java, PHP, .NET, Python) 175,000+ app

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Dan Bartow, VP ofSOASTA, talking about how they pelted
MySpace with 1 million concurrent users using 800 EC2 instances. I thought
this was an interesting story because: that's a lot of users, it takes big
cajones to test your live site like that, and not everything worked out quite
as expected. I'd like to thank Dan for taking the time to write and share this
article.In December of 2009 MySpace launched a new wave of streaming music
video offerings in New Zealand, building on the previous success of MySpace
music.  These new features included the ability to watch music videos, search
for artist's videos, create lists of favorites, and more. The anticipated load
increase from a feature like this on a popular site like MySpace is huge, and
they wanted to test these features before making them live. If you manage the
infrastructure that sits behind a high traffic application you don't want any
surprises.

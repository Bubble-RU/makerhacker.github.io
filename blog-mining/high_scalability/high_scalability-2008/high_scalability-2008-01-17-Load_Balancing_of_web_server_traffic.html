<p>Introduction: At a  Cloud Computing Meetup , Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:  Keeping Movies Running Amid Thunderstorms . While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the cloud, issues with capacity planning,  thundering herds , latency problems, and  simian armageddon , I found myself most taken with how they handle  software deployment in the cloud .
 
I've worked on half a dozen or more build and deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant software deployments:  the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to completely run a new release while running the old release at the same time .
 
The process goes something like:

<p>Introduction: We talked about  42 Monster Problems That Attack As Loads Increase . And in  The Aggregation Collection  we talked about the value of prioritizing work and making smart queues as a way of absorbing and not reflecting traffic spikes.
 
Now we move on to our next batch of strategies where the theme is  conditioning , which is the idea of shaping and controlling flows of work within your application...
  Use Resources Proportional To a Fixed Limit  
This is probably the most important rule for achieving scalability within an application. What it means:
  
 Find the resource that has a fixed limit that you know you can support. For example, a guarantee to handle a certain number of objects in memory. So if we always use resources proportional to the number of objects it is likely we can prevent resource exhaustion. 
 Devise ways of tying what you need to do to the individual resources. 
  
Some examples:
  
 Keep a list of purchase orders with line items over $20 (or whatever). Do not keep</p><p>4 0.079117186 <a title="217-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed_content_system_with_bandwidth_balancing.html">605 high scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed content system with bandwidth balancing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1 copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random server to serve the file as a temp fix...     It's a small video streaming service. I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's psuedo streaming, but it works.     I have been looking at MogileFS, which would solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar). However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth % usage?     Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>5 0.073761284 <a title="217-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-The_7_Stages_of_Scaling_Web_Apps.html">391 high scalability-2008-09-23-The 7 Stages of Scaling Web Apps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical successful website goes through: 
 
 Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture, low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers, database server, and internal storage. 
 Stage 2 - More of the same, just bigger. 
 Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding. 
 Stage 4 - The Pain Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content, significant re-architecting for DB. 
 Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters, using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster. 
 Stage 6 - Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again, op</p><p>6 0.072983533 <a title="217-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-03-Save_on_a_Load_Balancer_By_Using_Client_Side_Load_Balancing.html">109 high scalability-2007-10-03-Save on a Load Balancer By Using Client Side Load Balancing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In   Client Side Load Balancing for Web 2.0 Applications   author Lei Zhu suggests a very interesting approach to load balancing: forget DNS round robbin, toss your expensive load balancer, and make your client do the load balancing for you. Your client maintains a list of possible servers and cycles through them. All the details are explained in the article, but it's an intriguing idea, especially for the budget conscious startup.</p><p>3 0.64223331 <a title="217-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-29-10_Things_Bitly_Should_Have_Monitored.html">1587 high scalability-2014-01-29-10 Things Bitly Should Have Monitored</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Monitor, monitor, monitor. That's the advice every startup gives once they reach a certain size. But can you ever monitor enough? If you are Bitly and everyone will complain when you are down, probably not.
 
Here are  10 Things We Forgot to Monitor  from Bitly, along with good stories and copious amounts of code snippets. Well worth reading, especially after you've already started monitoring the lower hanging fruit.
 
An interesting revelation from the article is that:
  

We run bitly split across two data centers, one is a managed environment with DELL hardware, and the second is Amazon EC2.  

   
  Fork Rate . A strange configuration issue caused processes to be created at a rate of several hundred a second rather than the expected 1-10/second.  
  Flow control packets .  A network configuration that honors flow control packets and isn’t configured to disable them, can temporarily cause dropped traffic. 
  Swap In/Out Rate . Measure the right thing. It's the rate memory is swapped</p><p>4 0.63089681 <a title="217-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-08-Paper%3A_Understanding_and_Building_High_Availability-Load_Balanced_Clusters.html">117 high scalability-2007-10-08-Paper: Understanding and Building High Availability-Load Balanced Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability load balanced system using mod backhand and  Wackamole . The idea is you don't need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read. Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of effect of keep-alives on performance.</p><p>5 0.62709111 <a title="217-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-04-Number_of_load_balanced_servers.html">111 high scalability-2007-10-04-Number of load balanced servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++ to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and platform independence (Java Bytecode). They may even have gotten better throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution, you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor. Why? Because of the unpredictable pauses introduced by the garbage collector which result in significant jitter (variance of execution time).      In this post Frederic Pariente  Engineering Manager at Sun Microsystems posted a summary of a case study on how the use of Sun Real Time JVM and  GigaSpaces was used in the context of of a customer proof-of-concept this summer to ensure   guaranteed latency per m</p><p>5 0.47867116 <a title="217-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-18-Announcing_My_Webinar_on_December_14th%3A_What_Should_I_Do%3F_Choosing_SQL%2C_NoSQL_or_Both_for_Scalable_Web_Applications.html">945 high scalability-2010-11-18-Announcing My Webinar on December 14th: What Should I Do?

<p>Introduction: It's time to do something a little different and for me that doesn't mean cutting off my hair and joining a monastery, nor does it mean buying a cherry red convertible (yet), it means doing a webinar!
  
 On December 14th, 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM EST, I'll be hosting  What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for Scalable Web Applications .  
 The webinar is sponsored by VoltDB, but it will be completely vendor independent, as that's the only honor preserving and technically accurate way of doing these things. 
 The webinar will run about 60 minutes, with 40 minutes of speechifying and 20 minutes for questions. 
 The hashtag for the event on Twitter will be  SQLNoSQL . I'll be monitoring that hashtag if you have any suggestions for the webinar or if you would like to ask questions during the webinar.  
   
  
The motivation for me to do the webinar was a talk I had with another audience member at the  NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto . He said he came from a Java background and was confused ab</p><p>6 0.47867003 <a title="217-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-13-Still_Time_to_Attend_My_Webinar_Tomorrow%3A_What_Should_I_Do%3F_Choosing_SQL%2C_NoSQL_or_Both_for_Scalable_Web_Applications.html">957 high scalability-2010-12-13-Still Time to Attend My Webinar Tomorrow: What Should I Do?

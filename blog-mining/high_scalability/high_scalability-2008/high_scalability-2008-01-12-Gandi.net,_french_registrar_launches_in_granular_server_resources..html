<p>Introduction: Hi,         I am using drupal for my clients website, and was thinking is it possible to host all ( about 500) of them on the same server(maybe VPS or dedicated).       Here is the situation..... Each clients website has a database with about 50 tables each, all the databases are small in size about 2-5 MB .... and the websites are low traffic websites with say.. 50 hits/day on avg.... that means about 2000 queries/db/day ..... (avg 40 queries per hit)....         Wanted to know if it is possible to have so many databases about 500 on the same server?         what are the things that i should look into if i should make this happen?</p><p>3 0.074692398 <a title="209-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-19-Strategy%3A_Three_Techniques_to_Survive_Traffic_Surges_by_Quickly_Scaling_Your_Site.html">1615 high scalability-2014-03-19-Strategy: Three Techniques to Survive Traffic Surges by Quickly Scaling Your Site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matthew Might , as a first responder to a surprise  traffic surge  on his inexpensive linode hosted blog, took emergency steps that you might find useful in a similar situation:
  
  Find the bottleneck.  Reloading the page in firebug showed the first page took 24 seconds to load and after that everything else loaded quickly. In retrospect this burst meant the site was thread limited as the CPU was idle. 
  Cut image sizes in half  with a shell script using ImageMagick's convert. Load time is now 12 seconds. 
  Turn dynamic content into static content  using a static index.html file  copied using the browser's "view source" feature. Load time is now 6 seconds. 
  Added threads  to the Apache configuration file. Load time is now 2 seconds. Crises averted. 
  
Because of this quick thinking and quick action the patient survived to serve pages another day.
 
And in fine post-mortem tradition some of the future changes are:

<p>Introduction: Launched in 2001 by Microsoft, since then this platform is widely popular among organizations to increase the efficiency of their business and productive volume. As we all know the importance of communication mode in every organization and by keeping in the mind this fact, Microsoft SharePoint communicates over all barriers and spread the required information within a company.
 
Microsoft SharePoint is an ideal solution for companies who have multiple offices and staff members who are on the move. Using SharePoint, documents and other materials can be easily shared with both colleagues and managers. Other features include advanced document management, which allows users to virtually check out a document, modify it or just read it, then check in the document again. This allows managers/company owners to see exactly when their staff members are working and just what they are doing. When combined with a highly customizable workflow management system and group calendars, SharePoint can imp</p><p>5 0.06524764 <a title="209-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-03-Snooze_-_Open-source%2C_Scalable%2C_Autonomic%2C_and_Energy-efficient_VM_Management_for_Private_Clouds.html">1238 high scalability-2012-05-03-Snooze - Open-source, Scalable, Autonomic, and Energy-efficient VM Management for Private Clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Snooze   is an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient  virtual machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly  to other VM management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula,  Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it allows to build compute infrastructures  from virtualized resources. Particularly, once installed and configured  users can submit and control the life-cycle of a large number of VMs.  However, contrary to existing frameworks for scalability and fault  tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical  architecture. Moreover, it performs distributed VM management and is  designed to be energy efficient. Therefore, it implements features to  monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU, memory, network Rx, network Tx)  demands, detect and resolve overload/underload situations, perform  dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and finally power  management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a g</p><p>6 0.062244914 <a title="209-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-28-Amazon%27s_EC2%3A_Pay_as_You_Grow_Could_Cut_Your_Costs_in_Half.html">195 high scalability-2007-12-28-Amazon's EC2: Pay as You Grow Could Cut Your Costs in Half</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ivan Zuzak wrote a fascinating article on  Real-time feed processing and filtering  using Google App Engine to build  Feed-buster , a service that  inserts MediaRSS tags into feeds that don't have them . He talks about using polling and  PubSubHubBub  (real-time) to process FriendFeed feeds. Ivan is trying to devise a separate filtering service where:   
  
  filtering services should be applied as close to the publisher  as possible so notifications that nobody wants don’t waste network resource.  
  processing services should be applied as close to the subscriber  so that the original update may be transported through the network as a single notification for as long as possible. 
  
Besides being a generally interesting article, Ivan makes an insightful observation on the nature of using polling services in combination with metered Infrastructure/Platform services:
  

Polling is bad because AppEngine applications have a  fixed free daily quota  for consumed resources, when the numbe</p><p>3 0.43806967 <a title="209-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-03-Product%3A_nginx.html">314 high scalability-2008-05-03-Product: nginx</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Cacti  is a network statistics graphing tool designed as a frontend to RRDtool's data storage and graphing functionality. It is intended to be intuitive and easy to use, as well as robust and scalable. It is generally used to graph time-series data like CPU load and bandwidth use.  The frontend is written in PHP; it can handle multiple users, each with their own graph sets, so it is sometimes used by web hosting providers (especially dedicated server, virtual private server, and colocation providers) to display bandwidth statistics for their customers. It can be used to configure the data collection itself, allowing certain setups to be monitored without any manual configuration of RRDtool.</p><p>6 0.42608544 <a title="209-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Feedblendr_Architecture_-_Using_EC2_to_Scale.html">138 high scalability-2007-10-30-Feedblendr Architecture - Using EC2 to Scale</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:    GlusterFS  is a clustered file-system capable of scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64 server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).  Cluster file systems are still not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.   GlusterFS achieved  35 GBps read throughput . The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB block size. GlusterFS was configured with unify translator and round-robin scheduler</p><p>3 0.31340173 <a title="209-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Why_doesn%27t_anyone_use_j2ee%3F.html">82 high scalability-2007-09-06-Why doesn't anyone use j2ee?</a></p>

They use servlets, an application server, the JDK, and they do the rest themselves.  They skip JSP, entity beans, and JMS.      When you need to scale putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky strategy. Why use JSP when you can do better? When use entity beans when you can do better? Use servlets because they are a very effective way of handling http requests. Use Java because it is fast, runs everywhere, and has a boat load of libraries you can use to build your build your custom system.     Probably the major reason J2EE is absentee is simply LAMP. LAMP is just so incredibly functional for most 2-tier shared nothing site</p><p>4 0.24702647 <a title="209-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-09-LiveJournal_Architecture.html">3 high scalability-2007-07-09-LiveJournal Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A fascinating and detailed story of how LiveJournal evolved their system to scale. LiveJournal was an early player in the free blog service race and faced issues from quickly adding a large number of users. Blog posts come fast and furious which causes a lot of writes and writes are particularly hard to scale. Understanding how LiveJournal faced their scaling problems will help any aspiring website builder.

    Scaling from 1, 2,  and 4 hosts to cluster of servers.    Avoid single points of failure.    Using MySQL replication only takes you so far.    Becoming IO bound kills scaling.    Spread out writes and reads for more parallelism.    You can't keep adding read slaves and scale.    Shard storage approach, using DRBD, for maxim</p><p>5 0.23763222 <a title="209-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-19-Serving_JavaScript_Fast.html">285 high scalability-2008-03-19-Serving JavaScript Fast</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cal Henderson  writes at thinkvitamin.com : "With our so-called "Web 2.0' applications and their rich content and interaction, we expect our applications to increasingly make use of CSS and JavaScript. To make sure these applications are nice and snappy to use, we need to optimize the size and nature of content required to render the page, making sure weâ&euro;&trade;re delivering the optimum experience. In practice, this means a combination of making our content as small and fast to download as possible, while avoiding unnecessarily refetching unmodified resources." A lot of good comments too.</p><p>6 0.22564861 <a title="209-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-12-Getting_ready_for_the_cloud.html">490 high scalability-2009-01-12-Getting ready for the cloud</a></p>

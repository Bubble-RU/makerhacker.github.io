<p>Introduction: Snooze   is an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient  virtual machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly  to other VM management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula,  Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it allows to build compute infrastructures  from virtualized resources. Particularly, once installed and configured  users can submit and control the life-cycle of a large number of VMs.  However, contrary to existing frameworks for scalability and fault  tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical  architecture. Moreover, it performs distributed VM management and is  designed to be energy efficient. Therefore, it implements features to  monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU, memory, network Rx, network Tx)  demands, detect and resolve overload/underload situations, perform  dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and finally power  management to save energy.

<p>Introduction: In  Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation  we learn some shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):
  
  Average server utilization in many data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.  
 Surely that's just for old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade. 
  
It's a VM wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same server.
 
It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithm</p><p>5 0.12743992 <a title="349-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-07-Rumors_of_Signs_and_Portents_Concerning_Freeish_Google_Cloud.html">299 high scalability-2008-04-07-Rumors of Signs and Portents Concerning Freeish Google Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Rumor no more.  Google Jumps Head First Into Web Services With Google App Engine . The quick and dirty of it: developers simply upload their Python code to Google, launch the application, and can monitor usage and other metrics via a multi-platform desktop application.  There were 10,000 developer slots open and of course I was too late. More as the cobra strikes.      Update: TechCrunch reports  Google To Launch BigTable As Web Service  next week. It competes with Amazon's SimpleDB. Though it won't be truly comparable until they also release an EC2 and S3 equivalent. An internet hit for each data access is a little painful. As Jimmy says in Goodfellas, "That's the way. You don't take no sh*t from nobody. "      First   Dave Winer   hallucinates a pig on the mean streets of Walnut Creek that told him Google's long foretold cloud offering will be free for bloggers of "modest needs." GigaOM then says a free cloud service is how Google could eat   Amazon's bacon for lunch  .</p><p>6 0.11278136 <a title="349-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-14-Strategy%3A_Cache_Application_Start_State_to_Reduce_Spin-up_Times.html">1023 high scalability-2011-04-14-Strategy: Cache Application Start State to Reduce Spin-up Times</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Are long VM instance spin-up times in the cloud costing you money? That's the question that immediately came to mind when  James Urquhart , in an interview at the  Stata Conference , made this thought provoking comment:  the   faster you can get the resources into the hands of the people who use them, the more money you save overall .
 
One of the many super powers of the cloud is  elasticity , the ability to dynamically acquire and release resources in response to demand. But like any good superhero, their strength must also form the basis of a not quite fatal flaw. Years and years of angsty episodes are usually required to explore this contradiction.
 
In the case of the cloud, the weakness reveals itself in slow VM spin-up times. Spinning up a VM in EC2 can take a little as  1-3 minutes , or can  average 5-10 minutes , or it can take much longer if there's heavy usage in your availability zone. EC2 is not alone. A common complaint about Google App Engine is the  cold-start problem .</p><p>3 0.75093496 <a title="349-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-The_Implications_of_Punctuated_Scalabilium_for_Website_Architecture.html">533 high scalability-2009-03-11-The Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At a  Cloud Computing Meetup , Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:  Keeping Movies Running Amid Thunderstorms . While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the cloud, issues with capacity planning,  thundering herds , latency problems, and  simian armageddon , I found myself most taken with how they handle  software deployment in the cloud .
 
I've worked on half a dozen or more build and deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant software deployments:  the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to completely run a new release while running the old release at the same time .
 
The process goes something like:

<p>Introduction: Write a little "Hello World" program these days and it runs inside a bewildering Russian Doll of nested environments, each layer adding its own special performance and complexity tax. First, a language executes in its own environment of data structure libraries, memory management, and so on. That, more often than not, will run inside a language VM like the JVM, CLR, or V8. The language VM will in-turn run inside a process that runs inside an OS. An application will run in one or more threads inside a process. And the whole thing will run inside a machine sharing VM layer like Xen. And across all of that are frameworks for monitoring, elasticity, storage, and so on.

<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something called   Self Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance   (SCIT).  Botnets  are created when vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks like a  dog chasing its tail ). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a great deal of sense once I thought about it.  With SCIT you stop and restart VM instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window vulnerability)....
   
 This short exposure window means worms and viri do not have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack. A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM</p><p>2 0.86917496 <a title="349-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-06-Paper%3A_Scaling_Genome_Sequencing_-_Complete_Genomics_Technology_Overview.html">403 high scalability-2008-10-06-Paper: Scaling Genome Sequencing - Complete Genomics Technology Overview</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in terms of scalability. The  paper  describes a new technology by the startup company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction of the cost of earlier possibilities.  Complete Genomics is building the worldâ&euro;&trade;s largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey, outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.  By 2010, their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30 petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.  Do you find this interesting and relevant to HighScalability.com?</p><p>3 0.82398283 <a title="349-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Product%3A_Cacti.html">58 high scalability-2007-08-04-Product: Cacti</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cacti  is a network statistics graphing tool designed as a frontend to RRDtool's data storage and graphing functionality. It is intended to be intuitive and easy to use, as well as robust and scalable. It is generally used to graph time-series data like CPU load and bandwidth use.  The frontend is written in PHP; it can handle multiple users, each with their own graph sets, so it is sometimes used by web hosting providers (especially dedicated server, virtual private server, and colocation providers) to display bandwidth statistics for their customers. It can be used to configure the data collection itself, allowing certain setups to be monitored without any manual configuration of RRDtool.</p><p>4 0.81508875 <a title="349-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy%3A_Efficiently_Geo-referencing_IPs.html">168 high scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy: Efficiently Geo-referencing IPs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations.  Jeremy Cole in   On efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GIS   succinctly explains the many uses for such a feature:     Geo-referencing IPs is, in a nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more applications.       This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-rereferncing data, how to load data,  and the performance of different approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to the subject.</p><p>5 0.79187649 <a title="349-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-01-Myth%3A_Eric_Brewer_on_Why_Banks_are_BASE_Not_ACID_-_Availability_Is_Revenue_.html">1450 high scalability-2013-05-01-Myth: Eric Brewer on Why Banks are BASE Not ACID - Availability Is Revenue </a></p>
<p>Introduction: In   NoSQL: Past, Present, Future    Eric Brewer  has a particularly fine section on explaining the often hard to understand ideas of   BASE   (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent),   ACID   (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability),   CAP   (Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in banking.
    Myth   : Money is important, so banks   must   use transactions to keep money safe and consistent, right? 
    Reality   : Banking transactions are inconsistent, particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over Consistency. 
   Why?   1)  Availability correlates with revenue and consistency generally does not.  2)  Historically there was never an idea of perfect communication so everything was partitioned.

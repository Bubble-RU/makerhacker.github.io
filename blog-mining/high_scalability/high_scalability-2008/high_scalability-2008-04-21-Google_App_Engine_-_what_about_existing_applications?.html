<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days - you only needed one, but then came along the
AS400's and soon you had ten - but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh
sh%# - now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and
datacenter operations!Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path?As a
technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other
CIO's on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context
to how they can leverage SpringCM' s easy, fast and affordable cloud
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done
in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a
combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those
services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be
outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud
services.What options do I have?In a recent conversation with a CIO

questions:1. If we want to take advantage of one of the clouds, are we doomed

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Rumor no more.Google Jumps Head First Into Web Services With Google
App Engine. The quick and dirty of it: developers simply upload their Python
code to Google, launch the application, and can monitor usage and other
metrics via a multi-platform desktop application. There were 10,000 developer
slots open and of course I was too late. More as the cobra strikes.Update:
TechCrunch reportsGoogle To Launch BigTable As Web Servicenext week. It
competes with Amazon's SimpleDB. Though it won't be truly comparable until
they also release an EC2 and S3 equivalent. An internet hit for each data
access is a little painful. As Jimmy says in Goodfellas, "That's the way. You
don't take no sh*t from nobody. "FirstDave Winerhallucinates a pig on the mean
streets of Walnut Creek that told him Google's long foretold cloud offering
will be free for bloggers of "modest needs." GigaOM then says a free cloud
service is how Google could eatAmazon's bacon for lunch.The reason for this

<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is
indeed the case:Research conducted by HPfound that the majority of businesses
in the EMEA region are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the
cloud. Of the 940 respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-
critical apps at some point over the next two to five years.A more
recentsurvey, by research firm MeriTalkand sponsored by VMware and EMC
(NYSE:EMC), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to move some
mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within two years,
the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their mission-critical apps
to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of their mission-
critical apps to run in the cloud.The Challenge - How to Bring Hundreds of
Enterprise Apps to the CloudThe reality is that cloud economics only start
making sense when there are true workloads that utilize the cloud
infrastructure.If the large majority of</p><p>4 0.7982567 <a title="305-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-12-Getting_ready_for_the_cloud.html">490 high scalability-2009-01-12-Getting ready for the cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Recently, Google announced Google App Engine, another announcement in the
rapidly growing world of cloud computing. This brings up some very serious
questions:1. If we want to take advantage of one of the clouds, are we doomed
to be locked-in for life?2. Must we re-write our existing applications to use
the cloud?3. Do we need to learn a brand new technology or language for the
cloud?This post presents a pattern that will enable us to abstract our
application code from the underlying cloud provider infrastructure. This will
enable us to easily migrate our EXISTING applications to cloud based
environment thus avoiding the need for a complete re-write.</p><p>2 0.90837204 <a title="305-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability_vs_Performance_vs_Availability_vs_Reliability.._Also_scale_up_vs_scale_out_%3F%3F%3F.html">224 high scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability vs Performance vs Availability vs Reliability..

<p>Introduction: Where do you draw the line between scalability vs Performance vs High
Availability vs Reliability?I guess at the end of the day, we all want to be
highly available, great performance and always reliable. So is it safe to say
that scalability is the answer ?Also when do you start to think scale out vs
scale up ?</p><p>3 0.88045639 <a title="305-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-09-Retrospect_on_recent_AWS_outage_and_Resilient_Cloud-Based_Architecture.html">1056 high scalability-2011-06-09-Retrospect on recent AWS outage and Resilient Cloud-Based Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A bit over a month ago Amazon experienced its infamous AWS outage in the US
East Region. As a cloud evangelist, I was intrigued by the history of the
outage as it occurred. There were great posts during and after the outage from
those who went down. But more interestingly for me as architect were the
detailed posts of those who managed to survive the outage relatively unharmed,
such as SimpleGeo, Netflix,SmugMug, SmugMug's CTO, Twilio, Bizo and
others.Reading through the experience of others, I tried to summarize
thepatterns, principles and best practicesthat emerged from these posts, as I
believe we can learn a lot from them on how to design our business
applications to truly leverage on the benefits that the cloud offers in high
availability and scalability.The main principles, patterns and best practices
are:Design for failureStateless and autonomous servicesRedundant hot copies

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Werner VogelsDr. Werner Vogels is Vice President & Chief
Technology Officer at Amazon.com where he is responsible for driving the
company’s technology vision, which is to continuously enhance the innovation
on behalf of Amazon’s customers at a global scale. Prior to joining Amazon, he
worked as a researcher at Cornell University where he was a principal
investigator in several research projects that target the scalability and
robustness of mission-critical enterprise computing systems. He is regarded as
one of the world's top experts on ultra-scalable systems and he uses his
weblog to educate the community about issues such as eventual consistency.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,  Ehcache  Terracotta Inc.  Note: this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are still generally valid and useful.
 
The legendary Moore’s Law, which  states that the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively  on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years, has  held true since 1965. It follows that integrated circuits will continue  to get smaller, with chip fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm  process (1). Users of big iron hardware, or servers that  are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity, benefit from this  trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful over time.  At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum mechanics  will preclude further density increases.

<p>Introduction: Hi,     I am very glad that this site exists, as I have learned more about clustering on this site than for quite some time reading stuff elsewhere. Oftentimes, one can find lots of material about clustering, but the practical real-life information is missing. Not so wih this site.     I am currently planning the development of an application which has a lot of enterprise features and requirements. On the other side (if the tiny chance of success might strike us), this application would not be an in-house application of a financial institution, or something like that, but some kind of communit/web 2.0 web site. Thus it is an enterprise application with (hopefully, but surely unlikely) the user numbers of a social networking site. Each user initiated transaction involves huge resssources business logic wise (including insane amounts of encryption oprations).     Of course, I do not intend to induldge into premature scaling, but to invest every minute I have into the implementation of bu</p><p>4 0.20041962 <a title="364-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-03-Java_World_Interview_on_Scalability_and_Other_Java_Scalability_Secrets.html">459 high scalability-2008-12-03-Java World Interview on Scalability and Other Java Scalability Secrets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK, this  interview is with me  on Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there’s no blame on them :-)   The interview went an interesting direction, but there’s more I’d like add and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have popped out at me:
    Java – It’s the platform stupid .  Java the language isn’t the big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM, libraries, and toolsets.      Java – It’s the community stupid . A lot of creativity is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.  The fecundity of the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our multi-core future.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: PayPal gives yet  another glowing report  of an app rewritten in node.js experiencing substantial performance improvements. PayPal rewrote their account overview page, one of the most trafficked apps on the website, which was previously written in King Java.
 
The benefits:
  
 Full-stack engineers. Using JavaScript on both the front-end and the back-end removed an artificial boundary between the browser and server, allowing engineers to code both. 
  Built almost twice as fast with fewer people  
 Written in 33% fewer lines of code  
 Constructed with 40% fewer files 
 Double the requests per second vs. the Java application. 
 35% decrease in the average response time for the same page. 
  
A common pro Java response is an argument like clearly these people don't know how to program Java. Or rewriting an application usually makes it faster. Or the benchmark is faulty. And so on. Consider it noted. These are all potential factors.

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++ to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and platform independence (Java Bytecode). They may even have gotten better throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution, you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor. Why? Because of the unpredictable pauses introduced by the garbage collector which result in significant jitter (variance of execution time).      In this post Frederic Pariente  Engineering Manager at Sun Microsystems posted a summary of a case study on how the use of Sun Real Time JVM and  GigaSpaces was used in the context of of a customer proof-of-concept this summer to ensure   guaranteed latency per m</p><p>6 0.69696754 <a title="364-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-20-How_Twitter_Improved_JVM_Performance_by_Reducing_GC_and_Faster_Memory_Allocation.html">1551 high scalability-2013-11-20-How Twitter Improved JVM Performance by Reducing GC and Faster Memory Allocation</a></p>

Nice writeup that covers resilience, failover, DB persistence, Distributed caching implementation, OS/Platform restrictions, Ease of implementation, Hardware requirements, Performance, Support package, Code stability, partitioning, Transactional, Replication and consistency.      Terracotta   is Network Attached Memory (NAM) for Java VMs. It provides up to a terabyte of virtual heap for Java applications that spans hundreds of connected JVMs.     NAM is best suited for storing what they call scratch data. Scratch data is defined as object oriented data that is critical to the execution of a series of Java operations inside the JVM, but may not be critical once a business transaction is complete.     The Terracotta Architecture has three components:     Client Nodes - Each client node corresponds to a client node in the cluster which runs on a standard JVM   Server Cluster - java process that provides the clustering intelligence.

<p>Introduction: This guest post is written by  Josh Fraser , co-founder and CEO of  Torbit .  Torbit creates tools for measuring, analyzing and optimizing web performance. Â  
 
Did you know that 5% of the pageviews on Walmart.com take over 20 seconds to load? Walmart discovered this recently after adding real user measurement (RUM) to analyze their web performance for every single visitor to their site. Walmart used JavaScript to measure their median load time as well as key metrics like their 95th percentile. While 20 seconds is a long time to wait for a website to load,  the Walmart story  is actually not that uncommon. Remember, this is the worst 5% of their pageviews, not the typical experience.
 
Walmart's median load time was reported at around 4 seconds, meaning half of their visitors loaded Walmart.com faster than 4 seconds and the other half took longer than 4 seconds to load. Using this knowledge, Walmart was prepared to act. By reducing page load times by even one second, Walmart found that</p><p>5 0.85092276 <a title="364-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-10-Riak%27s_Bitcask_-_A_Log-Structured_Hash_Table_for_Fast_Key-Value_Data.html">971 high scalability-2011-01-10-Riak's Bitcask - A Log-Structured Hash Table for Fast Key-Value Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How would you implement a key-value storage system if you were starting from scratch? The approach Basho settled on with  Bitcask , their new backend for Riak, is an interesting combination of using RAM to store a hash map of file pointers to values and a log-structured file system for efficient writes.  In this excellent  Changelog interview , some folks from Basho describe Bitcask in more detail.
 
The essential Bitcask:
  
 
 Keys are stored in memory for fast lookups. All keys must fit in RAM. 
 Writes are append-only, which means writes are strictly sequential and do not require seeking. Writes are write-through. Every time a value is updated the data file on disk is appended and the in-memory key index is updated with the file pointer. 
 Read queries are satisfied with O(1) random disk seeks. Latency is very predictable if all keys fit in memory because there's no random seeking around through a file. 
 For reads, the file system cache in the kernel is used instead of writing a c</p><p>6 0.85050714 <a title="364-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-14-Google_Says_Cloud_Prices_Will_Follow_Moore%E2%80%99s_Law%3A_Are_We_All_Renters_Now%3F.html">1647 high scalability-2014-05-14-Google Says Cloud Prices Will Follow Moore’s Law: Are We All Renters Now?</a></p>

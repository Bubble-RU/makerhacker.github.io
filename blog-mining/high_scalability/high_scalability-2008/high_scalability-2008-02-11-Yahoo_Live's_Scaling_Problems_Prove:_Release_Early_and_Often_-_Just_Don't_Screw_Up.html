<p>Introduction: Many people in the Apache Hadoop community have asked Yahoo! to publish the version of Apache Hadoop they test and deploy across their large Hadoop clusters. As a service to the Hadoop community, Yahoo is releasing the Yahoo! Distribution of Hadoop -- a source code distribution that is based entirely on code found in the Apache Hadoop project.   This source distribution includes code patches that they have added to improve the stability and performance of their clusters. In all cases, these patches have already been contributed back to Apache, but they may not yet be available in an Apache release of Hadoop.

<p>Introduction: Performance is critical to the success of any web site, and yet today's web applications push browsers to their limits with increasing amounts of rich content and heavy use of Ajax. In his new book  Even Faster Web Sites: Performance Best Practices for Web Developers  , Steve Souders, web performance evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.  Souders' previous book, the bestselling  High Performance Web Sites , shocked the web development world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on the client side. In Even Faster Web Sites, Souders and eight expert contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your site's performance in three critical categories:

<p>Introduction: The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality augmentation, live crab (fresh and local), and live event publishing. One of the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a  broadcaster  and a consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a time shift war. The resources and the engineering needed to make this happened must be substantial. How do you do that?

<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsay  is a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant, but it applies to software development too.
 
You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is there to help.
 
If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say" means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses, belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence a</p><p>3 0.72341609 <a title="244-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-26-7_Years_of_YouTube_Scalability_Lessons_in_30_Minutes.html">1215 high scalability-2012-03-26-7 Years of YouTube Scalability Lessons in 30 Minutes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you started out building a dating site and instead ended up  building a video sharing site (YouTube) that handles 4 billion views a day, then it’s just possible you learned something along the way. And indeed, Mike Solomon, one of the original engineers at YouTube, did learn a lot and he has given a talk about it at   PyCon  :   Scalability at YouTube  .  This isn’t an architecture driven talk where we are led through a description of how a lot of boxes connect to each other. Mike could give that sort of talk. He has worked on building YouTube’s servlet infrastructure, video indexing feature, video transcoding system, their full text search, a CDN, and much more. But instead, he’s taken a step back, took a long look around at what time has wrought, and shared some deep lessons, obviously hard won from experience.  The key takeaway away of the talk for me was doing  a lot with really simple tools . While many teams are moving on to more complex ecosystems, YouTube really does keep it</p><p>4 0.69339734 <a title="244-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-11-Ten_Lessons_from_GitHub%E2%80%99s_First_Year_in_2008.html">1515 high scalability-2013-09-11-Ten Lessons from GitHub’s First Year in 2008</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tom Preston-Werner , GitHub Cofounder, wrote  Ten Lessons from GitHub’s First Year  in 2008. Though the lessons are still relevant, and the war stories behind each lesson are great, I can't help but wonder what a 2013 version would look like?
  
   Start Early -  GitHub created a market that didn't exist. By building early "on top of a nascent technology, we were able to construct a startup with basically no overhead, no competition, and in our free time." 
   Adapt to Your Customers - " Don’t give your customers what they ask for; give them what they want." 
   Have Fun -  "You have to goof off a lot in order to balance things out. Burnout is a real and dangerous phenomenon. " 
   Pay attention to Twitter -  "Twitter [is] an extremely valuable resource for instant feedback." 
   Deploy at Will! -  "The first year of a web offering is a magical one. Your customers are most likely early adopters and love to see new features roll out every few weeks. If this results in a little bit of do</p><p>5 0.68369222 <a title="244-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-18-Robert_Scoble%27s_Rules_for_Successfully_Scaling_Startups.html">352 high scalability-2008-07-18-Robert Scoble's Rules for Successfully Scaling Startups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignant   FriendFeed thread   commiserating PodTech's unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup. Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with them:       Have a story.   Have everyone on board with that story.   If anyone goes off of that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.   Make sure people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.   Work ONLY for a leader who will make the tough decisions.   Build a place where excellence is expected, allowed, and is enabled.   Fire idiots quickly.   If your engineering team can't give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only things that are measured ever get improved.   When your stars aren't listened to the company is in trouble.

<p>Introduction: Update :   Speed up Apache - how I went from F to A in YSlow .  Good example of using YSlow to speed up a website with solid code examples.  Every layer in the multi-layer cake that is your website contributes to how long a page takes to display.  YSlow , from Yahoo, is a cool tool for discovering how the ingredients of your site's top layer contribute to performance.
 
YSlow analyzes web pages and tells you why they're slow based on the rules for high performance web sites. YSlow is a Firefox add-on integrated with the popular Firebug web development tool.   YSlow gives you:

<p>Introduction: I’ve largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the “NoSQL vs. Relational” conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to build in, I’d like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint. In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I’ve inadvertently given myself plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches, and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say with a fair amount of certainty, that I’ve found a good compromise.

<p>Introduction: Tech Crunch chomped down on some initial scaling problems with Yahoo's new live video streaming service   Yahoo Live  . After a bit of chewing on Yahoo's old bones, TC spat out:   If Yahoo cant scale something like this (no matter how much they claim it’s an experiment, it’s still a live service), it shows how far the once brightest star of the online world has fallen  .     This kind of thinking kills innovation. When there's no room for a few hiccups or a little failure you have to cover your ass so completely nothing new will ever see the light of day.        I thought we were supposed to be   agile  . We are supposed to release early and often.  Not every 'i' has to be dotted and not every last router has to be installed before we take the first step of a grand new journey.      Get it out there. Let users help you make it better.

<p>Introduction: Scoble   the Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.     For a strategy hit he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about when making   FeedBlendr  :     One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in designing their architecture.</p><p>5 0.74000835 <a title="244-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-07-Analyzing_billions_of_credit_card_transactions_and_serving_low-latency_insights_in_the_cloud.html">1382 high scalability-2013-01-07-Analyzing billions of credit card transactions and serving low-latency insights in the cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ivan de Prado  and  Pere Ferrera , founders of  Datasalt , the company behind  Pangool  and  Splout SQL  Big Data open-source projects.  
 
The amount of payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and shops for improving their relationship with the market. At  Datasalt  we have developed a system in collaboration with the  BBVA bank  that is able to analyze years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web and mobile applications.
 
The main challenge we faced besides processing Big Data input is that  the output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the input . And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.
 
The solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few tho</p><p>6 0.7367813 <a title="244-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-18-Misco%3A_A_MapReduce_Framework_for_Mobile_Systems_-_Start_of_the_Ambient_Cloud%3F.html">882 high scalability-2010-08-18-Misco: A MapReduce Framework for Mobile Systems - Start of the Ambient Cloud?</a></p>

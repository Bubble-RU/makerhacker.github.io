<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsay  is a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant, but it applies to software development too.
 
You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is there to help.
 
If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say" means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses, belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he does it all over gain just for spite.

What should Robert ask in his scalability interview?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help? Here's Robert's plight:     I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.  It’s on Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.  Look at who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the “don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million users on Facebook in about 10 days.       What would you ask?</p><p>4 0.11371995 <a title="352-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-02-7_Scaling_Strategies_Facebook_Used_to_Grow_to_500_Million_Users.html">870 high scalability-2010-08-02-7 Scaling Strategies Facebook Used to Grow to 500 Million Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Johnson,   a director of engineering at Facebook, celebrated Facebook's monumental achievement of reaching 500 million users by sharing the  scaling principles that helped  reach that milestone. In case you weren't suitably impressed by the 500 million user number, Robert ratchets up the numbers game with these impressive figures:      
 
 1 million users per engineer 
 500 million active users 
 100 billion hits per day 
 50 billion photos 
 2 trillion objects cached, with hundreds of millions of requests per second 
 130TB of logs every day 
 
  
How did Facebook get to this point?
   
  People Matter Most . It's people who build and run systems. The best tools for scaling are an engineering and operations teams that can handle anything. 
  Scale Horizontally . Handling exponentially growing traffic requires spreading load arbitrarily across many machines. Using different databases for tables like accounts and profiles only doubles capacity. This approach hurts efficiency, but</p><p>5 0.090918735 <a title="352-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-19-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_19%2C_2012.html">1344 high scalability-2012-10-19-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 19, 2012</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:
  
  @davilagrau : Youtube, GitHub,..., Are cloud services facing a entropic limit to scalability? 
 Async all the way down?  The Tyranny of the Clock : The cost of logic and memory dominated Turing's thinking, but today, communication rather than logic should dominate our thinking. Clock-free design uses less than half, about 40%, as much energy per addition as its clocked counterpart. We can regain the efficiency of local decision making by revolting against the pervasive beat of an external clock.  
  Why Google Compute Engine for OpenStack . Smart move. Having OpenStack work inside a super charged cloud, in private clouds, and as a bridge between the two ought to be quite attractive to developers looking for some sort of ally for independence. All it will take are a few victories to cement new alliances.

My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.   The trip was more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system, listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of fellow riders. Magical.

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean: can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something useful? 
 
Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often do very little to help front-line developers succeed. 
 
How many ideas break out of academia into industry in computer science?

Sorry, but while wandering dazzled through  Race to the End of the Earth , a fantastic exhibit at the  Royal BC Museum  on the 1911-1912  race to the South Pole  between Norwegian explorer  Roald Amundsen  and British naval officer  Robert Scott , I couldn’t help but think of the two radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.
  I wish I could reproduce the experience of  walking through the exhibit . Plaque after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott’s choices and then nod in agreement with Amundsen’s approach. The core conflict was straight out of any ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet. And Waterfall lost.

<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation  Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation , offers to help us  break free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of autonomous but interconnected machines .  We can do this by  organizing computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.  The abstract from his thesis is : 
  In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected with stateful storage</p><p>2 0.8914355 <a title="352-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-23-Here%27s_a_1300_Year_Old_Solution_to_Resilience_-_Rebuild%2C_Rebuild%2C_Rebuild.html">1636 high scalability-2014-04-23-Here's a 1300 Year Old Solution to Resilience - Rebuild, Rebuild, Rebuild</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are you still the same person?
 
The  Ise Grand Shrine  has been in continuous existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then dismantled.
 
Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that imperative.
 
You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed in each new environment.

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignant   FriendFeed thread   commiserating PodTech's unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup. Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with them:       Have a story.   Have everyone on board with that story.   If anyone goes off of that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.   Make sure people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.   Work ONLY for a leader who will make the tough decisions.   Build a place where excellence is expected, allowed, and is enabled.   Fire idiots quickly.   If your engineering team can't give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only things that are measured ever get improved.   When your stars aren't listened to the company is in trouble.

<p>Introduction: If you are interested in future foward OS designs then you might find  Akaros  worth a look. It's an operating system designed for many-core architectures and large-scale SMP systems, with the goals of:
  
 Providing better support for parallel and high-performance applications 
 Scaling the operating system to a large number of cores  
  
A more indepth explanation of the motiviation behind Akaros can be found in  Improving Per-Node Efﬁciency in the Datacenter with NewOS Abstractions  by Barret Rhoden, Kevin Klues, David Zhu, and Eric Brewer.
 
The abstract:
  We believe datacenters can beneﬁt from more focus on per-node efﬁciency, performance, and predictability, versus the more common focus so far on scalability to a large number of nodes. Improving per-node efﬁciency decreases costs and fault recovery because fewer nodes are required for the same amount of work. We believe that the use of complex, general-purpose operating systems is a key contributing factor to these inefﬁciencies</p><p>5 0.78056216 <a title="352-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-Sharding_and_Connection_Pools.html">532 high scalability-2009-03-11-Sharding and Connection Pools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple (any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and how you resolved it?

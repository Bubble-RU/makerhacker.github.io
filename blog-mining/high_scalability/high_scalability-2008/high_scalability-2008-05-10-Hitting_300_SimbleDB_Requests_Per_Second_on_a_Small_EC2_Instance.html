<p>Introduction: There's not a lot  of talk about application architectures at the process
level. You have your threads, pools of threads, and you have your callback
models. That's about it. Languages/frameworks making a virtue out of simple
models, like Go and Erlang, do so at the price of control. It's difficult to
make a low latency well conditioned application when a power full tool, like
work scheduling, is taken out of the hands of the programmer.But that's not
all there is my friend. We'll dive into different ways an application can be
composed across threads of control.Your favorite language may not give you
access to all the capabilities we are going to talk about, but lately there
has been a sort of revival in considering performance important, especially
for controlling latency variance, so I think it's time to talk about these
kind of issues. When it was do everything in the thread of a web server thread
pool none of these issues really mattered. But now that developers are

<p>Introduction: Update 35:How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational
Database. Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in
order to mimic RDBMS joins:Given the trade off between potential
inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the
latter.Update 34: Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what
that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?Amazon dramatically drops
SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB. This puts
SimpleDB on par withGoogle App Engine. They also announced a few new
features:a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline
uploading of multiple items or attributes. One of the complaints against
SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things.
These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can
store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.Update 33: Amazon announcesElastic

<p>Introduction: InfoQueue has thisexcellent talk by Brian Goetzon the new features being added
to Java SE 7 that will allow programmers to fully exploit our massively multi-
processor future. While the talk is about Java it's really more general than
that and there's a lot to learn here for everyone.Brian starts with a short,
coherent, and compelling explanation of why programmers can't expect to be
saved by ever faster CPUs and why we must learn to exploit the strengths of
multiple core computers to make our software go faster.Some techniques for
exploiting multiple cores are given in an equally short, coherent, and
compelling explanation of why divide and conquer as the secret to multi-core
bliss, fork-join, how the Java approach differs from map-reduce, and lots of
other juicy topics.The multi-core "problem" is only going to get worse. Tilera
founder Anant Agarwalestimates by 2017embedded processors could have 4,096
cores, server CPUs might have 512 cores and desktop chips could use 128 cores.

<p>Introduction: This is an email interview withViktor Klang, Director of Engineering

immensely passionate and knowledgeable.How do you structure your application?
That's the question I explored in the articleBeyond Threads And Callbacks. An
option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful
stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.To remedy my
oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe's Viktor Klang, long time Scala
hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in
answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He's
a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about.I've implemented several
Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO,
service orchestration, failover, etc, so I'm innately skeptical about

<p>Introduction: Hidden in every computer is a hardware backplane for moving signals around.
Hidden in every application are ways of moving messages around and giving code
CPU time to process them. Unhiding those capabilities and making them first
class facilities for the programmer to control is the idea behind
AppBackplane.This goes directly against the trend of hiding everything from
the programmer and doing it all automagically. Which is great, until it
doesn't work. Then it sucks. And the approach of giving the programmer all the
power also sucks, until it's tuned to work together and performance is
incredible even under increasing loads. Then it's great.These are two
different curves going in opposite directions. You need to decide for your
application which curve you need to be on.AppBackplane is an example framework
supporting the multiple application architectures we talked about inBeyond
Threads And Callbacks. It provides a scheduling system that supports
continuous and high loads, meets crit</p><p>6 0.74541759 <a title="317-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-05-Little%E2%80%99s_Law%2C_Scalability_and_Fault_Tolerance%3A_The_OS_is_your_bottleneck._What_you_can_do%3F.html">1591 high scalability-2014-02-05-Littleâ€™s Law, Scalability and Fault Tolerance: The OS is your bottleneck.

<p>Introduction: Deploying, running and monitoring application on a big cluster is a
challenging task. RecentlyHazelcastteam deployed a demo application on Amazon
EC2 platform to show how Hazelcast p2p cluster scales and screen recorded the
entire process from deployment to monitoring.Hazelcast is open source (Apache
License), transactional, distributed caching solution for Java. It is a little
more than a cache though as it provides distributed implementation of map,
multimap, queue, topic, lock and executor service. Details of running 100 node
Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2 can befound here. Make sure towatch the
screencast!</p><p>2 0.96682268 <a title="317-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-02-Stack_Overflow_Makes_Slow_Pages_100x_Faster_by_Simple_SQL_Tuning.html">1032 high scalability-2011-05-02-Stack Overflow Makes Slow Pages 100x Faster by Simple SQL Tuning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good
SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and
make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was
written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in A day in the life of a slow page
at Stack Overflow, where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was
possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for
other pages the improvement was 100x.Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of
his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the
tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:Using theirmini-
profiler it was shown that abadge detail pagewas taking 630.3 ms to load,
298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL
queries for the page and how long each took.From the historical logs, which
are stored inHAProxy on a month-by-month basis, Sam was able to determine this

<p>Introduction: Michael Laing, a Systems Architect at NYTimes, gave thisgreat decriptionof
their use ofRabbitMQ and their overall architecture on the RabbitMQ mailing
list. The closing sentiment marks this as definitely an architecture to learn
from:Although it may seem complex,Fabrik has simple components and is mostly
principles and plumbing. The key point to grasp is that there is no head, no
master, no single point of failure. As I write this I can see components
failing (not RabbitMQ), and we are fixing them so they are more reliable. But
the system doesn't fail, users can connect, and messages are delivered,
regardless - all within design parameters.Since it's short, to the point, and
I couldn't say it better, I'll just reproduce several original sources
here:Just a quick note and thank you to the RabbitMQ team for a great
product.Our premier online offering www.nytimes.com has a new look and new
underpinnings, now including a messaging architecture implemented using
RabbitMQ.This architecture -</p><p>4 0.96125436 <a title="317-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-06-Product%3A_ChironFS.html">143 high scalability-2007-11-06-Product: ChironFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across
data centers, then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so
there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What
isChironFSand how does it work?Adapted from the ChironFS website:The Chiron
Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of
failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using
replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not
FILESYSTEMS.Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it
is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other
server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many
servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become
a real nightmare!</p><p>5 0.95505345 <a title="317-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>

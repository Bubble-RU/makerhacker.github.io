<p>Introduction: This is a hilarious presentation byJosh Berkus, calledScale Fail, given at
O'Reilly MySQL CE 2011. Josh is entertaining, well spoken, and cleverly hides
insight inside chaos. And he makes some dang good points along the way.Josh
has a problem, you see Josh has learned how to make sites that are both
scalable and reliable. So he's puzzled why companies "whose downtime
interfaces (Twitter) are more well known than their uptime interfaces" get all
the attention, respect, and money for being failures. Just doing your job
doesn't make you a hero.  You need these self-inflicted wounds in-order to
have the war stories to share at conferences. They get the attention. Just
doing your job is boring. This is so unfair in that way life can be. So if you
want to turn the tables and take the low road to fame and fortune, here's
Josh's program for learning how not to scale:Be trendy. Use the tool that has
the most buzz: NoSQL, Cloud, MapReduce, Rails, RabbitMQ. It helps you not
scale and the VCs like</p><p>3 0.11090158 <a title="398-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-13-Plenty_of_Fish_Says_Scaling_for_Free_Doesn%27t_Pay.html">442 high scalability-2008-11-13-Plenty of Fish Says Scaling for Free Doesn't Pay</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Plenty of Fish CEO Markus Frind, famous nerd hero for making over $10 million
a year from Google ads on a free dating site he made and ran all by himself,
nowsees a problem with the free model:The problem with free is that every time
you double the size of your database the cost of maintaining the site grows 6
fold. I really underestimated how much resources it would take, I have one
database table now that exceeds 3 billion records. The bigger you get as a
free site the less money you make per visit and the more it costs to service a
visit...There is really no money in being free and we have to start
experimenting with other models now or we won't be able to compete in 3 or 4
years.As one commenter succinctly put it: the"golden time" of AdSense is over.
Time to look at costs. The POF architecture is to run scarily huge tables on
single machines. They also buy and maintain their own SAN. So it seems scaling
up is what is increasing costs and decreasing profits. I wonder if the

<p>Introduction: Solve only 80% of a problem. That's usually good enough and you'll not only
get done faster, you'll actually have a chance of getting done at all.This
strategy is given by Amix inHOW TWITTER (AND FACEBOOK) SOLVE PROBLEMS
PARTIALLY. The idea is solving 100% of a complex problem can be so hard and so
expensive that you'll end up wasting all your bullets on a problem that could
have been satisfactoraly solved in a much simpler way.The example given is for
Twitter's real-time search. Real-time search almost by definition is focussed
on recent events. So in the design should you be able to search historically
back from the beginning of time or should you just be able to search for
recent time periods? A complete historical search is the 100% solution. The
recent data only search is the 80% solution. Which should you choose?breakThe
100% solution is dramatically more difficult to solve. It requires searching
disk in real-time which is a killer. So it makes more sense to work on the 80%

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: What good are problems without solutions? In 42 Monster Problems That Attack
As Loads Increase we talked about problems. In this first post (OK, there was
an earlier post, but I'm doing some reorganizing), we'll cover what I
callaggregation strategies.Keep in mind these are low level architecture type
suggestions of how to structure the components of your code and how they
interact. We're not talking about massive scale-out clusters here, but of what
your applications might like like internally, way below the service level
interface level. There's a lot more to the world than evented
architectures.Aggregation simply means we aren't using stupid queues. Our
queues will be smart. We are deeply aware of queues as containers of work that
eventually dictate how the entire system performs. As work containers we know
intimately what requests and data sit in our queues and we can use that
intelligence to our great advantage.Prioritize WorkThe key idea to it all is

immensely passionate and knowledgeable.How do you structure your application?
That's the question I explored in the articleBeyond Threads And Callbacks. An
option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful
stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.To remedy my
oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe's Viktor Klang, long time Scala
hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in
answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He's
a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about.I've implemented several
Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO,
service orchestration, failover, etc, so I'm innately skeptical about

<p>Introduction: This is a guest posting by Marty Abbott and Michael Fisher, authors ofThe Art
of Scalability. I'm still reading their book and will have an interview with
them a little later.  If 2010 is the year that you've decided to kickoff your
startup or if you've already got something off the ground and are expecting
double or triple digit growth, this list is for you.  We all
wanttheattentionof usersto achieve viral growth but as manycan attest, too
much attention can bring a startup to its knees. If you've used Twitter for
any amount of time you're sure to have seen the "Fail Whale", which is so
often seen that it has its ownfan club. Take a look at the graph below from
Compete.com showing Twitter's unique visitors. One can argue that limitations
in the product offering have as much to do with the flattening of growthover
the past six monthsas does the availability,butit's hard to believe the
inability of users to actually use the service has not hindered growth. What

<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with
our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting
monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously
how Netflix used Chaos Monkey, a tool to test failover handling by
continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been
added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a
problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is
handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this
approach in this very interesting post: The Netflix Simian Army.I know what
you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down
lately. Dmuino addressedthis potential embarrassment, putting all fears of
cloud inferiority to rest:Unfortunately we're not running 100% on the cloud
today. We're working on it, and we could use more help. The latest outage was

<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: Brian Zimmer, architect at travel startup Yapta, highlights some worst
practices jeopardizing the growth and scalability of a system:* The Golden
Hammer. Forcing a particular technology to work in ways it was not intended is
sometimes counter-productive. Using a database to store key-value pairs is one
example. Another example is using threads to program for concurrency.*
Resource Abuse. Manage the availability of shared resources because when they
fail, by definition, their failure is experienced pervasively rather than in
isolation. For example, connection management to the database through a thread
pool.* Big Ball of Mud. Failure to manage dependencies inhibits agility and
scalability.* Everything or Something. In both code and application dependency
management, the worst practice is not understanding the relationships and
formulating a model to facilitate their management. Failure to enforce
diligent control is a contributing scalability inhibiter.* Forgetting to check
the time. To</p><p>3 0.87993443 <a title="398-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_eAccelerator_a_PHP_Accelerator.html">32 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: eAccelerator a PHP Accelerator</a></p>
<p>Introduction: eAcceleratoris a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic
content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in
their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely
eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution.
eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP
code by 1-10 times.</p><p>4 0.82124573 <a title="398-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-16-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_16%2C_2012.html">1210 high scalability-2012-03-16-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 16, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 35:How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational
Database. Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in
order to mimic RDBMS joins:Given the trade off between potential
inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the
latter.Update 34: Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what
that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?Amazon dramatically drops
SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB. This puts
SimpleDB on par withGoogle App Engine. They also announced a few new
features:a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline
uploading of multiple items or attributes. One of the complaints against
SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things.
These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can
store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.Update 33: Amazon announcesElastic

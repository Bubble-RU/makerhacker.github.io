Review, Nicholas Carr writes and speaks on technology, business, and culture.
His provocative 2004 book Does IT Matter? set off a worldwide debate about the
role of computers in business.The Big Switch – Rewiring the World, From Edison
to GoogleCarr's core insight is that the development of the computer and the
Internet remarkably parallels that of the last radically disruptive
technology, electricity. He traces the rapid morphing of electrification from
an in-house competitive advantage to a ubiquitous utility, and how the
business advantage rapidly shifted from the innovators and early adopters to

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.If datacenters are the
new castles, then what will be the new gunpowder? As soon asgunpowdercame on
the scene, castles, which are defensive structures, quickly became the
future's cold, drafty hotels. Gunpowder fueled cannon balls make short work of
castle walls.There's a long history of "gunpowder" type inventions in the tech
industry. PCs took out the timeshare model. The cloud is taking out the PC
model. There must be something that will take out the cloud.Right now it's
hard to believe the cloud will one day be no more. They seem so much the
future, but something will transcend the cloud. We even have a law that says
so:Bell's Law of Computer Classeswhich holds thatroughly every decade a new,
lower priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform,
network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new
industry.Acomputer</p><p>6 0.098937109 <a title="460-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-11-Have_We_Reached_the_End_of_Scaling%3F.html">758 high scalability-2010-01-11-Have We Reached the End of Scaling?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.Have we reached the end
of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The
End of" headlines. We've reachedThe End of Historybecause the Western liberal
democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the
final form of human government." We've reachedThe End of Sciencebecause of the
"fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions."
We've even reachedThe End of Theorybecause all answers can be found in the
continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're
atThe End of the World?Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began
to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?For a while I thought
this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is
because of the slow down of potential articles at

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.Earlier we talked about
how a single botnet could harness more compute power than our largest super
computers. Well, that's just the start of it. The amount of computer power
available to the Ambient Cloud will be truly astounding.2 Billion Personal
ComputersThe number of personal computers is still growing. By 2014 one
estimate is there will be2 billion PCs. That's a giant reservoir of power to
exploit, especially considering these new boxes are stuffed with multiple
powerful processors and gigabytes of memory.7 Billion SmartphonesBy now it's
common wisdom smartphones are the computing platform of the future. It's
plausible to assume the total number ofmobile phonesin use will roughly equal
the number of people on earth. That's 7 billion smartphones.Smartphones aren't

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.If datacenters are the
new castles, then what will be the new gunpowder? As soon asgunpowdercame on
the scene, castles, which are defensive structures, quickly became the
future's cold, drafty hotels. Gunpowder fueled cannon balls make short work of
castle walls.There's a long history of "gunpowder" type inventions in the tech
industry. PCs took out the timeshare model. The cloud is taking out the PC
model. There must be something that will take out the cloud.Right now it's
hard to believe the cloud will one day be no more. They seem so much the
future, but something will transcend the cloud. We even have a law that says
so:Bell's Law of Computer Classeswhich holds thatroughly every decade a new,
lower priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform,
network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new
industry.Acomputer</p><p>6 0.68507797 <a title="460-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_28%2C_2013.html">1484 high scalability-2013-06-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 28, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind. Warning #2: this post is wild.Kevin KellyKevin Kelly is Senior
Maverick at Wired magazine. He helped launch Wired in 1993, and served as its
Executive Editor until January 1999. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers'
Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online
service started in 1985. He authored the best-sellingNew Rules for the New
Economyand the classic book on decentralized emergent systems,Out of

its inhabitants first wire up its innumerable parts to make one large Machine.

<p>Introduction: Election night is a big traffic boost for news and social sites. Yahoo expects
up to 400 million page views on Election Day. Data Center Knowledge has
anexcellent article how various sitesare preparing to handle spikes in
election night traffic. Some interesting bits:Prepare ahead. Don't wait to
handle spikes, plan and prepare before the blessed event.Use a CDN. Daily Kos
puts images on a CDN, but the dynamic nature of their site means the can't use
CDN for their other content.Scale up. Daily Kos "to handle the traffic better,
we moved to a cluster of six quad core Xeons with 8GB RAM for webheads that
all boot off a central NFS (Network File System) root, with the capability of
adding more webheads as needed," . They also "added two 16GB eight-core Xeons
and a 6Ă&mdash;73GB RAID-10 array for database files running a MySQL master/slave
setup."Add Cache. Daily Kos added 1GB instances memcached to each
webhead.Change Caching Strategy. Daily Kos puts fully rendered pages into

<p>Introduction: In the past year, Intel issued a series of powerful chips under the new
Nehalem microarchitecture, with large numbers of cores and extensive memory
capacity. This new class of chips is is part of a bigger Intel initiative
referred to as Tera-Scale Computing. Cisco has released their Unified
Computing System (UCS) equipped with a unique extended memory and high speed
network within the box, which is specifically geared to take advantage of this
type of CPU architecture .This new class of hardware has the potential to
revolutionize the IT landscape as we know it.In  this post, I want to focus
primarily on the potential implications on application architecture, more
specifically on the application platform landscape.  more...</p><p>6 0.83862191 <a title="460-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Product%3A_Facebook%27s_Cassandra_-_A_Massive_Distributed_Store.html">649 high scalability-2009-07-02-Product: Facebook's Cassandra - A Massive Distributed Store</a></p>

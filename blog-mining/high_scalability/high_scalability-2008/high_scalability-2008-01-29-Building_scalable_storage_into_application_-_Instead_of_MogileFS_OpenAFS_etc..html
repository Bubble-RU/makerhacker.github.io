<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>3 0.14556652 <a title="229-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-30-Pomegranate_-_Storing_Billions_and_Billions_of_Tiny_Little_Files.html">889 high scalability-2010-08-30-Pomegranate - Storing Billions and Billions of Tiny Little Files</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pomegranateis a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular
storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at
increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support
applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high
concurrency, high throughput, and low latency. Their tests seem to indicate it
works:We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well
for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observedlinearly
increased more than100,000aggregate read and write requests served per second
(RPS). Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V
store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system
API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use.
Every application could use it out of the box.The features of Pomegranate
are:It handles billions of small files efficiently, even in one directory;It

<p>Introduction: Hello everybody!I am a developer of a website with a lot of traffic. Right now
we are managing the whole website using perl + postgresql + fastcgi +
memcached + mogileFS + lighttpd + roundrobin DNS distributed over 5 servers
and I must say it works like a charm, load is stable and everything works very
fast and we are recording about 8 million pageviews per day.The only problem
is with postgres database since we have it installed only on one server and if
this server goes down, the whole "cluster" goes down. That's why we have a
master2slave replication so we still have a backup database except that when
the master goes down, all inserts/updates are disabled so the whole website is
just read only.But this is not a problem since this configuration is working
for us and we don't have any problems with it.Right now we are planning to
build our own analytics service that would be customized for our needs. We
tried various different software packages but were not satisfied with any of
them.</p><p>5 0.12393563 <a title="229-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-07-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Web_asset_server_concept_-_3rd_party_software_available%3F.html">1402 high scalability-2013-02-07-Ask HighScalability: Web asset server concept - 3rd party software available?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>6 0.12312539 <a title="229-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Sync_data_on_all_servers.html">98 high scalability-2007-09-18-Sync data on all servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi. I'm looking for a way to share files between EC2 nodes. Currently we are
using glusterfs to do this. It has been reliable recently, but in the past it
has crashed under high load and we've had trouble starting it up again. We've
only been able to restart it by removing the files, restarting the cluster,
and filing it up again with our files from backup. This takes ages, and will
take even longer the more files we get.What worries me is that it seems to
make each node a point of failure for the entire system. One node crashes and
soon the entire cluster has crashed. The other problem is adding another node.
It seems like you have to take down the whole thing, reconfigure to include
the new node, and restart. This kind of defeats the horizontal scaling
strategy.We are using 2 EC2 instances as web servers, 1 as a DB master, and 1
as a slave. GlusterFS is installed on the web server machines as well as the
DB slave machine (we backup files to s3 from this machine). The files are
mostly</p><p>3 0.8081525 <a title="229-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Sync_data_on_all_servers.html">98 high scalability-2007-09-18-Sync data on all servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have a few apache servers ( arround 11 atm ) serving a small amount of data
( arround 44 gigs right now ).For some time I have been using rsync to keep
all the content equal on all servers, but the amount of data has been growing,
and rsync takes a few too much time to "compare" all data from source to
destination, and create a lot of I/O.I have been taking a look at MogileFS, it
seems a good and reliable option, but as the fuse module is not finished, we
should have to rewrite all our apps, and its not an option atm.Any ideas?I
just want a "real time, non resource-hungry" solution alternative for rsync.
If I get more features on the way, then they are welcome :)Why I prefer to use
a Distributed File System instead of using NAS + NFS?- I need 2 NAS, if I dont
want a point of failure, and NAS hard is expensive.- Non-shared hardware, all
server has their own local disks.- As files are replicated, I can save a lot
of money, RAID is not a MUST.Thnx in advance for your help and sorry for</p><p>4 0.7949453 <a title="229-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed_content_system_with_bandwidth_balancing.html">605 high scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed content system with bandwidth balancing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've been trying to find a high availability file storage solution without
success. I tried GlusterFS which looks very promising but experienced problems
with stability and don't want something I can't easily control and rely on.
Other solutions are too complicated or have a SPOF.So I'm thinking of the
following setup:Two NFS servers, a primary and a warm backup. The primary
server will be rsynced with the warm backup every minute or two. I can do it
so frequently as a PHP script will know which directories have changed
recently from a database and only rsync those. Both servers will be NFS
mounted on a cluster of web servers as /mnt/nfs-primary (sym linked as
/home/websites) and /mnt/nfs-backup.I'll then use Ucarp
(http://www.ucarp.org/project/ucarp) to monitor both NFS servers availability
every couple of seconds and when one goes down, the Ucarp up script will be
set to change the symbolic link on all web servers for the /home/websites dir
from /mnt/nfs-primary to /mnt/nfs-backupThe</p><p>6 0.72939181 <a title="229-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-07-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Web_asset_server_concept_-_3rd_party_software_available%3F.html">1402 high scalability-2013-02-07-Ask HighScalability: Web asset server concept - 3rd party software available?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am planning the scaling of a hosted service, similar to typepad etc. and
would appreciate feedback on my plan so far.Looking into scaling storage, I
have come accross MogileFS and OpenAFS. My concern with these is I am not at
all experienced with them and as the sole tech guy I don't want to build
something into this hosting service that proves complex to update and
adminster.So, I'm thinking of building replication and scalability right into
the application, in a similar but simplified way to how MogileFS works (I
think).So, for our database table of uploaded files, here's how it currently
looks (simplified):fileid (pkey)filenameowneridFor adding the replication and
scalability, I would add a few more
columns:serveroneidservertwoidserverthreeids3At the time the user uploads a
file, it will go to a specific server (managed by the application) and the id
of that server will be placed in the "serverone" column. Then hourly or so, a
cron job will run through the "files" table, and copy</p><p>2 0.91439104 <a title="229-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-04-Manage_Downtime_Risk_by_Connecting_Multiple_Data_Centers_into_a_Secure_Virtual_LAN.html">266 high scalability-2008-03-04-Manage Downtime Risk by Connecting Multiple Data Centers into a Secure Virtual LAN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:VcubeV- an OpenVPN-based solution designed to build and operate a
multisourced infrastructure.True high availability requires a presence in
multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation
like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys
can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers. Cloud
computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling
the playing field. Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk
by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost, Mosso and other
providers.The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk
amongst the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy
Samovskiy in his Linux Journal article titledBuilding aMultisourced
Infrastructure Using OpenVPN.breakDmitriy's idea is to create a secure UDP
tunnel between different data centers over public internet links so your

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed

<p>Introduction: Matt Aslett from the 451 group created a term called"NewSQL". On the
definition of NewSQL, Aslett writes:"NewSQL" is our shorthand for the various
new scalable/high performance SQL database vendors. We have previously
referred to these products as 'ScalableSQL' to differentiate them from the
incumbent relational database products. Since this implies horizontal
scalability, which is not necessarily a feature of all the products, we
adopted the term 'NewSQL' in the new report.And to clarify, like NoSQL, NewSQL
is not to be taken too literally: the new thing about the NewSQL vendors is
the vendor, not the SQL.As with NoSQL, under the NewSQL umbrella you can see
various providers, with various solutions.I think these can be divided into
several sub-types:New MySQL storage engines. These give MySQL users the same
programming interface, but scale very well. You can Xeround or Akiban in this
field. The good part is that you still use MySQL, but on the downside it's not

<p>Introduction: "I'll never need to scale so why bother? We aren't Twitter or Facebook or
Google after all." This is the most common email I get, a question in the form
of a thinly disguised rationalization for not having to worry about scaling.
And in these days of giant transformer-like machines they are probably right.
But what if there areBarry Bonds enhancing type forces at work that argue for
the chances of your needing to scale being higher than you think?And if that
happens, how will you cross the scalability chasm? Will you want to completely
change your architecture or evolve it from a tool-chain that was meant to
scale from the start? Architecturally, that's the question you have to answer.
Today's tool-chains are making it possible to grow a system from small to
large without needing to implement complete architectural phase changes at
various scale inflection points, but that's a different topic. We're trying to
think about why you may actually need to scale, that is the question.Tumblr i</p><p>6 0.90265167 <a title="229-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-01-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_April_1%2C_2010.html">802 high scalability-2010-04-01-Hot Scalability Links for April 1, 2010</a></p>

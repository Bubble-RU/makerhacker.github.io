<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage
of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with
CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable

<p>Introduction: Skypeuses PostgreSQL as their backend database. PostgreSQL doesn't get enough
run in the database world so I was excited to see how PostgreSQL is used "as
the main DB for most of [Skype's] business needs." Their approach is to use a
traditional stored procedure interface for accessing data and on top of that
layer proxy servers which hash SQL requests to a set of database servers that
actually carry out queries. The result is a horizontally partitioned system
that they think will scale to handle 1 billion users.Skype's goal is an
architecture that can handle 1 billion plus users. This level of scale isn't
practically solvable with one really big computer, so our masked superhero
horizontal scaling comes to the rescue.Hardware is dual or quad Opterons with
SCSI RAID.Followed common database progression: Start with one DB. Add new
databases partitioned by functionality. Replicate read-mostly data for better
read access. Then horizontally partition data across multiple nodes..In a

<p>Introduction: nginx is a high performance smtp/pop/imap proxy that lets you do custom
authorization and lookups and is very scalable. (just add nodes)Nginx by
default is a reverse proxy and this is what it is doing here for pop/imap
connections. It is also an excellelent reverse proxy for web
servers.Advantage: You dont have to have a speacial database or ldap schema.
Just an url to do auth and lookup with.A url that may be accessed by a unix or
a tcp socket. Write your own auth handler - according to your own policy.For
example:A user called atif tries to login with the pass testxyz.You pass this
infomation to a URL such assocket:/var/tmp/xyz.sockorhttp://auth.corp.mailserv
er.net:someport/someurlThe auth server replies with either a FAILURE such

Proxy articles all over the place. It's like those "get rich quick" books that
say all you have to do is visualize a giraffe with a big yellow dot
superimposed over it and by sympathetic magic giraffes will suddenly stampede
into your life. Without realizing it I must have visualized transparent
proxies smothered in yellow dots.One of the brightest images is a wonderful
series of articles by Peter Romianowski describing the evolution of their
proxy architecture. Their application is an OLTP system executing 200 million

<p>Introduction: Performance guruSteve Souders gave his keynote presentation, Cache is King!
(slides), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of
how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get
the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results
on what gave the best web site performance improvements.In his base line test,
page loads took 7.65 seconds (median of three runs). What change--Fast
Network, No Javascript, or Primed Cache--would make the biggest performance
improvement? It was Primed Cache.Fast Network - Using a fast FIOS network the
load time was 4.13 seconds. Steve was surprised how big a difference this
made, given how much work must happen in the browser. No JavaScript - 4.74
seconds after disabling JavaScript. Both reduces transfers and skips parsing
by the browser. Steve thought the effect would have been larger.Primed Cache-

interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from
Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and
work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn
in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting
the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-
in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer
specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed
development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and
reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5 second procedure;
capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git
for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem;

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post fromPer Buer, founder and CEO of Varnish Software,
provider of Varnish Cache, an open source web application accelerator freely
available at varnish-cache.org. Varnish powers a lot of really big websites
worldwide.We at Varnish Software are all about speed. Varnish Cache is built
for speed. It executes its policy code more or less a thousand times faster
than your typical Java or PHP based application servers, mostly due to the
fact that the configuration is compiled into system call free machine
code.System calls require expensive context switches, stall the CPU and wreck
havoc in the CPU cache so avoiding them makes the code fly. There are strong
limitations on what kind of logic you can move into Varnish Cache, but the
logic that you do move there will run very fast.An example is using Varnish
for access control to serve access controlled content from the caching edge
layer.The Varnish PaywallWho gets to access your content? In a traditional
environment the cach</p><p>5 0.67425019 <a title="353-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-28-A_Practical_Guide_to_Varnish_-_Why_Varnish_Matters.html">996 high scalability-2011-02-28-A Practical Guide to Varnish - Why Varnish Matters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeff Sufrom Factual.What is Varnish?Varnishis an open
source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack
and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for
both static and dynamic content.One great thing about Varnish is that it can
improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.
If you haven't heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven't used it),
please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive,
but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish's more advanced
features, you'll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.Some
of the high profile companies using Varnish include: Twitter, Facebook, Heroku
and LinkedIn.Our Use CaseOne of Factual's first high profile projects was

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly

<p>Introduction: Given S3'srecent failure(Cloud Statustells the tale)Kevin Burtonmakes
theexcellent suggestion of fronting S3with acaching proxy server.A caching
proxy servercan reply to service requests without contacting the specified
server, by retrieving content saved from a previous request, made by the same
client or even other clients. This is called caching. Caching proxies keep
local copies of frequently requested resources.In normal operation when an
asset (a user's avatar, for example) is requested the cache is tried first. If
the asset is found in the cache then it's returned. If the asset is not in the
cache it's retrieved from S3 (or wherever) and cached. So when S3 goes down
it's likely you can ride out the down time by serving assets out of the
cache.This strategy only works when using S3 as aCDN. If you are using S3 for
its "real" purpose, as a storage service, then a caching proxy can't help
you...breakAmazon doesn't used S3 as a CDN eitherAmazon Not Building Out AWS

<p>Introduction: Release It!authorMichael Nygard tells a tale of two web sites, both brought
low by unexpectedly huge unbounded results sets that slowed down their sites
to the speed of a Christmas checkout line.I've committed this error more than
a few times. During testing the results sets are often small, so you don't see
problems. Or when a product is new you don't have a lot of data so everything
is fine, until some magic line is crossed and you get that dreaded 2AM fix it
call.breakMy most embarrassing bug of this type caused a rather spectacular
failure at a customer site as the variance in response times was out of spec
and this kicked in penalty clauses. What happened was the customer had a
larger network than we could even test (customers always get the good stuff).
I took a lock and went to get all the data. Because the result set was so much
larger in their larger system I took the lock for many more milliseconds than
I should have.

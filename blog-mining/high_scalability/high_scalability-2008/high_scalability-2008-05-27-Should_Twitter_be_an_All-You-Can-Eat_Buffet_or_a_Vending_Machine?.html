<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsayis a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on
software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant,
but it applies to software development too.You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on
one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying
to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show
Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few
heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant
owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is
there to help.If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay
is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say"
means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses,
belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he
does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence at

<p>Introduction: Now that the internet has become defined as a mashup over a collection of
service APIs, we have a little problem: for clients using APIs is a lot like
drinking beer through a straw. You never get as much beer as you want and you
get a headache after. But what if I've been a good boy and deserve a bigger
straw? Maybe we can use game theory to model trust relationships over a life
time of interactions over many different services and then give more
capabilities/beer to those who have earned them?breakLet's say Twitter limits
me to downloading only 20 tweets at a time through their API. But I want more.
I may even want to do something so radical as download all my tweets. Of
course Twitter can't let everyone do that. They would be swamped serving all
this traffic and service would be denied. So Twitter does that rational thing
and limits API access as a means of self protection. As does Google,
Yahoo,Skynet, and everyone else.But when I hit the API limit I think, but hey

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose
limits (GAE Quotas,Fotolog,Facebook) as a means of protecting a website
against service destroyingtraffic spikes. Twitter will reportedlylimit the
number followersto 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow
Twitter to make some bank bygoing freemiumand charging for adding more
followers.Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting
aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established
ecosystem?One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let
everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is,
however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are
will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service.
Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.Now in Twitter's
case the people with the most followers tend to be opinion leaderswho shape

My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

Distributed Computing.Achieving highest possible scalability is a complex

that can be used to make a system highly scalable.The Scalability Pattern

<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>4 0.86433482 <a title="330-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-17-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_17%2C_2010.html">860 high scalability-2010-07-17-Hot Scalability Links for July 17, 2010</a></p>

resourcesare spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work
with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but
does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data

<p>Introduction: Om proposes one solution to theTwitter Problemis tolimit followersto three
square meals a day. The reasonable idea being that lower limits should mean
fewer scaling problems. And as a kicker raising those limits is a good way to
raise much needed revenue.Scoble thinks users shouldconsume without limitand
will drive to another buffet if all-you-can-eat privileges are revoked. The
reasonable idea being that if an internet service can't solve internet scale
problems then there's not much use for it.Dave sayscomp power users a top
floor suiteand shower them with free passes to the buffet. Let the good times
roll! The reasonable idea being that power users help create popular
restaurants, er, services in the first place and limiting them starves users
and starved users won't come back.So, should web services like Twitter be a
buffet, a fixed eight course fine dining experience, a small plate restaurant,
a family style joint, or a vending machine? Or something else entirely?In a

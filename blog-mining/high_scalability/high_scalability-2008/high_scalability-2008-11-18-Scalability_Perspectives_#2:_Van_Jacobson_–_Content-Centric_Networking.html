<p>Introduction: It's called "east-west" networking, which when compared to its predecessor,
"north-south" networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane winds and
tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation between the
transformative shift this change in networking patterns has on the data center
with that of El Ni単o's transformative power upon the weather patterns across
the globe.Traditionally, data center networks have focused on North-South
network traffic. The assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly
communicate with servers at the core, rather than across the network to other
clients.But server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual
appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical
infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with workloads
moving to different physical locations on the network as virtual servers are
migrated (in the case of data center networks) and clients move about the

<p>Introduction: InA Brief History of the Internetit was revealed that the Internet wasbased on
the idea that there would be multiple independent networks of rather arbitrary
design. The Internet as we now know it embodies a key underlying technical
idea, namely that of open architecture networking. In this approach, the
choice of any individual network technology was not dictated by a particular
network architecture but rather could be selected freely by a provider and
made to interwork with the other networks through a meta-level
"Internetworking Architecture".  With the cloud we are in the same situation
today, just a layer or two higher up the stack. We have independent clouds
that we would like to connect and work seamlessly together, preferably with
the ease at which we currently connect nodes to a network and networks to the
Internet. This technology seems to be called theIntercloud: an interconnected
global "cloud ofclouds" as apposed to theInternetwhich is a "network of
networks."Vinton Cerf,p</p><p>5 0.10453469 <a title="446-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-24-Scalability_Perspectives_%233%3A_Marc_Andreessen_%E2%80%93_Internet_Platforms.html">450 high scalability-2008-11-24-Scalability Perspectives #3: Marc Andreessen – Internet Platforms</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like?
Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing.
Specifically the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group(IPNSIG
).Ansible-likefaster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical
warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning
telegraph system.It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more
interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that
was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances
and with muchlonger delays:The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also
called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a
set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2]
Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances,
so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to
large delays and errors.[2] While the In</p><p>3 0.82430124 <a title="446-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN_is_Not_a_Silver_Bullet_for_Network_Scalability.html">1256 high scalability-2012-06-04-OpenFlow-SDN is Not a Silver Bullet for Network Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ivan Pepelnjak(CCIE#1354 Emeritus) is Chief Technology Advisor atNIL Data
Communications,author of numerous webinarsandadvanced networking books, and
aprolific blogger. He's focusing on data center and cloud networking, network
virtualization, and scalable application design.OpenFlow is an interesting
emerging networking technology appearingseemingly out of nowhere with much
hype and fanfarein March 2011. More than a year later, there are two
commercial products based on OpenFlow (NEC's Programmable FlowandNicira's
Network Virtualization Platform) and probably less than a dozen production-
grade implementations (includingGoogle's G-Scale networkandIndiana
University's campus network). Is this an expected result for an emerging
technology or another case of overhyped technology hitting limits imposed by
reality?OpenFlow-based solutions have to overcome numerous problems every
emerging technology is facing, in OpenFlow's case ranging from compatibility

<p>Introduction: Update:as of the end of Q2 2011,Akamai had 95,811servers deployed
globally.Akamai is the CDN to the stars. It claims to deliver between 15 and
30 percent of all Web traffic, with major customers like Facebook, Twitter,
Apple, and the US military. Traditionally quite secretive, we get a peek
behind the curtain in this paper: The Akamai Network: A Platform for High-
Performance Internet Applications by Erik Nygren, Ramesh Sitaraman, and
Jennifer Sun. Abstract:Comprising more than 61,000 servers located across
nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers
hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of
enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet
applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the components and
capabilities of this large-scale distributed computing platform, and offer

<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday
you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is
technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient
and made the diagnosis. What did they find?Diagnostic team: the Packet Pushers
gang (Greg Ferro,Jan Zorz,Ivan Pepelnjak) in the podcast How We Are Killing
the Internet.Diagnosis: invasive tunnelation. (tubes anyone?)Prognosis: even
Dr. House might not be able to help.Cure: go back to what the Internet was;
kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything;
disrupt the telcos.This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--
but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's
where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder,
tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's
all being carried out on battlefield few get to see: the infrastructure of
Internet.Ou</p><p>6 0.7787205 <a title="446-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-02-How_Will_DIDO_Wireless_Networking_Change_Everything%3F.html">1091 high scalability-2011-08-02-How Will DIDO Wireless Networking Change Everything?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>2 0.90104908 <a title="446-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-29-Digg_-_Looking_to_the_Future_with_Cassandra.html">732 high scalability-2009-10-29-Digg - Looking to the Future with Cassandra</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Digg has been researching ways to scale our database infrastructure for some
time now. We've adopted a traditional vertically partitioned master-slave
configuration with MySQL, and also investigated sharding MySQL with IDDB.
Ultimately, these solutions left us wanting. In the case of the traditional
architecture, the lack of redundancy on the write masters is painful, and both
approaches have significant management overhead to keep running.Since it was
already necessary to abandon data normalization and consistency to make these
approaches work, we felt comfortable looking at more exotic, non-relational
data stores. After considering HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, Tokyo
Cabinet/Tyrant, Voldemort, and Dynomite, we settled on Cassandra.Each system
has its own strengths and weaknesses, but Cassandra has a good blend of
everything. It offers column-oriented data storage, so you have a bit more
structure than plain key/value stores. It operates in a distributed, highly
available, peer-to-pee</p><p>3 0.90033597 <a title="446-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_SmarterStats.html">45 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: SmarterStats</a></p>

Previews team, giving some fascinating inside details on how Google

Strategy: Biggest Performance Impact Is To Reduce The Number Of HTTP Requests
and one of the major ideas behind the design Instant Previews is to reduce the
number of HTTP requests through a few well chosen tricks. Cosmic!Some of what
Google does to reduce HTTP requests:Data URIs, which are are base64 encodings
of image data, are used instead of static images that are served from the
server. This means the whole preview can be pieced together from image slices
in one request as both the data and the image are returned in the same
request. Google found thateven though base64 encoding adds about 33% to the
size of the image, tests showed that gzip-compressed data URIs are comparable

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Van JacobsonVan Jacobson is a Research Fellow atPARC. Prior to
that he was Chief Scientist and co-founder of Packet Design. Prior to that he
was Chief Scientist at Cisco. Prior to that he was head of the Network
Research group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He's been studying
networking since 1969. He still hopes that someday something will start to
make sense.Scaling the Internet – Does the Net needs an upgrade?As the
Internet is being overrun with video traffic, many wonder if it can survive.

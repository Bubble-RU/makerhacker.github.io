<p>Introduction: GridGain   was kind enough to present at the September 17th instance of  the   Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group  . I've been curious about GridGain so I was glad to see them there. In short GridGain is:   an open source computational grid framework that enables Java developers to improve general performance of processing intensive applications by splitting and parallelizing the workload  . GridGain can also be thought of as a set of middleware primitives for building applications. GridGain's peer group of competitors includes GigaSpaces, Terracotta, Coherence, and Hadoop.     The speaker for GridGain was the President and Founder, Nikita Ivanov. He has a very pleasant down-to-earth way about him that contrasts nicely with a field given to religious discussions of complex taxomic definitions. Nikita first talked about cloud computing in general. He feels Java is the perfect gateway for cloud computing. Which is good because   GridGain only works with Java  .

<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective, flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute- and data-intensive applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory, and delivers 47.38 trillion1 floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS) of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future. This Sun BluePrints article provides an overview of the Tokyo Tech grid, named TSUBAME.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: Summary    In this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out model.          Bio    Nati Shalom is the CTO and Founder of   GigaSpaces   and responsible for the technology roadmap.

<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective, flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute and data-intensive applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory, and delivers 47.38 trillion floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS) of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future.     This article provides an overview of the Tokyo Tech grid, named TSUBAME.

<p>Introduction: From their website:    FAI  is an automated installation tool to install or deploy Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat, autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used for configuration management of a running system.  You can take one or more virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed, configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized management system for your Linux deployment.  
   
  FAI's target group are system administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a rendering farm,</p><p>2 0.92343444 <a title="395-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-31-Pud_is_the_Anti-Stack_-_Windows%2C_CFML%2C_Dropbox%2C_Xeround%2C_JungleDisk%2C_ELB.html">1108 high scalability-2011-08-31-Pud is the Anti-Stack - Windows, CFML, Dropbox, Xeround, JungleDisk, ELB</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pud of  f*ckedcomany.com  (FC) fame, a favorite site of the dot bomb era, and a site I absolutely loved until my company became featured, has given us a look at his backend:  Why Must You Laugh At My Back End . For those whose don't remember FC's history, TechCrunch published a  fitting eulogy :
  

[FC] first went live in 2000, chronicling failing and troubled companies in its unique and abrasive style after the dot com bust. Within a year it had a massive audience and was getting serious mainstream press attention. As the startup economy became better in 2004, much of the attention the site received went away. But a large and loyal audience remains at the site, coming back day after day for its unique slant on the news. At its peak, FC had 4 million unique monthly visitors.

  
Delightfully, FC was not a real-names kind of site. Hard witty cynicism ruled and not a single cat picture was in sight. It was a blast of fun when all around was the enclosing dark.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ben Bromhead  from  Instaclustr  
 
 
 
Deciding to use a managed NoSQL datastore is a great step in ensuring you run a fast, scalable and resilient application without needing to be an expert in highly available architecture. How do you know which technology is the best for your application? How do you know whether the provider's performance claims are true? You are putting your application on someone else’s infrastructure and that requires some hard answers about their claims.
 
To determine the suitability of a provider, your first port of call is to benchmark. Choosing a service provider is often done in a number of stages. First is to shortlist providers based on capabilities and claimed performance, ruling out those that do not meet your application requirements. Second is to look for benchmarks conducted by third parties, if any. The final stage is to benchmark the service yourself.
 
In this article we will show you how to run some preliminary benchmark</p><p>same-blog 4 0.90899479 <a title="395-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-25-Is_your_cloud_as_scalable_as_you_think_it_is%3F.html">395 high scalability-2008-09-25-Is your cloud as scalable as you think it is?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An unstated assumption is that clouds are scalable. But are they? Stick thousands upon thousands of machines together and there are a lot of potential bottlenecks just waiting to choke off your scalability supply. And if the cloud is scalable what are the chances that your application is really linearly scalable? At 10 machines all may be well. Even at 50 machines the seas look calm. But at 100, 200, or 500 machines all hell might break loose. How do you know?     You know through real life testing. These kinds of tests are brutally hard and complicated. who wants to do all the incredibly precise and difficult work of producing cloud scalability tests?   GridDynamics   has stepped up to the challenge and has just released their   Cloud Performance Reports  .       The report is quite detailed so I'll just cover what I found most interesting. GridDynamics in this report test three configurations:           GridGain  running a Monte-Carlo simulation on EC2 . This test is a CPU only test,</p><p>5 0.88849658 <a title="395-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-15-Video%3A_Dryad%3A_A_general-purpose_distributed_execution_platform.html">155 high scalability-2007-11-15-Video: Dryad: A general-purpose distributed execution platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dryad is Microsoft's answer to Google's  map-reduce . What's the question: How do you process really large amounts of data? My initial impression of Dryad is it's like a giant Unix command line filter on steroids. There are lots of inputs, outputs, tees, queues, and merge sorts all connected together by a master exec program.  What else does Dryad have to offer the scalable infrastructure wars?
 
Dryad models programs as the execution of a directed acyclic graph. Each vertex is a program and edges are typed communication channels (files, TCP pipes, and shared memory channels within a process). Map-reduce uses a different model. It's more like a large distributed sort where the programmer defines functions for mapping, partitioning, and reducing.  Each approach seems to borrow from the spirit of its creating organization. The graph approach seems a bit too complicated and map-reduce seems a bit too simple. How ironic, in the Alanis Morissette sense.   Dryad is a middleware layer that ex</p><p>6 0.88336474 <a title="395-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-01-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Oct_1%2C_2010.html">913 high scalability-2010-10-01-Hot Scalability Links For Oct 1, 2010</a></p>

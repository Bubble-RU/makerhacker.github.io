<p>Introduction: Reducing the costs of IT infrastructure and improving the manageability and
efficiency of web services pose significant challenges for many organizations
in today's economic climate. Recent studies describe the challenges IT
managers face administering the proliferation of x86-based servers used to run
web services applications. Those reports reveal that using large number of
x86-based systems can increase space and power consumption, as well as cost
and asset management overhead. In addition, many of these x86-based systems
run a mixture of operating system and application software leading to
increased management complexity and potential security concerns.Faced with
these challenges, many organizations are attracted by the idea of
consolidating web and application services from multiple x86-based servers to
a smaller number of high-performance servers. This approach strives to help
simplify management, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of
delivering web services. The co</p><p>3 0.21996839 <a title="454-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-15-Hadoop_-_A_Primer.html">414 high scalability-2008-10-15-Hadoop - A Primer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hadoop is a distributed computing platform written in Java. It incorporates
features similar to those of theGoogle File System and of MapReduce to process
vast amounts of data"Hadoop is a Free Java software framework that supports
data intensive distributed applications running on large clusters of commodity
computers. It enables applications to easily scale out to thousands of nodes
and petabytes of data" (Wikipedia)* What platform does Hadoop run on?* Java

<p>Introduction: From their website:FAIis an automated installation tool to install or deploy
Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a
Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat,
autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used
for configuration management of a running system.You can take one or more
virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction
necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your
computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized
management system for your Linux deployment.breakFAI's target group are system
administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of
computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general
purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a
rendering farm, a web server</p><p>5 0.11813366 <a title="454-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL_clustering_strategies_and_comparisions.html">196 high scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL clustering strategies and comparisions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues
of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well
documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an
insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has
managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!,
maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at
conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing
major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of
their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High
Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in
depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn
practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information
that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life
environments. And you</p><p>5 0.7436465 <a title="454-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL_clustering_strategies_and_comparisions.html">196 high scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL clustering strategies and comparisions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: MySQL™ database, an open source database, delivers high performance and
reliability while keeping costs low by eliminating licensing fees. The
Solaris™ Cluster product is an integrated hardware and software environment
that can be used to create highly-available data services. This article
explains how to deploy the MySQL database in a Solaris Cluster environment.
The article addresses the following topics:* "Advantages of Deploying MySQL
Database with Solaris Cluster" on page 1 discusses the benefits provided by a
Solaris Cluster deployment of the MySQL database.* "Overview of Solaris
Cluster" on page 2 provides a high-level description of the hardware and
software components of the Solaris Cluster.* "Installation and Configuration"
on page 8 explains the procedure for deploying the MySQL database on a Solaris
Cluster.This article assumes that readers have a basic understanding of
Solaris Cluster and MySQL database installation and administration.</p><p>2 0.8447184 <a title="454-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-07-Paper%3A_A_Co-Relational_Model_of_Data_for_Large_Shared_Data_Banks.html">1018 high scalability-2011-04-07-Paper: A Co-Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let's play a quick game of truth or sacrilage: are SQL and NoSQL are really
just two sides of the same coin? That's what Erik Meijerand Gavin Bierman
would have us believe in their "we can all get along and make a lot of money"
article in the Communications of the ACM,A Co-Relational Model of Data for
Large Shared Data Banks. You don't believe it? It's math, so it must be true
:-) Some key points:In this article we present a mathematical data model for
the most common noSQL databases--namely, key/value relationships--and
demonstrate that this data model is the mathematical dual of SQL's relational
data model of foreign-/primary-key relationships...we believe that our
categorical data-model formalization and monadic query language will allow the
same economic growth to occur for coSQL key-value stores....In contrast to
common belief, the question of big versus small data is orthogonal to the
question of SQL versus coSQL. While the coSQL model naturally supports extreme
sharding, the fac</p><p>3 0.8279627 <a title="454-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-26-Google_Pro_Tip%3A_Use_Back-of-the-envelope-calculations_to_Choose_the_Best_Design.html">978 high scalability-2011-01-26-Google Pro Tip: Use Back-of-the-envelope-calculations to Choose the Best Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you know which is the "best" design for a given problem? If, for
example, you were given the problem of generating an image search results page
of 30 thumbnails, would you load images sequentially? In parallel? Would you
cache? How would you decide?If you could harness thepower of the multiverseyou
could try every possible option in the design space and see which worked best.
But that's crazy impractical, isn't it?Another option is to consider theorder
of various algorithm alternatives. As a prophet for the Golden Age
ofComputational Thinking, Google would definitely do this, but what else might
Google do?Use Back-of-the-envelope Calculations to Evaluate Different
DesignsJeff Dean, Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry--
instrumental in many of Google's key systems: ad serving, BigTable; search,
MapReduce, ProtocolBuffers--advocates evaluating different designs usingback-
of-the-envelope calculations. He gives the full story in this Stanford video

<p>Introduction: Am I mad to consider using .Net2 and AJAX for a high-scalability application?
In case you wonder why, it's the legacy of a website built on IIS and .Net
1.1, and we're looking for ways to make the content more attractive and
interactive. In this case, it's a medical image library being shared by a few
Wikis and online coursework for medicalstudents ( < 15K users) and doctors ( <
150K users)But I'm worried about the performance overhead. We already have a
performance problem because of personalising the content for users according
to their type (student or doctor), and for doctors, their grade and
speciality.</p><p>5 0.76048779 <a title="454-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL%3A_An_Overview_of_the_Various_Query_Semantics_in_the_Post_Only-SQL_World.html">867 high scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL: An Overview of the Various Query Semantics in the Post Only-SQL World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of many of the
scalability issues that we face today with traditional database approach.I
think that the main reason so many people have come to see SQL as the source
of all evil is the fact that, traditionally, the query language was burned
into the database implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to
the traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.This view has brought on a
flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a different aspect
that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach, such as a document
model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as Key/Value query.Most of
the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject, and tend to use
query semantics and architecture interchangeably. InPart Iof this post i tried
to provide quick overview of what each query term stands for in the context of
the NoSQL world .Part II illustrates those ideas using  code examples from</p><p>6 0.75799215 <a title="454-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-13-Why_are_Facebook%2C_Digg%2C_and_Twitter_so_hard_to_scale%3F.html">721 high scalability-2009-10-13-Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?</a></p>

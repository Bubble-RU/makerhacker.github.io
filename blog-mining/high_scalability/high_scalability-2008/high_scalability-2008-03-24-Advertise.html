<p>Introduction: Pinterest co-founder Paul Sciarrashared a bit about their stackon Quora:Python
+ heavily-modified Django at the application layerTornado and (very
selectively) node.js as web-servers.  Memcached and membase / redis for
object- and logical-caching, respectively.  RabbitMQ as a message queue.
Nginx, HAproxy and Varnish for static-delivery and load-balancing.Persistent
data storage using MySQL.  MrJob on EMR for map-reduce.Git.Alex Popescu
hascreated a cool diagramof the setup and provided some thoughtful analysis as
well.</p><p>5 0.54103374 <a title="287-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-12-Strategy%3A_Limit_The_New%2C_Not_The_Old.html">363 high scalability-2008-08-12-Strategy: Limit The New, Not The Old</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose
limits (GAE Quotas,Fotolog,Facebook) as a means of protecting a website
against service destroyingtraffic spikes. Twitter will reportedlylimit the
number followersto 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow
Twitter to make some bank bygoing freemiumand charging for adding more
followers.Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting
aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established
ecosystem?One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let
everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is,
however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are
will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service.
Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.Now in Twitter's
case the people with the most followers tend to be opinion leaderswho shape
much of the blognet echo</p><p>6 0.52836639 <a title="287-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-25-Advanced_BPM_program__in_USA_and_India__discount_for_Group_Membership.html">520 high scalability-2009-02-25-Advanced BPM program  in USA and India  discount for Group Membership</a></p>

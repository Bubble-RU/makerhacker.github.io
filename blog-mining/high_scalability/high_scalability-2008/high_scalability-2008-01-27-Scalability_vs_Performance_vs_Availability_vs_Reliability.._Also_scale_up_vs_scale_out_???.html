<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure...
  
 On the new year  Twitter set a record  with 6,939 Tweets Per Second (TPS). Cool video visualizing New Year's Eve Tweet data across the world.  
 Marko Rodriguez in  Memoirs of a Graph Addict: Despair to Redemption  tells a stirring tale of how graph programming saved the world from certain destruction by realizing Aritstotle's dream of an eudaimonia-driven society. Could a relational database do that? The tools of the revolution can be found at  tinkerprop.com , which describes a databases agnostic stack for working with property graphs, they include Blueprints - a property graph model interface; Pipes - a dataflow netowork using process grapphs; Gremlin - a graph based programming language; Rexster - a RESTful graph shell. 
 The never never ending battle of good versus evil has nothing on programmers arguing about bracket policies or sync vs async programming models.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Final Thoughts on SSD and MySQL AKA Battleship Spinn3r . Tips on how to make your database 10x faster using solid state drives. Potential exists for 100x speedup.       Solid-state drives   (SSDs) are the holy grail of storage. The promise of RAM speeds and hard disk like persistence have for years driven us crazy with power user lust, but they've stayed tantalizingly just out of reach. Always too expensive, too small, and oddly too slow. Has that changed? Can you now miraculously have your cake and eat it too? Can you now have it both ways? Is balancing work with family life now as easy as tripping over a terabyte drive?     In a pioneering series of blog articles Kevin Burton conducts original research on next generation SSD drives in real world configurations. For an experience report on his great adventure you can turn to:         Could SSD Mean a Rise in MyISAM Usage?  ,   Serverbeach, MySQL and Mtron SSDs  ,   Prediction: SSD Blades in 2008  ,   Zeus IOPS - Another High</p><p>5 0.11495522 <a title="224-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_8%2C_2011.html">1019 high scalability-2011-04-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 8, 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this tomato killing frosty morn...
  
 Now we really know why vampires feed on blood...they are elastically acquiring more compute power.  Your Next Computer May Be Made of...Blood!  It's those  memristors  again. Ancient vamps are really just giant super computers. 
  Twitter now at 155 million tweets a day , up from 55 million a year ago. 
   10,000-core Linux supercomputer built in Amazon cloud  By Jon Brodkin. T he 10,000 cores were composed of 1,250 instances with eight cores each, as well as 8.75TB of RAM and 2PB disk space. The cluster ran for eight hours at a cost of $8,500 .

  @jkalucki : Getting just 100 servers to work together for the first time is so ridiculously complicated. Horizontal scaling doesn't scale.

  Data sorting world record: 1 terabyte, 1 minute . The system has  52 computer nodes, each node is a commodity server with two quad-core processors, 24 gigabytes (GB) memory and sixteen 500 GB disks . It's not just hardware though, they also built a software that utilized all their CPU and RAM. 
 Tweets of Gold:          
 
  wm : I am really getting the sense that none of you yokels waxing profound about scalability actually has anything factual to say

<p>Introduction: Update 3:  Presentation from the  NoSQL Conference :  slides ,  video .  Update 2:  Jim Wilson helps with the  Understanding HBase and BigTable  by explaining them from a "conceptual standpoint."  Update:  InfoQ interview:  HBase Leads Discuss Hadoop, BigTable and Distributed Databases . "MapReduce (both Google's and Hadoop's) is ideal for processing huge amounts of data with sizes that would not fit in a traditional database. Neither is appropriate for transaction/single request processing."   Hbase  is the open source answer to BigTable, Google's highly scalable distributed database.  It is built on top of Hadoop ( product ), which implements functionality similar to Google's GFS and Map/Reduce systems.Â 
 
Both Google's GFS and Hadoop's HDFS provide a mechanism to reliably store large amounts of data. However, there is not really a mechanism for organizing the data and accessing only the parts that are of interest to a particular application.  Bigtable (and Hbase) provide a means for</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9497242 <a title="224-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability_vs_Performance_vs_Availability_vs_Reliability.._Also_scale_up_vs_scale_out_%3F%3F%3F.html">224 high scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability vs Performance vs Availability vs Reliability..

<p>Introduction: Where do you draw the line between scalability vs Performance vs High Availability vs Reliability?     I guess at the end of the day, we all want to be highly available, great performance and always reliable. So is it safe to say that scalability is the answer ?      Also when do you start to think scale out vs scale up ?</p><p>3 0.94327366 <a title="224-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-25-Paper%3A_High_Performance_Scalable_Data_Stores_.html">784 high scalability-2010-02-25-Paper: High Performance Scalable Data Stores </a></p>
<p>Introduction: The world of scalable databases is not a simple one. They come in every race, creed, and color. Rick Cattell has brought some harmony to that world by publishing  High Performance Scalable Data Stores , a nicely detailed one stop shop paper comparing scalable databases soley on the content of their character. Ironically, the first step in that evaluation is dividing the world into four groups:
  
 Key-value stores: Redis, Scalaris, Voldmort, and Riak. 
 Document stores: Couch DB, MongoDB, and SimpleDB. 
 Record stores: BigTable, HBase, HyperTable, and Cassandra. 
 Scalable RDBMSs: MySQL Cluster, ScaleDB, Drizzle, and VoltDB. 
  
The paper describes each system and then compares them on the dimensions of Concurrency Control, Data Storage Replication, Transaction Model, General Comments, Maturity, K-hits, License Language.
 
And the winner is: there are no winners. Yet. Rick concludes by pointing to a great convergence:

<p>Introduction: Wildly popular VC blogger  Fred Wilson  defines in an excellent  27 minute video  the ten most important criteria he uses when deciding to give the gold, that is, fund a web application. Note, this video is  from 2010 , so no doubt the ideas are still valid, but the importance of mobile vs web apps has probably shifted to mobile, as Mr. Wilson says in a recent post:  mobile is growing like a weed . 
  
   Speed  - speed is more than a feature, it's a requirement. Mainstream users are unforgiving. If something is slow they won't use it. Pingdom is used to track speed across their portfolio. A trend they've noticed is that as an application slows down they don't grow as quickly.   
   Instant Utility  - a service must be instantly useful to users. Lengthy setup and configuration is a killer. Tricks like crawling the web to populate information you expect to get from your users later makes the service initially useful. YouTube won, for example, with instant availability of uploaded video.</p><p>6 0.92067152 <a title="224-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-13-Reconnoiter_-_Large-Scale_Trending_and_Fault-Detection.html">680 high scalability-2009-08-13-Reconnoiter - Large-Scale Trending and Fault-Detection</a></p>

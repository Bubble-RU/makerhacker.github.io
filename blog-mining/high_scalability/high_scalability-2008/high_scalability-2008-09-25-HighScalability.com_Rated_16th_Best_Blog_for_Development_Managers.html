<p>Introduction: MySQL Scale-Out by application partitioningby Oli SennhauserEventually every
database system hit its limits. Especially on the Internet, where you have
millions of users which theoretically access your database simultaneously,
eventually your IO system will be a bottleneck. [A] promising but more complex
solution with nearly no scale-out limits is application partitioning. If and
when you get into the top-1000 rank on alexa [1], you have to think about such
solutions.A Quick Hit of What's InsideHorizontal application partitioning,

<p>Introduction: In this article Jeff Atwood (a rockstar programmer and one
ofStackOverflowwebsite founders) discusses the measures of how you can reduce
you bandwidth usage and refers specifically on high trafficked websites for
which bandwidth is more costly than for an average website.This is his

<p>Introduction: Joel Spolsky and JeffAtwood areraising VC moneyforStackOverflow.This is
interesting for three reasons: 1) Joel has always seemed like a keep it small
and grow organically type of guy, so this is a big step in a different
direction. 2) It means they think there's a very big market in the Q&A; space
and they mean to capture as much as the market as possible. 3) Most
importantly for this blog, Joel gives some good advice on when to stay fresh
and local and when it's time to jump for the brass ring, scale up your
ambition, and go for VC money. Please seeJoel's blogpost for the details, but
here's when to go VC:There's a land grab going on.There is a provable concept
that's repeatable.The business itself could benefit from the publicity.The
investor will add substantial value to the business.The business can
potentially have a big exit or become a large, publically traded company.The
founders are not in it for their own personal aggrandizement.Joel thinks

<p>Introduction: An excellent article by Bryan Cantrill and Jeff Bonwick on how to write multi-
threaded code. With more processors and no magic bullet solution for how to
use them, knowing how to write multiprocessor code that doesn't screw up your
system is still a valuable skill. Some topics:Know your cold paths from your
hot paths.Intuition is frequently wrong--be data intensive.Know when--and when
not--to break up a lock.Be wary of readers/writer locks.Consider per-CPU
locking.Know when to broadcast--and when to signal.Learn to debug
postmortem.Design your systems to be composable.Don't use a semaphore where a
mutex would suffice.Consider memory retiring to implement per-chain hash-table
locks.Be aware of false sharing.Consider using nonblocking synchronization
routines to monitor contention.When reacquiring locks, consider using
generation counts to detect state change.Use wait- and lock-free structures
only if you absolutely must.Prepare for the thrill of victory--and the agony
of defeat.While I</p><p>4 0.49729767 <a title="394-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-02-RFC_1925_-_The_Twelve_%28Timeless%29_Networking_Truths.html">1526 high scalability-2013-10-02-RFC 1925 - The Twelve (Timeless) Networking Truths</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Twelve Networking Truths is one of a long series of timeless truths
documented in sacred April Fools'RFCs. Though issued in 1996, it's no less
true today.It's hard to pick a favorite because they are all good. But if I
had to pick, it would be:Some things in life can never be fully appreciated
nor understood unless experienced firsthand.As we grow comfortable behind
garden walls, clutching gadgets like lifelines and ideologies like shields,
empathy is the true social network. Network Working Group R.Callon, Editor

<p>Introduction: The paper MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O
(video,slides) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a
better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started
with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support
for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling
to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they
created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented
workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."The result:
MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29% (for long connections) and
582% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed
version of memcached between 15% and 320%. For a workload based on real-world
HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of nginx by 75%.What's this most
excellent and interesting paper about?Message-oriented network workloads,

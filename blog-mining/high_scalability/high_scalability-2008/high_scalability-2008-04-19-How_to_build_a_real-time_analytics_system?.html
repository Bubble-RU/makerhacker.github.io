<p>Introduction: Facebook did it again. They've built another system capable of doing something
useful with ginormous streams of realtime data. Last time we saw Facebook
release their New Real-Time Messaging System: HBase To Store 135+ Billion
Messages A Month. This time it's a realtime analytics system handlingover 20
billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30
seconds. Alex Himel, Engineering Manager at Facebook, explains what they've
built (video) and the scale required:Social plugins have become an important
and growing source of traffic for millions of websites over the past year. We
released a new version of Insights for Websites last week to give site owners
better analytics on how people interact with their content and to help them
optimize their websites in real time. To accomplish this, we had to engineer a
system that could process over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per
second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds. Alex does an excellent job with

<p>Introduction: AWStatsis a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web,
streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works
as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log
contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be
able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files
from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log
format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of
other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.</p><p>4 0.14884874 <a title="304-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-30-How_Rackspace_Now_Uses_MapReduce_and_Hadoop_to_Query_Terabytes_of_Data.html">233 high scalability-2008-01-30-How Rackspace Now Uses MapReduce and Hadoop to Query Terabytes of Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from
over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle
ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the greatMapReduce Versus Database War,
you would be correct.Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail
division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved
their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each
machine approach, to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just
couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that
works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability
potential.Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data
streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful
with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text
files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each
individual machine. Then came a</p><p>5 0.1479072 <a title="304-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-15-New_Website_Design_Considerations.html">276 high scalability-2008-03-15-New Website Design Considerations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I am in the design phase of getting a website up and running that will have
scalability as a main concern. I am looking for opinions on architecture and
the like for this endeavor.The site has a few unique characteristics that make
scalability difficult. Users will all have a pretty large amount of data that
other users will be able to search. The site will be entirely based around
search. The catch is that other users will be searching always with a
stipulation of 'n' miles from me. I imagine that fact will kill the
possibility of query caching for most searches.I have extensive experience
with PHP and MYSQL, some experience with ASP.NET/C#, some experience with perl
but can learn anything fast. The site will start out on a single server but I
want to be 100% certain that I architect the code and databases such that
scaling will be simple.What language should I code the site in? What DB would
you use: Postgres, MYSQL, MSSQL, BerkelyDB? Should we shard the database by
location? by user</p><p>6 0.14053091 <a title="304-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-30-Log_Everything_All_the_Time.html">77 high scalability-2007-08-30-Log Everything All the Time</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byGordon Worley, a Software Engineer atKorrelate, where
they correlate (see what they did there) online purchases to offline
purchases.Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every
server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not
making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come
online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were
originally told to expect. I wouldn't say we panicked, but the office was
certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks
both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the
added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.At
Korrelate, we deploytracking pixels, also known beacons or web bugs, that our
partners use to send us information about their users. These tiny web objects
contain no visible content, but may include transparent 1 by 1 gifs or
Javascript,</p><p>3 0.77572286 <a title="304-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-30-How_Rackspace_Now_Uses_MapReduce_and_Hadoop_to_Query_Terabytes_of_Data.html">233 high scalability-2008-01-30-How Rackspace Now Uses MapReduce and Hadoop to Query Terabytes of Data</a></p>

<p>Introduction: WebLog Expertis a fast and powerful access log analyzer. It will give you
information about your site's visitors: activity statistics, accessed files,
paths through the site, information about referring pages, search engines,
browsers, operating systems, and more. The program produces easy-to-read HTML
reports that include both text information (tables) and charts. View the
WebLog Expert sample report to get the general idea of the variety of
information about your site's usage it can provide.WebLog Expert can analyze
logs of Apache and IIS web servers. It can even read GZ and ZIP compressed
logs so you won't need to unpack them manually.The log analyzer features
intuitive interface. Built-in wizards will help you quickly and easily create
a profile for your site and analyze it.</p><p>5 0.75798029 <a title="304-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_Web_Log_Storming.html">37 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: Web Log Storming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Web Log Stormingis an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows.
The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any
other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down
to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and
how it fits into your desired scenario.Web Log Storming does far more than
just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with
interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of
activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.In
other words, analyze your web logs like never before!It's easy to track
sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to
each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and
keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the
top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed. You

<p>Introduction: Hello everybody!I am a developer of a website with a lot of traffic. Right now
we are managing the whole website using perl + postgresql + fastcgi +
memcached + mogileFS + lighttpd + roundrobin DNS distributed over 5 servers
and I must say it works like a charm, load is stable and everything works very
fast and we are recording about 8 million pageviews per day.The only problem
is with postgres database since we have it installed only on one server and if
this server goes down, the whole "cluster" goes down. That's why we have a
master2slave replication so we still have a backup database except that when
the master goes down, all inserts/updates are disabled so the whole website is
just read only.But this is not a problem since this configuration is working
for us and we don't have any problems with it.Right now we are planning to
build our own analytics service that would be customized for our needs. We
tried various different software packages but were not satisfied with any of
them.</p><p>2 0.93704361 <a title="304-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-08-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_April_8%2C_2010.html">806 high scalability-2010-04-08-Hot Scalability Links for April 8, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model,
which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model,
networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as
services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the
datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed
application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing
sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the
datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to
scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt
easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sun's VeriScale architecture
provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun
Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures
for more than a decade. The features of these architectures, such as
elasticity, ar</p><p>5 0.89924544 <a title="304-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-12-High_Performance_at_Massive_Scale_%E2%80%93__Lessons_learned_at_Facebook.html">720 high scalability-2009-10-12-High Performance at Massive Scale –  Lessons learned at Facebook</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great
presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: "High Performance at
Massive Scale -  Lessons learned at Facebook". The abstract for the talk
is:Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today
serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes
engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging
proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data
that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core
architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to
address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies
that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web
architectures.There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into
later, but I thought you might want a head start on learning how Facebook
handles 30K+ machines, 300 million</p><p>6 0.8989327 <a title="304-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-01-Prismatic_Update%3A_Machine_Learning_on_Documents_and_Users.html">1294 high scalability-2012-08-01-Prismatic Update: Machine Learning on Documents and Users</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Much of the focus of high performance computing (HPC) has centered on CPU
performance. However, as computing requirements grow, HPC clusters are
demanding higher rates of aggregate data throughput. Today's clusters feature
larger numbers of nodes with increased compute speeds. The higher clock rates
and operations per clock cycle create increased demand for local data on each
node. In addition, InfiniBand and other high-speed, low-latency interconnects
increase the data throughput available to each node.Traditional shared file
systems such as NFS have not been able to scale to meet this growing demand
for data throughput on HPC clusters. Scalable cluster file systems that can
provide parallel data access to hundreds of nodes and petabytes of storage are
needed to provide the high data throughput required by large HPC applications,
including manufacturing, electronic design, and research.This paper describes
an implementation of the Sun Lustre file system as a scalable storage cluster

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are

<p>Introduction: Sun FireTM X4540 Server as Backup Server for Zmanda's Amanda Enterprise 2.6
Softwareby Thomas Hanvey (Sun Microsystems) and Dmitri Joukovski and Ken
Crandall (Zmanda)September, 2008Explosive data growth, combined with demanding
requirements for data availability, has placed a tremendous burden on IT
operations staff at businesses of all sizes. Yet, many organizations do not
have the staff or budget to purchase and manage complex and expensive backup
and recovery software products.The Sun FireTM X4540 server can deliver massive
storage capacity and remarkable throughput so it is well-suited as a nearline
storage platform for backup and restore applications. Combining the power of
the SolarisTM 10 Operating System with the data integrity and simplified
administration of ZFS, the Sun Fire X4540 server can be an ideal candidate for
streamlining and improving backup and restore operations.Amanda Enterprise

<p>Introduction: When designing data storage solutions for High Performance Computing (HPC)
environments, IT architects strive to balance complex and often conflicting
requirements. The need to manage a skyrocketing amount of data, along with the
goals of controlling cost and immediate data availability, can make it
difficult to meet HPC application demands within the constraints of today's IT
budgets. To help customers address an almost bewildering set of architectural
challenges, Sun has developed the Sun Storage and Archive Solution for HPC, a
reference architecture that can be easily customized to meet specific
application goals and business requirements.This article is intended for IT
managers and storage architects familiar with HPC applications and data
requirements in the organization. It assumes that the audience has a technical
background and some familiarity with issues surrounding the task of
configuring systems and storage.</p><p>2 0.87229097 <a title="413-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Product%3A_ISPMan_Centralized_ISP_Management_System_.html">228 high scalability-2008-01-28-Product: ISPMan Centralized ISP Management System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: FromFRESH Portsand their website:ISPmanis an ISP management software written
in perl, using an LDAPbackend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP. It can be
used to manage,DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration,
cyrusmail boxes, proftpd etc.ISPMan was written as a management tool for the
network at 4unet wherebetween 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is
crazily growing.Managing these domains and their users was a little time
consuming,and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these
daemonsfluently. Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and
users.LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server canbe
scaled from 1 to n as required. An LDAP entry called maildroptells the SMTP
server (postfix) where to deliver the mail. The SMTPservers can be
loadbalanced with one of many load balancingtechniques. The program is written
with scalability and Highavailability in mind.This may not be the right
software for you if you want to run a sm</p><p>3 0.86784858 <a title="413-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-09-Writing_about_cisco_loadbalancer%3F.html">678 high scalability-2009-08-09-Writing about cisco loadbalancer?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Guys,At one of my jobs I have to administer a CISCO ACE (application control
engine) hardware load-balancer.I don't particularly love this beast, but it's
very very powerful.There appears to be little real-world info out there, so it
could be interesting writing an article on that.But I don't have other HW LB's
to compare it to and I don't want to rehash the product page.What would
interest you in a 'product review' of a loadbalancer?No replies means it's not
an interesting topic, so no article then ;-)</p><p>4 0.84495175 <a title="413-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_Web_Log_Expert.html">36 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: Web Log Expert</a></p>
<p>Introduction: WebLog Expertis a fast and powerful access log analyzer. It will give you
information about your site's visitors: activity statistics, accessed files,
paths through the site, information about referring pages, search engines,
browsers, operating systems, and more. The program produces easy-to-read HTML
reports that include both text information (tables) and charts. View the
WebLog Expert sample report to get the general idea of the variety of
information about your site's usage it can provide.WebLog Expert can analyze
logs of Apache and IIS web servers. It can even read GZ and ZIP compressed
logs so you won't need to unpack them manually.The log analyzer features
intuitive interface. Built-in wizards will help you quickly and easily create
a profile for your site and analyze it.</p><p>5 0.84435076 <a title="413-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-26-Hot_Links_for_2009-8-26.html">688 high scalability-2009-08-26-Hot Links for 2009-8-26</a></p>

requires massive infrastructure: Google-size infrastructure.What Does Cloud
Computing Actually Cost? An Analysis of the Top Vendors-Amazon is currently
the lowest cost cloud computing option overall. At least for production
applications that need more than 6.5 hours of CPU/day, otherwise GAE is

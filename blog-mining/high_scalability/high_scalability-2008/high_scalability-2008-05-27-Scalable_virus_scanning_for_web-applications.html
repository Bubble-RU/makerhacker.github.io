<p>Introduction: Hi all,Has anyone got any experience with using Amazon S3 as an uploaded photo
store?I'm writing a website that I need to keep as low budget as possible, and
I'm investigating solutions for storing uploaded photos from users - not too
many, probably in the low thousands. The site is commercial so I'm straying
away from the Flickrs of the world. S3 seems to offer a solution but I'd like
to hear from those who have used it before.ThanksAndy</p><p>3 0.091847226 <a title="328-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-23-Economies_of_Scale_in_the_Datacenter%3A_Gmail_is_100x_Cheaper_to_Run_than_Your_Own_Server.html">1310 high scalability-2012-08-23-Economies of Scale in the Datacenter: Gmail is 100x Cheaper to Run than Your Own Server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle, infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made areally interesting
statementabout the economics of scale in the datacenter:We've shown that when
you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared
to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a
factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.My
first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm
crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using
technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency
requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly
automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a
simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper
to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>4 0.084955566 <a title="328-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-25-Who_can_answer_or_analyze_the_image_store_and_visit_solution_about_alibaba.com%3FThanks.html">132 high scalability-2007-10-25-Who can answer or analyze the image store and visit solution about alibaba.com?Thanks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,First of all; thanks for a creating a GREAT resource on high scalability
architecture. For us building high scalability solutions from the west coast
of (tiny) Norway good input on the subject isn't always abundant.Which leads
me to my next question; Are there any events or conferences on high
scalability / SaaS in the US or internationally that any of you would
recommend architects or data center managers to attend?</p><p>6 0.075081073 <a title="328-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-14-Product%3A_The_Spread_Toolkit.html">122 high scalability-2007-10-14-Product: The Spread Toolkit</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Justin.tv is looking to hire aScaling Engineerto help scale their video
cluster, IRC server, web app, monitoring and search services. I've never seen
this job title before. A quick search that showed only a few previous
instances of it being used. Has anyone else seen Scaling Engineer as a job
title before?It's a great idea. Scaling is certainly a worthy specialty of
it's own. Why there's a difficult lingo, obscure tools, endlessly subtle
concepts, a massive body of knowledge to master, and many competing religious
factions. All a good start. Next I see a chain of Scalability Universities.
Maybe use all those Starbucks that are closing down. Contact me for franchise
opportunities :-)</p><p>3 0.6278764 <a title="328-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-03-Development_of_highly_scalable_web_site.html">296 high scalability-2008-04-03-Development of highly scalable web site</a></p>

concrete way to create an intuitive understanding of just how fast is a
nanosecond, a billionth of a second, which was the speed of their new computer
circuits. As an illustration she settled on the length of wire that is as long
as light can travel in one nanosecond. The length is a very portable11.8
inches. A microseconds worth of wire is a still portable, but a much bulkier
984 feet. In one millisecond light travels 186 miles, which only Hercules
could carry. In today's terms, at a3.06 GHz clock speed, there's .33
nanoseconds between ticks, or 3.73 inches of light travel.Understanding the
profligate ways of programmers, she suggests that every programmer wear a
necklace of a microseconds worth of wire so they know what they are wasting

<p>Introduction: Hi,We're looking for a highly scalable way of scanning documents being
uploaded and downloaded from our web application. I believe services like
gmail and hotmail are using bespoke solutions from companies like Trend, but
are there some quality "off the shelf" products out there that can easily be
scaled out and have a "loose" API (HTTP based) for application
integration?Once again, thanks for any input.</p><p>3 0.74931061 <a title="328-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-09-In_Memory%3A_Grace_Hopper_to_Programmers%3A_Mind_Your_Nanoseconds%21.html">1560 high scalability-2013-12-09-In Memory: Grace Hopper to Programmers: Mind Your Nanoseconds!</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hello all,does anyone have experience in scaling a european website to
china?The main problem in china is the internet connectivity to websites
outside china, that means latency and packetloss (and perhaps filtering) make
things difficult.The options I see are:1. Host you application in china, but
where? I haven't got a answer from any chinese ISP I contacted. On the other
hand I don't really want to host in china.2. Build your own CDN. Wikipedia
shows how it goes. Get a bunch of machines (but where? see point 1) put squid
on them, implement intelligent cache invalidation and you're set. But where
can I get machines in china? Where do I need them in china? There are soe big
isps with limited peering capability, so I'd need servers in every network.3.
Get professional CDN services. Akamai, ChinaCache, CDNetworks, etc etc.. They
all provide services in china. The problem is: they are all very expensive.4.
Amazon EC2/S3 ? Is it worth thinking about this way? I am not sure, because
they on</p><p>5 0.64689052 <a title="328-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud.html">40 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built

<p>Introduction: In a paper delivered at HotCloud '12 by a group from CMU and Intel Labs,
Saving Cash by Using Less Cache (slides,  pdf), they show it may be possible
to use less DRAM under low load conditions to save on operational costs. There
are some issues with this idea, but in a give me more cache era, it could be
an interesting source of cost savings for your product. Caching is used
to:Reduce load on the database.Reduce latency.Problem:RAM in the cloud is
quite expensive. A third of costs can come from the caching tier.Solution:
Shrink your cache when the load is lower. Their work shows when the load drops
below a certain point you can throw away 50% of your cache while still
maintaining performance.A few popular items often account for most of your
hits, implying can remove the cache for the long tail. Use two tiers of
servers, the Retiring Group, which is the group of servers you want to get rid
of. The Primary Group is the group of servers you are keeping. A cache request
goes to both serve</p><p>6 0.1409115 <a title="383-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling_Pinterest_-_From_0_to_10s_of_Billions_of_Page_Views_a_Month_in_Two_Years.html">1440 high scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling Pinterest - From 0 to 10s of Billions of Page Views a Month in Two Years</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I met the CodeFutures folks, makers ofdbShards, atGluecon. They occupy an
interesting niche in the database space, somewhere betweenNoSQL, which
jettisons everything SQL, and high end analytics platformsthat completely
rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.High concept: I think of
dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from HSCALE
(partitioning) +MySQL Proxy (transparent intermediate layer) +Memcached
(client side sharding) +Gigaspaces(parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).You
may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out
writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would
prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about
dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult
questions (not really).Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was
dbShards created to solve?I'm Cory Isaacson, CEO/CTO of CodeFutures

<p>Introduction: Jared Rosoffconcisely, effectively, entertainingly, and convincingly gives an
8 minute MongoDB tutorialon scaling MongoDB at Scale Out Camp. The ideas
aren't just limited to MongoDB, they work for most any database: Optimize your
queries; Know your working set size; Tune your file system; Choose the right
disks; Shard. Here's an explanation of all 5 strategies:Optimize your queries.
Computer science works. Complexity analysis works. A btree search is faster
than a table scan. So analyze your queries. Use explain to see what your query
is doing. If it is saying it's using a cursor then it's doing a table scan.
That's slow. Look at the number of documents it looks at to satisfy a query.
Look at how long it takes. Fix: add indexes. It doesn't matter if you are

<p>Introduction: Hello everyone,I'm designing a website/widget that my business partner and I
expect to serve millions of hits daily. As such we must shard our database
(and we're designing with shards in mind right from the beginning). However,
the one thing I haven't been able to figure out from Googling is the best
hardware to go with for shards. I'm using exclusively InnoDB tables.We'll
(eventually) be running 3 groups of database servers:a) Session servers for
php sessions. These will have a very high write volume.b) ID servers. These
will match a couple primary indices (such as user ID) to a given shard. These
will have an intense read load, plus a moderate amount of writes.c) Shard
servers. These will hold the bulk of the data. These will have a high read
load and a lowish write load.Group A is done as a database instead of using
memcached so users aren't logged out if a memcached server goes down. As the
write load is high, a pair of high performance master-master servers seems
obvious. What's</p><p>2 0.9054215 <a title="383-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-28-PaaS_on_OpenStack_-_Run_Applications_on_Any_Cloud%2C_Any_Time_Using_Any_Thing.html">1031 high scalability-2011-04-28-PaaS on OpenStack - Run Applications on Any Cloud, Any Time Using Any Thing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday, I had a session during the OpenStack Summit where I tried to
present a more general view on how we should be thinking about PaaS in the
context of OpenStack.The key takeaway :The main goal of PaaS is to drive
productivity into the process by which we can deliver new applications.Most of
the existing PaaS solutions take a fairly extreme approach with their
abstraction of the underlying infrastructure and therefore fit a fairly small
number of extremely simple applications and thus miss the real promise of
PaaS.Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk took a more bottom up approach giving us
better set of tradeoffs between the abstraction and control which makes it
more broadly applicable to a larger set of applications.The fact that
OpenStack is opensource allows us to think differently on the things we can do
at the platform layer. We can create a tighter integration between the PaaS
and IaaS layers and thus come up with better set of tradeoffs into the way we
drive productivity without g</p><p>3 0.90050519 <a title="383-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-12-Slashdot_Architecture_-_How_the_Old_Man_of_the_Internet_Learned_to_Scale.html">150 high scalability-2007-11-12-Slashdot Architecture - How the Old Man of the Internet Learned to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Slashdot effect: overwhelming unprepared sites with an avalanche of reader's
clicks after being mentioned on Slashdot. Sure, we now have the "Digg effect"
and other hot new stars, but Slashdot was the original. And like many stars
from generations past, Slashdot plays the elder statesman's role with with
class, dignity, and restraint. Yet with millions and millions of users
Slashdot is still box office gold and more than keeps up with the young'ins.
And with age comes the wisdom of learning how to handle all those users. Just
how does Slashdot scale and what can you learn by going old school?breakSite:

<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novicexI am starting
a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality
possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).I have done some
research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I
have some basic knowledge on these.Following are my requirements1) My budget
is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).2)
I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first
2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And
more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)3)
90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.Based on the above,
could you please answer my following questions?1) Can I go with just a good
dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site
gets big? Or do you think its wise to start with a CDN service?2) Should I</p><p>5 0.89560902 <a title="383-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_22%2C_2013.html">1411 high scalability-2013-02-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 22, 2013</a></p>

truly horrendous crimes against scalability today.@ErrataRob: doubling
performance doesn't double scalability.@rsingel: In 2008 when Yahoo.com

tune your TCP buffer sizes...@gwestr: In which the node community showers
schadenfreude upon the rails community for "scalability is not my problem"
architectures@pbailis:  Makes sense, though I think there's a tradeoff re:
coordination and scalability (always homogeneous vs dynamically
heterogenous)@pembleton: To summarize Yoav's philosophy: we started as quick
as we can and then we accelerated #operationgrandma in #reversim@surfichris:

</p><p>4 The indexes are computed on the write, so reads are very fast. [sent-8, score-0.29]
</p><p>5 Joe mentions some special algorithms for spreading out data, which tends to cluster around geographical regions, but does not mention what these are. [sent-11, score-0.247]
</p><p>6 Users are allowed to perform a well defined set of operations that end up using highly optimized searches. [sent-14, score-0.195]
</p><p>7 They have no intention of being a generic database, they only intend to be able to serve geodata, well. [sent-15, score-0.18]
</p><p>8 The relation tool chain has failed for real-time . [sent-16, score-0.338]
</p><p>9 Building scalable systems on a relational database requires building sharding, load balancing, resharding, cluster management, worrying about consistency, implementing distributed queries, and other layers yourself, so why bother? [sent-19, score-0.526]
</p><p>10 Shutdown a server and Cassandra will handle all the remapping and rerouting automatically. [sent-21, score-0.215]
</p><p>11 Scaling practices turn a relational database into a non-relational database . [sent-22, score-0.544]
</p><p>12 To scale at Digg they followed a set of practices very similar to those used at  eBay . [sent-23, score-0.182]
</p><p>13 No joins, no foreign key constraints (to scale writes), primary key look-ups only, limited range queries, and  joins were done in memory. [sent-24, score-0.465]
</p><p>14 When implementing the comment feature a 4,000 percent increase in performance was created by sorting in PHP instead of MySQL. [sent-25, score-0.098]
</p><p>15 All this effort required to make a relational database scale basically meant you were using a non-relational database anyway. [sent-26, score-0.643]
</p><p>16 So why not just use a non-relational database from the start? [sent-27, score-0.128]
</p><p>17 Cassandra allowed SimpleGeo to create custom data partitioning policies to better spread the data around. [sent-29, score-0.24]
</p><p>18 This meant a custom database didn't have to be created, an existing database could be extended to go that extra mile while still benefiting from a well supported highly functional database. [sent-30, score-0.792]
</p><p>19 To scale often requires building highly custom, problem specific solutions. [sent-34, score-0.166]

<p>Introduction: In  Cool spatial algos with Neo4j: Part 1 -  Routing with A* in Ruby  Peter Neubauer not only does a fantastic job explaining a complicated routing algorithm using the graph database  Neo4j , but he surfaces an interesting architectural conundrum:  make it really fast so work can be done on the reads or do all the work on the writes so the reads are really fast .
 
The money quote pointing out the competing options is:
     

[Being] able to do these calculations in sub-second speeds on graphs of millions of roads and waypoints makes it possible in many cases to  abandon the normal approach of  precomputing indexes  with K/V stores and be able to put routing into the critical path with the possibility to adapt to the live conditions and build highly personalized and dynamic spatial services.﻿

<p>Introduction: Joe Stump, Lead Architect at Digg, gave  this presentation  at the Web 2.0 Expo. I couldn't find the actual presentation, but fortunately  Kris Jordan  took some great notes. That's how key moments in history are accidentally captured forever. Joe was also kind enough to respond to my email questions with a phone call.   In this first part of the post Joe shares some timeless wisdom that you may or may not have read before. I of course take some pains to extract all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules. What really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDB  Will be the biggest new kid on the block in scaling .  MemcacheDB has been around for a little while and I've never thought of it in that way. Well learn why Joe is so excited by MemcacheDB at the end of the post.

<p>Introduction: A firestorm of accusations circled around recently saying that Cassandra, the elected-by-major-adopters emperor of the NoSQL movement, has no clothes. It was said Twitter was dumping Cassandra;  Reddit outages  were linked to Cassandra; and even Facebook, Cassandra's cradle of birth, was said to have abandoned Cassandra. Shouts of NoSQL Fail! were heard in the streets. Much gloating followed. Is the emperor really naked? Casually dressed maybe, but not naked.
 
 (Note: after this point the article contains a flow chart that is NSFW. Some people are very sensitive about cussing, so if that's you, please go back, don't read on. Danger! There are no nude pictures or anything, just some strong language. But this is my most favorite flow chart of all time, so it's worth it :-) 
 
Is Twitter really abandoning Cassandra? Not according to Twitter,  which came out with a post,  Cassandra  at Twitter Today , explaining that they are using Cassandra in  production for geolocation and analytics.

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: Alan Watts once observed how after we accepted Descartes' separation of the mind and body we've been trying to smash them back together again ever since when really they were never separate to begin with.      The database normalization-denormalization dualism has the same mobius shaped reverberations as Descartes' error. We separate data into a million jagged little pieces and then spend all our time stooping over, picking them and up, and joining them back together again.       Normalization has been standard practice now for decades. But times are changing. Many mega-website architects are concluding Watts was right: the data was never separate to begin with.  And even more radical, we may even need to store multiple copies of data.

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?  Mike Stonebraker , the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world, hopes you get something like his new database,  VoltDB : a pure SQL, pure ACID, pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a second. VoltDB  claims to be  100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster than  Cassandra , and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.
  Will VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of ancient databases?

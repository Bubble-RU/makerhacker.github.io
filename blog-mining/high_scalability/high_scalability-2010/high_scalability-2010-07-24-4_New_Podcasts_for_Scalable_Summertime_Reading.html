<p>Introduction: Update 2:   Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr . Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change.  Operations and developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature flags -  don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics. Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access to production</p><p>5 0.097232543 <a title="864-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-22-We%27re_on_a_Break.html">1495 high scalability-2013-07-22-We're on a Break</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be thankful for the  song  of the tinniest  sparrow  at  sunrise , I'll save you from all that. It's hard to tie scalability and the  giving of thanks  together, especially as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of time. But I think I found a sentiment in  A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and MIRACLES  by  James Bridle  that manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving thanks meaningfully together:
  

I distrust commercial definitions of innovation, and particularly of awesomeness. It’s an overused term. When I think of awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.


  So I started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.  


     


We’re not actually very good about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use metaphors and examples.

<p>Introduction: I fully and enthusiastically encourage anyone who wants to share a relevant topic  to register and post. People have added a lot of good and useful content.  Don't be shy. It's been asked how a  teaser is created when posting so the full article doesn't display on the front page. A teaser is a paragraph interesting enough to convince readers to click on the "read more" link to get the full article.        Creating a teaser in Drupal is accomplished by inserting < ! -- break -- > on a separate line directly after the text you want to be the teaser. Only DO NOT include the spaces.  So your post looks like:   Teaser Content   < ! -- break -- > (no spaces in real life)   Rest of Content     It's a bit kludgey, but it works.</p><p>6 0.62103319 <a title="864-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-29-Gone_Fishin%27_Two.html">1350 high scalability-2012-10-29-Gone Fishin' Two</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just  let the  random chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting  content." #fail. While someone says this I imagine them flicking their  hair back in a "I can't be bothered with true understanding" disdain. And  where does random chance get its content? From people like these. So:  support your local blog! 
 
If you would like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts that you may not know about and that I've found interesting:

<p>Introduction: Lustre速  is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system. It is designed, developed and maintained by Cluster File Systems, Inc.  The central goal is the development of a next-generation cluster file system which can serve clusters with 10,000's of nodes, provide petabytes of storage, and move 100's of GB/sec with state-of-the-art security and management infrastructure.  Lustre runs on many of the largest Linux clusters in the world, and is included by CFS's partners as a core component of their cluster offering (examples include HP StorageWorks SFS, and the Cray XT3 and XD1 supercomputers). Today's users have also demonstrated that Lustre scales down as well as it scales up, and runs in production on clusters as small as 4 and as large as 25,000 nodes.  The latest version of Lustre is always available from Cluster File Systems, Inc. Public Open Source releases of Lustre are available under the GNU General Public License. These releases are found here, and are used</p><p>4 0.84462446 <a title="864-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-09-Sponsored_Post%3A_Job_Openings_-_Squarespace.html">791 high scalability-2010-03-09-Sponsored Post: Job Openings - Squarespace</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An interesting and different implementation approach:  Tempest: Scalable Time-Critical Web Services Platform : 
  

Tempest is a new framework for developing time-critical web services. Tempest enables developers to build scalable, fault-tolerant services that can then be automatically replicated and deployed across clusters of computing nodes. The platform automatically adapts to load ﬂuctuations, reacts when components fail, and ensures consistency between replicas by repairing when inconsistencies do occur. Tempest relies on a family of epidemic protocols and on Ricochet, a reliable time critical multicast protocol with probabilistic guarantees.


Tempest is built around a novel storage abstraction called the TempestCollection in which application developers store the state of a service. Our platform handles the replication of this state across clones of the service, persistence, and failure handling. To minimize the need for specialized knowledge on the part of the application deve</p><p>6 0.80732441 <a title="864-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-12-Peregrine_-_A_Map_Reduce_Framework_for_Iterative_and_Pipelined_Jobs.html">1173 high scalability-2012-01-12-Peregrine - A Map Reduce Framework for Iterative and Pipelined Jobs</a></p>

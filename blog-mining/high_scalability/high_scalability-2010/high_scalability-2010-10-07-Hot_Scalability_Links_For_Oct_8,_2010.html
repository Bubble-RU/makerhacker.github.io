<p>Introduction: In the era of Web 2.0 traditional approaches to capacity planning are often
difficult to implement. Guerrilla Capacity Planning facilitates rapid
forecasting of capacity requirements based on the opportunistic use of
whatever performance data and tools are available.One unique Guerrilla tool is
Virtual Load Testing, based on Dr. Gunther's "Universal Law of Computational
Scaling", which provides a highly cost-effective method for assessing
application scalability. Neil Gunther, M.Sc., Ph.D. is an internationally
recognized computer system performance consultant who founded Performance
Dynamics Company in 1994.Some reasons why you should understand this law:1. A
lot of people use the term "scalability" without clearly defining it, let
alone defining it quantitatively. Computer system scalability must be
quantified. If you can't quantify it, you can't guarantee it. The universal
law of computational scaling provides that quantification.2. One the greatest
impediments to applying queueing</p><p>3 0.10970306 <a title="916-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-24-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Oct_24%2C_2010.html">926 high scalability-2010-10-24-Hot Scalability Links For Oct 24, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On a cold and rainy Fall day, a day stolen from winter rather than our usual
gorgeousIndian Summers, a day not even the SF Giants winning the pennant can
help warm, here are some hot links to read by a digital flame: Using MySQL as
a NoSQL - A story for exceeding 750,000 qps on a commodity serverby Yoshinori
Matsunobu. Wonderfully detailed post on how you can lookup a row by ID really
fast if you bypass all the typical MySQL query parsing
overhead.Minecraftwiki.net and minecraftforum.net now serve more traffic than

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

doing it wrong.Update 5:Exciting stuff happening in Japan at this Key-Value

<p>Introduction: It's called "east-west" networking, which when compared to its predecessor,
"north-south" networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane winds and
tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation between the
transformative shift this change in networking patterns has on the data center
with that of El Ni単o's transformative power upon the weather patterns across
the globe.Traditionally, data center networks have focused on North-South
network traffic. The assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly
communicate with servers at the core, rather than across the network to other
clients.But server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual
appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical
infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with workloads
moving to different physical locations on the network as virtual servers are
migrated (in the case of data center networks) and clients move about the
building (in the ca</p><p>5 0.84890014 <a title="916-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-26-Oculus_Causes_a_Rift%2C_but_the_Facebook_Deal_Will_Avoid_a_Scaling_Crisis_for_Virtual_Reality.html">1619 high scalability-2014-03-26-Oculus Causes a Rift, but the Facebook Deal Will Avoid a Scaling Crisis for Virtual Reality</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

"seats" to maximize profit using multi-variate time sensitive pricing

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.We tend to think compute
of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of
innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will
reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the
datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of
datacenters in the future.Given the diversity of compute resources it's
reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API.
They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those
specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough
to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever
they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the
fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever
resources it doesn't have</p><p>6 0.72374636 <a title="778-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-02-Using_the_Ambient_Cloud_as_an_Application_Runtime.html">786 high scalability-2010-03-02-Using the Ambient Cloud as an Application Runtime</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will. --Steve Jobs  America as
the New World has a long history of inspiring Utopian communities. Early
experiments were famously religious. But there have been many others as new
waves of thought have inspired people to organize and try something
different.In the 1840s Transcendentalists, believing the true path lay in the
perfection of the individual, created intentional communities likeBrook Farm.
We've also seensocialist, anarchist,hippy, and virtually every other kind of
Utopia in-between. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote an infamous book,Walden
Two, with a more "scientific" take on creating a Utopian community and Ayn
Rand inAtlas Shrugged had her free market version.I believe in startup
organizations we see the modern version of Utopian energy in action. We now
call it by names like "culture hacking", but the goal is the same: to create a
new form of human community to achieve a profound goal. You may think startups
are only about m</p><p>3 0.91916084 <a title="778-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-17-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_17%2C_2010.html">860 high scalability-2010-07-17-Hot Scalability Links for July 17, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>5 0.89398909 <a title="778-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-05-Paper%3A_Scalability_Design_Patterns.html">402 high scalability-2008-10-05-Paper: Scalability Design Patterns</a></p>

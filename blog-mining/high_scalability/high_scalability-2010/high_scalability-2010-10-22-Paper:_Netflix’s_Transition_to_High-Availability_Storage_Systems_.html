FUD.Update:Top 10 Reasons to Avoid the SimpleDB Hypeby Ryan Park provides a
well written counter take. Am I really that fawning? If so, doesn't that make
me a dear?All your life you've used a relational database. At the tender age
of five you banged out your first SQL query to track your allowance. Your
RDBMS allegiance was just assumed, like your politics or religion would have
been assumed 100 years ago. They now say--you know them--that relations won't
scale and we have to do things differently. New databases like SimpleDB and
BigTable are what's different. As a long time RDBMS user what can you expect
of SimpleDB? That's what Alex Tolley of MyMeemz.com set out to discover. Like
many brave explorers before him, Alex gave a report of his adventures to the
Royal Society of theAWS Meetup. Alex told a wild almost unbelievable tale of
cultures and practices so different from our own you almost could not believe

<p>Introduction: Amazon has announced the limited beta of Amazon SimpleDB - a simple web
services interface to create and store multiple data sets, query your data
easily, and return the results. Together with the Simple Storage Service (S3),
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and other web services Amazon offers a complete
utility computing platform. SimpleDB was the missing piece of AWS - the
scalable structured database.Check out my blog entry:

<p>Introduction: Youmight haveconsistency problems if you have: multiple datastores in multiple
datacenters, without distributed transactions, and with the ability to
alternately execute out of each datacenter;  syncing protocols that can fail
or sync stale data; distributed clients that cache data and then write old
back to the central store; a NoSQL database that doesn't have transactions
between updates of multiple related key-value records; application level
integrity checks; client drivenoptimistic locking.Sounds a lot like many
evolving, loosely coupled, autonomous, distributed systems these days. How do
you solve these consistency problems? Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix talks
about how they solved theirs in his excellent presentation, NoSQL @ Netflix :
Part 1, given to a packed crowd at aCloud Computing Meetup. You might be
inclined to say how silly it is to have these problems in the first place, but
just hold on. See if you might share some of their problems, before getting
all judgy:Netfli</p><p>6 0.18811131 <a title="925-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-24-The_State_of_NoSQL_in_2012.html">1180 high scalability-2012-01-24-The State of NoSQL in 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Read/WriteWeb has a good article talking about the scalability
issues of relational databases and how Dynamo solves them:Amazon Dynamo: The
Next Generation Of Virtual Distributed Storage. But since Dynamo is just
another frustrating walled garden protected by barbed wire and guard dogs, its
relevance is somewhat overstated.Update:Greg Lindenhas a take on the paper
where he questions some of Amazon's design choices: emphasizing write
availability over fast reads, a lack of indexing support, use of random
distribution for load balancing, and punting on some scalability issues.Werner
Vogels, Amazon's avuncular CTO, just announced a newpaperon the internal
database technology Amazon uses to handle tens of millions customers. I'll
dive into more details later, but I thought you'd want to read it hot off the
blog. The bad news is it won't be a service. They are keeping this tech not so
secret, but very safe. Happily, it's another real-life example to learn from.

<p>Introduction: Not surprisingly opinions onSimpleDBvary from it sucks, don't take my
database, to it will change the world, who needs a database anyway? From
aquick survey of the blogosphere, here's where SimpleDB stands at the
moment:SimpleDB ConsNo SLA. We don't know how reliable it will be, how fast it
will be, or how consistent the performance will be.Consistency constraints are
relaxed. Reading data immediately after a write may not reflect the latest
updates. To programmers used to transactions, this may be surprising, but many
people think this is one of the tradeoffs that needs to be made to
scale.Database is a core competency. If you don't control your database you
can't out compete your competition.When your database is out of your control
you can't guarantee it will work properly. You can't create the proper indexes
and other optimizations.No join or IN operator. You'll need to do multiple
client side calls to simulate joins, which will be slow.No stored procedures,
referential integrity,</p><p>5 0.72417349 <a title="925-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-04-Damn%2C_Which_Database_do_I_Use_Now%3F.html">736 high scalability-2009-11-04-Damn, Which Database do I Use Now?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With so many database options available these days, like for the rest of life,
it's natural to wonder how it allfits together. Amazon complicated, or rather
expanded the available options by introducing RDS, theirrelational database
service. RDS is MySQL safely cocooned as a manageable cloud element, resting
boldly within an energy providing elasticCPU pool, supported by a
virtuallyinfinite supplyof verycapable virtualized storage.MySQL in AWS isnow
easyto start, stop, monitor, backup, snapshot, expand, and effortlessly move
up and down the instance hierarchy. What it's not, contrary to what you might
expect, is a scale-out solution, it's a scale-up solution. You get more by
buying a bigger instance, not by horizontally adding more instances. There's
alimit. Admittedly a larger limit now with Amazon's newhigh memory
instances.That's OK, well maybe not for people who helped grow Amazon's
ecosystem by offering a similar product, but so many projects use MySQL that

<p>Introduction: In an audacious move for such an established property, Netflix is moving their
website out of the comfort of their own datacenter and into the wilds of the
Amazon cloud. This paper by Netflix's Siddharth "Sid" Anand,Netflix's
Transition to High-Availability Storage Systems, gives a detailed look at this
transition and does a deep dive on SimpleDB best practices, focussing
especially on techniques useful to those who are making the move from a
RDBMS.Sid is going to give a talk at QCon based on this paper and he would
appreciate your feedback. So if you have any comments or thoughts please
comment here or email Sid atr39132@hotmail.com or Twitter at @r39132 Here's
the introduction from the paper:Circa late 2008, Netflix had a single data
center. This single data center raised a few concerns. As a single-point-of-
failure (a.k.a. SPOF), it represented a liability - data center outages meant
interruptions to service and negative customer impact. Additionally, with

<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom
for Vertical Scaling Simplifies EverythingThe beauty of higher hardware
performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This
has always been the allure ofvertical scalingand is well realized by SSDs
through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as
important, high densities.We have a few early examples showing the performance

<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood
out:Twitter no lon</p><p>4 0.94767159 <a title="925-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-HotPads_Shows_the_True_Cost_of_Hosting_on_Amazon.html">619 high scalability-2009-06-05-HotPads Shows the True Cost of Hosting on Amazon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mather Corgan, president of HotPads,gave a great talkon how HotPads uses AWS
to run their real estate search engine. I loved the presentation for a few
reasons:It gives real costs on on their servers, how many servers they have,
what they are used for, and exactly how they use S2, EBS, CloudFront and other
AWS services. This is great information for anybody trying to architect a
system and wondering where to run it.HotPads is a "real" application. It's a
small company and at 4.5 million page-views/month it's large but not super
large. It has custom server side components like indexing engines, image
processing, and background database update engines for syncing new real estate
data. And it also stores a lot of images and has low latency requirements.This
a really good example mix of where many companies are or would like to be with
their applications.Their total costs are about $11K/month, which is about what
they were paying at their previous provider. I found this is a little

is the scalar field in state space, then scalability is just it's

scalability, elasticity". Brilliant! @Guerrero_FJ: Always remember:
'scalability problems should be solved when there are scalability problems.'

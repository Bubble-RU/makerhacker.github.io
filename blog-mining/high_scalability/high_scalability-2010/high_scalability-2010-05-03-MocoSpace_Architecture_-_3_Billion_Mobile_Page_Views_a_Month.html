<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300 thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?

<p>Introduction: With Lavabit  shutting down Â under  murky circumstances , it seems fitting to  repost an old  (2009), yet still very good post by  Ladar Levison  on Lavabit's architecture. I don't know how much of this information is still current, but it should give you a general idea what Lavabit was all about.
  
 Getting to Know You 
 What is the name of your system and where can we find out more about it?

 What is your system for? 

Lavabit is a mid-sized email service provider. We currently have about 140,000 registered users with more than 260,000 email addresses. While most of our accounts belong to individual users, we also provide corporate email services to approximately 70 companies.

 Why did you decide to build this system?

<p>Introduction: Update:  Presentation: Behind the Scenes at MySpace.com . Dan Farino, Chief Systems Architect at MySpace shares details of some of MySpace's cool internal operations tools.   MySpace.com  is one of the fastest growing site on the Internet with 65 million subscribers and 260,000 new users registering each day. Often criticized for poor performance, MySpace has had to tackle scalability issues few other sites have faced. How did they do it?

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead:Â doing something useful with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales are finally fulfilling their destiny:Â  slaughtering PCs  in the sales arena. And it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standaloneÂ apps anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend systems.
    
While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company facing those same exact problems right now is  Medialets , a mobile rich media ad platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads, though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of defeating the mobile device data deluge.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Dave Hagler  Systems Architect at AOL. 
  The AOL homepages receive more than  8 million visitors per day . Â Thatâs more daily viewers than Good Morning America or the Today Show on television. Â Over a billion page views are served each month. Â AOL.com has been a major internet destination since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.
   The architecture for AOL.com is in itâs 5th generation . Â It has essentially been rebuilt from scratch 5 times over two decades. Â The current architecture was designed 6 years ago. Â Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along the way, but the overall design remains largely intact. Â The code, tools, development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very stable.
  The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations and  totals around 25 people . Â The majority are in Dulles, Virginia</p><p>3 0.81139404 <a title="821-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-16-Cinchcast_Architecture_-_Producing_1%2C500_Hours_of_Audio_Every_Day.html">1284 high scalability-2012-07-16-Cinchcast Architecture - Producing 1,500 Hours of Audio Every Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Dr. Aleksandr Yampolskiy , CTO ofÂ  CinchcastÂ  andÂ  BlogTalkRadio ,Â where he oversees Engineering, QA, TechOps, Telephony, and Product teams. 
 
  Cinchcast    provides solutions that allow companies to create, share, measure and monetize audio content to reach and engage the people that are most important to their business.Â  Our technology integrates conference bridge with live audio streaming to simplify online events and enhance participant engagement. The Cinchcast technology is also used to power  Blogtalkradio   , the worldâs largest audio social network. Today our platform produces and distributes over 1,500 hours of original content every day.Â Â  In this article, we describe the engineering decisions we have made in order to scale our platform to support this scale of data.

<p>Introduction: ThePort Network's Director of Engineering, TJ Muehleman was kind of enough to share some of the architectural details for their white label social media system. It currently runs about 50 social networks varying in size from less than 1000 members to more than 300,000 members, all on a Microsoft stack. In addition to their social networking platform, they offer Javascript APIs and web service APIs (both REST and SOAP) which account for a significant percentage of overall system usage.  ThePort is an excellent example of a real world in-the-trenches product offering real value to customers.  One of the most interesting problems they have to solve is multi-tenancy. How do you provide good performance, complete customization, support, develop new features, and provide individual search indexes for each customer? It's not an easy problem to solve.  How did they solve their problems and build a successful system?Â

<p>Introduction: ESPN went on airin 1978. In those 30+ years think of the wonders we've seen!
When I think of ESPN I think of a world wide brand that is the very definition
of prime time. And it shows in their stats. ESPN.com peaks at 100,000 requests
per second. Their peak event is, not surprisingly, the World Cup. But would
you be surprised to learn ESPN is powered by only a few hundred servers and a
couple of dozen engineers? I was.And would you be surprised to learn ESPN is
undergoing a fundamental transition from an Enterprise architecture to one
capable of handling web scale loads driven by increasing mobile usage,
personalization, and a service orientation? Again, thinking ESPN was just
about watching sports on TV, I was surprised. ESPN is becoming much more than
that. ESPN is becoming a sports platform. How does ESPN handle all of this
complexity, responsibility, change, and load? Unlike most every other profile
on HighScalability. The fascinating story of ESPN's architecture is told

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO of  MocoSpace , describing the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile Web; their multi-tiered,  read/write, local/distributed caching system; selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.
 
MocoSpace is a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser, ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web. Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging, music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs. The monetization strategy is focused on</p><p>2 0.96737021 <a title="821-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-23-Paper%3A_CRDTs%3A_Consistency_without_concurrency_control.html">963 high scalability-2010-12-23-Paper: CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For a great Christmas read forget  The Night Before Christmas , a heart warming poem written by Clement Moore for his children, that created the modern idea of Santa Clause we all know and anticipate each Christmas eve. Instead, curl up with a some potentÃÂ  eggnog , nog being any drink made with rum, and readÃÂ  CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control ÃÂ by Mihai Letia, Nuno PreguiÄÂ§a, and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),  a data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent .
 
From the introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed consistency issues:
  

Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach [</p><p>3 0.96687061 <a title="821-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-02-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_2%2C_2012.html">1203 high scalability-2012-03-02-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 2, 2012</a></p>

 Quotable quotes:             
 
  @karmafile : "Scalability" is a much more evil word than we make it out to be 
  @ostaquet : More hardware won't solve #SQL resp. time issues; proper indexing does. 
  @datachick : All computing technology is the rearrangement of data. Data is the center of the universe 
 â @jamesurquhart : "Complexity is a characteristic of the system, not of the parts in it." 
 
 
 Data is the star of the cat walk, looking fierce in Ilya Katsov's impeccably constructed post onÂ  NoSQL Data Modeling Techniques : In this article I provide a short comparison of NoSQL system families from the data modeling point of view and digest several common modeling techniques.  
 Peter Burns  talks computer nanosecond time scales Â as a human might experience them. Your memory == computer registers , L1 cache == papers kept close by, L2 cache == books, RAM == the library down the street, and going to disk is a 3 year odessy for data.

<p>Introduction: This is a hilarious presentation by  Josh Berkus , called  Scale Fail , given atÂ O'Reilly MySQL CE 2011. Josh is entertaining, well spoken, and cleverly hides insight inside chaos. And he makes some dang good points along the way.
  Josh has a problem, you see Josh has learned how to make sites that are both scalable and reliable. So he's puzzled why companies "whose downtime interfaces (Twitter) are more well known than their uptime interfaces"Â get all the attention, respect, and money forÂ being failures. Just doing your job doesn't make you a hero.Â Â You need these self-inflicted wounds in-order to have the war stories to share at conferences.Â They get the attention. Just doing your job is boring. This is so unfair in that way life can be.Â 
 
  
 
So if you want to turn the tables and take the low road to fame and fortune, here's Josh's program for learning how not to scale:

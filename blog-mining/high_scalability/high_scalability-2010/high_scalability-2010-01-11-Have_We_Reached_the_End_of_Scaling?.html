<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things).
That's why scaling Facebook is hardsays Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of
Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and
Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why
would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional
web sites? Let's find out.Traditional websites are easier to scale than social
networking sites for two reasons:They usually access only their own data and
common cached data.Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one
time.Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your
profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the
website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around
single records usingdistributed hashing schemes. And since only a few percent
of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little RAM cache
to handle a</p><p>5 0.18592249 <a title="758-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-15-The_Amazing_Collective_Compute_Power_of_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">778 high scalability-2010-02-15-The Amazing Collective Compute Power of the Ambient Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.Earlier we talked about
how a single botnet could harness more compute power than our largest super
computers. Well, that's just the start of it. The amount of computer power
available to the Ambient Cloud will be truly astounding.2 Billion Personal
ComputersThe number of personal computers is still growing. By 2014 one
estimate is there will be2 billion PCs. That's a giant reservoir of power to
exploit, especially considering these new boxes are stuffed with multiple
powerful processors and gigabytes of memory.7 Billion SmartphonesBy now it's
common wisdom smartphones are the computing platform of the future. It's
plausible to assume the total number ofmobile phonesin use will roughly equal
the number of people on earth. That's 7 billion smartphones.Smartphones aren't
just tiny little wannabe computers anymore either. They are real computers and

<p>Introduction: "I'll never need to scale so why bother? We aren't Twitter or Facebook or
Google after all." This is the most common email I get, a question in the form
of a thinly disguised rationalization for not having to worry about scaling.
And in these days of giant transformer-like machines they are probably right.
But what if there areBarry Bonds enhancing type forces at work that argue for
the chances of your needing to scale being higher than you think?And if that
happens, how will you cross the scalability chasm? Will you want to completely
change your architecture or evolve it from a tool-chain that was meant to
scale from the start? Architecturally, that's the question you have to answer.
Today's tool-chains are making it possible to grow a system from small to
large without needing to implement complete architectural phase changes at
various scale inflection points, but that's a different topic. We're trying to
think about why you may actually need to scale, that is the question.Tumblr i</p><p>5 0.75039834 <a title="758-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-05-Scalability_Perspectives_%234%3A_Kevin_Kelly_%E2%80%93_One_Machine.html">460 high scalability-2008-12-05-Scalability Perspectives #4: Kevin Kelly – One Machine</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.Have we reached the end
of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The
End of" headlines. We've reachedThe End of Historybecause the Western liberal
democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the
final form of human government." We've reachedThe End of Sciencebecause of the
"fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions."
We've even reachedThe End of Theorybecause all answers can be found in the
continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're
atThe End of the World?Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began
to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?For a while I thought
this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is
because of the slow down of potential articles at

<p>Introduction: Travis Reeder inSpikability - An Application's Ability to Handle Unknown
and/or Inconsistent Load gives four good ways of handling spikey loads:Have
more resources than you'll ever need. Estimate the maximum traffic you'll need
and keep that many servers running. Downside is you are paying for capacity
you aren't using.Disable features during high loads. Reduce load by disabling
features or substituting in lighter weight features. Downside is users to have
access to features.Auto scaling. Launch new servers in response to load.
Downsides are it's complicated to setup and slow to respond. Random spikes
will cause cycling of instances going up and down.Use message queues. Queues
soak up work requests during traffic spikes. More servers can be started to
process work from the queue. Resources aren't wasted and features are
disabled. Downside is increased latency.</p><p>3 0.87456834 <a title="758-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-27-Product%3A_Munin_Monitoriting_Tool.html">34 high scalability-2007-07-27-Product: Munin Monitoriting Tool</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Muninthe monitoring tool surveys all your computers and remembers what it saw.
It presents all the information in graphs through a web interface. Its
emphasis is on plug and play capabilities. After completing a installation a
high number of monitoring plugins will be playing with no more effort.Using
Munin you can easily monitor the performance of your computers, networks,
SANs, applications, weather measurements and whatever comes to mind. It makes
it easy to determine "what's different today" when a performance problem crops
up. It makes it easy to see how you're doing capacity-wise on any resources.</p><p>4 0.86802435 <a title="758-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-The_7_Stages_of_Scaling_Web_Apps.html">391 high scalability-2008-09-23-The 7 Stages of Scaling Web Apps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical
successful website goes through:Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture,
low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers,
database server, and internal storage.Stage 2 - More of the same, just
bigger.Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache
static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding.Stage 4 - The Pain
Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too
long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content,
significant re-architecting for DB.Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink
entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters,
using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster.Stage 6
- Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database
architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again,
optimizing some code,</p><p>5 0.86799985 <a title="758-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-29-100%25_on_Amazon_Web_Services%3A_Soocial.com_-_a_lesson_of_porting_your_service_to_Amazon.html">477 high scalability-2008-12-29-100% on Amazon Web Services: Soocial.com - a lesson of porting your service to Amazon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Simone Brunozzi, technology evangelist for Amazon Web Services in Europe,
describes how Soocial.com was fully ported to Amazon web services.
----------------This period of the year I decided to dedicate some time to
better understand how our customers use AWS, therefore I spent some online
time with Stefan Fountain and the nice guys at Soocial.com, a "one address
book solution to contact management", and I would like to share with you some
details of their IT infrastructure, which now runs 100% on Amazon Web
Services!In the last few months, they've been working hard to cope with tens
of thousands of users and to get ready to easily scale to millions. To make
this possible, they decided to move ALL their architecture to Amazon Web
Services. Despite the fact that they were quite happy with their previous
hosting provider, Amazon proved to be the way to go.-----------------Read the

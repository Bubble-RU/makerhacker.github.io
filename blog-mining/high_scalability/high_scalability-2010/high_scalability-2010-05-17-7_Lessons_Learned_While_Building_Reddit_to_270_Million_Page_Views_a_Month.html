<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg, the first paid employee at reddit, teaches us a lot about how
to create a successful social site in a really good talk he gave at the RAMP
conference. Watch it here at Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion-
Pitfalls and Lessons.Jeremy uses a virtue and sin approach. Examples of the
mistakes made in scaling reddit are shared and it turns out they did a lot of
good stuff too. Somewhat of a shocker is that Jeremy is now a Reliability
Architect at Netflix, so we get a little Netflix perspective thrown in for
free.Some of the lessons that stood out most for me: Think of SSDs as cheap
RAM, not expensive disk. When reddit moved from spinning disks to SSDs for the
database the number of servers was reduced from 12 to 1 with a ton of
headroom. SSDs are 4x more expensive but you get 16x the performance. Worth
the cost. Give users a little bit of power, see what they do with it, and turn
the good stuff into features. One of the biggest revelations for me was how
much reddit le</p><p>3 0.21363761 <a title="828-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-09-6_Scalability_Lessons.html">898 high scalability-2010-09-09-6 Scalability Lessons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund not only put together a few interesting scalability patterns,
he also came up with a few interesting scalability lessons:Lesson #1. Put
Smarty compile and template caches on an active-active DRBD cluster with high
load and your servers will DIE!Lesson #2. Don't use out-of-the-box
configurations.Lesson #3. Single points of contention will eventually become a
bottleneck.Lesson #4. Plan in advance. Lesson #5. Offload your databases as
much as possible.Lesson #6. File systems matter and can run out of space /
inodes.For more details and explanations see the original post.</p><p>4 0.18657048 <a title="828-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-12-How_Google_Taught_Me_to_Cache_and_Cash-In.html">703 high scalability-2009-09-12-How Google Taught Me to Cache and Cash-In</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A user named Apathyon how Reddit scales some of their features, shares some
advice he learned while working at Google and other major companies.To be
fair, I [Apathy] was working at Google at the time, and every job I held
between 1995 and 2005 involved at least one of the largest websites on the
planet. I didn't come up with any of these ideas, just watched other smart
people I worked with who knew what they were doing and found (or wrote) tools
that did the same things. But the theme is always the same:Cache everything
you can and store the rest in some sort of database (not necessarily
relational and not necessarily centralized).Cache everything that doesn't
change rapidly. Most of the time you don't have to hit the database for
anything other than checking whether the users' new message count has
transitioned from 0 to (1 or more).Cache everything--templates, user message
status, the front page components--and hit the database once a minute or so to

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.

<p>Introduction: My first post, please be gentle. I know it is long. You are all like doctors -
the more info, the better the diagnosis.-----------What is the best way to
store a list of all of your friends in the memcached cache (a simple boolean
saying “yes this user is your friend”, or “no”)? Think Robert Scoble (26,000+
“friends”) on Twitter.com. He views a list of ALL existing users, and in this
list, his friends are highlighted.I came up with 4 possible methods:--store in
memcache as an array, a list of all the "yes" friend ID's--store your friend
ID's as individual elements.--store as a hash of arrays based on last 3 digits
of friend's ID -- so have up to 1000 arrays for you.--comma-delimited string
of ID's as one elementI'm using the second one because I think it is faster to
update. The single array or hash of arrays feels like too much overhead
calculating and updating – and even just loading – to check for existence of a
friend.The key is FRIEND[small ID#]_[big ID#]. The value is 1.This way</p><p>5 0.79170036 <a title="828-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling_Pinterest_-_From_0_to_10s_of_Billions_of_Page_Views_a_Month_in_Two_Years.html">1440 high scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling Pinterest - From 0 to 10s of Billions of Page Views a Month in Two Years</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a
firm schema. I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the
overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding. The data is
essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song. This
lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and
Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together. This will be in
a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by
artist album or song. By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song
I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by. The problem is
that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to
shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what
are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it? Should I go
with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table? Perhaps it might be

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time:Test your sense of scale. Is this image of
something microscopic or macroscopic?Find out.Quotable Quotes:fidotron: It
feels like we've gone in one big circle, where first we move the DB on to a
separate machine for performance, yet now more computation will go back to
being done nearer the data (like Hadoop) and we'll try to pretend it's all
just one giant computer again.@pbailis: Building systems from the ground up
with distribution, scale, and availability in mind is much easier than
retrofitting single-node systems.@merv: #awsreinvent Jassy: Netflix has
10,000s of EC2 instances. They are the final deployment scenario: All In. And

promise" and realize that flattening your callback effects is actually quite
nice.@jimblomo: A Note on Distributed Computing advised against treating

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want
to take a whack at it.I have a problem I'd like to have your view on. I've
looked around a lot, and I haven't found a definite answer. The question is
this:Is it true that for a scalable web-based system targeting millions of
users (hopefully), using Microsoft technology(.Net/SQL Server) over open
source technologies like python/ruby/php and mysql (mariadb) / postgresql will
cost you more? Is there any justification for paying up for Microsoft
licenses(OS, SQL Server, â&euro;Ś)?I am in charge of selecting the technology toolbox
for a startup which is going to build a scalable public web platform. I've
worked as a developer and database developer/admin (mainly as a DBA) using
different platforms and technologies, but my main focus is on Microsoft
technology. I've considered all other important factors for this decision, and
at the end, I always come back to the question of money. When I finish
developing the first st</p><p>5 0.93694401 <a title="828-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-20-what_is_j2ee_stack.html">162 high scalability-2007-11-20-what is j2ee stack</a></p>

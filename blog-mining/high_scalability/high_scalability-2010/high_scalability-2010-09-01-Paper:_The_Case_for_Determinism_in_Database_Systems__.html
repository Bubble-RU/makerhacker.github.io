</p><p>8 The root of these problems lies in the isolation property within ACID. [sent-13, score-0.39]
</p><p>9 So if three transactions (let's call them A, B and C) are active at the same time on an ACID system, it will guarantee that the resulting database state will be the same as if it had run them one-by-one. [sent-15, score-0.257]

This paper presents a novel protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top of a sharded data store.

<p>Introduction: The abstract for the talk given by Bob Ippolito, co-founder and CTO of Mochi Media, Inc:
   Building large systems on top of a traditional single-master RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This talk explores the landscape of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability. Is your application a good fit for caches, bloom filters, bitmap indexes, column stores, distributed key/value stores, or document databases? Learn how they work (in theory and practice) and decide for yourself.   
Bob does an excellent job highlighting different products and the key concepts to understand when pondering the wide variety of new database offerings. It's unlikely you'll be able to say oh, this is the database for me after watching the presentation, but you will be much better informed on your options. And I imagine slightly confused as to what to do :-)  An interesting observation in the talk is that the more robust products are internal</p><p>4 0.17387931 <a title="890-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-17-Against_all_the_odds.html">658 high scalability-2009-07-17-Against all the odds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article not about Mariah Carey, or its song. It's about Storing System, Database.   
First let's describe what means by odds:  In my social network, I found 93% of the mainstream developers sanctify the database, or at least consider it in any data persistence challenge as the ultimate, superhero, and undefeatable solution.  I think this problem come from the education, personally, and some companies also I think it's involved in this.  To start to fix this bad thinking, we all should agree in the following points:
  
 Every challenge have its own solutions, so whatever you want to save/persistent, there are always many solutions. For example the Web search engines, such as: Google, Kngine, Yahoo, Bing don't use database at all instead we use Indexes (Index file) for better performance. 
   
 The Database in general whatever the vendor it's slow compared with other solutions such as: Key-Value storing system, Index file, DHT. 
   
 The Database currently employ Relation Data model</p><p>5 0.16606614 <a title="890-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-28-VoltDB_Decapitates_Six_SQL_Urban_Myths_and_Delivers_Internet_Scale_OLTP_in_the_Process.html">849 high scalability-2010-06-28-VoltDB Decapitates Six SQL Urban Myths and Delivers Internet Scale OLTP in the Process</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?  Mike Stonebraker , the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world, hopes you get something like his new database,  VoltDB : a pure SQL, pure ACID, pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a second. VoltDB  claims to be  100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster than  Cassandra , and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.
  Will VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...

<p>Introduction: Teams from  Princeton  and CMU are  working together  to solve one of the most difficult problems in the repertoire: scalable geo-distributed data stores. Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple datacenter database functionality for some time, but there's still a general lack of available systems that work for complex data scenarios.
 
The ideas in this paper-- Don’t Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-Area Storage with COPS --are different. It's not another eventually consistent system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally consistent system that achieves  ALPS  system properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL, etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete successfully), Low-latency (operations complete quickly (single digit milliseconds)), Partition-tolerant (operates with a partition), and Scalable (just a</p><p>4 0.86839449 <a title="890-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-01-Myth%3A_Eric_Brewer_on_Why_Banks_are_BASE_Not_ACID_-_Availability_Is_Revenue_.html">1450 high scalability-2013-05-01-Myth: Eric Brewer on Why Banks are BASE Not ACID - Availability Is Revenue </a></p>
<p>Introduction: In   NoSQL: Past, Present, Future    Eric Brewer  has a particularly fine section on explaining the often hard to understand ideas of   BASE   (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent),   ACID   (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability),   CAP   (Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in banking.
    Myth   : Money is important, so banks   must   use transactions to keep money safe and consistent, right? 
    Reality   : Banking transactions are inconsistent, particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over Consistency. 
   Why?   1)  Availability correlates with revenue and consistency generally does not.  2)  Historically there was never an idea of perfect communication so everything was partitioned.

<p>Introduction: So far every massively scalable database is a bundle of compromises. For some the weak guarantees of Amazon's  eventual consistency  model are too cold. For many the strong guarantees of standard RDBMS  distributed transactions  are too hot. Google App Engine tries to get it just right with  entity groups .

<p>Introduction: Can you have your ACID cake and eat your distributed database too? Yes explains Daniel Abadi, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Yale University, in an epic post,  The problems with ACID, and how to fix them without going NoSQL , coauthored with  Alexander Thomson , on their paper  The Case for Determinism in Database Systems . We've already seen  VoltDB  offer the best of both worlds, this sounds like a completely different approach.
 
The solution, they propose, is: 
  

  ...an architecture and execution model that avoids deadlock, copes with failures without aborting transactions, and achieves high concurrency. The paper contains full details, but the basic idea is to use ordered locking coupled with optimistic lock location prediction, while exploiting deterministic systems' nice replication properties in the case of failures.  

  
  The problem they are trying to solve is:

<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of  many of the scalability issues that we face today with traditional  database approach.
 
I think that the main reason so many people  have come to see SQL as the source of all evil is the fact that,  traditionally, the query language was burned into the database  implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to the  traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.
 
This view has  brought on a flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a  different aspect that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach,  such as a document model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as  Key/Value query.
 
Most of the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject,  and tend to use query semantics and architecture interchangeably. In  Part I  of this post i tried to provide quick overview of what  each query term stands for in the context of the NoSQL world .  Part II  illustrates those ide</p><p>3 0.8467347 <a title="890-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-10-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_10th%2C_2014.html">1576 high scalability-2014-01-10-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 10th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is adding   Elastic IP Addresses   and   Availability Zones  .     Elastic IP addresses are far better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight with   Jessica Alba   and they are:        Static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures by programmatica</p><p>5 0.84458613 <a title="890-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-26-End-To-End_Performance_Study_of_Cloud_Services.html">831 high scalability-2010-05-26-End-To-End Performance Study of Cloud Services</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cloud computing promises a number of advantages for the deployment of data-intensive applications. Most prominently, these include reducing cost with a pay-as-you-go pricing model and (virtually) unlimited throughput by adding servers if the workload increases. At the  Systems Group , ETH Zurich, we did an extensive  end-to-end performance study  to compare the major cloud offerings regarding their ability to fulfill these promises and their implied cost.
 
The focus of the work is on transaction processing (i.e., read and update work-loads), rather than analytics workloads. We used the  TPC-W , a standardized benchmark simulating a Web-shop, as the baseline for our comparison. The TPC-W defines that users are simulated through emulated browsers (EB) and issue page requests, called web-interactions (WI), against the system. As a major modification to the benchmark, we constantly increase the load from 1 to 9000 simultaneous users to measure the scalability and cost variance of the syst</p><p>6 0.8426407 <a title="890-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_28th%2C_2014.html">1603 high scalability-2014-02-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 28th, 2014</a></p>

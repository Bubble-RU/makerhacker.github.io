<p>Introduction: Several readers had follow-up questions in response toHow FarmVille Scales to
Harvest 75 Million Players a Month. Here are Luke's response to those
questions (and a few of mine).How does social networking makes things easier
or harder?The primary interesting aspect of social networking games is how you
wind up with a graph of connected users who need to be access each other's
data on a frequent basis. This makes the overall dataset difficult if not
impossible to partition.What are examples of the Facebook calls you try to
avoid and how they impact game play?We can make a call for facebook friend
data to retrieve information about your friends playing the game. Normally, we
show a friend ladder at the bottom of the game that shows friend information,
including name and facebook photo. Can you say where your cache is, what form
it takes, and how much cached there is? Do you have a peering relationship

<p>Introduction: Release early and often. A/B testing. Creating a landing page and buying ads
on AdSense. All are ways of providing quick feedback in order to validate an
idea. If you are like Zynga, with 250 million active users a month, how do you
cost effectively prove out a game that could flop or get 90 million users
(like CityVille) in an instant?Zynga handles this problem inlle an innovative
way, by inverting the typical cloud burst scenario that has excess traffic
flowing from a datacenter to a cloud, to having a game start in the cloud and
then moving to the datacenter once the game has proved popular enough to
keep.This process is nicely described by Charles Babcock in Lessons From
FarmVille: How Zynga Uses The Cloud, in an interview with Allan Leinwand, CTO
of infrastructure engineering at Zynga.When paired down to its essence,
Zynga's strategy goes something like this:Games are risky.  Even with all
their experience, Zynga can't know how many people will play a game or how
fast the adoption</p><p>4 0.193123 <a title="774-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-13-7_Sensible_and_1_Really_Surprising_Way_EVE_Online_Scales_to_Play_Huge_Games.html">1405 high scalability-2013-02-13-7 Sensible and 1 Really Surprising Way EVE Online Scales to Play Huge Games</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact
socially with friends usingPlayfishgames on social platforms like The
Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the
fastest growing segment of the game industry:social gaming, which is the love
child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early
adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud
servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by
why EA bought them for$300 millionand they think a$1 billion gameis possible):
building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile
gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve
systems, agile development and deployment, andselling virtual goodas a
business model.How can a small company make all this happen? To explain the

world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average
of 130 friends.Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a
homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those
requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then
rendered.Different events put different stresses on different parts of

<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

<p>Introduction: Authored by Chris Fregly:  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS
Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.Ahead of the
upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi's
recentpresentationat an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few
of my recentFluxcapacitor.com consulting engagements, I've compiled a list of
10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS.1) Query AWS resource
metadata Can't remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge
cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?
awsnow.infois the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.
Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You're in luck.
There's now aREST API, as well!Note:  These are default soft limits and will
vary by account.2) Tame your S3 buckets Delete an entire S3 bucket with a
single CLI command:  aws s3 rb s3://\--forceRecursively copy a

<p>Introduction: Several readers had follow-up questions in response to this article. Luke's
responses can be found inHow FarmVille Scales - The Follow-up.If real farming
was as comforting as it is inZynga's mega-hit Farmvillethen my family would
have probably never left those harsh North Dakota winters. None of the scary
bedtime stories my Grandma used to tell about farming are true in
FarmVille.Farmersmake money, plants grow, and animals never visit thered barn.
I guess it's just that keep-your-shoes-clean back-to-the-land charm that has
helped make FarmVille the "largest game in the world" in such an astonishingly
short time.How did FarmVille scale a web application to handle 75 million
players a month? Fortunately FarmVille's Luke Rajlich has agreed to let us in
on a few their challenges and secrets. Here's what Luke has to say...The
format of the interview was that I sent Luke a few general questions and he

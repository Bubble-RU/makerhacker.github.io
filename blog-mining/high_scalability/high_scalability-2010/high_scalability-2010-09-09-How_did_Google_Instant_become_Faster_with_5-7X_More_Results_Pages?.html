<p>Introduction: The world has changed. And some things that should not have been forgotten,
were lost. I found these words from the Lord of the Rings echoing in my head
as I listened to a fascinating presentation by Luiz Andre Barroso,
Distinguished Engineer at Google, concerning Google's legendary past, golden
present, and apocryphal future. His talk, Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering
the Teenage Decade, was given at theFederated Computing Research Conference.
Luiz clearly knows his stuff and was early at Google, so he has a deep and
penetrating perspective on the technology. There's much to learn from, think
about, and build.Lord of the Rings applies at two levels. At the change level,
Middle Earth went throughthree ages. While listening to Luiz talk, it seems so
has Google: Batch (indexes calculated every month), Warehouse (the datacenter
is the computer), and Instant (make it all real-time). At the "what was
forgot" level, in the Instant Age section of the talk,  a common theme was the
challenge</p><p>4 0.14363658 <a title="899-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex_Architecture.html">258 high scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Anatomy of a crash in a new part of Yandex written in Django. Writing
to a magic session variable caused an unexpected write into an InnoDB database
on every request. Writes took 6-7 seconds because of index rebuilding. Lots of
useful details on the sizing of their system, what went wrong, and how they
fixed it.Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their
search index. We only know a few fun facts about how they do things, nothing
at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I
thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with
Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:3.5 billion pages in the search
index.Over several thousand servers.35 million searches a day.Several data
centers around Russia.Two-layer architecture.The database is split in pieces
and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database
servers and brings it together for the user.Languages used: c++, perl, some
java.FreeBSD</p><p>5 0.13000134 <a title="899-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-11-Google%27s_Colossus_Makes_Search_Real-time_by_Dumping_MapReduce.html">900 high scalability-2010-09-11-Google's Colossus Makes Search Real-time by Dumping MapReduce</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As the Kings of scaling, when Google changes its search infrastructure over to
do something completely different, it's news. InGoogle search index splits
with MapReduce, an exclusive interview by Cade Metz with Eisar Lipkovitz, a
senior director of engineering at Google, we learn a bit more of the secret
scaling sauce behindGoogle Instant, Google's new faster, real-time search
system.The challenge for Google has been how to support a real-time world when
the core of their search technology, the famous MapReduce, is batch oriented.
Simple, they got rid of MapReduce. At least they got rid of MapReduce as the
backbone for calculating search indexes. MapReduce still excels as a general
query mechanism against masses of data, but real-time search requires a very
specialized tool, and Google built one. Internally the successor to Google's
famed Google File System, was code named Colossus.Details are slowly coming
out about their new goals and approach:Goal is to update the search index

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with Gabriel Weinberg, founder of Duck Duck Go and
general all around startup guru, on what DDG's architecture looks like in
2012.Innovative search engine upstart DuckDuckGo had30 million searchesin
February 2012 and averages over 1 million searches a day. It's being
positioned bysuper investor Fred Wilsonas a clean, private, impartial and fast
search engine. After talking with Gabriel I like what Fred Wilson said
earlier, it seems closer to the heart of the matter:We invested in DuckDuckGo
for the Reddit, Hacker News anarchists.                  Choosing DuckDuckGo
can be thought of as not just a technical choice, but a vote for revolution.
In an age when knowing your essence is not about about love or friendship, but
about more effectively selling you to advertisers, DDG is positioning
themselves as thedo not track alternative, keepers of theprivacy flame. You
will still be monetized of course, but in a more civilized and anonymous way.

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally
successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips
with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these
successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to
multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are
reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we
are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be
squashed.To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a
corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer
2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use
symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to
work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore
designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core
efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtaining</p><p>2 0.94458961 <a title="899-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-27-Paper%3A_Logic_and_Lattices_for_Distributed_Programming.html">1273 high scalability-2012-06-27-Paper: Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Neil Conwayfrom Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk ata meetup today
in San Francisco on a new paper: Logic and Lattices for Distributed
Programming \- extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. The
description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the
paper:Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong
consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability.
Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of
strong consistency can be very challenging. In this talk, I'll discuss work
from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed
programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative
programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis
technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually
consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a
broader range of programs, drawin</p><p>same-blog 3 0.92508447 <a title="899-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-09-How_did_Google_Instant_become_Faster_with_5-7X_More_Results_Pages%3F.html">899 high scalability-2010-09-09-How did Google Instant become Faster with 5-7X More Results Pages?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We don't have a lot of details on how Google pulled off their technically very
impressive Google Instant release, but inGoogle Instant behind the scenes,
they did share some interesting facts:Google was serving more than a billion
searches per day.With Google Instant they served 5-7X more results pages than
previously.Typical search results were returned in less than a quarter of
second.A team of 50+ worked on the project for an extended period of
time.AlthoughGoogleis associated with muscular data centers, they just didn't
throw more server capacity at the problem, they worked smarter too. What were
their general strategies?Increase backend server capacity.Add new caches to
handle high request rates while keeping results fresh while the web is
continuously crawled and re-indexed.Add User-state data to the back-ends to
keep track of the results pages already shown to a given user, preventing the
same results from being re-fetched repeatedly.Optimize page-rendering

<p>Introduction: If you just can't get enough high scalability talk you might want to take a
look GigaOm's Structure 08 conference. The slate of speakers looks
appropriately interesting and San Francisco is truly magical this time of
year. High Scalability readers even get a price break is you use the HIGHSCALE
discount code! I'll be on vacation so I won't see you there, but it looks like
a good time. For a nice change of pace consider visitingMoMAnext door. Here's
a blurb on the conference:A reminder to our readers about Structure 08,
GigaOm's upcomingconference dedicated to web infrastructure. In addition to
keynotesfrom leaders like Jim Crowe, chairman and CEO of Level 3Communications
and Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon, the event willfeature workshops from Google
App Engine, Microsoft and a specialworkshop from Fenwick and West who will
cover how to raise money foran infrastructure start up. Learn from the guru's

<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important. Jim Scheinman, former Bebo
and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to
scale as why they lost the social networking race:VB: Can you tell me a bit
about what you learned in your time at Friendster? JS:For me, it basically
came down to failed execution on the technology side -- we had millions of
Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log
in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in
to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling
us that if we didn't get our site working better soon, they'd be 'forced to
join' a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpaceâ&euro;Śthe
rest is history. To be fair to Friendster's technology team at the time, they
were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites
simply hadn't had to deal with prior to Friendster. As is often the case, the

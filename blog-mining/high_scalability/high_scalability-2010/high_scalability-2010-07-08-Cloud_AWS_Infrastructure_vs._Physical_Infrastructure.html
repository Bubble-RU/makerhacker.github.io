</p><p>3 In fact, regarding the latter, we can’t speak for clients (they are the ones holding the credit card) about infrastructure management, because we upload our application using the APIs provided and leave the entire infrastructure management to the service provider. [sent-8, score-0.773]
</p><p>4 Physical infrastructure    As far as physical infrastructure is concerned, I will examine the notion of self-hosted infrastructure and equally the notion of infrastructure supported by a hosting provider. [sent-11, score-1.291]
</p><p>5 A person with experience in the field, able to set up the infrastructure requirement is needed: the tool may change but the skills must still be available. [sent-25, score-0.364]
</p><p>6 Indeed, being able to pull up resources on the fly will enable infrastructure management to be scheduled and automated via scripts which will call up the APIs provided by Amazon enabling communication with its web services. [sent-31, score-0.483]
</p><p>7 The systems administrator’s craft is therefore evolving between a physical infrastructure and an AWS-type Cloud infrastructure: he is becoming more and more of a developer. [sent-34, score-0.555]
</p><p>8 As I mentioned earlier, one of the crucial differences between the two types of infrastructure is the flexibility and dynamism provided by the Cloud solution, compared to a traditional physical architecture (whether it is based on virtualization or not). [sent-37, score-0.741]
</p><p>9 You also have complete access to certain elements such as security groups (firewall) set for each instance… And that’s very useful. [sent-42, score-0.398]
</p><p>10 All the safety standards that need to be met in terms of fire protection, computer cooling, redundant electrical power supply, physical security against break-ins, distributing the hardware across 2 or more physical datacenters for disaster recovery, etc. [sent-46, score-0.65]
</p><p>11 To easily calculate how much your infrastructure will cost you, take advantage of the new calculator provided by Amazon:  Simple Monthly Calculator . [sent-57, score-0.345]
</p><p>12 Simple Monthly Calculator     You can do the comparison with the cost of your local infrastructure or with that of your hosting provider. [sent-59, score-0.359]
</p><p>13 However, it must be acknowledged that often the cosy aspects of “home”-hosted infrastructure can lead to a certain lack of rigor on many issues. [sent-67, score-0.465]
</p><p>14 Total visibility of our infrastructure is therefore not possible on Cloud. [sent-76, score-0.351]
</p><p>15 Unlike the specific contracts you may sign with your hosting providers, you must provide for these elements yourself, or regarding on-call support for example, you could out-source it to a facilities management company. [sent-90, score-0.448]
</p><p>16 Some traditional hosting providers offer packaged monitoring with their services. [sent-93, score-0.34]
</p><p>17 The first key point is that the level of security supplied in Amazon datacenters, not just physically but – equally importantly – in programmatically terms, will still be streets ahead of your average corporate computer room, even the datacenters of the smallest hosting providers. [sent-104, score-0.575]
</p><p>18 Firstly because that is Amazon’s business: a security problem revealed in their infrastructure would have immediate implications in terms of user reactions (and thus in terms of business). [sent-105, score-0.383]
</p><p>19 Conclusion     The evolving duties of infrastructure management can be clearly seen  in this first part: from handling physical resources by means of APIs,  underlying mechanisms ensuring data durability, availability of  services, etc. [sent-119, score-0.635]
</p><p>20 right up to server power supply and the physical security  of datacenters, all of which are supported transparently. [sent-120, score-0.368]

How do you scale an  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure? This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can use to make the most of Amazon’s dynamic approach, and the architectural model you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.
 
I base my report on my experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming (Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS (Geographic Information System). It’s true that my experience in gaming ( IsCool, The Game ) is currently the most representative in terms of scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU – daily active users – at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability and da</p><p>3 0.2288985 <a title="853-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-02-An_Epic_TripAdvisor_Update%3A_Why_Not_Run_on_the_Cloud%3F_The_Grand_Experiment..html">1331 high scalability-2012-10-02-An Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run on the Cloud?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Shawn Hsiao ,  Luke Massa , and  Victor Luu . Shawn runs  TripAdvisor ’s Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his team this past summer. This post is introduced by  Andy Gelfond , TripAdvisor’s head of engineering.   It's been a little over a year since our last post about the  TripAdvisor architecture . It has been an exciting year. Our business and team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown - we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:
  
 56M visitors per month 
 350M+ pages requests a day 
 120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large Hadoop cluster, and quickly growing 
  
We also had a very successful college intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were quickly on boarded and doing the same kind of work a</p><p>4 0.22268167 <a title="853-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Authored by  Chris Fregly   :  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.  
   Ahead of the upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi’s recent    presentation    at an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few of my recent    Fluxcapacitor.com    consulting engagements, I’ve compiled a list of 10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS. 
    1) Query AWS resource metadata  
      
   Can’t remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?     awsnow.info    is the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.  Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You’re in luck.  There’s now a    REST API   , as well!

 Urbandive  is an immersive view service launched by the  French YellowPages  which allows you to travel in cities in France thanks to a 360° view. Urbandive focuses on providing high definition pictures and accurate professional and social content. One of the biggest jobs was to enable a fast scalable architecture, because it was really difficult to forecast the traffic load at production time. Traffic load may be influenced if the service receives attention from users as a result of advertising.
 
Below you will find a summary of the goals we achieve by using a Ruby scheduler built on top of  Puppet  on  AWS  to create a complete infrastructure.

<p>Introduction: If you like the idea of exploiting market inconsistencies to lower your costs then you will love this  paper  and video from the Hot Cloud '12 conference:  Exploiting Hardware Heterogeneity within the Same Instance Type of Amazon EC2 .
 
The conclusion is interesting and is a source of good guidance:
  
 Amazon EC2 uses diversified hardware to host the same type of instance.   
 The hardware diversity results in performance variation.  
 In general, the variation between the fast instances and slow  instances can reach 40%. In some applications, the variation can even approach up to 60%.   
 By selecting fast instances within the same instance type,  Amazon EC2 users can acquire up to 30% of cost saving, if the fast instances have a relatively low probability.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Frédéric Faure   (architect at  Ysance )  on the differences between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frédéric was kind enough to translate the original French version of this article into English. 
 
I’ve been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such as  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) and a traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you. Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure. I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.

<p>Introduction: There has been an update on Pinterest:  Pinterest growth driven by Amazon cloud scalability  since our last post:  A Short on the Pinterest Stack for Handling 3+ Million Users .
 
With Pinterest we see a story very similar to that of  Instagram . Huge growth, lots of users, lots of data, with remarkably few employees, all on the cloud.
 
While it's true that both Pinterest and Instagram are not making great advances in  science and technology , that is more indicator of the easy power of today's commodity environments rather than a sign of Silicon Valley's lack of innovation. The numbers are so huge and the valuations are so high we naturally want some sort of fundamental technological revolution to underlie their growth. The revolution is more subtle. It really is just that easy to attain such growth these days, if you can execute on the right idea. Get used to it. This is the new normal.

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 2 ( part 1 ) of  an interview  I did for the  Boundary blog . 
 
 Boundary:  There’s another battle coming down the pike between Amazon (AWS) and Google (GCE). How should the CTO decide which one’s best? 
 
 Hoff:  Given that GCE is still closed to public access we have very little common experience on which to judge. The best way to decide is as always, by running a few experiments. Pick a few representative projects, a representative team, implement the projects on both infrastructures, crunch some numbers, figure out the bigger picture and then select the one you wanted in the first place   .
 
Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, recently  wrote about his experiences  on both platforms and found some interesting differences: AWS has a much richer set of services; GCE is on-demand only, so AWS can be cheaper; GCE has faster disk and faster network IO, especially between datacenters; GCE has faster boot times and can mount read-only partitions across multiple</p><p>4 0.95964473 <a title="853-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-24-The_State_of_NoSQL_in_2012.html">1180 high scalability-2012-01-24-The State of NoSQL in 2012</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Siddharth Anand , a senior member of LinkedIn's Distributed Data Systems team.  
 
 Preamble Ramble 
 
If you’ve been working in the online (e.g. internet) space over the past 3 years, you are no stranger to terms like “the cloud” and “NoSQL”.
 
In 2007, Amazon published a paper on  Dynamo . The paper detailed how Dynamo, employing a collection of techniques to solve several problems in fault-tolerance, provided a resilient solution to the on-line shopping cart problem. A few years go by while engineers at AWS toil in relative obscurity at standing up their public cloud.
 
It’s December 2008 and I am a member of Netflix’s Software Infrastructure team. We’ve just been told that there is something called the “CAP theorem” and because of it, we are to abandon our datacenter in hopes of leveraging Cloud Computing.
 
Huh?
 
A month into the investigation, we start wondering about our Oracle database. How are we are going to move it into the cloud?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Doug Judd , original creator of Hypertable and the CEO of Hypertable, Inc. 
 
 Hypertable delivers 2X better throughput in most tests -- HBase fails 41 and 167 billion record insert tests, overwhelmed by garbage collection -- Both systems deliver similar results for random read uniform test 
 
We recently conducted a test comparing the performance of Hypertable ( @hypertable ) version 0.9.5.5 to that of HBase ( @HBase ) version 0.90.4 (CDH3u2) running Zookeeper 3.3.4.  In this post, we summarize the results and offer explanations for the discrepancies. For the full test report, see  Hypertable vs. HBase II .
  Introduction  
Hypertable and HBase are both open source, scalable databases modeled after Google's proprietary Bigtable database.  The primary difference between the two systems is that Hypertable is written in C++, while HBase is written in Java.  We modeled this test after the one described in section 7 of the  Bigtable paper  and tuned both systems fo</p><p>6 0.95411813 <a title="853-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-02-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_2%2C_2011.html">1109 high scalability-2011-09-02-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 2, 2011</a></p>

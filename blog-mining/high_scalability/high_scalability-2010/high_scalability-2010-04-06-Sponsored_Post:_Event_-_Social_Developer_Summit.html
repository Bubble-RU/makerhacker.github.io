  DBMS Musings: Distinguishing Two Major Types of Column-Stores  by Daniel Abadi.  I have noticed that Bigtable, HBase, Hypertable, and Cassandra are being called column-stores with increasing frequency, due to their ability to store and access column families separately. This makes them appear to be in the same category as column-stores such as Sybase IQ, C-Store, Vertica, VectorWise, MonetDB, ParAccel, and Infobright, which also are able to access columns separately.

<p>Introduction: Update: Facebook pulls a Microsoft and embraces and extends by opening their platform to other social sites like Bebo. Very smart and unexpected. More info at  Facebook to let other sites access platform code .      This month's regular Facebook   Meetup   was held at Google and the topic of the day was   OpenSocial  . For those of you with real lives, OpenSocial "provides a common set of APIs for social applications across multiple websites." Over 200 excited people, hoping to do very exciting things, and dreaming of making an exciting pile of money, watched an OpenSocial presentation put on by a couple of appropriately knowledgeable evangelists. I could feel my social graph being more successfully monetized with each passing minute.      Normally the meetings are much smaller, but Google puts on a very nice spread, so I think people may have showed up to dine :-) Or they could have showed up to learn why and how they should code to the new uber social API.

<p>Introduction: Social Developer Summit  - June 29, 2010 - San Franciso, CA 
 
 A meeting of the technically social - Building, scaling, and profiting in a social age 
 
Whether it's  social games, social news, social discovery,   social search, or other forms of social solutions , developers  today are facing new  hurdles in building instantly scalable products.  As new technologies  emerge to address the challenges faced by social  application developers, it's  increasingly important to come together  for knowledge sharing purposes.
 
The first Social Developer Summit will bring  together social  application developers to  discuss the challenges, solutions,   and best practices for building applications in the rapidly expanding  social  web economy . At  the Social Developer Summit, industry  experts will share tips and case studies for   building high performance  social web products.

<p>Introduction: We saw in  Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?  scaling social networks is a lot harder than you might think. This paper,  Scaling Online Social Networks without Pains , from a team at Telefonica Research in Spain hopes to meet the challenge of status distribution, user generated content distribution, and managing the social graph through a technique they call  One-Hop Replication  (OHR). OHR  abstracts and delegates the complexity of scaling up from the social network application . The abstract:   
 Online Social Networks (OSN) face serious scalability challenges due to their rapid growth and popularity. To address this issue we present a novel approach to scale up OSN called One Hop Replication (OHR). Our system combines partitioning and replication in a middleware to transparently scale up a centralized OSN design, and therefore, avoid the OSN application to undergo the costly transition to a fully distributed system to meet its scalability needs. OHR exploits some</p><p>4 0.70358187 <a title="804-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-16-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_April_16%2C_2010.html">811 high scalability-2010-04-16-Hot Scalability Links for April 16, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Social Developer Summit  - June 29, 2010 - San Franciso, CA 
 
 A meeting of the technically social - Building, scaling, and profiting in a social age 
 
Whether it's  social games, social news, social discovery,   social search, or other forms of social solutions , developers  today are facing new  hurdles in building instantly scalable products.  As new technologies  emerge to address the challenges faced by social  application developers, it's  increasingly important to come together  for knowledge sharing purposes.
 
The first Social Developer Summit will bring  together social  application developers to  discuss the challenges, solutions,   and best practices for building applications in the rapidly expanding  social  web economy . At  the Social Developer Summit, industry  experts will share tips and case studies for   building high performance  social web products.

<p>Introduction: The way this game is played is you read a few statements on some hot topics below. If you agree with a statement then you “take it”; if you disagree then you “leave it.” And if you are so moved please write a convincing comment as to why. Got it?
  
 

  Snowden vs. the State.  Snowden represents true the spirit of freedom and is not a threat to all we hold dear. 

 
 

  Walled Garden vs. Federated Freedom.  The Walled Garden has won the last decade. The cycle of life will return the balance and federated services will once again win the day. 

 
 

  Mobile + messaging vs. Le Web.  Mobile + messaging is eating search and the web, changing the way things are found, discovered, and bought.  

 
 

  Fiat vs. Cryptocurrency.  BitCoin has had its 400 million dollars of fame, it’s on the way out, a tulip gone out of bloom. 

 
 

  True Detective vs. The Field.  True Detective is the best show on TV, ever. Wired and Breaking Bad need not apply.</p><p>4 0.75571275 <a title="804-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-04-Its_time_for_auto_scaling_%E2%80%93_avoid_peak_load_provisioning_for_web_applications.html">524 high scalability-2009-03-04-Its time for auto scaling – avoid peak load provisioning for web applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many web applications, including eBanking, Trading, eCommerce and Online Gaming, face large, fluctuating loads. In this post will describe how to achieve Right Sizing using virtualization and cloud computing. Will use a standard JEE web application to demonstrate how auto-scaling works on AWS Cloud without changing your application code.</p><p>5 0.70504993 <a title="804-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-11-Monday_Fun%3A_Seven_Databases_in_Song.html">1262 high scalability-2012-06-11-Monday Fun: Seven Databases in Song</a></p>

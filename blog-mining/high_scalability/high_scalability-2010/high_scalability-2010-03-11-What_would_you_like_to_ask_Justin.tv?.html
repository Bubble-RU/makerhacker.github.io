<p>Introduction: It looks like in the near future I'll have a chance to interview the Elastra
CEO. Elastra provides standarddatabases--MySQL, EnterpriseDB and PostgreSQL--
on top of EC2 and S3. They are selling aggressive pricing, expandable and
contactable database resource usage in response to demand, and a simple
management and operations interface to well known databases deployed in a
cloud. Elastra could be an important option for developers looking for a more
traditional cloudy database.I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions
for questions you would like answered? What would you like to know about their
service? What are you looking for in a cloudy database? What would stop you
from adopting it or what would make you decide to adopt it? Any ideas you have
would help a lot and will probably be better than anything I have.</p><p>4 0.07119789 <a title="794-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish_Architecture.html">638 high scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 5:PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews And 32 Billion Images A
MonthUpdate 4:Jeff Atwoodcosts out Markus' scale up approach against a scale
out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as
interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his
software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive
scale up works better for his needs.Update 3:POF now has 200 million imagesand
serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS
RamSan to handle the load. Also upgraded to a core database machine with 512
GB of RAM, 32 CPU's, SQLServer 2008 and Windows 2008.Update 2: This seems to
be aPOF Peer1 love fest infomercial. It's pretty content free, but the
production values are high. Lots of quirky sounds and fish swimming on the
screen.Update: by Facebook standards Read/WriteWeb says POF is worth a coolone

<p>Introduction: Here's my template for describing the architecture of a system. The idea is to
have people fill out this template and that then becomes the basis for a
profile. This is how theFriends for Salepost was created and I think that
turned out well. People always want more detail, but realistically you can
only expect so much.The template is definitely too long, but it's more just a
series of questions to jog people's memories and then they can answer whatever
they think is important.What I want to ask is if you can think of any things
to add/delete/change in the template? What do you want to know about the
systems people are building? So if you have the time, please take a look and
tell me what you think.Getting to Know You* What is the name of your system
and where can we find out more about it?* What is your system is for?* Why did
you decide to build this system?* How is your project financed?* What is your
revenue model?* How do you market your product?* How long have you been
working on</p><p>6 0.071041681 <a title="794-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-25-Architecture_Template_Advice_Needed.html">260 high scalability-2008-02-25-Architecture Template Advice Needed</a></p>

<p>Introduction: You know your product is doing well when most of yourearly blog postsdeal with
the status of the waiting list of hundreds of thousands of users eagerly
waiting to download your product. That's the enviable positionMailbox, a free
mobile email management app, found themselves early in their release cycle.
Hasn't email been done already? Apparently not. Mailbox scaled to one million
users in a paltry six weeks with a team ofabout 14 people. As of April they
were delivering over100 million messages per day.How did they do it? Mailbox
engineering lead,Sean Beausoleil, gave an informative interview on
readwrite.comon how Mailbox planned to scale... Gather signals early. A pre-
release launch video helped generate interest, but it also allowed them to
gauge early interest before even releasing. From the overwhelming response
they knew they would need to have to scale and scale quickly. Have something
unique. The average person might not think a mailbox app would be a fertile
product space. T</p><p>3 0.67501456 <a title="794-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-02-Some_Real_Financial_Numbers_for_Your_Startup.html">107 high scalability-2007-10-02-Some Real Financial Numbers for Your Startup</a></p>

for Underachievers: Two Years of the Real Numbers of a Startup. Part of any
business plan are the projected guestimates. They are guestimates because
everyone keeps these numbers hidden like a Swiss bank account. But notRedfin.
They've bravely shared their initial cost projections, their actual numbers
from real life, and the lessons they've learned from the discrepancy between
the two...breakYou can find their model estimates and actuals for Rent, Per
Employee, Per Month (model: $250, actual: $336); Initial Per-Employee
Equipment Cost; Monthly Benefits, Per-Employee; Annual Payroll Tax; Quarterly

<p>Introduction: Hi...I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am
building it! So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking,
architecture planning, everything. I haven't even gotten into the legal
aspects yet.......It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to
handle that end of the operation. I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at
Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best. I'd like to FIND that very best
person available, to handle the technical aspects. For worse or better, I
don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.I've posted a bazillion ads
on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses. I've put out feelers
among my own network, same result. Not sure what else I can do. Shoestring
budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning. That can actually be a plus, as
it forces people to focus.Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the
right person?ThanksJason</p><p>5 0.64741302 <a title="794-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-16-What_if_Cars_Were_Rented_Like_We_Hire_Programmers%3F.html">1388 high scalability-2013-01-16-What if Cars Were Rented Like We Hire Programmers?</a></p>

hired at many software companies...Agency: So sorry you had to wait in the
reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally
found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you
may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our
manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so
I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?Applicant: I
drive a 2008 Subaru.Agency: That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent
you.Applicant: That's OK. Any car will do.Agency: No, we can only take on
clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way.
There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take
a chance.Applicant: I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been
driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt. Agency: We

<p>Introduction: SmugMug's CEO & Chief Geek Don MacAskill smugly (hard to resist) gushes over
finally finding, after a long and arduous quest, their "best bang-for-the-buck
storage array." It's theDell MD300. His in-depth explanation of why he prefers
the MD3000 should help anyone with their own painful storage deliberations.
His key points are:breakThe price is right; DAS via SAS, 15 spindles at 15K
rpm each, 512MB of mirrored battery-backed write cache; You can disable read
caching; You can disable read-ahead prefetching; The stripe sizes are
configurable up to 512KB; The controller ignores host-based flush commands by
default; They support an ‘Enhanced JBOD’ mode.His reasoning for the
desirability each option is astute and he even gives you the configuration
options for carrying out the configuration. This is not your average CEO.Don
also speculates that a three tier system using flash (system RAM + flash
storage + RAID disks) is a possible future direction. Unfortunately, flash may
not be the dream</p><p>2 0.85791004 <a title="794-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-10-Paper%3A_Consensus_Protocols%3A_Paxos___.html">529 high scalability-2009-03-10-Paper: Consensus Protocols: Paxos   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Barbara Liskov's Turing Award, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance.Henry
Robinson has created an excellent series of articles on consensus protocols.
We already covered his2 Phase Commitarticle and he also has a3 Phase
Commitarticle showing how to handle 2PC under single node failures.But that is
not enough! 3PC works well under node failures, but fails for network
failures. So another consensus mechanism is needed that handles both network
and node failures. And that'sPaxos.Paxos correctly handles both types of
failures, but it does this by becoming inaccessible if too many components
fail. This is the "liveness" property of protocols. Paxos waits until the
faults are fixed. Read queries can be handled, but updates will be blocked
until the protocol thinks it can make forward progress.The liveness of Paxos
is primarily dependent on network stability. In a distributed heterogeneous
environment you are at risk of losing the ability to make updates. Users hate
that.breakSo when compani</p><p>same-blog 3 0.85419142 <a title="794-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-11-What_would_you_like_to_ask_Justin.tv%3F.html">794 high scalability-2010-03-11-What would you like to ask Justin.tv?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It looks like I'll have the chance to interview someone tomorrow from
Justin.tv about their architecture, which is pretty exciting given their
leadership role in live broadcasting. They get 30 million uniques a month, can
handle 1 million simultaneous broadcasts and hope to grow another magnitude in
the near future. That must take some doing.Here's your opportunity, especially
if you think my questions suck, to ask your own sucky questions :-) What would
you like to know about Justin.tv?</p><p>4 0.81634057 <a title="794-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-15-Does_Sun_Buying_MySQL_Change_Your_Scaling_Strategy%3F.html">213 high scalability-2008-01-15-Does Sun Buying MySQL Change Your Scaling Strategy?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sun is buying MySQL for $1 billion. The MySQL team has worked long and hard so
I don't begrudge them their pay day. Strike while the iron is offering a lot
of cash I say. And I have nothing against Sun. Yet I can't help but think this
changes the mental calculation of what database to use. When Oracle acquired
Innobase a new independent storage engine was needed for MySQL. How is this
different? Does this change your thinking any? Would Martha say it's a good
thing? Like Luke I've searched my feelings, but the force is not with me and I
don't really know how I feel about it.</p><p>5 0.77710402 <a title="794-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-20-PaxosLease%3A_Diskless_Paxos_for_Leases.html">710 high scalability-2009-09-20-PaxosLease: Diskless Paxos for Leases</a></p>

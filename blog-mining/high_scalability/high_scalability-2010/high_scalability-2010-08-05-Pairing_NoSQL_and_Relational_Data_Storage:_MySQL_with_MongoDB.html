<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors, attended the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto  NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid, InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came from the audience, which was refreshing. 
 
Overall a genial evening with some good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at giving a wide ra</p><p>3 0.10426407 <a title="872-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-02-Distributed_Hashing_Algorithms_by_Example%3A_Consistent_Hashing.html">892 high scalability-2010-09-02-Distributed Hashing Algorithms by Example: Consistent Hashing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Consistent Hashing is a specific implementation of hashing that is well  suited for many of today’s web-scale load balancing problems.  Specifically, it can be seen in use in various caching solutions like  Memcached and is applicable to NoSQL solutions as well. Consistent  Hashing is used particularly because it provides a solution for the  typical “hashcode mod n” method of distributing keys across a series of  servers. It does this by allowing servers to be added or removed without  significantly upsetting the distribution of keys, nor does it require  that all keys be rehashed to accommodate the change in the number of  servers.﻿

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Ellis  reviews in the  NoSQL Ecosystem  the origin of the NoSQL movement and 10 different NoSQL products and how their 1) support for multiple datacenters,  2) the ability to add new machines to a live cluster transparently to the your applications, 3) Data Model, 4) Query API, 5) Persistence Design. The 10 systems reviewed are: Cassandra, CouchDB, HBase, MongoDB, Neo4J, Redis, Riak, Scalaris, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort.
 
A very thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of approaches to not being a relational database.

<p>Introduction: Morgan Tocker has an awesome article and comment thread in the  MySQL Performance Blog  about  When should you store serialized objects in the database?  Before the NoSQL age is was very common to simulate schemalessness by storing blobs in MySQL. Sharding was implemented by running multiple MySQL instances and spreading writes across them. While not ideal for the purpose, developers felt comfortable with MySQL. They knew how to install it, back it up, replicate it, in short:Â  they knew how to make it work. Yet they also needed to store objects without the penalty of joins. Searches and aggregate queries were handled by indexes kept in separate tables, this offloaded the fast path to objects.
 
This all made perfect sense. Usually we just want stuff to work and going with what you know is often the best path to that goal. And what we have known is MySQL. All the different pros and cons of this approach are covered wonderfully in the post.
 
But the world has changed. With the same goal</p><p>6 0.092750736 <a title="872-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Designing_Web_Applications_for_Scalability.html">877 high scalability-2010-08-12-Designing Web Applications for Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source. There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity: from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there’s Riak, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft Windows. I’m going to outline what’s available now and briefly touch on some opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.

<p>Introduction: I’ve largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the “NoSQL vs. Relational” conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to build in, I’d like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint. In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I’ve inadvertently given myself plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches, and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say with a fair amount of certainty, that I’ve found a good compromise.

<p>Introduction: Update :   Speed up Apache - how I went from F to A in YSlow .  Good example of using YSlow to speed up a website with solid code examples.  Every layer in the multi-layer cake that is your website contributes to how long a page takes to display.  YSlow , from Yahoo, is a cool tool for discovering how the ingredients of your site's top layer contribute to performance.
 
YSlow analyzes web pages and tells you why they're slow based on the rules for high performance web sites. YSlow is a Firefox add-on integrated with the popular Firebug web development tool.   YSlow gives you:

<p>Introduction: Scoble   the Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.     For a strategy hit he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about when making   FeedBlendr  :     One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in designing their architecture.</p><p>4 0.53224838 <a title="872-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-22-Why_not_Cache_from_Intersystems%3F.html">164 high scalability-2007-11-22-Why not Cache from Intersystems?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have some experience with a very large OLTP system that is 7+ TB in size and performs very well for 30K+ concurrent users.  It is built using Intersystems Cache based on the very old but very scalable MUMPS platform.  Why don't I see more discussions about archiectures such as these in this forum?  I am curious why this platform scales so much better then the typical RDBMS.</p><p>5 0.51866734 <a title="872-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-14-When_all_the_Program%27s_a_Graph_-_Prismatic%27s_Plumbing_Library.html">1406 high scalability-2013-02-14-When all the Program's a Graph - Prismatic's Plumbing Library</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.
 
Then you may observe after coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form of interacting patterns of flows.
 
Then you may think hey, a program isn't only useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over data and flow over other flows.
 
That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making available in the Graph extension to their  plumbing  package ( code examples ), which is described in an excellent post:  Graph: Abstractions for Structured Computation .

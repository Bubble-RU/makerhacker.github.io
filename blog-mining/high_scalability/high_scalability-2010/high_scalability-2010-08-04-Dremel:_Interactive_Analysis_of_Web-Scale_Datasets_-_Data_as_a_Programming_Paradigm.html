<p>Introduction: Update 2:Sorting 1 PB with MapReduce. PB is not peanut-butter-and-jelly
misspelled. It's 1 petabyte or 1000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes.It took
six hours and two minutes to sort 1PB (10 trillion 100-byte records) on 4,000
computersand the results were replicated thrice on 48,000 disks.Update:Greg
Lindenpoints to a new Google articleMapReduce: simplified data processing on
large clusters. Some interesting stats: 100k MapReduce jobs are executed each
day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k
MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with
gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.Google is the King of scalability.
Everyone knows Google for their large, sophisticated, and fast searching, but
they don't just shine in search. Their platform approach to building scalable
applications allows them to roll out internet scale applications at an
alarmingly high competition crushing rate. Their goal is always to build a

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by BugSense Founder/CTO Jon Vlachogiannisand Head of
Infrastructure at BugSensePanagiotis Papadomitsos.There has been a lot of
speculation and assumptions around whetherPRISMexists and if it is cost
effective. I don't know whether it exists or not, but I can tell you if it
could be built.Short answer: It can.If you believe it would be impossible for
someone with access to a social "datapool" to find out more about you (if they
really want to track you down) in the tsunami of data, you need to think
again.Devices, apps and websites are transmitting data. Lots of data. The
questions are could the data compiled and searched and how costly would it be
to search for your targeted data. (hint: It is not $4.56 trillion).Let's
experiment and try to build PRISM by ourselves with a few
assumptions:Assumption 1: We have all the appropriate "data connectors" that
will provide us with data.Assumption 2: These connectors provide direct access
to social networks, emails, mobile t</p><p>6 0.12928313 <a title="871-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-13-Google_Reveals_New_MapReduce_Stats.html">211 high scalability-2008-01-13-Google Reveals New MapReduce Stats</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a People of ACM interview withSanjay Ghemawat, a Google Fellow in the
Systems Infrastructure Group (MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, GFS, etc), talks
about a few interesting aspects of Google's culture.What Made Google
GoogleProgress is a modern idea. The conviction that future can be changed for
the better through individual advancement and action has over hundreds of
years driven an exponential growth in the technome.What drives progress?
Challenges. Individuals finding and defeating a challenge. There's usually
something someone wants to do so badly that they put in the effort, the
thought, and the money into solving all the problems. The results are often
something new and amazing.And so it was for Google:The main motivation behind
the development of much of Google's infrastructure was the challenge of
keeping up with ever-growing data sets. For example, at the same time Google's
web search was gaining usage very quickly, we were also scaling up the size of
our index dramatically a</p><p>4 0.82221353 <a title="871-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-01-Google_Paper%3A_Large-scale_Incremental_Processing_Using_Distributed_Transactions_and_Notifications.html">912 high scalability-2010-10-01-Google Paper: Large-scale Incremental Processing Using Distributed Transactions and Notifications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This paper, Large-scale Incremental Processing Using Distributed Transactions
and Notifications by Daniel Peng and Frank Dabek, is Google's much anticipated
description of Percolator, their new real-time indexing system.The
abstract:Updating an index of the web as documents are crawled requires
continuously transforming a large repository of existing documents as new
documents arrive. This task is one example of a class of data processing tasks
that transform a large repository of data via small, independent mutations.
These tasks lie in a gap between the capabilities of existing infrastructure.
Databases do not meet the storage or throughput requirements of these tasks:
Google's indexing system stores tens of petabytes of data and processes
billions of updates per day on thousands of machines. MapReduce and other
batch-processing systems cannot process small updates individually as they
rely on creating large batches for efÄÅ¹ ciency. We have built Percolator, a
system for incrementally</p><p>5 0.81258428 <a title="871-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-13-Google_Reveals_New_MapReduce_Stats.html">211 high scalability-2008-01-13-Google Reveals New MapReduce Stats</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Google Operating System blog has aninteresting poston Google's scale based
on an updated version of Google's paper about MapReduce.The input data for
some of the MapReduce jobs run in September 2007 was 403,152 TB (terabytes),
the average number of machines allocated for a MapReduce job was 394, while
the average completion time was 6 minutes and a half. The paper mentions that
Google's indexing system processes more than 20 TB of raw data.breakNiall
Kennedy calculates that the average MapReduce job runs across a $1 million
hardware infrastructure, assuming that Google still uses the same cluster
configurations from 2004: two 2 GHz Intel Xeon processors with Hyper-Threading
enabled, 4 GB of memory, two 160 GB IDE hard drives and a gigabit Ethernet
link.Greg Linden notices that Google's infrastructure is an important
competitive advantage. "Anyone at Google can process terabytes of data. And
they can get their results back in about 10 minutes, so they can iterate on it

<p>Introduction: In the "should I or shouldn't I" debate around deploying SSD, it always helps
to have real-world data. Fiesta! with alive-blog summary of a presentation by
Kenny Gorman onShutterfly on MongoDB Performance Tuning.What if you still need
more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs.
Shutterfly usesFacebook's flashcache: kernel module to cache data on SSD.
Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single
mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O.
Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can
delay sharding: less complexity.The wholeseries of posts has a lot of great
information and is worth a longer look, especially if you are considering
using MongoDB. Related ArticlesSlides forMongoSF 2011 slides: MongoDB

<p>Introduction: Update:as of the end of Q2 2011,Akamai had 95,811servers deployed
globally.Akamai is the CDN to the stars. It claims to deliver between 15 and
30 percent of all Web traffic, with major customers like Facebook, Twitter,
Apple, and the US military. Traditionally quite secretive, we get a peek
behind the curtain in this paper: The Akamai Network: A Platform for High-
Performance Internet Applications by Erik Nygren, Ramesh Sitaraman, and
Jennifer Sun. Abstract:Comprising more than 61,000 servers located across
nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers
hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of
enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet
applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the components and
capabilities of this large-scale distributed computing platform, and offer
some insight into its architecture, design principles, operation, and

<p>Introduction: Wildly popular VC blogger Fred Wilson defines in an excellent 27 minute
videothe ten most important criteria he uses when deciding to give the gold,
that is, fund a web application. Note, this video isfrom 2010, so no doubt the
ideas are still valid, but the importance of mobile vs web apps has probably
shifted to mobile, as Mr. Wilson says in a recent post: mobile is growing like
a weed. Speed- speed is more than a feature, it's a requirement. Mainstream
users are unforgiving. If something is slow they won't use it. Pingdom is used
to track speed across their portfolio. A trend they've noticed is that as an
application slows down they don't grow as quickly. Instant Utility- a service
must be instantly useful to users. Lengthy setup and configuration is a
killer. Tricks like crawling the web to populate information you expect to get
from your users later makes the service initially useful. YouTube won, for
example, with instant availability of uploaded video.Voice- Consumer software

<p>Introduction: If you are a startup you may find useful Guy Kawasaki's postFinancial Models
for Underachievers: Two Years of the Real Numbers of a Startup. Part of any
business plan are the projected guestimates. They are guestimates because
everyone keeps these numbers hidden like a Swiss bank account. But notRedfin.
They've bravely shared their initial cost projections, their actual numbers
from real life, and the lessons they've learned from the discrepancy between
the two...breakYou can find their model estimates and actuals for Rent, Per
Employee, Per Month (model: $250, actual: $336); Initial Per-Employee
Equipment Cost; Monthly Benefits, Per-Employee; Annual Payroll Tax; Quarterly
Bonus Payout, as a % of the Total Possible; Annual Payroll Increase for
Existing Employees; All-Company Meeting Cost, Per-Meeting, Per-Employee;
Annual Accounting Costs, and a few more.There is also a great lessons section:

economies of scale</p><p>5 0.98558533 <a title="871-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-25-Paper%3A_High_Performance_Scalable_Data_Stores_.html">784 high scalability-2010-02-25-Paper: High Performance Scalable Data Stores </a></p>
<p>Introduction: The world of scalable databases is not a simple one. They come in every race,
creed, and color. Rick Cattell has brought some harmony to that world by
publishingHigh Performance Scalable Data Stores, a nicely detailed one stop
shop paper comparing scalable databases soley on the content of their
character. Ironically, the first step in that evaluation is dividing the world
into four groups:Key-value stores: Redis, Scalaris, Voldmort, and
Riak.Document stores: Couch DB, MongoDB, and SimpleDB.Record stores: BigTable,
HBase, HyperTable, and Cassandra.Scalable RDBMSs: MySQL Cluster, ScaleDB,
Drizzle, and VoltDB.The paper describes each system and then compares them on
the dimensions of Concurrency Control, Data Storage Replication, Transaction
Model, General Comments, Maturity, K-hits, License Language.And the winner is:
there are no winners. Yet. Rick concludes by pointing to a great convergence:I

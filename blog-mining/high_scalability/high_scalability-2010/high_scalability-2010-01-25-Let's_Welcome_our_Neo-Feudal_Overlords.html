[sent-2, score-0.503]
</p><p>2 Applications have started to become mashups where the hard parts are written in terms of a platform that does all those hard parts. [sent-33, score-0.334]
</p><p>3 Once adopted, a platform becomes hard to leave which adds a political dimension to the evolution of future application architectures. [sent-35, score-0.339]
</p><p>4 This result may not be readily apparent because we are still so close to the era of small disconnected systems: application writers are becoming 'vassals' to their feudal platform 'lords', a kind of neo-feudalism that bares a striking relationship to the previous agriculture based feudalism. [sent-36, score-0.655]
</p><p>5 This somewhat imprecise feudal analogy goes like this: the platform provider (the King) provides services, land, and protection to their platform users (vassals). [sent-37, score-0.975]
</p><p>6 Datacenters are the New LandIn the feudal era having land meant everything. [sent-46, score-0.592]
</p><p>7 Only land owners could grow crops for food, for trade, and for money. [sent-47, score-0.393]
</p><p>8 When the feudal era collapsed industry and trade became the new means for acquiring wealth. [sent-49, score-0.351]
</p><p>9 To stretch the analogy further, in terms of building applications we have been in the hunter gather era, we are entering the feudal era of great land owners, and we are contemplating what might constitute the next industrial revolution. [sent-53, score-0.698]
</p><p>10 A DDoS attack can take down even the largest of companies and no small land holder can even begin to defend themselves. [sent-66, score-0.423]
</p><p>11 They informed me my email was shut down because there was a DDoS attack on my domain. [sent-77, score-0.335]
</p><p>12 For my email provider that attack was anything but inconsequential. [sent-87, score-0.413]
</p><p>13 On the frontier of the US when homesteaders came under attack and could no longer protect themselves, they had to move to the nearest fort for protection. [sent-91, score-0.503]
</p><p>14 Meanwhile back at the frontier my previous email provider said the attack stopped after 10 days and I that could go back. [sent-100, score-0.52]
</p><p>15 In good times you can homestead in the wilderness, but when the bandits attack and you can no longer bring your goods to market, you seek the protection of the King. [sent-112, score-0.338]
</p><p>16 The King has Subtle Forms of PersuasionOriginally I considered the driving forces of scale and complexity as sufficient to compel developers to end up in the arms of platform provider. [sent-113, score-0.31]
</p><p>17 By linking pagerank to performance and providing all the intermediary steps necessary to become performant, the result is likely to drive developers to a platform for refuge. [sent-125, score-0.477]
</p><p>18 Google is certainly not the only platform option, but people will go to a platform people as an easy prepackaged solution to a tough to solve problem. [sent-127, score-0.51]
</p><p>19 Instead, we're facing the prospect of Facebook as the platform, Apple as the platform, Google as the platform, Amazon as the platform, where big companies slug it out until one is king of the hill. [sent-132, score-0.324]
</p><p>20 Hinchcliffe thinks there will be a protracted platform war with afairly predictable and oft-repeated cycle of events for which a small number of large winners are likely to emerge victorious. [sent-139, score-0.377]

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.We tend to think compute
of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of
innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will
reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the
datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of
datacenters in the future.Given the diversity of compute resources it's
reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API.
They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those
specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough
to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever

<p>Introduction: Update: Organism without a brain creates external memories for navigationshows
slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where
it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's
calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the
organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that
won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors
make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants.  InAfter Life: The
Strange Science Of Decaythere's a truly incredible sequence of gorgeously shot
video showing howcreeping slime moldsolves mazes and performs other other
amazing feats of computation. Take a look at what simple one celled organisms
can do:The whole video is really well done and shockingly revelatory. It's the
story of decay, how atoms created during the Big Bang and through countless

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.There's a pattern,
already begun, that has accelerated by the need for applications to scale and
increase complexity, the end result of which will be that applications give up
their independence and enter a kind offeudal relationshipwith their platform
provider.To understand how this process works, like a glacier slowly and
inevitably carving out a deep river valley, here's the type of question I get
quite a lot:I've learned PHP and MySQL and I've built a web app that I HOPE
will receive traffic comparable to eBay's with a similar database structure. I
see all these different opinions and different techniques and languages being
recommended and it's so confusing. All I want is perhaps one book or one
website that focuses on PHP and MySQL and building a large database web app
like eBay's. Does something like this exist?I'm always at a loss for words

<p>Introduction: Update: How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences. Shows how to
analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what
I mean. Steve Souders, author ofHigh Performance WebsitesandYslow, hasten more

26.7 rules left, so get them while they're still in our dimension.Here

<p>Introduction: If you were going to design a next generation Internet at the physical layer
that routes around the current Internet, what would it look like? What should
it do? How should it work? Who should own it? How should it be paid for? How
would you access it?It has long been said the Internet routes around
obstacles. Snowden has revealed some major obstacles. The beauty of the
current current app and web system is the physical network doesn't matter. We
can just replace it with something else. Something that doesn't flow through
choke points like backhaul networks,under sea cables, andcell towers. What
might that something else look like?Google's Loon ProjectProject Loonwas so
named because the idea was thought to be loony. Maybe not.The idea is to float
high-altitude balloons 20 miles in the air to create an aerial wireless
network with up to 3G-like speeds. Signals travel through the balloon network
from balloon to balloon, then to a ground-based station connected to an
Internet service pro</p><p>5 0.92808563 <a title="765-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-30-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_30%2C_2010.html">869 high scalability-2010-07-30-Hot Scalability Links for July 30, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremy Zawodny, while performing data alchemy in the dungeons of Craigslist,
stored1,250,000,000 Key/Value Pairs in Redis on a 32GB Machine.Data sorting
world record: 1 terabyte, 1 minute. The system has 52 computer nodes, each
node is a commodity server with two quad-core processors, 24 gigabytes (GB)
memory and sixteen 500 GB disks. It's not just hardware though, they also
built a software that utilized all their CPU and RAM.Tweets of Gold:wm: I am
really getting the sense that none of you yokels waxing profound about
scalability actually has anything factual to sayjoestump: I think you can do
things to *mitigate* pain points up front. You don't need to over-engineer,
but it's not hard to look forward.danielcrenna: I love it when I check in
debug code accidentally and it turns into a three day hunt for a major
scalability problemjoestump: Your post also makes me think of another phrase I

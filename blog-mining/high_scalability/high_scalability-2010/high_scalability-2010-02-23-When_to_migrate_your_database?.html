<p>Introduction: Making Hadoop Run FasterOne of the challenges in processing data is that the
speed at which we can input data is quite often much faster than the speed at
which we can process it. This problem becomes even more pronounced in the
context of Big Data, where the volume of data keeps on growing, along with a
corresponding need for more insights, and thus the need for more complex
processing also increases.Batch Processing to the RescueHadoop was designed to
deal with this challenge in the following ways:1. Use a distributed file
system: This enables us to spread the load and grow our system as needed.2.
Optimize for write speed: To enable fast writes the Hadoop architecture was
designed so that writes are first logged, and then processed. This enables
fairly fast write speeds.3. Use batch processing (Map/Reduce) to balance the
speed for the data feeds with the processing speed.Batch Processing
ChallengesThe challenge with batch-processing is that it assumes that the
feeds come in bursts.

<p>Introduction: I follow a certain philosophy when developing system architectures. I assume
that very few systems will ever exist in a consistent form for more than a
short period of time. What constitutes a “short period of time” differs
depending on the specifics of each system, but in an effort to quantify it, I
generally find that it falls somewhere between a week and a month.The driving
forces behind the need for an ever changing architecture are largely business
requirement based. This is a side effect of the reality that software
development, in most cases, is used as a supporting role within the business
unit it serves. As business requirements (i.e. additional features, new
products, etc.) pour forth, it is the developer’s job to evolve their software
system to accommodate these requirements and provide a software based solution
to whatever problems lay ahead.Given that many businesses can be identified as
having the above characteristics, I can now begin to explain why I believe

<p>Introduction: With cloud SLAs generally being worth what you don't pay for them, what can
you do to protect yourself? Sean Hull inAirBNB didn't have to fail  has some
solid advice on how to deal with outages:Use Redundancy. Make database and
webserver tiers redundant using multi-az or alternately read-replicas. Have a
browsing only mode. Give users a read-only version of your site. Users may not
even notice failures as they will only see problems when they need to perform
a write operation.Web Applications need Feature Flags. Build in the ability to
turn off and on major parts of your site and flip the switch when problems
arise.Consider Netflix's Simian. By randomly causing outages in your
application you can continually test your failover and redundancy
infrastructure.Use multiple clouds. Use Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Clouds
as a way of surviving outages in any one particular cloud.None of these are
easy and it's worth considering that your application may not need them at
all. Life will alm</p><p>6 0.079519615 <a title="782-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-04-Business_continuity_with_real-time_data_integration.html">822 high scalability-2010-05-04-Business continuity with real-time data integration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Practically any software project nowadays could not survive without a database
(DBMS) backend storing all the business data that is vital to you and/or your
customers. When projects grow larger, the amount of data usually grows larger
exponentially. So you start moving the DBMS to a separate server to gain more
speed and capacity. Which is all good and healthy but you do not gain any
extra safety for this business data. You might be backing up your database
once a day so in case the database server crashes you don't lose EVERYTHING,
but how much can you really afford to lose? Well clearly this depends on what
kind of data you are storing. In our case the users of our solutions use our
software products to do their everyday (all day) work. They have "everything"
they need for their business stored in the database we are providing. So is 24
hours of data loss acceptable? No, not really. One hour? Maybe. But what we
really want is a second database running with the EXACT same data. We mos</p><p>3 0.68584782 <a title="782-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-10-Building_Scalable_Databases%3A_Denormalization%2C_the_NoSQL_Movement_and_Digg.html">698 high scalability-2009-09-10-Building Scalable Databases: Denormalization, the NoSQL Movement and Digg</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database
schemas that ensures that the data is optimal for ad-hoc querying and that
modifications such as deletion or insertion of data does not lead to data
inconsistency. Database denormalization is the process of optimizing your
database for reads by creating redundant data. A consequence of
denormalization is that insertions or deletions could cause data inconsistency
if not uniformly applied to all redundant copies of the data within the
database.Read more on Carnage4life blog...</p><p>4 0.66280264 <a title="782-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-The_cost_of_High_Availability_%28HA%29_with_Oracle_.html">813 high scalability-2010-04-19-The cost of High Availability (HA) with Oracle </a></p>
<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000
or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is
estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High
Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as
uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.This post focuses on a
customer's backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a
dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA
features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the
challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services
and annual support?Read more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>5 0.6608867 <a title="782-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-16-Scaling_Secret_%232%3A_Denormalizing_Your_Way_to_Speed_and_Profit.html">65 high scalability-2007-08-16-Scaling Secret #2: Denormalizing Your Way to Speed and Profit</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alan Watts once observed how after we accepted Descartes' separation of the
mind and body we've been trying to smash them back together again ever since
when really they were never separate to begin with.The database normalization-
denormalization dualism has the same mobius shaped reverberations as
Descartes' error. We separate data into a million jagged little pieces and
then spend all our time stooping over, picking them and up, and joining them
back together again.Normalization has been standard practice now for decades.
But times are changing. Many mega-website architects are concluding Watts was
right: the data was never separate to begin with. And even more radical, we
may even need to store multiple copies of data.breakInformation

<p>Introduction: Hi, I stumbled on your site and I am thinking about starting a website. I
haven't received a good answer about what I should use to buildit, so I
thought I would give it a shot.I am a windows guy. I know .Net and ASP and how
to build web sites using that stack. But I notice most sites use LAMP and
that's what most people talk about using. What's wrong with using Windows?.Net

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:Now that we have a new computing paradigm,
Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data
vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds?
Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space,

versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are
a number of issues driving this uncertainty.read more at:BigDataMatters.com</p><p>same-blog 5 0.98210675 <a title="782-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-23-When_to_migrate_your_database%3F.html">782 high scalability-2010-02-23-When to migrate your database?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming
your business - reports are out of date, your batch processing window is
nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database
consolidation - remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database

clear,  what now?ďťżRead more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>6 0.98096967 <a title="782-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Paper%3A_Pig_Latin%3A_A_Not-So-Foreign_Language_for_Data_Processing.html">443 high scalability-2008-11-14-Paper: Pig Latin: A Not-So-Foreign Language for Data Processing</a></p>

The future looks many, big, complex, and adaptive:
  
 Many clouds.  
 Many servers.  
 Many operating systems.  
 Many languages.  
 Many storage services.  
 Many database services.  
 Many software services.  
 Many adjunct human networks (like Mechanical Turk).  
 Many fast interconnects.  
 Many CDNs.  
 Many cache memory pools.  
 Many application profiles (simple request-response, live streaming, computationally complex, sensor driven, memory intensive, storage intensive, monolithic, decomposable, etc).  
 Many legal jurisdictions. Don't want to perform a function on Patriot Act "protected" systems then move the function elsewhere.  
 Many SLAs.  
 Many data driven pricing policies that like airplane pricing algorithms will price "seats" to maximize profit using multi-variate time sensitive pricing models.  
 Many competitive products.

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.  
 
We tend to think compute of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of datacenters in the future.
 
Given the diversity of compute resources it's reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API. They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever resources it doe</p><p>6 0.74911046 <a title="768-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-02-Using_the_Ambient_Cloud_as_an_Application_Runtime.html">786 high scalability-2010-03-02-Using the Ambient Cloud as an Application Runtime</a></p>

<p>Introduction: And by hot I also mean temperature. Summer has arrived. It's sizzling here in Silicon Valley. Thank you air conditioning!
  
 Scale the web by appointing a Crawler Czar? Tom Foremski has the idea that  Google should open up their index  so sites wouldn't have to endure the constant pounding by ravenous crawler bots. Don MacAskill of SmugMug estimates  50% of our web server CPU resources  are spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data over and over again?

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.   
 
Earlier we talked about how a single botnet could harness more compute power than our largest super computers. Well, that's just the start of it. The amount of computer power available to the Ambient Cloud will be truly astounding.
  2 Billion Personal Computers  
The number of personal computers is still growing. By 2014 one estimate is there will be  2 billion PCs . That's a giant reservoir of power to exploit, especially considering these new boxes are stuffed with multiple powerful processors and gigabytes of memory.
  7 Billion Smartphones  
By now it's common wisdom smartphones are the computing platform of the future. It's plausible to assume the total number of  mobile phones  in use will roughly equal the number of people on earth. That's 7 billion smartphones.
 
Smartphones aren't just tiny little wannabe computers anymore either. They are rea</p><p>3 0.93150479 <a title="768-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-07-It%27s_a_VM_Wasteland_-_A_Near_Optimal_Packing_of_VMs_to_Machines_Reduces_TCO_by_22%25.html">1419 high scalability-2013-03-07-It's a VM Wasteland - A Near Optimal Packing of VMs to Machines Reduces TCO by 22%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation  we learn some shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):
  
  Average server utilization in many data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.  
 Surely that's just for old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade. 
  
It's a VM wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same server.
 
It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithm</p><p>4 0.92738789 <a title="768-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-Should_Twitter_be_an_All-You-Can-Eat_Buffet_or_a_Vending_Machine%3F.html">330 high scalability-2008-05-27-Should Twitter be an All-You-Can-Eat Buffet or a Vending Machine?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Om proposes one solution to the   Twitter Problem   is to   limit followers   to three square meals a day. The reasonable idea being that lower limits should mean fewer scaling problems. And as a kicker raising those limits is a good way to raise much needed revenue.      Scoble thinks users should   consume without limit   and will drive to another buffet if all-you-can-eat privileges are revoked. The reasonable idea being that if an internet service can't solve internet scale problems then there's not much use for it.      Dave says   comp power users a top floor suite   and shower them with free passes to the buffet. Let the good times roll! The reasonable idea being that power users help create popular restaurants, er, services in the first place and limiting them starves users and starved users won't come back.     So, should web services like Twitter be a buffet, a fixed eight course fine dining experience, a small plate restaurant, a family style joint, or a vending machine?

<p>Introduction: If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will. --  Steve Jobs   
 
       
 
 
America as the New World has a long history of inspiring  Utopian communities . Early experiments were famously religious. But there have been many others as new waves of thought have inspired people to organize and try something different.
 
In the 1840s Transcendentalists, believing the true path lay in the perfection of the individual, created intentional communities like  Brook Farm . We've also seen  socialist ,  anarchist ,  hippy , and virtually every other kind of Utopia in-between. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote an infamous book,  Walden Two , with a more "scientific" take on creating a Utopian community and Ayn Rand in  Atlas Shrugged  had her free market version.
 
I believe in startup organizations we see the modern version of Utopian energy in action. We now call it by names like "culture hacking", but the goal is the same: to create a new form of human community to achieve a profound go</p><p>same-blog 6 0.9123379 <a title="768-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-01-What_Will_Kill_the_Cloud%3F.html">768 high scalability-2010-02-01-What Will Kill the Cloud?</a></p>

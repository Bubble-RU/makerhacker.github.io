<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Frédéric Faure   (architect at  Ysance )  on the differences between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frédéric was kind enough to translate the original French version of this article into English. 
 
I’ve been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such as  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) and a traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you. Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure. I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.

<p>Introduction: When you’re looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium  ecosystem, one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular  breed of fish is amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are  not, which means if you put them together in a confined space, they’re  going to fight. Viciously. To the death. Responsible aquarists try to  avoid such situations, so careful attention to the  conspecificity  of animals is a must.
 
Now,  while in many respects the data center ecosystem correlates well to an  aquarium ecosystem, in this case it does not. It’s what you usually get,  today, but its not actually the best model. That’s because what you  want in the data center ecosystem – particularly when it extends to  include public  cloud computing   resources – is conspecificity in infrastructure.
 
This  desire and practice is being seen both in enterprise data center  decision making as well as in startups suddenly dealing with massive  growth and increasingly encountering pe</p><p>3 0.87914312 <a title="918-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Are_we_seeing_the_renaissance_of_enterprises_in_the_cloud%3F.html">1354 high scalability-2012-11-05-Are we seeing the renaissance of enterprises in the cloud?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is  indeed the case:
 
 Research  conducted by HP   found that the majority of businesses in the EMEA region  are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the cloud. Of the 940  respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-critical apps at some  point over the next two to five years.
 
A more recent  survey, by research firm  MeriTalk   and sponsored by VMware and EMC (NYSE: EMC  ), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to  move some mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within  two years, the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their  mission-critical apps to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of  their mission-critical apps to run in the cloud.

<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for "Cloud  API  portability," which implies a series of misconceptions.
 
If we break away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without settling on a common Cloud  API. 
 
In this post i'll be covering five common misconceptions people have  WRT  to cloud portability.
  
  Cloud portability = Cloud API portability . API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.  
  The main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in .Cloud portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-in.  
  Cloud portability isnâ&euro;&trade;t for startups . Every startup that is expecting rapid growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared to do so.</p><p>5 0.86197573 <a title="918-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-21-Eucalyptus__-__Build_Your_Own_Private_EC2_Cloud.html">355 high scalability-2008-07-21-Eucalyptus  -  Build Your Own Private EC2 Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:   InfoQ  links to a few excellent Eucalyptus updates:  Velocity Conference Video by Rich Wolski  and a Visualization.com interview  Rich Wolski on Eucalyptus: Open Source Cloud Computing .   Eucalyptus  is generating some excitement on the  Cloud Computing  group as a potential vendor neutral  EC2 compatible cloud platform. Two reasons why Eucalyptus is potentially important: private clouds and cloud portability:
   
  Private clouds . Let's say you want a cloud like infrastructure for architectural purposes but you want it to run on your own hardware in your own secure environment. How would you do this today? Hm....   Cloud portability . With the number of cloud offerings increasing how can you maintain some level of vendor neutrality among this "swarm" of different options? Portability is a key capability for cloud customers as the only real power customers have is in where they take their business and the only way you can change suppliers is if there's a ready market of fun</p><p>6 0.86187226 <a title="918-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-12-Product%3A_Building_Next-generation_Collaborative_cloud-ready_applications_with_Optimus_Cloud%E2%84%A2_.html">536 high scalability-2009-03-12-Product: Building Next-generation Collaborative cloud-ready applications with Optimus Cloud™ </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days – you only needed one, but then came along the AS400’s and soon you had ten – but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh sh%# – now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and datacenter operations!
 
 Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path? 
 
As a technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other CIO’s on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context to how they can leverage SpringCM’ s easy, fast and affordable cloud Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud services.
 
 What options do I have?

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble  is a kind of Brothers Grimm for the digital age. Instead of inspired romantics walking around the country side collecting the folk tales of past ages, he is an inspired technologist documenting the current mythology of startups.
 
One of the developments Robert is exploring is the rise of the  contextual age . Where every bit of information about you is continually being prodded, pulled, and observed, shoveled into a great learning machine, and turned into a fully actionable  knowledge graph  of context. A digital identity more real to software than your physical body ever was. 
 
Sinner or saviour, the Age of Context has interesting implications for startups. It raises the entrance bar to dizzying heights. Much of the reason companies are tearing down the Golden Age of the Web, one open protocol at a time, is to create a walled garden of monopolized information.
 
To operate in this world you will have to somehow create a walled garden of your own. And it will be a damn</p><p>3 0.91068876 <a title="918-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-04-For_%245_Million_You_Can_Buy_Enough_Storage_to_Compete_with_Google.html">201 high scalability-2008-01-04-For $5 Million You Can Buy Enough Storage to Compete with Google</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kevin Burton calculates that   Blekko  , one of the barbarian hoard storming Google's search fortress, would need to spend $5 million just to buy enough weapons, er storage.      Kevin estimates storing a deep crawl of the internet would take about 5 petabytes. At a projected $1 million per petabyte that's a paltry $5 million. Less than expected. Imagine in days of old an ambitious noble itching to raise an army to conquer a land and become its new prince. For a fine land, and the search market is one of the richest, that would be a smart investment for a VC to make.      In these situations I always ask: What would Machiavelli do?        Machiavelli taught some lands are hard to conquer and easy to keep and some are easy to conquer and hard to keep. A land like France was easy to conquer because it was filled with nobles. You can turn nobles on each other because they always hate each other for some reason or another. But it's hard to keep a land of nobles because they all think they</p><p>4 0.90787035 <a title="918-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-04-Is_Provisioned_IOPS_Better%3F_Yes%2C_it_Delivers_More_Consistent_and_Higher_Performance_IO.html">1398 high scalability-2013-02-04-Is Provisioned IOPS Better? Yes, it Delivers More Consistent and Higher Performance IO</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with their  Provisioned IOPS  for RDS, EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model. You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used. 
 
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?
 
 Rodrigo Campos  put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he describes in  IOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012 .
 
The result?  Yes,   AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and Higher Performance IO :
  

It is clear that the provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer a huge performance upgrade when compared to the non-optimized EBS volumes, but as data has to be spread among more underlying disks or systems, it seems that the volume is increasingly more susceptibl</p><p>5 0.89553833 <a title="918-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets_to_Fotolog%27s_Scaling_Success.html">106 high scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300 thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?

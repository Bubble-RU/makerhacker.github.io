<p>Introduction: As it is said in the recent article"Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail -
When More Machines Equals Worse Results" , latency variability has greater
impact in larger scale clusters where a typical request is composed of
multiple distributed/parallel requests. The overall response time dramatically
decreases if latency of each request is not consistent and low. In dynamically
scalable partitioned storage systems, whether it is a NoSQL database,
filesystem or in-memory data grid, changes in the cluster (adding or removing
a node) can lead to big data moves in the network to re-balance the cluster.
Re-balancing will be needed for both primary and backup data on those nodes.
If a node crashes for example, dead node's data has to be re-owned (become
primary) by other node(s) and also its backup has to be taken immediately to
be fail-safe again. Shuffling MBs of data around has a negative effect in the

<p>Introduction: Update:Yahoo! Launches World's Largest Hadoop Production Application. A 10,000
core Hadoop cluster produces data used in every Yahoo! Web search query. Raw
disk is at 5 Petabytes. Their previous 1 petabyte database couldn't handle the
load and couldn't grow larger.Greg Lindenthinks the Google cluster has way
over 133,000 machines.From an InfoQinterviewwith project lead Doug Cutting, it
appearsHadoop, an open source distributed computing platform, is making good
progress towards their 1.0 release. They've successfully reached a 1000 node
cluster size, improved file system integrity, and jacked performance by 20x in
the last year.How they are making progress could be a good model for
anyone:breakThe speedup has been an aggregation of our work in the past few
years, and has been accomplished mostly by trial-and-error. We get things
running smoothly on a cluster of a given size, then double the size of the
cluster and see what breaks. We aim for performance to scale linearly as you

<p>Introduction: f230ce3face848ff842452a614358356This a follow-up post to an earlier poston the
Scaling Rails Screencast Series byGregg Pollack, when there were only 13
screencasts, now there are 21. Eight more have been added on topics like load
testing and database scaling. This series is of surprisingly high quality.
While I didn't view every screencast, I sampled a large set and found them to
have solid content and high production values. In fact, how did they make
these things? The instructor moves around in a little box while the content
flows around him. A very cool effect. But that wouldn't matter if the content
didn't deliver, here's what's new:Episode #14 - Rack & MetalEpisode #15 - Load

<p>Introduction: Wackamoleis an application that helps with making a cluster highly available.
It manages a bunch of virtual IPs, that should be available to the outside
world at all times. Wackamole ensures that a single machine within a cluster
is listening on each virtual IP address that Wackamole manages.If it discovers
that particular machines within the cluster are not alive, it will almost
immediately ensure that other machines acquire these public IPs. At no time
will more than one machine listen on any virtual IP. Wackamole also works
toward achieving a balanced distribution of number IPs on the machine within
the cluster it manages.There is no other software like Wackamole. Wackamole is
quite unique in that it operates in a completely peer-to-peer mode within the
cluster. Other products that provide the same high-availability guarantees use
a "VIP" method.Wackamole is an application that runs as root in a cluster to
make it highly available. It uses the membership notifications provided by th</p><p>5 0.59067047 <a title="820-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-14-Product%3A_Terracotta_-_Open_Source_Network-Attached_Memory.html">364 high scalability-2008-08-14-Product: Terracotta - Open Source Network-Attached Memory</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:My
recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget
with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid
expiration headers) is employ areverse proxyas mentioned in this article.In
the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a
single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a
single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max
server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.It's trivial to implement for
anyone interested...</p><p>2 0.92365694 <a title="820-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>

Distributed Computing Concepts, Sensor Networks, Overlays and DHTs, Cloud
Programming, Cloud Scheduling, Key-Value Stores, Storage, Sensor Net Routing,
Geo-Distribution, P2P Apps, In-network processing, Epidemics, Probabilistic
Membership Protocols, Distributed Monitoring and  Management, Publish-

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across
data centers, then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so
there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What
isChironFSand how does it work?Adapted from the ChironFS website:The Chiron
Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of
failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using
replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not
FILESYSTEMS.Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it
is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other
server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many
servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become
a real nightmare!</p><p>same-blog 5 0.8603878 <a title="820-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-03-100_Node_Hazelcast_cluster_on_Amazon_EC2.html">820 high scalability-2010-05-03-100 Node Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Deploying, running and monitoring application on a big cluster is a
challenging task. RecentlyHazelcastteam deployed a demo application on Amazon
EC2 platform to show how Hazelcast p2p cluster scales and screen recorded the
entire process from deployment to monitoring.Hazelcast is open source (Apache
License), transactional, distributed caching solution for Java. It is a little
more than a cache though as it provides distributed implementation of map,
multimap, queue, topic, lock and executor service. Details of running 100 node
Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2 can befound here. Make sure towatch the
screencast!</p><p>6 0.84741867 <a title="820-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-19-High_Definition_Video_Delivery_on_the_Web%3F.html">447 high scalability-2008-11-19-High Definition Video Delivery on the Web?</a></p>

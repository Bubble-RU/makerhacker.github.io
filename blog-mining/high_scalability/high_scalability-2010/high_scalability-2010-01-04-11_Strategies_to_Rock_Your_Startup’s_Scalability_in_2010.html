</p><p>2 One can argue that limitations in the product offering have as much to do with the flattening of growth     over the past six months     as does the availability    ,     but     it’s hard to believe the inability of users to actually use the service has not hindered growth. [sent-8, score-0.361]
</p><p>3 What should you do if you want your startup to scale with double and triple digit growth? [sent-9, score-0.398]
</p><p>4 It also means that you can more easily and quickly respond to customer demands by buying one more box rather than having to spec and buy a bigger box. [sent-16, score-0.277]
</p><p>5 It’s critically important where in the database tier are concerned as that’s where most architectures tend to converge and where most problems with scale tend to occur. [sent-17, score-0.314]
</p><p>6 Don’t rely heavily on stored procedures, especially those with business logic embedded within them, as it will keep you from quickly and easily moving to competing     database products for reasons of cost or availability. [sent-19, score-0.495]
</p><p>7 3)     Soar Through the Clouds               If you need high availability 24x7, relying solely upon a cloud for your services will likely let you down for the near future. [sent-23, score-0.282]
</p><p>8 We are huge believers in having the beauty of your product nested within the blueprint of your architecture and your design     – not in your hardware    . [sent-29, score-0.32]
</p><p>9 We love to buy cheap hardware that’s easily disposed of or replaced rather than painstakingly caring for and maintaining expensive hardware with designer labels. [sent-30, score-0.332]
</p><p>10 Design your product     for goldfish (commodity hardware    ) and you will nearly always lower your total cost of ownership and increase your ability to leverage clouds and rapid horizontal scale. [sent-31, score-0.516]

</p><p>12 It isn’t that difficult in our experience to build horizontal scale into your architecture, even within the database tier. [sent-43, score-0.324]
</p><p>13 While there are competing theories on this particular       matter      , most of us have plenty of opportunity to learn from past mistakes in both our engineering and operations environments. [sent-46, score-0.318]

</p><p>17 Our       D-I-D       approach to scale helps you to quickly react to scale needs by always designing well ahead of need, coding or implementing slightly ahead of need and deploying the capital assets “just in time” for your growth. [sent-68, score-0.315]

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

<p>Introduction: This is a guest posting by Marty Abbott and Michael Fisher, authors of  The Art of Scalability . I'm still reading their book and will have an interview with them a little later.     

    

      

   If 2010 is the year that you’ve decided to kickoff your startup or if you’ve already got something off the ground and are expecting double or triple digit growth, this list is for you.  We all want     the     attention     of user    s     to achieve viral growth but as many     can attest    , too much attention can bring a startup to its knees.      If you’ve used Twitter for any amount of time you’re sure to have seen the “Fail Whale”, which is so often seen that it has its own       fan club      .      Take a look at the graph below from Compete.com showing Twitter’s unique visitors.      One can argue that limitations in the product offering have as much to do with the flattening of growth     over the past six months     as does the availability    ,     but     it’s hard to beli</p><p>2 0.8292616 <a title="757-lsi-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-13-Is_premature_scalation_a_real_disease%3F.html">185 high scalability-2007-12-13-Is premature scalation a real disease?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3: InfoQ's  Big Architecture Up Front - A Case of Premature Scalaculation?  twines several different threads on the topic together into a fine noose.     Update 2: Kevin says the  biggest problems he sees with startups is they need to scale  their backend (no, the other one).     Update: My bad.  It's hard to sell scalability  so just forget it.       The premise of   Startups and The Problem Of Premature Scalaculation   and   Donâ&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Mart   is that you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?     If I ever believed this I certainly don't believe it anymore.

<p>Introduction: Update 2:   Velocity 09: John Allspaw, 10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr . Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change.  Operations and developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature flags -  don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics. Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access to production</p><p>4 0.82639283 <a title="757-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-10-A_Perfect_Fifth_of_Notes_on_Scalability.html">1172 high scalability-2012-01-10-A Perfect Fifth of Notes on Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremiah Peschka with a great a set of  Notes on Scalability , just in case you do reach your wildest expectations of success:
  
   Build it to Break . Plan for the fact that everything you make is going to break. Design in layers that are independent and redundant. 
  Everything is a Feature . Your application is a set of features created by a series of conscious choices made by considering trade-offs.  
  Scale Out, Not Up . Purchasing more hardware is easier than coding and managing horizontal resources.  
  Buy More Storage . Large numbers of smaller, faster drives have more IOPS than fewer, larger drives. 
  You’re Going to Do It Wrong . Be prepared to iterate on your ideas. You will make mistakes.  Be prepared to re-write code and to quickly move on to the next idea.

<p>Introduction: And by hot I also mean temperature. Summer has arrived. It's sizzling here in Silicon Valley. Thank you air conditioning!
  
 Scale the web by appointing a Crawler Czar? Tom Foremski has the idea that  Google should open up their index  so sites wouldn't have to endure the constant pounding by ravenous crawler bots. Don MacAskill of SmugMug estimates  50% of our web server CPU resources  are spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data over and over again?

<p>Introduction: In  Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation  we learn some shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):
  
  Average server utilization in many data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.  
 Surely that's just for old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade. 
  
It's a VM wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same server.
 
It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method that performs provably close to the optimal.

<p>Introduction: If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will. --  Steve Jobs   
 
       
 
 
America as the New World has a long history of inspiring  Utopian communities . Early experiments were famously religious. But there have been many others as new waves of thought have inspired people to organize and try something different.
 
In the 1840s Transcendentalists, believing the true path lay in the perfection of the individual, created intentional communities like  Brook Farm . We've also seen  socialist ,  anarchist ,  hippy , and virtually every other kind of Utopia in-between. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote an infamous book,  Walden Two , with a more "scientific" take on creating a Utopian community and Ayn Rand in  Atlas Shrugged  had her free market version.
 
I believe in startup organizations we see the modern version of Utopian energy in action. We now call it by names like "culture hacking", but the goal is the same: to create a new form of human community to achieve a profound go</p><p>4 0.9509964 <a title="757-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-15-The_Amazing_Collective_Compute_Power_of_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">778 high scalability-2010-02-15-The Amazing Collective Compute Power of the Ambient Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.   
 
Earlier we talked about how a single botnet could harness more compute power than our largest super computers. Well, that's just the start of it. The amount of computer power available to the Ambient Cloud will be truly astounding.
  2 Billion Personal Computers  
The number of personal computers is still growing. By 2014 one estimate is there will be  2 billion PCs . That's a giant reservoir of power to exploit, especially considering these new boxes are stuffed with multiple powerful processors and gigabytes of memory.
  7 Billion Smartphones  
By now it's common wisdom smartphones are the computing platform of the future. It's plausible to assume the total number of  mobile phones  in use will roughly equal the number of people on earth. That's 7 billion smartphones.

<p>Introduction: While working with Memcache the other night, it dawned on me that it’s usage as a distributed caching mechanism was really just one of many ways to use it. That there are in fact many alternative usages that one could find for Memcache if they could just realize what Memcache really is at its core – a simple distributed hash-table – is an important point worthy of further discussion.     To be clear, when I say “simple”, by no means am I implying that Memcache’s implementation is simple, just that the ideas behind it are such. Think about that for a minute. What else could we use a simple distributed hash-table for, besides caching? How about using it as an alternative to the traditional shard lookup method we used in our Master Index Lookup scalability strategy, discussed previously here.</p><p>6 0.93880051 <a title="757-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-25-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_June_25%2C_2010.html">848 high scalability-2010-06-25-Hot Scalability Links for June 25, 2010</a></p>

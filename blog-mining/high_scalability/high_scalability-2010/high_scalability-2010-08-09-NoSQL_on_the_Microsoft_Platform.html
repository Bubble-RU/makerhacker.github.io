A very thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of approaches to not being a relational database.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by     Frédéric Faure      (architect at    Ysance   ), you can follow him on    twitter   .  
 
Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it’s true that the marketing wave of NoSQL has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that’s been around for quite a while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all, everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very p</p><p>4 0.1690861 <a title="875-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-15-The_Common_Principles_Behind_the_NOSQL_Alternatives.html">749 high scalability-2009-12-15-The Common Principles Behind the NOSQL Alternatives</a></p>

 Update 7:   The Future of Scalable Databases  by Robin Mathew.
 
 Update 6:   NoSQL : If Only it Was that Easy . BJ Clark lays down the law on which databases are scalable: Tokyo - NO, Redis - NO, Voldemort - YES, MongoDB - Not Yet, Cassandra - Probably, Amazon S3 - YES * 2, MySQL - NO.  The real thing to point out is that if you are being held back from making something super awesome because you can’t choose a database, you are doing it wrong.   Update 5:   Exciting stuff happening in Japan at this Key-Value Storage meeting in Tokyo . Presentations on Groonga, Senna, Lux IO, Tokyo-Cabinet, Tx, repcached, Kai, Cagra, kumofs, ROMA, and Flare.

<p>Introduction: I’ve largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the “NoSQL vs. Relational” conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to build in, I’d like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint. In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I’ve inadvertently given myself plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches, and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say with a fair amount of certainty, that I’ve found a good compromise.

The ArchCamp unconference was held this past Friday at HackerDojo in Mountain View, CA.  There was plenty of pizza, beer, and great conversation.  This session started out free-form, but shaped up pretty quickly into a discussion of the popular open source scalable NoSQL databases and the architectural categories in which they belong.</p><p>5 0.78216076 <a title="875-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-25-Brian_Aker%27s_Hilarious_NoSQL_Stand_Up_Routine.html">745 high scalability-2009-11-25-Brian Aker's Hilarious NoSQL Stand Up Routine</a></p>

<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source. There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity: from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there’s Riak, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft Windows. I’m going to outline what’s available now and briefly touch on some opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jeff Su  from Factual. 
 
 
  What is Varnish?  
 Varnish  is an open source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for both static and dynamic content.
 
One great thing about Varnish is that it can improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.  If you haven’t heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven’t used it), please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive, but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish’s more advanced features, you’ll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.
 
Some of the high profile companies using Varnish include:  Twitter ,  Facebook ,  Heroku  and  LinkedIn .
  Our Use Case  
One of Factual’s first high profile projects was  Newsweek’s “America’s Best High Schools: The List” . After realizing that we had only a few weeks to increase our</p><p>3 0.64942229 <a title="875-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-16-What_if_Cars_Were_Rented_Like_We_Hire_Programmers%3F.html">1388 high scalability-2013-01-16-What if Cars Were Rented Like We Hire Programmers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are hired at many software companies...   Agency  : So sorry you had to wait in the reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?  Applicant  : I drive a 2008 Subaru.  Agency  : That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent you.  Applicant  : That's OK. Any car will do.  Agency  : No, we can only take on clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way. There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take a chance.  Applicant  : I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt.</p><p>4 0.62502003 <a title="875-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-13-SQL_Server_2008_Database_Performance_and_Scalability.html">410 high scalability-2008-10-13-SQL Server 2008 Database Performance and Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 incorporates the tools and technologies that are necessary to implement relational databases, reporting systems, and data warehouses of enterprise scale, and provides optimal performance and responsiveness.      With SQL Server 2008, you can take advantage of the latest hardware technologies while scaling up your servers to support server consolidation. SQL Server 2008 also enables you to scale out your largest data solutions.         This white paper describes the performance and scalability capabilities of Microsoft速 SQL Server速 2008 and explains how you can use these capabilities to:           * Optimize performance for any size of database with the tools and features that are available for the database engine, analysis services, reporting services, and integration services.               * Scale up your servers to take full advantage of new hardware capabilities.         * Scale out your database environment to optimize responsiveness and to move your data</p><p>5 0.62353891 <a title="875-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-06-Sponsored_Post%3A_FreeAgent%2C_Percona_Live%21%2C_Strata%2C_Box%2C_BetterWorks%2C_New_Relic%2C_NoSQL_Now%21%2C_Surge%2C_Tungsten%2C_AppDynamics%2C_Couchbase%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1111 high scalability-2011-09-06-Sponsored Post: FreeAgent, Percona Live!, Strata, Box, BetterWorks, New Relic, NoSQL Now!, Surge, Tungsten, AppDynamics, Couchbase, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

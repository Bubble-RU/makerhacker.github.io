<p>Introduction: The transport-level server load balancing architectures described in   the first half of this article   are more than adequate for many Web sites, but more complex and dynamic sites can't depend on them. Applications that rely on cache or session data must be able to handle a sequence of requests from the same client accurately and efficiently, without failing. In this follow up to his introduction to server load balancing, Gregor Roth discusses various application-level load balancing architectures, helping you decide which one will best meet the business requirements of your Web site.           The first half of this article   describes transport-level server load balancing solutions, such as TCP/IP-based load balancers, and analyzes their benefits and disadvantages. Load balancing on the TCP/IP level spreads incoming TCP connections over the real servers in a server farm. It is sufficient in most cases, especially for static Web sites. However, support for dynamic Web sites often re</p><p>5 0.1418083 <a title="948-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-16-What_tech_is_used_to_build_your_favorite_site%3F.html">66 high scalability-2007-08-16-What tech is used to build your favorite site?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Find out with Builtwith.com. It scans a site and guesses how the site is built. I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows,  PHP, Adsense, RSS, CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which AJAX library is used. Though it's kind of cool to see which sites use PHP and other technologies.</p><p>6 0.13000591 <a title="948-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-24-Building_a_Scalable_Architecture_for_Web_Apps.html">392 high scalability-2008-09-24-Building a Scalable Architecture for Web Apps</a></p>

<p>Introduction: eAccelerator  is a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution. eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.</p><p>3 0.65710688 <a title="948-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-03-5_Rockin%27_Tips_for_Scaling_PHP_to_30%2C000_Concurrent_Users_Per_Server.html">1486 high scalability-2013-07-03-5 Rockin' Tips for Scaling PHP to 30,000 Concurrent Users Per Server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block , CTO at  RockThePost.com , a crowdfunding company, has  written a nice set of tips  for smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a small two person development team. 
 
Their service has a typical small scale structure:
  
 PHP's Zend Framework 2 
 Two m1.medium for web servers 
 ELB to split the load 
 master/slave MySQL database 
 Siege for load testing 
  
The very sensible tips that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: 
  
  Use PHP's APC feature . APC is opcode cache that is " really a requirement in order for a website to have a chance at performing well."  
  Put everything that's not a .php request on a CDN . Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused them to serve directly from S3. 
  Don't make connections to other servers in your PHP code . Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down processing. Use the APC k</p><p>4 0.65244746 <a title="948-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-30-Olio_Web2.0_Toolkit_-_Evaluate_Web_Technologies_and_Tools.html">434 high scalability-2008-10-30-Olio Web2.0 Toolkit - Evaluate Web Technologies and Tools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you evaluate and decide which web technologies (and there are myriads out there) to use for your new web application, which one potentially gives you the best performance, which one will likely give you the shortest time-to-market? The Apache incubator project   Olio   might help.     Olio is a is an open source web 2.0 toolkit to help evaluate the suitability, functionality and performance of web technologies. Olio defines an example web2.0 application (an events site somewhat like yahoo.com/upcoming) and provides three initial implementations : PHP, Java EE and RubyOnRails (ROR). The toolkit also defines ways to drive load against the application in order to measure performance.     Apache Olio could be used to     Understand how to use various web 2.0 technologies such as AJAX, memcached, mogileFS etc. Use the code in the application to understand the subtle complexities involved and how to get around issues with these technologies.   Evaluate the differences in the three imp</p><p>5 0.6023429 <a title="948-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-07-How_Ruby_on_Rails_Survived_a_550k_Pageview_Digging.html">203 high scalability-2008-01-07-How Ruby on Rails Survived a 550k Pageview Digging</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Shanti Braford  details how his Ruby on Rails  based website survived a 24 hour 550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup details, so there's not much I can add.   Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR, nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of the performance boost.    Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>6 0.58997768 <a title="948-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-26-Paper%3A_Wikipedia%27s_Site_Internals%2C_Configuration%2C_Code_Examples_and_Management_Issues.html">134 high scalability-2007-10-26-Paper: Wikipedia's Site Internals, Configuration, Code Examples and Management Issues</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Professor  David Malan  gives a very good lecture on scalability for dynamic websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high availability.

This is one lecture in a series of 13 lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to:  build dynamic websites  with  Ajax  and with  Linux ,  Apache ,  MySQL , and  PHP  ( LAMP ); set up  domain names  with  DNS ;  structure pages  with  XHTML  and  CSS  how to  program  in  JavaScript  and  PHP ;  configure Apache and  MySQL ; design and  query databases  with  SQL ; use  Ajax  with both  XML  and JSON ;</p><p>2 0.92240423 <a title="948-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-08-Making_the_case_for_PHP_at_Yahoo%21_%28Oct_2002%29.html">85 high scalability-2007-09-08-Making the case for PHP at Yahoo!

<p>Introduction: This presentation by Michael Radwin describes why Yahoo! had standardized on PHP going forward. It describes how after reviewing all the web technologies including their own internal ones, PHP was choosen. It shows that not only technical reasons , but also business and development processes were taken into account.</p><p>3 0.88277328 <a title="948-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-14-Product%3A_The_Spread_Toolkit.html">122 high scalability-2007-10-14-Product: The Spread Toolkit</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Complex applications coordinating work across a lot of machines often need a highly performing fault tolerant message layer. Though a blast to write, it's probably a better use of your time to use an off the shelf solution. And that's where  Spread  comes in. Flickr, for example, uses Spread to create real-time event feeds from their web server logs. What exactly is Spread?
   
 From the  Spread  website:
    Spread is an open source toolkit that provides a high performance messaging service that is resilient to faults across local and wide area networks. Spread functions as a unified message bus for distributed applications, and provides highly tuned application-level multicast, group communication, and point to point support. Spread services range from reliable messaging to fully ordered messages with delivery guarantees.  Spread can be used in many distributed applications that require high reliability, high performance, and robust communication among various subsets of members.

<p>Introduction: ThePort Network's Director of Engineering, TJ Muehleman was kind of enough to share some of the architectural details for their white label social media system. It currently runs about 50 social networks varying in size from less than 1000 members to more than 300,000 members, all on a Microsoft stack. In addition to their social networking platform, they offer Javascript APIs and web service APIs (both REST and SOAP) which account for a significant percentage of overall system usage.  ThePort is an excellent example of a real world in-the-trenches product offering real value to customers.  One of the most interesting problems they have to solve is multi-tenancy. How do you provide good performance, complete customization, support, develop new features, and provide individual search indexes for each customer? It's not an easy problem to solve.  How did they solve their problems and build a successful system?

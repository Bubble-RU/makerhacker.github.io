<p>Introduction: Update:Social networks in the database: using a graph database. A nice post on
representing, traversing, and performing other common social network
operations using a graph database.If you areDiggorLinkedInyou can build your
own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network
relationships. For those of more modest meansNeo4j, a graph database, is a
good alternative.A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges
(relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs)
on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to
represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships
are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and
relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look
at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for
relationships."A graph looks something like:For more lovely examples take a

<p>Introduction: O'Reilly Radar's James Turner conducted avery informative interviewwith Joe
Stump, current CTO ofSimpleGeoand former lead architect atDigg, in which Joe
makes some of his usually insightful comments on his experience using
Cassandra vs MySQL. As Digg started out with aMySQL oriented architectureand
has recently beenmoving full speedto Cassandra, his observations on some of
their lessons learned and the motivation for the move are especially valuable.
Here are some of the key takeaways you find useful:Precompute on writes, make
reads fast. This is an oldie as a scaling strategy, but it's valuable to see
how SimpleGeo is applying it to their problem of finding entities within a
certain geographical region. Using Cassandra they've built two clusters: one
for indexes and one for records. The records cluster, as you might imagine, is
a simple data lookup. The index cluster has a carefully constructed key for
every lookup scenario. The indexes are computed on the write, so reads are
very fas</p><p>4 0.24142624 <a title="805-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-30-Running_Large_Graph_Algorithms_-_Evaluation_of_Current_State-of-the-Art_and_Lessons_Learned.html">801 high scalability-2010-03-30-Running Large Graph Algorithms - Evaluation of Current State-of-the-Art and Lessons Learned</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>5 0.24019064 <a title="805-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Paper%3A_Graph_Databases_and_the_Future_of_Large-Scale_Knowledge_Management.html">626 high scalability-2009-06-10-Paper: Graph Databases and the Future of Large-Scale Knowledge Management</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all
programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.Then you may observe after
coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form
of interacting patterns of flows.Then you may think hey, a program isn't only
useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and
that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over
data and flow over other flows.That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making
available in the Graph extension to their plumbing package (code examples),
which is described in an excellent post:Graph: Abstractions for Structured
Computation.You may remember Prismatic from previous profile we did on
HighScalability: Prismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning On Social
Networks To Figure Out What You Should Read On The Web. We learned how
Prismatic, an interest driven content suggestion service, builds programs in

<p>Introduction: GraphChiuses aParallel Sliding Windowsmethod which can: process a graph with
mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-
sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of
computation.The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on
just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar
toPregel, which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style
of MapReduce. Streaming graph updates are supported.About GraphChi, Carlos
Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,says:A Mac Mini running
GraphChi can analyze Twitter's social graph from 2010--which contains 40
million users and 1.2 billion connections--in 59 minutes. "The previous

to store 2.9 × 1020 optimally compressed bytes, communicate almost 2 × 1021
bytes, and carry out 6.4 × 1018 instructions per second on general-purpose
computers.Hadoop has hit a scalability limit at a whopping 4,000 machines and
are looking to create thenext generation architecture. Their target is
clusters of 10,000 machines and 200,000 cores.The fundamental idea of the re-
architecture is to divide the two major functions of the Job Tracker, resource
management and job scheduling/monitoring, into separate components. If you

this responsibility is given to Database layer. By using sequences or some
other technique. This is a problem for horizontal scalability.What are the
Guid generation schemes used in high scalable web sites generally? I have seen

than 30,000 miles on it.Yes, you heard that right, less than 30,000 miles. I
don't drive my car very often because, well, my commute is a short trip down
two flights of stairs. I don't need to go very far when I do drive it's only
ten miles or so round trip to the grocery store. So from my perspective, gas
isn't really very expensive. I may use a tank of gas a month, which works out
to … well, it's really not even worth mentioning the cost. But for someone who
commutes every day - especially someone who commutes a long-distance every day
- gas is expensive. It's a significant expense every month for them and they

<p>Introduction: hi,the website i work for is looking to build a email system that can handle a
fair few emails (up to a hundred thousand a day).These comprise emails like
registration emails, newsletters, lots of user triggered emails and overnight
emails.At present we queue them in SQL and feed them into an smtp server on
one of our web servers when the queue drops below a certain level.this has
caused our mail system to crash as well as hammer our DB server (shared!!!).We
have got an architecture of what we want to build but thought there might be
something we could buy off the shelf that allowed us to keep templated emails,
lists of recipients, schedule sends etc and report on it. We can't find
anythingWhat do big websites like amazon etc use or people a little smaller
but who still send loads of mail (flickr, ebuyer, or other ecommerce
sites)Cheerstarqs</p><p>5 0.93086427 <a title="805-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-14-Sun_N1_Grid_Engine_Software_and_the_Tokyo_Institute_of_Technology_Super_Computer_Grid.html">412 high scalability-2008-10-14-Sun N1 Grid Engine Software and the Tokyo Institute of Technology Super Computer Grid</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of
Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of
the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data
servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective,
flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute- and data-intensive
applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of
systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory,
and delivers 47.38 trillion1 floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS)
of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to
users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment
architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future. This
Sun BluePrints article provides an overview of the Tokyo Tech grid, named
TSUBAME. The third in a series of Sun BluePrints articles on the TSUBAME grid,

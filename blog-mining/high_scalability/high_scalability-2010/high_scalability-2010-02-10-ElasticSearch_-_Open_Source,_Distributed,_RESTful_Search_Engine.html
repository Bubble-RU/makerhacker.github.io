<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byZardosht Kasheff, Software Developer atTokutek, a
storage engine company that delivers 21st-Century capabilities to the leading
open source data management platforms.As software developers, we value
abstraction. The simpler the API, the more attractive it becomes. Arguably,
MongoDB's greatest strengths are its elegant API and itsagility, which let
developers simply code.But whenMongoDBruns into scalability problems onbig
data, developers need to peek underneath the covers to understand the
underlying issues and how to fix them. Without understanding, one may end up
with an inefficient solution that costs time and money. For example, one may
shard prematurely, increasing hardware and management costs, when a simpler
replication setup would do. Or, one may increase the size of a replica set
when upgrading to SSDs would suffice.This article showshow to reason about
some big data scalability problemsin an effort to find efficient
solutions.Defining the IssuesFirst, l</p><p>4 0.16092911 <a title="775-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: ThePort Network's Director of Engineering, TJ Muehleman was kind of enough to
share some of the architectural details for their white label social media
system. It currently runs about 50 social networks varying in size from less
than 1000 members to more than 300,000 members, all on a Microsoft stack. In
addition to their social networking platform, they offer Javascript APIs and
web service APIs (both REST and SOAP) which account for a significant
percentage of overall system usage.ThePort is an excellent example of a real
world in-the-trenches product offering real value to customers. One of the
most interesting problems they have to solve is multi-tenancy. How do you
provide good performance, complete customization, support, develop new
features, and provide individual search indexes for each customer? It's not an
easy problem to solve.How did they solve their problems and build a successful
system? Site: http://theport.comPlatformMicrosoft.NET 3.5C# / VB.NETSQL Server

<p>Introduction: Hi,I want to implement a search engine with lucene.To be scalable, I would
like to execute search jobs asynchronously (with a job queuing system).But i
don't know if it is a good design... Why ?Search results can be large ! (eg:
100+ pages with 25 documents per page)With asynchronous sytem, I need to store
results for each search job.I can set a short expiration time (~5 min) for
each search result, but it's still large.What do you think about it ?Which
design would you use for that ?ThanksMat</p><p>5 0.66143548 <a title="775-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-14-kngine_%27Knowledge_Engine%27_milestone_2.html">630 high scalability-2009-06-14-kngine 'Knowledge Engine' milestone 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kngine is Knowledge Web search engine designed to provide meaningful search
results, such as: semantic information about the keywords/concepts, answer the
user's questions, discover the relations between the keywords/concepts, and
link the different kind of data together, such as: Movies, Subtitles, Photos,
Price at sale store, User reviews, and Influenced storyGoalsKngine long-term
goal is to make all human beings systematic knowledge and experience
accessible to everyone. I aim to collect and organize all objective data, and
make it possible and easy to access. Our goal is to build on the advances of
Web search engine, semantic web, data representation technologies a new form
of Web search engine that will unleash a revolution of new
possibilities.Kngine tries to combine the power of Web search engines with the
power of Semantic search and the data representation to provide meaningful
search results compromising user needs.StatusKngine starts as a research
project in October 2008. Ov</p><p>6 0.66055793 <a title="775-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding_the_Hibernate_Way.html">358 high scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding the Hibernate Way</a></p>

<p>Introduction: ElasticSearchis an open source, distributed, RESTful search engine built on
top ofLucene. Itsfeaturesinclude:Distributed and Highly Available Search
Engine.Each index is fully sharded with a configurable number of shards.Each
shard can have zero or more replicas.Read / Search operations performed on
either replica shard.Multi Tenant with Multi Types.Support for more than one
index.Support for more than one type per index.Index level configuration
(number of shards, index storage, ...).Various set of APIs.HTTP RESTful
API.Native Java API.All APIs perform automatic node operation
rerouting.Document oriented.No need for upfront schema definition.Schema can
be defined per type for customization of the indexing process.Reliable,
Asynchronous Write Behind for long term persistency.(Near) Real Time

<p>Introduction: Slashdot effect: overwhelming unprepared sites with an avalanche of reader's
clicks after being mentioned on Slashdot. Sure, we now have the "Digg effect"
and other hot new stars, but Slashdot was the original. And like many stars
from generations past, Slashdot plays the elder statesman's role with with
class, dignity, and restraint. Yet with millions and millions of users
Slashdot is still box office gold and more than keeps up with the young'ins.
And with age comes the wisdom of learning how to handle all those users. Just
how does Slashdot scale and what can you learn by going old school?breakSite:

truly horrendous crimes against scalability today.@ErrataRob: doubling
performance doesn't double scalability.@rsingel: In 2008 when Yahoo.com
linked out, I had a Wired story get 1M visitors in an hour from their
homepage.@philiph: Lets solve this scalability problem with a queuing
system@jaykreps: Transferring data across data centers? Read this page and go
tune your TCP buffer sizes...@gwestr: In which the node community showers
schadenfreude upon the rails community for "scalability is not my problem"
architectures@pbailis:  Makes sense, though I think there's a tradeoff re:
coordination and scalability (always homogeneous vs dynamically
heterogenous)@pembleton: To summarize Yoav's philosophy: we started as quick
as we can and then we accelerated #operationgrandma in #reversim@surfichris:
"We chose Heroku because we believed we could just `heroku scale web=X` when
needed." \- Yeah, because scalability is</p><p>4 0.92645675 <a title="775-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-20-The_Tumblr_Architecture_Yahoo_Bought_for_a_Cool_Billion_Dollars.html">1461 high scalability-2013-05-20-The Tumblr Architecture Yahoo Bought for a Cool Billion Dollars</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's being reportedYahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion. You may
recallInstagram was profiled on HighScalabilityand they were also bought by
Facebook for a ton of money. A coincidence? You be the judge.Just what is
Yahoo buying? The business acumen of the deal is not something I can judge,
but if you are doing due diligence on the technology then Tumblr would
probably get a big thumbs up. To see why, please keep on reading...With over
15 billion page views a month Tumblr has become an insanely popular blogging
platform. Users may like Tumblr for its simplicity, its beauty, its strong
focus on user experience, or its friendly and engaged community, but like it
they do.Growing at over 30% a month has not been without challenges. Some
reliability problems among them. It helps to realize that Tumblr operates at
surprisingly huge scales: 500 million page views a day, a peak rate of ~40k

chasm crossing from startup to wildly successful startup. Finding people,
evolving infrastructures, servicing old infrastructures, while handling huge
month over month increases in traffic, all with only four engineers, means you
have to make difficult choices about what to work on. This was Tumblr's
situation. Now with twenty engineers there's enough energy to work on issues

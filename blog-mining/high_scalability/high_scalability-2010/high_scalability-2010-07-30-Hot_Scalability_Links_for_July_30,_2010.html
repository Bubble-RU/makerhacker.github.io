<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: Update: How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences. Shows how to
analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what
I mean. Steve Souders, author ofHigh Performance WebsitesandYslow, hasten more

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released
information onPregel. Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip.
Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure......to mine a wide range of
graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each
iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages
sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify
its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's
topology.Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this
limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but
so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing
problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much
faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to
use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

<p>Introduction: Update: Organism without a brain creates external memories for navigationshows
slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where
it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's
calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the
organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that
won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors
make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants.  InAfter Life: The
Strange Science Of Decaythere's a truly incredible sequence of gorgeously shot
video showing howcreeping slime moldsolves mazes and performs other other
amazing feats of computation. Take a look at what simple one celled organisms
can do:The whole video is really well done and shockingly revelatory. It's the

<p>Introduction: When you have a large population of servers you have both the opportunity and
the incentive to perform interesting studies. Authors from Google and the
University of California in Optimizing Google's Warehouse Scale Computers: The
NUMA Experience conducted such a study, taking a look at how jobs run on
clusters of machines using a NUMA architecture. Since NUMA is common on server
class machines it's a topic of general interest for those looking to maximize
machine utilization across clusters.Some of the results are surprising:The
methodology of how to attribute such fine performance variations to NUMA
effects within such a complex system is perhaps more interesting than the
results themselves. Well worth reading just for that story.The performance
swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on
Intel Westmere for Web-search frontend. Memory locality is not always King.
Because of the interaction between NUMA and cache sharing/contention it turns

stored1,250,000,000 Key/Value Pairs in Redis on a 32GB Machine.Data sorting
world record: 1 terabyte, 1 minute. The system has 52 computer nodes, each
node is a commodity server with two quad-core processors, 24 gigabytes (GB)
memory and sixteen 500 GB disks. It's not just hardware though, they also
built a software that utilized all their CPU and RAM.Tweets of Gold:wm: I am
really getting the sense that none of you yokels waxing profound about

things to *mitigate* pain points up front. You don't need to over-engineer,
but it's not hard to look forward.danielcrenna: I love it when I check in

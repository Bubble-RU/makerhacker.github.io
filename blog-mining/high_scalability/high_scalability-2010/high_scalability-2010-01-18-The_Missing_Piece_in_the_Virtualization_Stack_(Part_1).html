we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today's IT
inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much
simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core

<p>Introduction: When you're looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium ecosystem,
one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular breed of fish is
amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are not, which means if you
put them together in a confined space, they're going to fight. Viciously. To
the death. Responsible aquarists try to avoid such situations, so careful
attention to theconspecificityof animals is a must.Now, while in many respects
the data center ecosystem correlates well to an aquarium ecosystem, in this
case it does not. It's what you usually get, today, but its not actually the
best model. That's because what you want in the data center ecosystem -
particularly when it extends to include publiccloud computingresources - is
conspecificity in infrastructure.This desire and practice is being seen both
in enterprise data center decision making as well as in startups suddenly
dealing with massive growth and increasingly encountering performance
bottlenecks over w</p><p>3 0.74898374 <a title="762-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-09-Paper%3A_Container-based_Operating_System_Virtualization%3A_A_Scalable%2C_High-performance_Alternative_to_Hypervisors.html">147 high scalability-2007-11-09-Paper: Container-based Operating System Virtualization: A Scalable, High-performance Alternative to Hypervisors</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Caching/data-grids are going through a similar evolution to databases. As with
databases, we started by using caching as an embedded service to the
application. Now we are in the phase where we need to be able to share the
data between multiple applications, or in cases where we don't want to share
the data, we need to be able to share the resources for managing the data,
while keeping a high degree of isolation.The demand for these sort of
requirements becomes much more common with SOA or SaaS-based applications. As
we approach the next generation of middleware and data-centers, it becomes
clear that we cannot move to the next wave of virtualization and cloud
computing without a strong security and isolation solution that is built-in to
all layers of our application and middleware.</p><p>5 0.73393214 <a title="762-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-What_is_Network-based_Application_Virtualization_and_Why_Do_You_Need_It%3F.html">924 high scalability-2010-10-21-What is Network-based Application Virtualization and Why Do You Need It?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This and the next post will discuss how virtualization and cloud computing, as
we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today's IT
inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much
simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core
inefficiencies lie. Virtualization principles must be extended to higher
levels of the application stack, to make it easier for all of us to manage,
tune and integrate applications. Otherwise we will continue to spend most of
our time on things that don't provide real value to the business.Read the full

<p>Introduction: It is fairly obvious that web site performance can be increased by making the
code run faster and optimising the response time. But that only scales up to a
point. To really take our web sites to the next level, we need to look at the
performance problem from a different angle.</p><p>6 0.87517619 <a title="762-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-22-EVE_Online_Architecture.html">424 high scalability-2008-10-22-EVE Online Architecture</a></p>

This site is very much NSFW, so be careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new, using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached, RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.
  What is Poppen.de?  
Poppen.de (NSFW) is the top dating website in  Germany, and while it may be a small site compared to giants like Flickr  or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to learn from if you  are starting to get some scaling problems.
  The  Stats   
 2.000.000 users 
 20.000  concurrent users 
 300.000 private messages per day 
 250.000  logins per day 
 We have a team  of  eleven developers, two designers and two sysadmins for this project. 
   Business Model  
The site works with a  freemium model, where users can do for free things like: 
  
 Search</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 Much more…     If they  want to send unlimited messages or have unlimited picture uploads then  they can pay for different kinds of membership according to their needs. [sent-20, score-0.378]
</p><p>2 Then we have  separate machines to serve the site images. [sent-28, score-0.296]
</p><p>3 One  of the cool things that Nginx lets us do is to deliver many requests  out of Memcached, without the need of hitting the PHP machines to get  content that is already cached. [sent-34, score-0.455]
</p><p>4 There  are 8000 requests per minute delivered out of the Memcached. [sent-38, score-0.234]
</p><p>5 If the picture is not  in the local cache filesystem, the Nginx will download the picture from  the central server, store in its local cache and serve it. [sent-42, score-0.428]
</p><p>6 This lets us  load balance the image distribution and alleviate the load in the main  storage machine. [sent-43, score-0.428]
</p><p>7 On one hand this means  extra resource footprint, on the other hand it gives us speed of  development and a well know framework that lets us integrate new  developers to the team with ease. [sent-54, score-0.316]
</p><p>8 Thanks to the fact that the  framework is easy to customize and configure, we were able to cache most  of the expensive calculations that were adding extra load to the  servers in APC. [sent-60, score-0.245]
</p><p>9 We want to partition the data by user id, since most of the  information on the site is centered on the user itself, like images,  videos, messages, etc. [sent-66, score-0.319]
</p><p>10 We  also have an NDB cluster composed by 4 machines for write intensive  data, like the statistics of which user visited which other user's  profile. [sent-71, score-0.244]
</p><p>11 We have a system that lets automatically  invalidate the cache every time one record of that table is modified. [sent-82, score-0.391]
</p><p>12 During the last month we have been moving  more and more stuff to the queue, meaning that at the moment the 28 PHP  frontend machines are publishing around 500. [sent-88, score-0.234]
</p><p>13 To enqueue messages we use one  of the coolest features provided by PHP-FPM which is the  fastcgi_finish_request() function. [sent-91, score-0.249]
</p><p>14 This allows us to send messages to  the queue in an asynchronous fashion. [sent-92, score-0.399]
</p><p>15 We have two machines dedicated to  consume those messages, running at the moment 40 PHP processes in total  to consume the jobs. [sent-96, score-0.234]
</p><p>16 This  system lets us improve the resource management. [sent-100, score-0.227]
</p><p>17 From requests per module/action to Memcached hits/misses,  RabbitMQ status monitoring, Unix Load of the servers and much more. [sent-112, score-0.233]
</p><p>18 We were able to run one version of the site in  half of the servers while the new version was running in the others. [sent-119, score-0.385]
</p><p>19 On mid 2009 we were streaming 17TB of video per  month to our users. [sent-128, score-0.239]
</p><p>20 Then we replayed back that traffic and hit  the machines in our lab with thousands of concurrent users generated by  Tsung. [sent-132, score-0.294]

<p>Introduction: Update 6 :  nginx_http_push_module . Turn nginx into a long-polling message queuing HTTP push server.
 
 Update 5 : In  Load Balancer Update  Barry describes how WordPress.com moved from Pound to Nginx and are now "regularly serving about 8-9k requests/second  and about 1.2Gbit/sec through a few Nginx instances and have plenty of room to grow!".   Update 4 :  Nginx better than Pound for load balancing.  Pound spikes at 80% CPU, Nginx uses 3% and is easier to understand and better documented.  Update 3 : igvita.com combines two cool tools together for better performance in  Nginx and Memcached, a 400% boost! .  Update 2 : Software Project on  Installing Nginx Web Server w/ PHP and SSL . Breaking away from mother Apache can be a scary proposition and this kind of getting started article really helps easy the separation.

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case. Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on Fotolog in  Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success , which was one of my personal favorites.  Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've developed a</p><p>4 0.1772912 <a title="808-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With Lavabit  shutting down  under  murky circumstances , it seems fitting to  repost an old  (2009), yet still very good post by  Ladar Levison  on Lavabit's architecture. I don't know how much of this information is still current, but it should give you a general idea what Lavabit was all about.
  
 Getting to Know You 
 What is the name of your system and where can we find out more about it? 

 Note: these links are no longer valid... 


Lavabit   http://lavabit.com      http://lavabit.com/network.html    http://lavabit.com/about.html 

 What is your system for? 

Lavabit is a mid-sized email service provider. We currently have about 140,000 registered users with more than 260,000 email addresses. While most of our accounts belong to individual users, we also provide corporate email services to approximately 70 companies.

 Why did you decide to build this system? 

We built the system to compete against the other large free email providers, with an emphasis on serving the privacy c</p><p>5 0.17384781 <a title="808-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-07-Update_on_Disqus%3A_It%27s_Still_About_Realtime%2C_But_Go_Demolishes_Python.html">1644 high scalability-2014-05-07-Update on Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes Python</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our last article on Disqus:  How Disqus Went Realtime With 165K Messages Per Second And Less Than .2 Seconds Latency , was a little out of date, but the folks at Disqus have been busy implementing, not talking, so we don't know a lot about what they are doing now, but we do have a short update in  C1MM and NGINX  by John Watson and an article  Trying out this Go thing .
 
So Disqus has grown a bit:
  
 1.3 billion unique visitors 
 10 billion page views 
 500 million users engaged in discussions 
 3 million communities 
 25 million comments 
  
They are still all about realtime, but Go replaced Python in their Realtime system:
  
 Original Realtime backend was written in a pretty lightweight Python + gevent. 
 The realtime service is a hybrid of CPU intensive tasks + lots of network IO. Gevent was handling the network IO without an issue, but at higher contention, the CPU was choking everything. Switching over to Go removed that contention, which was the primary issue that was being se</p><p>6 0.17373231 <a title="808-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-31-How_WhatsApp_Grew_to_Nearly_500_Million_Users%2C_11%2C000_cores%2C_and_70_Million_Messages_a_Second.html">1622 high scalability-2014-03-31-How WhatsApp Grew to Nearly 500 Million Users, 11,000 cores, and 70 Million Messages a Second</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steffen Konerow, author of the    High Performance Blog   .  
 
Learning how to scale isn’t easy without any prior experience. Nowadays you have plenty of websites like  highscalability.com  to get some inspiration, but unfortunately there is no solution that fits all websites and needs. You still have to think on your own to find a concept that works for your requirements. So did I.
 
A few years ago, my bosses came to me and said “We’ve got a new project for you. It’s the relaunch of a website that has already 1 million users a month. You have to build the website and make sure we’ll be able to grow afterwards”. I was already an experienced coder, but not in these dimensions, so I had to start learning how to scale – the hard way.
 
The software behind the website was a PHP content management system, based on Smarty and MySQL. The first task was finding a proper hosting company who had the experience and would also manage the servers for us. After some researc</p><p>3 0.79990542 <a title="808-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-22-How_Ravelry_Scales_to_10_Million_Requests_Using_Rails.html">711 high scalability-2009-09-22-How Ravelry Scales to 10 Million Requests Using Rails</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tim Bray  has a wonderful  interview with Casey Forbes , creator of Ravelry, a Ruby on Rails site supporting a 400,000+ strong community of dedicated knitters and crocheters.   Casey and his small team have done great things with Ravelry. It is a very focused site that provides a lot of value for users. And users absolutely adore the site. That's obvious from their enthusiastic comments and rocket fast adoption of Ravelry.  Ten years ago a site like Ravelry would have been a multi-million dollar operation. Today Casey is the sole engineer for Ravelry and to run it takes only a few people. He was able to code it in 4 months working nights and weekends. Take a look down below of all the technologies used to make Ravelry and you'll see how it is constructed almost completely from free of the shelf software that Casey has stitched together into a complete system. There's an amazing amount of leverage in today's ecosystem when you combine all the quality tools, languages, storage, bandwidth</p><p>4 0.79440659 <a title="808-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-30-Rather_small_site_architecture..html">312 high scalability-2008-04-30-Rather small site architecture.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here's an  Update On Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes Python . 
 
How do you add realtime functionality to a web scale application? That's what  Adam Hitchcock , a Software Engineer at Disqus talks about in an excellent talk:  Making DISQUS Realtime  ( slides ).
 
Disqus had to take their commenting system and add realtime capabilities to it. Not something that's easy to do when at the time of the talk (2013) they had had just hit a billion unique visitors a month.
 
What Disqus developed is a realtime commenting system called “realertime” that was tested to handle 1.5 million concurrently connected users, 45,000 new connections per second, 165,000 messages/second, with less than .2 seconds latency end-to-end.
 
The nature of a commenting system is that it is IO bound and has a high fanout, that is a comment comes in and must be sent out to a lot of readers. It's a problem very similar to what  Twitter must solve . 
 
Disqus' solution was quite interesting as was th</p><p>6 0.77774543 <a title="808-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-03-How_Sites_are_Scaling_Up_for_the_Election_Night_Crush.html">437 high scalability-2008-11-03-How Sites are Scaling Up for the Election Night Crush</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the  Stack Overflow Architecture . Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up and out in the last few years.
 
Stack Overflow has grown up by more then doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  
 
Stack Overflow has grown out by expanding into the  Stack Exchange Network , which includes Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.
 
What hasn't changed is Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been handling their growth:  Stack Exchange’s Architecture in Bullet Points ,  Stack Overflow’s New York Data Center ,  Designing For Scalability of Manageme</p><p>2 0.98598963 <a title="808-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets_to_Fotolog%27s_Scaling_Success.html">106 high scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300 thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Eric Czech  ,  Chief Architect at Next Big Sound, talks about some unique approaches taken to solving scalability challenges in music analytics.  
 
Tracking online activity is hardly a new idea, but doing it for the entire music industry isn't easy.  Half a billion music video streams,  track downloads, and artist page likes occur each day and measuring all of this activity across platforms such as Spotify, iTunes, YouTube,  Facebook, and more, poses some interesting scalability challenges.  Next Big Sound collects this type of data from over a hundred sources,  standardizes everything, and offers that information to record labels, band managers, and artists through a web-based analytics platform.
 
While many of our applications use open-source systems like Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Mongo, RabbitMQ, and MySQL, our usage is fairly standard, but there is one aspect of what we do that is pretty unique. We collect or receive information from 100+ sources and we s</p><p>4 0.98283482 <a title="808-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-17-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Sep_17%2C_2010.html">903 high scalability-2010-09-17-Hot Scalability Links For Sep 17, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Disqus - Scaling the Worlds Largest Django App.  Interesting overview of a commenting system with 75 million comments and 250 million visitors. Lots of good details on how they partition their database, testing, continuous integration, feature switches, caching, delayed signals, and more. 
 
  Things I learnt tracking a billion events in 24 hours : Know your host, Scaling isn't just servers, My servers need to talk to me more, Kill switches for users, What you don't know is the problem, Don't mix server roles, Know your most important users outside of your site.

  @maxtaco : Garbage collection solves a minuscule %age of bugs, that are non-critical (memleaks? big deal!) and easy to find and fix. At a HUGE expense.

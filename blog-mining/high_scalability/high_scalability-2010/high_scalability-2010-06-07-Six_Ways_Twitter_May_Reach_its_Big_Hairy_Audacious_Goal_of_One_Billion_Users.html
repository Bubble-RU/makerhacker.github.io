<p>Introduction: Update 6:  Some interesting changes from Twitter's  Evan Weaver : everything in RAM now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability; switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them locally.  Update 5:   Twitter on Scala . A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners.

<p>Introduction: A firestorm of accusations circled around recently saying that Cassandra, the elected-by-major-adopters emperor of the NoSQL movement, has no clothes. It was said Twitter was dumping Cassandra;  Reddit outages  were linked to Cassandra; and even Facebook, Cassandra's cradle of birth, was said to have abandoned Cassandra. Shouts of NoSQL Fail! were heard in the streets. Much gloating followed. Is the emperor really naked? Casually dressed maybe, but not naked.

<p>Introduction: A lot has been said already about Twitter's scalability issues. Many have given Twitter as an anti-pattern of how not to deal with scalability and have suggested different solutions for scaling it. As Twitter is famously a Ruby-on-Rails deployment, this case has also been used as a weapon in the language/platform wars between the RoR and Java camps, and to a lesser degree, also with the LAMP (PHP) camp</p><p>5 0.23316926 <a title="837-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-14-Designing_a_Scalable_Twitter.html">568 high scalability-2009-04-14-Designing a Scalable Twitter</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There were many talks recently about twitter scalability and their specific choice of language such as Scala  to address their existing Ruby based scalability. In this post i tried to provide a more methodical approach for handling twitter scalability challenges that is centered around the right choice of architecture patterns rather then the language itself.   The architecture pattern are given in a generic fashion that is not specific to twitter itself and can serve anyone who is looking to build a scalable real time web application in the near future.</p><p>6 0.22676013 <a title="837-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-18-QCon_London_2009%3A_Upgrading_Twitter_without_service_disruptions.html">544 high scalability-2009-03-18-QCon London 2009: Upgrading Twitter without service disruptions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter’s “problems” are a favorite scalability trope. Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it’s not that simple as   Raffi Krikorian   , VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his superb and very detailed presentation on    Timelines at Scale   . If you want to know how Twitter works - then start here.  
 
It happened gradually so you may have missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a struggling   three-tierish Ruby on Rails    website to become a beautifully service driven core that we actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.  
 
Twitter now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines, and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from Lady Gaga’s fingers to her 31 million followers.

<p>Introduction: Can anyone convincingly explain why properties sporting traffic statistics that may seem in-line with with the capabilities of a single big-iron machine need so many machines in their architecture?
 
This is a common reaction to architecture profiles on High Scalability: I could do all that on a few machines so they must be doing something really stupid. 
 
Lo and behold this same reaction also occurred to the article  The Architecture Twitter Uses to Deal with 150M Active Users . On Hacker News  papsosouid  voiced what a lot of people may have been thinking:
  

I really question the current trend of creating big, complex, fragile architectures to "be able to scale". These numbers are a great example of why, the entire thing could run on a single server, in a very straight forward setup. When you are creating a cluster for scalability, and it has less CPU, RAM and IO than a single server, what are you gaining? They are only doing 6k writes a second for crying out loud.

 Quotable Quotes:                 
 
  Chad Dickerson : You can only get growth by feeding opportunities. 
  @launchany : It amazes me how many NoSQL database vendors spend more time detailing their scalability and no time detailing the data model and design 
  Google : Let's make TCP faster. 
  WhatsApp : we are now able to easily push our systems to over 2 million tcp connections! 
  Sidney Dekker : In a complex system…doing the same thing twice will not predictably or necessarily lead to the same results. 
  @Rasmusfjord : Just heard about an Umbraco site running on Azure that handles 20.000 requests /*second*

I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.
  Those were the days our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to use the curse called “XDoclet”.  On the other side, our company grew steadily, our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of money.

<p>Introduction: Every day brings news of either more failures of the financial systems or out-right fraud, with the $50 billion Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme being the latest, breaking all records. This post provide a technical overview of a solution that was implemented for one of the largest banks in China. The solution illustrate how one can use Excel as a front end client and at the same time leverage cloud computing model and mapreduce as well as other patterns to scale-out risk calculations. I'm hoping that this type of approach will reduce the chances for seeing this type of fraud from happening in the future.</p><p>4 0.96359581 <a title="837-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_28th%2C_2014.html">1603 high scalability-2014-02-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 28th, 2014</a></p>

  @ML_Hipster : A machine learning researcher, a crypto-currency expert, and an Erlang programmer walk into a bar. Facebook buys the bar for $27 billion. 
 OH: Network effects don't happen on toll roads. 
  Benedict Evans : Google is a vast machine learning engine... and it spent 10-15 years building that learning engine and feeding it data. 
 
 
  Mining Experiment: Running 600 Servers for a Year Yields 0.4 Bitcoin . Yes, this is a far superior way of doing things. Chew up the commons for marginal gain. It's like old times. 
  Game designers, forget the sardines and go hunt some whale .  Swrve found : half of free-to-play games’ in-app purchases came from 0.15 percent of players. Only 1.5 percent of players of games in the Swrve network spent any money at all.

<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users  by 2013. Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in  2012 . But let's be optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is the user leader with over  400 million users . Will Facebook stumble or will they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's "low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has  106 million  registered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one billion users served?
 
From recent infrastructure announcements and information gleaned at  Chirp  ( videos ) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal 2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) D</p><p>6 0.94891131 <a title="837-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-27-Making_Hadoop_1000x_Faster_for_Graph_Problems.html">1088 high scalability-2011-07-27-Making Hadoop 1000x Faster for Graph Problems</a></p>

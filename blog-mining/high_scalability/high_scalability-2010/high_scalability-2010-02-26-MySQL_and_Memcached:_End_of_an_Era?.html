<p>Introduction: Memcached is one of the most common In-Memory cache implementation.  It was
originally developed by Danga Interactive for LiveJournal, but is now used by
many other sites as a side cache to speed up read mostly operations. It gained
popularity in the non-Java world, too, especially since it's a language-
neutral side cache for which few alternatives existed.  As a side-cache,
Memcache clients relies on the database as the system of record, The database
is still used for write,update and complex query operations.  Since the
memcached specification includes no query operations, memcached is not a
database alternative, unlike most of the NoSQL offerings. It also exclude
memcache from being a real solution for write scalability. As a result of that
many of the heavy sites started to move away from Memcache and replace it with
other NoSQL alternatives as noted in a recent highscalability post MySQL And
Memcached: End Of An Era?The transition away from memcached to NoSQL could

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've
developed a soph</p><p>4 0.1656552 <a title="785-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-28-And_the_winner_is%3A_MySQL_or_Memcached_or_Tokyo_Tyrant%3F.html">729 high scalability-2009-10-28-And the winner is: MySQL or Memcached or Tokyo Tyrant?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matt, from the ever excellentMySQL Performance Blog, decided to run a test
using a simple scenario drawn from his client experience in the gaming space.
The scenario: read a row based on a primary key, update the row, write it to
disk, and use the row to lookup another row. Matt ran three different tests
explained in a series of three different articles:MySQL and MySQL + Memcached,
Memcached Only, andTokyo Tyrant.The lovingly compiled details along with many
cool graphs are in the articles, but in general the lessons learned are:When
memcached hasenough memory(so records being accessed are in RAM), memcached +
MySQL can provide a10x performance boostover MySQL alone. When the RAM is too
small and hot records, those being accessed a lot, aren't in RAM, or perhaps
applications are doing a sequential scan of a table and the entire table isn't
cached, then memcached won't be the big bang improvement you may be hoping
for.When the database is removed and memcached serves both reads and writ</p><p>5 0.16404191 <a title="785-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.14616224 <a title="785-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Morgan Tocker has an awesome article and comment thread in theMySQL
Performance BlogaboutWhen should you store serialized objects in the
database?Before the NoSQL age is was very common to simulate schemalessness by
storing blobs in MySQL. Sharding was implemented by running multiple MySQL
instances and spreading writes across them. While not ideal for the purpose,
developers felt comfortable with MySQL. They knew how to install it, back it
up, replicate it, in short:  they knew how to make it work. Yet they also
needed to store objects without the penalty of joins. Searches and aggregate
queries were handled by indexes kept in separate tables, this offloaded the
fast path to objects.This all made perfect sense. Usually we just want stuff
to work and going with what you know is often the best path to that goal. And
what we have known is MySQL. All the different pros and cons of this approach
are covered wonderfully in the post.But the world has changed. With the same
goals in mind I do</p><p>3 0.80651802 <a title="785-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-16-The_NewSQL_Market_Breakdown.html">1025 high scalability-2011-04-16-The NewSQL Market Breakdown</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matt Aslett from the 451 group created a term called"NewSQL". On the
definition of NewSQL, Aslett writes:"NewSQL" is our shorthand for the various
new scalable/high performance SQL database vendors. We have previously
referred to these products as 'ScalableSQL' to differentiate them from the
incumbent relational database products. Since this implies horizontal
scalability, which is not necessarily a feature of all the products, we
adopted the term 'NewSQL' in the new report.And to clarify, like NoSQL, NewSQL
is not to be taken too literally: the new thing about the NewSQL vendors is
the vendor, not the SQL.As with NoSQL, under the NewSQL umbrella you can see
various providers, with various solutions.I think these can be divided into
several sub-types:New MySQL storage engines. These give MySQL users the same
programming interface, but scale very well. You can Xeround or Akiban in this
field. The good part is that you still use MySQL, but on the downside it's not

doesn't make him a troll in my mind, he'sway too accomplishedin the field to
be that, but he does have a bit of Barnum & Bailey in him, which serves to get
the discussion flowing, and that's a good thing. A lot of previously hidden
wisdom and passion unlocks, which we'll try to capture here.This disturbance
in the force is over OldSQL vs NoSQL vsNewSQL. Warning, these are not crisp
categories, there's leakage all over the place, watch your step:OldSQL
(Oracle, MySQL, etc) refers to what some want to term as legacy relational
database like MySQL, that don't scale out horizontally with aplomb.NoSQL
(CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, Riak, Neo4j, etc) refers to, well,
a collection of technologies that aren't OldSQL, these often are designed to
scale out horizontally, aren't on ACID, and use schemaless non-relational
datamodels.NewSQL  (Xeround, Clustrix, NimbusDB, GenieDB, ScaleBase, VoltDB)
are databa</p><p>6 0.76816338 <a title="785-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-23-Building_a_Scalable_Key-Value_Database%3A_Project_Hydracus.html">885 high scalability-2010-08-23-Building a Scalable Key-Value Database: Project Hydracus</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like?
Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing.
Specifically the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group(IPNSIG
).Ansible-likefaster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical
warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning
telegraph system.It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more
interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that
was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances
and with muchlonger delays:The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also
called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a
set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2]
Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances,
so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to
large delays and errors.[2] While the In</p><p>2 0.92681891 <a title="785-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Sharding_with_Cookie-Based_Session_Storage.html">207 high scalability-2008-01-10-Sharding with Cookie-Based Session Storage</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected
availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P
systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show
you how! They havelaunched Wuala, the social online storage service which
scales as new nodes join the P2P network.The goal ofWua.lais to provide
distributed online storage that is:largescalablereliablesecureby harnessing
the idle resources of participating computers.This challenge is an old dream
of computer science. In fact asAndrew Tanenbaumwrote in 1995:"The design of a
world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by
millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise
for the reader"After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich,
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system,
Caleido is ready to unveil the result: Wuala. Wuala is a new way of storing,

<p>Introduction: If you look at the early days of this blog, when web scalability was still in
its heady bloom of youth, many of the articles had to do with
leveragingMySQLandmemcached. Exciting times. Shard MySQL to handle high write
loads, cache objects in memcached to handle high read loads, and then write a
lot of glue code to make it all work together. That was state of the art, that
was how it was done. The architecture of many major sites still follow this
pattern today, largely because with enough elbow grease, it works.This was a
pre-cloud, relational database dominated world, built from parts scrounged
from the remnants of enterprises and datacenters past.TwitterandDiggstarted in
this era, but are evolving into something different, as scaling pressures
increase and new purpose built technologies pop into being.With a little
perspective, it's clear the MySQL+memcached era is passing. It will stick
around for a while. Old technologies seldom fade away completely. Some still
ride horses. Some st</p><p>6 0.90277356 <a title="785-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-01-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_1%2C_2012.html">1255 high scalability-2012-06-01-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 1, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

A very thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of approaches to not being a relational database.

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors, attended the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto  NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid, InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came from the audience, which was refreshing. 
 
Overall a genial evening with some good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that was really the purpose of this kind of talk.

<p>Introduction: Matt Aslett from the 451 group created a term called  “NewSQL ”. On the definition of NewSQL, Aslett writes:
  

“NewSQL” is our shorthand for the various new scalable/high performance SQL database vendors. We have previously referred to these products as ‘ScalableSQL’ to differentiate them from the incumbent relational database products. Since this implies horizontal scalability, which is not necessarily a feature of all the products, we adopted the term ‘NewSQL’ in the new report.


And to clarify, like NoSQL, NewSQL is not to be taken too literally: the new thing about the NewSQL vendors is the vendor, not the SQL.

  
As with NoSQL, under the NewSQL umbrella you can see various providers, with various solutions.
 
I think these can be divided into several sub-types:
  
  New MySQL storage engines . These give MySQL users the same programming interface, but scale very well. You can Xeround or Akiban in this field. The good part is that you still use MySQL, but on the downside it’s n</p><p>4 0.82462943 <a title="770-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL_and_Memcached%3A_End_of_an_Era%3F.html">785 high scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL and Memcached: End of an Era?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you look at the early days of this blog, when web scalability was still in its heady bloom of youth, many of the articles had to do with leveraging  MySQL  and  memcached . Exciting times. Shard MySQL to handle high write loads, cache objects in memcached to handle high read loads, and then write a lot of glue code to make it all work together. That was state of the art, that was how it was done. The architecture of many major sites still follow this pattern today, largely because with enough elbow grease, it works.
 
This was a pre-cloud, relational database dominated world, built from parts scrounged from the remnants of enterprises and datacenters past.  Twitter  and  Digg  started in this era, but are evolving into something different, as scaling pressures increase and new purpose built technologies pop into being.
 
With a little perspective, it's clear the MySQL+memcached era is passing. It will stick around for a while. Old technologies seldom fade away completely.

<p>Introduction: Michael Stonebraker sure knows how to stir up a storm. Unlike for others, that doesn't make him a troll in my mind, he's  way too accomplished  in the field to be that, but he does have a bit of Barnum & Bailey in him, which serves to get the discussion flowing, and that's a good thing. A lot of previously hidden wisdom and passion unlocks, which we'll try to capture here.
 
This disturbance in the force is over OldSQL vs NoSQL vs  NewSQL . Warning, these are not crisp categories, there's leakage all over the place, watch your step:
  
  OldSQL  (Oracle, MySQL, etc) refers to what some want to term as legacy relational database like MySQL, that don't scale out horizontally with aplomb. 
  NoSQL  (CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, Riak, Neo4j, etc) refers to, well, a collection of technologies that aren't OldSQL, these often are designed to scale out horizontally, aren't on ACID, and use schemaless non-relational datamodels.

<p>Introduction: Shanti Braford  details how his Ruby on Rails  based website survived a 24 hour 550,000+ pageview digg attack. His post cleanly lays out all the juicy setup details, so there's not much I can add.   Hosting costs $370 a month for 1 web server, 1 database server, and sufficient bandwidth. The site is built on RoR, nginx, MySQL, and 7 mongrel servers. He thinks Rails 2.0 has improved performance and credits database avoidance and fragment caching for much of the performance boost.    Keep in mind his system is relatively static, but it's a very interesting and useful experience report.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.8598569 <a title="770-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-03-NoSQL_Means_Never_Having_to_Store_Blobs_Again.html">770 high scalability-2010-02-03-NoSQL Means Never Having to Store Blobs Again</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Morgan Tocker has an awesome article and comment thread in the  MySQL Performance Blog  about  When should you store serialized objects in the database?  Before the NoSQL age is was very common to simulate schemalessness by storing blobs in MySQL. Sharding was implemented by running multiple MySQL instances and spreading writes across them. While not ideal for the purpose, developers felt comfortable with MySQL. They knew how to install it, back it up, replicate it, in short:Â  they knew how to make it work. Yet they also needed to store objects without the penalty of joins. Searches and aggregate queries were handled by indexes kept in separate tables, this offloaded the fast path to objects.
 
This all made perfect sense. Usually we just want stuff to work and going with what you know is often the best path to that goal. And what we have known is MySQL. All the different pros and cons of this approach are covered wonderfully in the post.
 
But the world has changed. With the same goal</p><p>4 0.82397908 <a title="770-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-19-Building_a_email_communication_system.html">253 high scalability-2008-02-19-Building a email communication system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: hi,   the website i work for is looking to build a email system that can handle a fair few emails (up to a hundred thousand a day).     These comprise emails like registration emails, newsletters, lots of user triggered emails and overnight emails.     At present we queue them in SQL and feed them into an smtp server on one of our web servers when the queue drops below a certain level.     this has caused our mail system to crash as well as hammer our DB server (shared!!!).     We have got an architecture of what we want to build but thought there might be something we could buy off the shelf that allowed us to keep templated emails, lists of recipients, schedule sends etc and report on it. We can't find anything     What do big websites like amazon etc use or people a little smaller but who still send loads of mail (flickr, ebuyer, or other ecommerce sites)     Cheers     tarqs</p><p>5 0.82035494 <a title="770-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-28-ID_generation_schemes.html">346 high scalability-2008-06-28-ID generation schemes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     Generating unique ids is a common requirements in many projects. Generally, this responsibility is given to Database layer. By using sequences or some other technique. This is a problem for horizontal scalability.    What are the Guid generation schemes used in high scalable web sites generally? I have seen use java's SecureRandom class to generate Guid. What are the other methods generally used?

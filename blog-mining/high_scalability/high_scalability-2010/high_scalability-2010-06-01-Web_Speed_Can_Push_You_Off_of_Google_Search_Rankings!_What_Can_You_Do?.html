<p>Introduction: Update 8:The Cost of Latency by James Hamilton. James summarizing some latency
info from Steve Souder,Greg Linden, andMarissa Mayer. Speed [is] an
undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web.Update 7:How do you know when
you need more memcache servers?. Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache
not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed
Pays, in Milliseconds. Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a500
millisecondtrading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside,
Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together
an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.Update 5:Shopzilla's

<p>Introduction: Likewise the current belief that, in the case of artificial machines the very
large and the very small are equally feasible and lasting is a manifest error.
Thus, for example, a small obelisk or column or other solid figure can
certainly be laid down or set up without danger of breaking, while the large
ones will go to pieces under the slightest provocation, and that purely on
account of their own weight. -- GalileoGalileo observed how things broke if
they were naively scaled up. Interestingly, Google noticed a similar pattern
when building larger software systems using the same techniques used to build
smaller systems. Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished Engineer at Google, talks
about this fundamental property of scaling systems in his fascinating talk,
Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering the Teenage Decade. Google found the
larger the scale the greater the impact of latency variability. When a request
is implemented by work done in parallel, as is common with today's service
oriented</p><p>5 0.12536949 <a title="834-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-22-Strategy%3A_Run_a_Scalable%2C_Available%2C_and_Cheap_Static_Site_on_S3_or_GitHub.html">1102 high scalability-2011-08-22-Strategy: Run a Scalable, Available, and Cheap Static Site on S3 or GitHub</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the best projects I've ever worked on was creating a large scale web
site publishing system that was almost entirely static. A large team of very
talented creatives made the art work, writers penned the content, and
designers generated templates. All assets were controlled in a database. Then
all that was extracted, after applying many different filters, to a static
site that was uploaded via ftp to dozens of web servers. It worked great.
Reliable, fast, cheap, and simple. Updates were a bit of a pain as it required
pushing a lot of files to a lot of servers, and that took time, but otherwise
a solid system.Alas, this elegant system was replaced with a new fangled
dynamic database based system. Content was pulled from a database using a
dynamic language generated front-end. With a recent series of posts from
Amazon's Werner Vogels, chronicling his experience of transforming his All
Things Distributed blog into a static site using S3's ability to serve web
pages, I get the pleasu</p><p>6 0.12187436 <a title="834-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-When_things_aren%27t_scalable.html">232 high scalability-2008-01-29-When things aren't scalable</a></p>

explode to be the next facebook/flickr/digg/etc. Since I really don't know how
popular the site will be I don't want to spend a ton of money on the
hardware/hosting right away but I want to be able to scale it easily if it
does grow rapidly. With this in mind, what would be the best approach to
launch the site?Thanks,Dan</p><p>3 0.64806402 <a title="834-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-31-Need_help_on_Site_loading_%26_database_optimization_-_URGENT.html">611 high scalability-2009-05-31-Need help on Site loading & database optimization - URGENT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site
has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this
day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out
the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was
taking too much load.There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my
database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I
have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain
PHP/HTML coding is used.Technology:PHP -- 5.2MYSQL -- 5.0Apache --

<p>Introduction: OK,I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any
sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll
ask here.Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application"
that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good
consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen
sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but
no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server"
when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously
useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-
alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.The
normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page
like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy
page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let a user
"in" a</p><p>5 0.63543856 <a title="834-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in_Architecture_-_Pay_to_Play_to_Keep_a_System_Small__.html">965 high scalability-2010-12-29-Pinboard.in Architecture - Pay to Play to Keep a System Small  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you keep a system small enough, while still being successful, that a
simple scale-up strategy becomes the preferred architecture?StackOverflow, for
example, could stick with a tool chain they were comfortable with because they
had a natural brake on how fast they could grow: there are only so many
programmers in the world. If this doesn't work for you, here's another natural
braking strategy to consider:charge for your service.Paul Houlesummarized this
nicely as:avoid scaling problems by building a service that's profitable at a
small scale.This interesting point, one I hadn't properly considered before,
was brought up by Maciej Ceglowski, co-founder ofPinboard.in, in an interview
with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their theirnet@nightshow.Pinboard is a
lean, mean, pay for bookmarking machine, a timely replacement for the nearly
departed Delicious. And as a self professed anti-social bookmarking site, it
emphasizes speed over socializing.

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>4 0.96189028 <a title="834-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-07-Using_ThreadLocal_to_pass_context_information_around_in_web_applications.html">115 high scalability-2007-10-07-Using ThreadLocal to pass context information around in web applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread
pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is
tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal
variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user
id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the
code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to
pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought isclass ReferenceIdGenerator
{public static setReferenceId(String login) {threadLocal.set(login +
System.currentMillis());}public static String getReferenceId() {return
threadLocal.get();}private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =new
ThreadLocal();}class MySevlet {void service(.....) {HttpSession session =
request.getSession(false);String userId =
session.get("userId");ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId);try
{doSomething();}finally {ReferenceIdGenerator.remove();}}This method is also</p><p>5 0.92550743 <a title="834-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-16-Paper%3A_A_Provably_Correct_Scalable_Concurrent_Skip_List.html">1305 high scalability-2012-08-16-Paper: A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InMemSQL Architecture we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to
achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to
efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps
eliminate contention and make writes fast. If this all sounds a little pie-in-
the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it
clearer: A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List.From the abstract:We
propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of
simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization,
searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation
before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before
physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms,
this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which
facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that

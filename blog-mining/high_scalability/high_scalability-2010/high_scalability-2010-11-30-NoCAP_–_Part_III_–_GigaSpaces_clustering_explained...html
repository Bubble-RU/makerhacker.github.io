<p>Introduction: This article not about Mariah Carey, or its song. It's about Storing System, Database.   
First let's describe what means by odds:  In my social network, I found 93% of the mainstream developers sanctify the database, or at least consider it in any data persistence challenge as the ultimate, superhero, and undefeatable solution.  I think this problem come from the education, personally, and some companies also I think it's involved in this.  To start to fix this bad thinking, we all should agree in the following points:
  
 Every challenge have its own solutions, so whatever you want to save/persistent, there are always many solutions. For example the Web search engines, such as: Google, Kngine, Yahoo, Bing don't use database at all instead we use Indexes (Index file) for better performance. 
   
 The Database in general whatever the vendor it's slow compared with other solutions such as: Key-Value storing system, Index file, DHT. 
   
 The Database currently employ Relation Data model</p><p>5 0.13063748 <a title="950-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon_Architecture.html">96 high scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

<p>Introduction: For a great Christmas read forget  The Night Before Christmas , a heart warming poem written by Clement Moore for his children, that created the modern idea of Santa Clause we all know and anticipate each Christmas eve. Instead, curl up with a some potentÂ  eggnog , nog being any drink made with rum, and readÂ  CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control Â by Mihai Letia, Nuno PreguiĂ§a, and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),  a data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent .
 
From the introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed consistency issues:
  

Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach [</p><p>3 0.76622665 <a title="950-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP.html">921 high scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Abstract: When designing distributed web services, there are three properties that are commonly desired: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. It is impossible to achieve all three. In this note, we prove this conjecture in the asynchronous network model, and then discuss solutions to this dilemma in the partially synchronous model.</p><p>5 0.76418889 <a title="950-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-01-Paper%3A_The_Case_for_Determinism_in_Database_Systems__.html">890 high scalability-2010-09-01-Paper: The Case for Determinism in Database Systems  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Can you have your ACID cake and eat your distributed database too? Yes explains Daniel Abadi, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Yale University, in an epic post,  The problems with ACID, and how to fix them without going NoSQL , coauthored with  Alexander Thomson , on their paper  The Case for Determinism in Database Systems . We've already seen  VoltDB  offer the best of both worlds, this sounds like a completely different approach.
 
The solution, they propose, is: 
  

  ...an architecture and execution model that avoids deadlock, copes with failures without aborting transactions, and achieves high concurrency. The paper contains full details, but the basic idea is to use ordered locking coupled with optimistic lock location prediction, while exploiting deterministic systems' nice replication properties in the case of failures.  

  
  The problem they are trying to solve is:

<p>Introduction: In many of the recent discussions on the design of large scale systems (a.k.a. Web Scale) it was argued that the right set of tradeoffs for building large scale systems would be to give away  C onsistency for  A vailability and  P artition tolerance. Those arguments relied on the foundation of the CAP theorem developed in early 2000-2002. One of the core principals behind the CAP theorem is that you must choose two out of the three CAP properties. In many of the transactional systems giving away consistency is either impossible or yields a huge complexity in the design of those systems. In this series of posts, I've tried to suggest a different set of tradeoffs in which we could achieve scalability without compromising on consistency. I also argued that rather than choosing only two out of the three CAP properties we could choose various degrees of all three. The degrees would be determined by the most likely availability and partition tolerance scenarios in our specific application.</p><p>2 0.92526448 <a title="950-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-01-FastBit%3A_An_Efficient_Compressed_Bitmap_Index_Technology.html">587 high scalability-2009-05-01-FastBit: An Efficient Compressed Bitmap Index Technology</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Data mining and fast queries are always in that bin of hard to do things where doing something smarter can yield big results. Bloom Filters are one such do it smarter strategy, compressed bitmap indexes are another. In one application "FastBit outruns other search indexes by a factor of 10 to 100 and doesnâ&euro;&trade;t require much more room than the original data size." The data size is an interesting metric. Our old standard b-trees can be two to four times larger than the original data. In a test searching an Enron email database FastBit outran MySQL by 10 to 1,000 times.      
   FastBit is a software tool for searching large read-only datasets. It organizes user data in a column-oriented structure which is efficient for on-line analytical processing (OLAP), and utilizes compressed bitmap indices to further speed up query processing. Analyses have proven the compressed bitmap index used in FastBit to be theoretically optimal for one-dimensional queries. Compared with other optimal indexing me</p><p>3 0.91706318 <a title="950-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-19-Alternatives_to_Google_App_Engine.html">423 high scalability-2008-10-19-Alternatives to Google App Engine</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide web of data.     
   Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10 billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, with the Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge structure. This talk will discuss graph databases, their underlying data model, their querying mechanisms, and the benefits of the graph data structure for modeling and analysis.</p><p>5 0.90968084 <a title="950-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-03-Stack_Overflow_Architecture_Update_-_Now_at_95_Million_Page_Views_a_Month.html">998 high scalability-2011-03-03-Stack Overflow Architecture Update - Now at 95 Million Page Views a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the  Stack Overflow Architecture . Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up and out in the last few years.
 
Stack Overflow has grown up by more then doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  
 
Stack Overflow has grown out by expanding into the  Stack Exchange Network , which includes Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.
 
What hasn't changed is Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been handling their growth:  Stack Exchange’s Architecture in Bullet Points ,  Stack Overflow’s New York Data Center ,  Designing For Scalability of Manageme</p><p>6 0.90792465 <a title="950-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-12-Creating_Scalable_Digital_Libraries.html">856 high scalability-2010-07-12-Creating Scalable Digital Libraries</a></p>

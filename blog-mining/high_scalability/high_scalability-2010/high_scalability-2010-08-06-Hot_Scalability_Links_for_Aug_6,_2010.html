<p>Introduction: By Bhavin Turakhia CEO, Directi. Covers:* Why scalability is important. Viral
marketing can result in instant success. With RSS/Ajax/SOA number of requests
grow exponentially with user base. Goal is to build a web 2.0 app that can
server millions of users with zero downtime.* Introduction to the variables.
Scalability, performance, responsiveness, availability, downtime impact, cost,
maintenance effort.* Introduction to the factors. Platform selection,
hardware, application design, database architecture, deployment architecture,
storage architecture, abuse prevention, monitoring mechanisms, etc.* Building
our own scalable architecture in incremental steps: vertical scaling, vertical
partitioning, horizontal scaling, horizontal partitioning, etc. First buy
bigger. Then deploy each service on a separate node. Then increase the number
of nudes and load balance. Deal with session management. Remove single points
of failure. Use a shared nothing cluster. Choice of master-slave multi-master</p><p>3 0.11422902 <a title="873-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-12-MySpace_Architecture.html">511 high scalability-2009-02-12-MySpace Architecture</a></p>

Systems Architect at MySpace shares details of some of MySpace's cool internal

Internet with 65 million subscribers and 260,000 new users registering each
day. Often criticized for poor performance, MySpace has had to tackle
scalability issues few other sites have faced. How did they do it?Site:

<p>Introduction: Where do you draw the line between scalability vs Performance vs High
Availability vs Reliability?I guess at the end of the day, we all want to be
highly available, great performance and always reliable. So is it safe to say
that scalability is the answer ?Also when do you start to think scale out vs
scale up ?</p><p>5 0.10624174 <a title="873-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

built a software that utilized all their CPU and RAM.Tweets of Gold:wm: I am

<p>Introduction: Twitter Sees Its 20 Billionth Tweet writes  Marshall Kirkpatrick of
ReadWriteWeb.Startups die for not having customers, so STOP thinking about how
to scale. Alessandro Orsi saysfocusing on the architecture and scaling
possibilities of your app for millions of users is just plain
dumb...concentrate on marketing...concentrate on user experience. Alessandro
is perfectly correct, but this isn't the year the 2000 when the default
architecture that is easy is also not scalable and when sites were built from
scratch one painful user at a time.  Today neither is tue. In the era of
social networks, where Facebook has 500 million users, successful applications
can and often do spike to millions of users seemingly overnight. And you have
to have some architecture. With today's tool-chains you don't have to choose
easy and non-scalable. There are other options. Of course, it's all pointless
without customers and that is what you need to worry about, but it's a false
choice in this era to think tha</p><p>2 0.83953667 <a title="873-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-22-We%27re_on_a_Break.html">1495 high scalability-2013-07-22-We're on a Break</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update::Eucalyptus Goes Commercial with $5.5M Funding Round. This removes my
objection that it's an academic project only. Go team go!Rich Wolski,
professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
gave a spirited talk onEucalyptusto a large group of very interested
cloudsters at theEucalyptus Cloud Meetup. If Rich could teach computer science
at every school the state of the computer science industry would be
stratospheric. Rich is dynamic, smart, passionate, and visionary. It's that
vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his
group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and
glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he
decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as
a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement
Eucalyptus and have been improving it and tracking Amazon's changes ever
since.The question I had going into t</p><p>4 0.82225025 <a title="873-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-31-Need_help_on_Site_loading_%26_database_optimization_-_URGENT.html">611 high scalability-2009-05-31-Need help on Site loading & database optimization - URGENT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site
has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this
day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out
the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was
taking too much load.There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my
database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I
have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain
PHP/HTML coding is used.Technology:PHP -- 5.2MYSQL -- 5.0Apache --

<p>Introduction: GridGainwas kind enough to present at the September 17th instance of
theSilicon Valley Cloud Computing Group. I've been curious about GridGain so I
was glad to see them there. In short GridGain is:an open source computational
grid framework that enables Java developers to improve general performance of
processing intensive applications by splitting and parallelizing the workload.
GridGain can also be thought of as a set of middleware primitives for building
applications. GridGain's peer group of competitors includes GigaSpaces,
Terracotta, Coherence, and Hadoop.The speaker for GridGain was the President
and Founder, Nikita Ivanov. He has a very pleasant down-to-earth way about him
that contrasts nicely with a field given to religious discussions of complex
taxomic definitions. Nikita first talked about cloud computing in general. He
feels Java is the perfect gateway for cloud computing. Which is good
becauseGridGain only works with Java. The Java centricity of GridGain may be

<p>Introduction: This post covers two main options for scaling-out MySql and compare between them. The first is based on data-base clustering and the second is based on In Memory clustering a.k.a Data Grid. A special emphasis is given to a pattern which shows how to scale our existing data base without changing it through a combination of Data Grid and data base as a background service. This pattern is referred to as Persistency as a Service (PaaS).  It also address many of the fequently asked question related to how performance, reliability and scalability is achieved with this pattern.</p><p>3 0.16982594 <a title="891-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-09-The_Tera-Scale_Effect_.html">939 high scalability-2010-11-09-The Tera-Scale Effect </a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the past year, Intel issued a series of powerful chips under the new  Nehalem microarchitecture  , with large numbers of cores and extensive memory capacity. This new class of chips is is part of a bigger Intel initiative referred to as  Tera-Scale Computing  . Cisco has released their  Unified Computing System   (UCS) equipped with a unique extended memory and high speed network within the box, which is specifically geared to take advantage of this type of CPU architecture .
 
This new class of hardware has the potential to revolutionize the IT landscape as we know it.
 
In  this post, I want to focus primarily on the potential implications on application architecture, more specifically on the application platform landscape.   more...</p><p>4 0.15058003 <a title="891-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-27-Big_Data_In_the_Cloud_Using_Cloudify.html">1216 high scalability-2012-03-27-Big Data In the Cloud Using Cloudify</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edd Dumbill  wrote an interesting article on O’Reilly Radar covering the current solutions for running  Big Data in the Cloud   
  Big data and cloud technology go hand-in-hand. Big data needs clusters of servers for processing, which clouds can readily provide.
   Big PaaS 
  Edd touched briefly on the role of PaaS for delivering Big Data applications in the cloud
  Beyond IaaS, several cloud services provide application layer support for big data work. Sometimes referred to as managed solutions, or  platform as a service   (PaaS), these services remove the need to ucale things such as databases or MapReduce, reducing your workload and maintenance burden. Additionally, PaaS providers can realize great efficiencies by hosting at the application level, and pass those savings on to the customer.
 
To put it simply, managing data clusters is one thing. Being able to process the data is yet another challenge that we need to think about when we’re dealing with application platforms, as I no</p><p>5 0.12619784 <a title="891-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-08-4_General_Core_Scalability_Patterns.html">897 high scalability-2010-09-08-4 General Core Scalability Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jesper Söderlund put together an excellent list of four general scalability patterns and four subpatterns in his post  Scalability patterns and an interesting story :
  
 
  Load distribution  - Spread the system load across multiple processing units                
 
  Load balancing / load sharing  - Spreading the load across many components with equal properties for handling the request 
  Partitioning  - Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to a component that owns that data specific           
 
  Vertical partitioning  - Spreading the load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions being handled by different processing units 
  Horizontal partitioning  - Spreading a single type of data element across many instances, according to some partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation, etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.

<p>Introduction: Art of Distributed   Part 1: Rethinking about distributed computing models  
I â&euro;&tilde;m getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability, and distributed storage systems.   Download the article in PDF format.   Download the article in MS Word format.   I wait for your comments, and questions, and I will answer it in part two.</p><p>3 0.69629717 <a title="891-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-23-Big_Data_on_Grids_or_on_Clouds%3F_.html">743 high scalability-2009-11-23-Big Data on Grids or on Clouds? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:
 
Now that we have a new computing paradigm, Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds? Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space, and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are a number of issues driving this uncertainty.

<p>Introduction: Since  The Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  was published we've a had few updates that people might not have seen. Amazon of course released their  Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East Region . Netlix shared their  Lessons Learned from the AWS Outage  as did Heroku ( How Heroku Survived the Amazon Outage ), Smug Mug ( How SmugMug survived the Amazonpocalypse ), and SimpleGeo ( How SimpleGeo Stayed Up During the AWS Downtime ). 
 
The curious thing from my perspective is the general lack of response to Amazon's explanation. I expected more discussion. There's been almost none that I've seen. My guess is very few people understand what Amazon was talking about enough to comment whereas almost everyone feels qualified to talk about the event itself.

<p>Introduction: Please see  The Updated Big List Of Articles On The Amazon Outage  for a new improved list. 
 
So many great articles have been written on the Amazon Outage. Some aim at being helpful, some chastise developers for being so stupid, some chastise Amazon for being so incompetent, some talk about the pain they and their companies have experienced, and some even predict the downfall of the cloud. Still others say we have seen a sea change in future of the cloud, a prediction that's hard to disagree with, though the shape of the change remains...cloudy.
 
I'll try to keep this list update as more information comes out. There will be a lot for developers to consider going forward. If there's a resource you think should be added, just let me know.

<p>Introduction: A big part of engineering for a quality experience is bringing in the  long tail . An improbable severe failure can ruin your experience of a site, even if your average experience is quite good. That's where building for  resilience  comes in. Resiliency used to be outside the realm of possibility for the common system. It was simply too complex and too expensive.
 
An evolution has been underway, making 2013 possibly the first time resiliency is truly on the table as a standard part of system architectures. We are getting the clouds, we are getting the tools, and prices are almost low enough.
 
Even Netflix,  real leaders  in the resiliency architecture game, took some heat for relying completely on Amazon's ELB and not having a backup load balancing system, leading to a prolonged  Christmas Eve failure . Adrian Cockcroft, Cloud Architect at Netflix,  said they've investigated  creating their own load balancing service, but that "we try not to invest in undifferentiated heavy lifting.</p><p>6 0.68300796 <a title="891-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-28-Kosmos_File_System_%28KFS%29_is_a_New_High_End_Google_File_System_Option.html">103 high scalability-2007-09-28-Kosmos File System (KFS) is a New High End Google File System Option</a></p>

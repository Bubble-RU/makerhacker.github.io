<p>Introduction: So what are we announcing today? That in addition to acquiring MySQL, Sun will
be unveiling new global support offerings into the MySQL marketplace. We'll be
investing in both the community, and the marketplace - to accelerate the
industry's phase change away from proprietary technology to the new world of
open web platforms.Read more onJonathan Schwartz's BlogWhat do you think about

<p>Introduction: The recent Data-Intensive Computing Symposium brought together experts in
system design, programming, parallel algorithms, data management, scientific
applications, and information-based applications to better understand existing
capabilities in the development and application of large-scale computing
systems, and to explore future opportunities.Google Fellow Jeff Dean had a
very interesting presentation on Handling Large Datasets at Google: Current
Systems and Future Directions. He discussed:• Hardware infrastructure•
Distributed systems infrastructure:–Scheduling system–GFS–BigTable–MapReduce•
Challenges and Future Directions–Infrastructure that spans all
datacenters–More automationIt is really like a "How does Google work"

<p>Introduction: The High Scalable Systems (i.e. Websites) such as: Google, Facebook, Amazon,
etc. need high scalable storage system that can deal with huge amount of data
with high availability and reliability. Building large systems on top of a
traditional RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This
presentation explores the landscape of new technologies available today to
augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability.Remember: All

<p>Introduction: How does Facebook handle the massive New Year's Eve traffic spike? Thanks to
Mike Swift, in Facebook gets ready for New Year's Eve, we get a little insight
as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still
interesting.Problem SetupFacebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be
shared on New Year's eve.Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the
world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average
of 130 friends.Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a
homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those
requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then
rendered.Different events put different stresses on different parts of
Facebook. Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of
capacity News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve

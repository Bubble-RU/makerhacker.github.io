<p>Introduction: I had a false beliefI thought I came here to stayWe're all just visitingAll
just breaking like wavesThe oceans made me, but who came up with me?Push me,
pull me, push me, or pull me out .So true Perl Jam(Push me Pull me lyrics), so
true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes.
Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from
servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.breakTo pull
events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server.
This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a
list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has
changed and makes those changes available to you. Knowing what has changed can
be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very
complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state
on what I client still needs to see.Polling is heavy man. Imagine all your

@tschellenbach on Twitter and GithubFashiolistastarted out as a hobby project
which we built on the side. We had absolutely no idea it would grow into one
of the largest online fashion communities. The entire first version took about
two weeks to develop and our feed implementation was dead simple. We've come a
long way since then and I'd like to share our experience with scaling feed
systems.Feeds are a core component of many large startups such as Pinterest,
Instagram, Wanelo and Fashiolista. At Fashiolista the feed system powers
theflat feed,aggregated feedand thenotification system. This article will
explain the troubles we ran into when scaling our feeds and the design
decisions involved with building your own solution. Understanding the basics
of how these feed systems work is essential as more and more applications rely
on them.Furthermore we've open sourcedFeedly, the Python module powering our

<p>Introduction: Who hasn't cursed their network for being slow while waiting for that annoying
little hour glass of pain to release all its grains of sand? But what's really
going on? Is your network really slow? PacketPushers Show 45 - Arista - EOS
Network Software Architecture has a good explanation of what may be really at
fault (paraphrased):Network operators get calls from application guys saying
the network is slow, but the problem is usually dropped packets due to
congestion. It's not usually latency, it's usually packet loss. Packet loss
causes TCP to back off and retransmit, which causes applications to appear
slow.Packet loss can be caused by a flakey transceiver, but the problem is
usually network congestion. Somewhere on the network there's fan-in, a
bottleneck develops, queues build up to a certain point, and when a queue
overflows it drops packets. Often the first sign of this happening is
application slowness.Queues get deeper and deeper because the network is
getting more and more use</p><p>5 0.1284631 <a title="759-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Feedblendr_Architecture_-_Using_EC2_to_Scale.html">138 high scalability-2007-10-30-Feedblendr Architecture - Using EC2 to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A man had a dream. His dream was to blend a bunch of RSS/Atom/RDF feeds into a
single feed. The man is Beau Lebens ofFeedvilleand like most dreamers he was a
little short on coin. So he took refuge in the home of a cheap hosting
provider and Beau realized his dream, creatingFEEDblendr. But FEEDblendr
chewed up so much CPU creating blended feeds that the cheap hosting provider
ordered Beau to find another home. Where was Beau to go? He eventually found a
new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how
Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of
affordable CPU cycles.Site: http://feedblendr.com/The PlatformEC2 (Fedora Core
6 Lite distro)S3ApachePHPMySQLDynDNS (for round robin DNS)The StatsBeau is a
developer with some sysadmin skills, not a web server admin, so a lot of
learning was involved in creating FEEDblendr.FEEDblendr uses 2 EC2 instances.

Halfway There. Excellent analysis of all the reasons you need real background
processing. Hey, you can't even build an alarm clock! Hard to believe some
commenters say it's not so..Update: Josh Lowensohn of Webware tells usWhy
users should be scared of Apple's new notification system.A big item on the
iPhone developer iWishlist has been background processing. If you can't write
an app to poll for new data in the background how will you keep your even more
important non-foreground app in sync? Live from the Apple developer conference
we learn the solution is a centralized push based architecture.Here's the
relevant MacRumorsLive transcript:Thanking the developers for their hard work.

<p>Introduction: Ilya Grigorik has written another wonderful article lavishly detailing the
extraordinary tactics Chrome employs to hide network latency from users:
Chrome Networking: DNS Prefetch & TCP Preconnect. Ilya springs some surpising
factoids on us, revealing how the web has slowed and super sized:The size of
an average page has grown to 1059kB and is now composed of over80 subresource
requests.An average DNS lookup takes between 60 and 120ms. This creates a
100-200ms of latency before a request can be sent because of th full round-
trip (RTT) to perform the TCP handshake.Slow mobile experiences are largely
due to the much higher RTT's (200-1000ms) on wireless networks. Reducing the
number of outbound connections and the total byte size of your pages is the
single best optimization you can make for mobile today. Chrome reduces
apparent latency using a host of clever anticipatory mechanisms:Learns the
network topology as you use it via a Predictor object that anticipates user
behavior and futur</p><p>4 0.63590407 <a title="759-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-09-Writing_about_cisco_loadbalancer%3F.html">678 high scalability-2009-08-09-Writing about cisco loadbalancer?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This strategy is stated perfectly by Flickr's Myles Grant:The Flickr
engineering team is obsessed with making pages load as quickly as possible. To
that end, weâ&euro;&trade;re refactoring large amounts of our code to do only the essential
work up front, and rely on our queuing system to do the rest.Flickr uses a
queuing system to process 11 million tasks a day. Leslie Michael Orchard also
does a great job explaining the queuing meme in his excellent postQueue
everything and delight everyone. Asynchronous work queues are how you scalably
solve problems that are too big to handle in real-time.The process:Identify
the minimum feedback the client (UI, API) needs to know an operation
succeeded. It's enough, for example, to update a client's view when a posting
a message to a microblogging service. The client probably isn't aware of all
the other steps that happen when a message is added and doesn't really care
when they happen as long as the obvious cases happen in an appropariate period
of time.Queue</p><p>6 0.62073642 <a title="759-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-31-Read_HighScalability_on_Your_Mobile_Phone_Using_WidSets_Widgets.html">293 high scalability-2008-03-31-Read HighScalability on Your Mobile Phone Using WidSets Widgets</a></p>

<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>2 0.91993034 <a title="759-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-15-How_Google%27s_Instant_Previews_Reduces_HTTP_Requests.html">941 high scalability-2010-11-15-How Google's Instant Previews Reduces HTTP Requests</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a strange case of synchronicity, Google just publishedInstant Previews:
Under the hood, a very well written blog post by Matias Pelenur of the Instant
Previews team, giving some fascinating inside details on how Google
implementedInstant Previews. It's syncronicty because I had just posted
Strategy: Biggest Performance Impact Is To Reduce The Number Of HTTP Requests
and one of the major ideas behind the design Instant Previews is to reduce the
number of HTTP requests through a few well chosen tricks. Cosmic!Some of what
Google does to reduce HTTP requests:Data URIs, which are are base64 encodings
of image data, are used instead of static images that are served from the
server. This means the whole preview can be pieced together from image slices
in one request as both the data and the image are returned in the same
request. Google found thateven though base64 encoding adds about 33% to the
size of the image, tests showed that gzip-compressed data URIs are comparable
in size to the o</p><p>same-blog 3 0.91903836 <a title="759-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-11-Strategy%3A_Don%27t_Use_Polling_for_Real-time_Feeds.html">759 high scalability-2010-01-11-Strategy: Don't Use Polling for Real-time Feeds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ivan Zuzak wrote a fascinating article onReal-time feed processing and
filteringusing Google App Engine to buildFeed-buster, a service thatinserts
MediaRSS tags into feeds that don't have them. He talks about using polling
andPubSubHubBub(real-time) to process FriendFeed feeds. Ivan is trying to
devise a separate filtering service where: filtering services should be
applied as close to the publisheras possible so notifications that nobody
wants don't waste network resource.processing services should be applied as
close to the subscriberso that the original update may be transported through
the network as a single notification for as long as possible.Besides being a
generally interesting article, Ivan makes an insightful observation on the
nature of using polling services in combination with metered
Infrastructure/Platform services:Polling is bad because AppEngine applications
have afixed free daily quotafor consumed resources, when the number of feeds
the service processed increased -t</p><p>4 0.90902746 <a title="759-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-25-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_25%2C_2013.html">1394 high scalability-2013-01-25-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 25, 2013</a></p>

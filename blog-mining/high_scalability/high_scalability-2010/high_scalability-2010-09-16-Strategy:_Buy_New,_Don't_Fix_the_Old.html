<p>Introduction: Why is there something rather than nothing? That's the kind of question the  Large Hadron Collider  in CERN is hopefully poised to answer. And what is the output of this beautiful 17-mile long,  6 billion  dollar  wabi-sabish  proton smashing machine? Data. Great heaping torrents of Grand Canyon sized data. 15 million gigabytes every year. That's 1000 times the information printed in books every year. It's so much data 10,000 scientists will use a  grid  of  80,000+ computers , in 300 computer centers , in 50 different countries just to help make sense of it all.
 
How will all this data be collected, transported, stored, and analyzed? It turns out, using what amounts to sort of Internet of Particles instead of an Internet of Things.

<p>Introduction: Are all instances created equal? Perhaps because under multi-tenancy multiple virtual machines run on the same physical host, not all applications will run equally well on every instance. In that case it makes sense to measure and move to a better performing instance. 
 
That's the interesting idea from  @botchagalupe :
  

Imagine something like a "performance monkey" where an infrastructure is so bound that it can kill lower performing instances automatically.

  
 @adrianco  says Netflix has throught of doing the same: 
  

We've looked at killing off multi-tenant instances that have high CPU stolen time...

<p>Introduction: Should you pay more in the cloud or pay less for bare metal in the datacenter? This is a crucial decision point facing startups today. Which way should you go? In this  Webpulp.tv interview   , Joe Stump, always a go-to guy when you need a metric ass-ton (a favorite expression of Joe’s) of good advice on cutting edge practices for the modern startup, laughs at conventional wisdom by saying  the cloud is really not more expensive than bare metal. 
 
The argument for a cheaper cloud has a three main points:
  
   Raw Hardware Costs are Close . Buying hardware is cheaper than renting hardware from Amazon, but it’s close when you consider  reserved instances . A reserved instance costs about $250 a year and a new server costs about $1500.  Let’s say Amazon is 30% slower. That means for a cluster of 20 machines you would need a another 7 servers. This takes 10 minutes and 4 button clicks to provision on the cloud (the advantage of a scale-out architecture + automation + cloud aware tools).</p><p>5 0.078611463 <a title="902-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-07-It%27s_a_VM_Wasteland_-_A_Near_Optimal_Packing_of_VMs_to_Machines_Reduces_TCO_by_22%25.html">1419 high scalability-2013-03-07-It's a VM Wasteland - A Near Optimal Packing of VMs to Machines Reduces TCO by 22%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation  we learn some shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):
  
  Average server utilization in many data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.  
 Surely that's just for old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade. 
  
It's a VM wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same server.
 
It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method that performs provably close to the optimal.

<p>Introduction: “ Data is everywhere, never be at a single location. Not scalable, not maintainable. ”  –Alex Szalay    While Galileo played life and death doctrinal games over the mysteries revealed by the telescope, another revolution went unnoticed, the microscope gave up mystery after mystery and nobody yet understood how subversive would be what it revealed. For the first time these new tools of perceptual augmentation allowed humans to peek behind the veil of appearance. A new new eye driving human invention and discovery for hundreds of years.     Data is another    material    that hides, revealing itself only when we look at different scales and investigate its underlying patterns. If the universe is truly    made of information   , then we are looking into truly primal stuff. A new eye is needed for Data and an ambitious project called    Data-scope    aims to be the lens.     A detailed    paper    on the Data-Scope tells more about what it is:

<p>Introduction: This is a question everyone must struggle with when building out their datacenter. Storage choices are always the ones I have the least confidence in.  David Marks in his blog  You Can Change It Later!  asks the question   Should I get a SAN to scale my site architecture?   and answers no. A better solution is to use commodity hardware, directly attach storage on servers, and partition across servers to scale and for greater availability.  David's reasoning is interesting:
  A SAN creates a SPOF (single point of failure) that is dependent on a vendor to fly and fix when there's a problem. This can lead to long down times during this outage you have no access to your data at all.   Using easily available commodity hardware minimizes risks to your company, it's not just about saving money. Zooming over to Fry's to buy emergency equipment provides the kind of agility startups need in order to respond quickly to ever changing situations.

<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:  Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework  by  Luigi Rizzo . As commodity networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen?

 


Abstract:

 

Today 10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the design of device drivers and network stacks.


The netmap framework is a promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary overhead and moves</p><p>5 0.61411804 <a title="902-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-04-Wide_Fast_SATA%3A_the_Recipe_for_Hot_Performance.html">1511 high scalability-2013-09-04-Wide Fast SATA: the Recipe for Hot Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by   Brian  Bulkowski  , CTO and co-founder of   Aerospike  , a leading clustered NoSQL  database, has worked in the area of high performance commodity systems  since 1989.  
 
This blog post will tell you exactly how to build a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays, actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.
 
You need to know:
  
  Which SSDs work  
  Which chassis work  
  How to configure your RAID cards  
  
Intel’s SATA solutions – combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized database like  Aerospike , enables high throughput and low latency.
 
In a wide configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can cost-effectively serve at high throughput with 16T at $2.50 per GB with the s3700, or $1.25 with the s3500.

<p>Introduction: This strategy is from the  Large Hadron Collider  project:      Improvements in performance per Watt have caused CERN to no longer sign hardware support contracts longer than three years.  Machines run until they die.  They have a very high utilization of equipment (‘duty cycle’, 7 x 24 x 365).  Replacing hardware makes more sense because of the lower cost and the power savings of new hardware.</p><p>2 0.71389246 <a title="902-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-01-Private_Data_Cloud%3A_%27Do_It_Yourself%27_with_Eucalyptus_.html">713 high scalability-2009-10-01-Private Data Cloud: 'Do It Yourself' with Eucalyptus </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Private Clouds provide many of the benefits of the Public Cloud, namely elastic scalability, faster time-to-market and reduced OpEX, all within the Enterprises own perimeter that complies to its governance. Leading commercial Private Cloud products include VMware, Univa UD, Unisys. Open source solutions include pro ducts like Globus Nimbus, Enomaly Elastic Computing Platform, RESERVOIR and Eucalyptus.

<p>Introduction: This question was asked over email and I thought a larger audience might want to take a whack at it. 
 
With a business associate, I am trying to develop a financial software that handles financial reports of listed companies. We managed to create this database with all the data necessary to do financial analysis. My associate is a Business Intelligence specialist so he is keen to use OLAPs databases like Microsoft Analysis Services or Jedox Palo, which enables in-memory calculations and very fast aggregation, slicing and dicing of data or write-backs.
 
At the same time I did an online course (MOOC) from Stanford CS184 called Startup Engineering which promoted/talked a lot about javascript and especially node.js as the language of the future for servers.
 
As I am keen to use open-source technologies (would be keen to avoid MS SSAS) for the development of a website to access this financial data , and there are so many choices for databases out there (Postgre, MongoDB, MySQL etc..but d</p><p>4 0.55028898 <a title="902-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-25-Paper%3A_High_Performance_Scalable_Data_Stores_.html">784 high scalability-2010-02-25-Paper: High Performance Scalable Data Stores </a></p>
<p>Introduction: The world of scalable databases is not a simple one. They come in every race, creed, and color. Rick Cattell has brought some harmony to that world by publishing  High Performance Scalable Data Stores , a nicely detailed one stop shop paper comparing scalable databases soley on the content of their character. Ironically, the first step in that evaluation is dividing the world into four groups:
  
 Key-value stores: Redis, Scalaris, Voldmort, and Riak. 
 Document stores: Couch DB, MongoDB, and SimpleDB. 
 Record stores: BigTable, HBase, HyperTable, and Cassandra. 
 Scalable RDBMSs: MySQL Cluster, ScaleDB, Drizzle, and VoltDB. 
  
The paper describes each system and then compares them on the dimensions of Concurrency Control, Data Storage Replication, Transaction Model, General Comments, Maturity, K-hits, License Language.
 
And the winner is: there are no winners. Yet. Rick concludes by pointing to a great convergence:

<p>Introduction: Wildly popular VC blogger  Fred Wilson  defines in an excellent  27 minute video  the ten most important criteria he uses when deciding to give the gold, that is, fund a web application. Note, this video is  from 2010 , so no doubt the ideas are still valid, but the importance of mobile vs web apps has probably shifted to mobile, as Mr. Wilson says in a recent post:  mobile is growing like a weed . 
  
   Speed  - speed is more than a feature, it's a requirement. Mainstream users are unforgiving. If something is slow they won't use it. Pingdom is used to track speed across their portfolio. A trend they've noticed is that as an application slows down they don't grow as quickly.   
   Instant Utility  - a service must be instantly useful to users. Lengthy setup and configuration is a killer. Tricks like crawling the web to populate information you expect to get from your users later makes the service initially useful. YouTube won, for example, with instant availability of uploaded video.</p><p>6 0.54569483 <a title="902-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-05-Shutterfly_Saw_a_Speedup_of_500%25_With_Flashcache.html">1169 high scalability-2012-01-05-Shutterfly Saw a Speedup of 500% With Flashcache</a></p>

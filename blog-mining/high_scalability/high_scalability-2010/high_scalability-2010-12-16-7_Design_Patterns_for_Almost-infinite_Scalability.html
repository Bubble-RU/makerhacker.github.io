<p>Introduction: Update 3: ReadWriteWeb saysGoogle App Engine Announces New Pricing Plans,
APIs, Open Access. Pricing is specified but I'm not sure what to make of it
yet. An image manipulation library is added (thus the need to pay for more CPU
:-) and memcached support has been added. Memcached will help resolve the

2: onGWT.com threw a GAE load party and a lot of people came. The results
atLoad test : Google App Engine = 1, Community = 0. GAE handled a peak of 35
requests/second and a sustained 10 requests/second. Some think performance was
good, others not so good. My GMT watch broke and I was late to arrive. Maybe
next time. Also added a few new design rules from the post.Update: Added a few

<p>Introduction: I have put down my thoughts in the architecture discussed inthe blog. Although
I have done substantial research to understand how things should work before
deciding this architecture but I will be requiring huge amount of inputs from
everyone to come to an architecture decision. Hardware entities which were
thought while designing the entities are:1. Master Web Server which will map
different users to web servers placed in different geographical locations.
(will prefer storing a mapping table in RAM)2. Web Servers3. Application
Servers4. Master Database Servers (to implement entity wise look up
sharding)5. Slave Database Servers.Will really appreciate if some good inputs
of using Cloud Computing are given and how to go about it against or in
addition to the given architecture. Would like to in fact know people's view
on when to decide using cloud computing techniques. Looking forward for inputs
from the community.</p><p>5 0.11564993 <a title="958-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-08-Google_AppEngine_-_A_First_Look.html">301 high scalability-2008-04-08-Google AppEngine - A First Look</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look
around their documentation and seeing what stands out for me. It's not the
much speculatedsuper cluster VM. AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and
structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran awebsite out of S3with a
splash ofHerokuthrown in as a chaser.The idea is clearly to take advantage of
ourmassive multi-core futureby creating a shared nothing infrastructure based
firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU
services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage:
email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps. A shared nothing
request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures
must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google
is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy
creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build on. Now they

<p>Introduction: Piccolo(notthisorthis) is a system for distributed computing, Piccolo is a new
data-centric programming model for writing parallel in-memory applications in
data centers. Unlike existing data-ﬂow models, Piccolo allows computation
running on different machines to share distributed, mutable state via a key-
value table interface. Traditional data-centric models (such as Hadoop) which
present the user a single object at a time to operate on, Piccolo exposes a
global table interface which is available to all parts of the computation
simultaneously. This allows users to specify programs in an intuitive manner
very similar to that of writing programs for a single machine.Using an in-
memory key-value store is a very different approach from the canonical map-
reduce, which is based on using distributed file systems. The results are
impressive:Experiments have shown that Piccolo is fast and pro-vides excellent
scaling for many applications. The performance of PageRank and k-means on

<p>Introduction: An interesting and different implementation approach: Tempest: Scalable Time-
Critical Web Services Platform: Tempest is a new framework for developing
time-critical web services. Tempest enables developers to build scalable,
fault-tolerant services that can then be automatically replicated and deployed
across clusters of computing nodes. The platform automatically adapts to load
ďŹ&sbquo;uctuations, reacts when components fail, and ensures consistency between
replicas by repairing when inconsistencies do occur. Tempest relies on a
family of epidemic protocols and on Ricochet, a reliable time critical
multicast protocol with probabilistic guarantees.Tempest is built around a
novel storage abstraction called the TempestCollection in which application
developers store the state of a service. Our platform handles the replication
of this state across clones of the service, persistence, and failure handling.
To minimize the need for specialized knowledge on the part of the application
developer, th</p><p>4 0.72368133 <a title="958-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-03-Paper%3A_Optimistic_Replication.html">507 high scalability-2009-02-03-Paper: Optimistic Replication</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To scale in the large you have to partition. Data has to be spread around,
replicated, and kept consistent (keeping replicas sufficiently similar to one
another despite operations being submittedindependently at different sites).
The result is a highly available, well performing, and scalable
system.Partitioning is required, but it's a pain to do efficiently and
correctly. UntilQuantum teleportationbecomes a reality how data is kept
consistent across a bewildering number of failure scenarios is a key design
decision.This excellent paper by Yasushi Saito and Marc Shapiro takes us on a
wild ride (OK, maybe not so wild) of different approaches to achieving
consistency.What's cool about this paper is they go over some real systems
that we are familiar with and cover how they work: DNS (single-master, state-
transfer), Usenet (multi-master), PDAs (multi-master, state-transfer, manual
or application-specific conflict resolution), Bayou (multi-master, operation-
transfer, epidemic propagation</p><p>5 0.72342074 <a title="958-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-06-Paper%3A_High-Performance_Concurrency_Control_Mechanisms_for_Main-Memory_Databases.html">1299 high scalability-2012-08-06-Paper: High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for Main-Memory Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirmingCuriosity landing on
Mars, then this paper,High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for
Main-Memory Databases, has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an
excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead
on in-memory datastructures:A database system optimized for in-memory storage
can support much higher transaction rates than current systems. However,
standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to the high
transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two
efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory
databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from
updates but differ in how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is
pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions never block
during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure
correct serializatio</p><p>6 0.70740831 <a title="958-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-26-Google%27s_Paxos_Made_Live_%E2%80%93_An_Engineering_Perspective.html">357 high scalability-2008-07-26-Google's Paxos Made Live – An Engineering Perspective</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>2 0.92645073 <a title="958-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson_from_Airbnb%3A_Give_Yourself_Permission_to_Experiment_with_Non-scalable_Changes.html">1458 high scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson from Airbnb: Give Yourself Permission to Experiment with Non-scalable Changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are stuck drowning in too much data and too many options and are
dazzled by all the possibilities of code, here's a helpful bit of advice from
Airbnb's rags to richesorigin story:it's okay to do things that don't scale. A
corollary is the idea of paying attention to and learning from what your users
are actually doing and let that lead you without out that annoying voice in
your head second guessing you, yelling but that will never scale! Worry about
building something good, then worry about making it scale.In Airbnb's case
they noticed people weren't booking rooms because the pictures sucked. So they
flew to New York and shot some beautiful images. This is a very non-scalable
and non-technical solution. Yet it was the turning point for Airbnb and
sparked their climb out of the "trough of sorrow." Previously they had been
limited by the Silicon Valley idea that every feature had to be scalable. Not
every solution can be found behind a computer screen.For the full story please

<p>Introduction: Good article frommanageability.com summarizing design patterns from Pat
Helland's amazing paperLife beyond Distributed Transactions: an Apostate's
Opinion.Entities are uniquely identified- each entity which represents
disjoint data (i.e. no overlap of data between entities) should have a unique
key.Multiple disjoint scopes of transactional serializability- in other words
there are these 'entities' and that you cannot perform atomic transactions
across these entities.At-Least-Once messaging- that is an application must
tolerate message retries and out-of-order arrival of messages.Messages are
adressed to entities- that is one can't abstract away from the business logic
the existence of the unique keys for addresing entities. Addressing however is
independent of location.Entities manage conversational state per party- that
is, to ensure idemptency an entity needs to remember that a message has been
previously processed. Furthermore, in a world without atomic transactions,
outcomes need t</p><p>4 0.91512227 <a title="958-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-02-How_Will_DIDO_Wireless_Networking_Change_Everything%3F.html">1091 high scalability-2011-08-02-How Will DIDO Wireless Networking Change Everything?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A conjunction of a few new technologies may trigger disruptive changes in the
future. This observation was prompted by a talkSteve Perlmangave at the
Columbia Engineering School: Benjamin Button, Cloud Everything and Why
Shannon's Law Isn't. In it he covers a set of technologies that at first may
seem unrelated, but turn out to be deeply related after all, culminating in a
realization of the long talked about vision of an application utility, where
all applications are hosted and run out of the cloud. First Perlman talks
about the realistic human rendering technology developed at Rearden, his
research incubator company. This technology was developed over many years and
is the secret behind the wonderful effects found in movies likeBenjamin
Button. It is now being used in many other films, and promises to
revolutionize film making, possibly even replacing actors with computers, in
real-time.The next invention at Rearden isOnLive, a cloud based gaming

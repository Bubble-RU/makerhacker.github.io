</p><p>3 A chatty protocol is one where a client makes a series of requests to a server and the client must wait on each reply before sending the next request. [sent-8, score-0.885]
</p><p>4 The overall goal is to reduce   the number of times a client has to wait for a response and reduce the number of packets sent. [sent-19, score-0.384]
</p><p>5 This may be obvious, but take a look at your protocols and see if any of the rountrips can be combined or eliminated. [sent-23, score-0.358]
</p><p>6 One of the reasons protocols become so chatty is programmers are thinking in terms of  fine-grained  distributed objects rather coarser-grained services. [sent-26, score-0.612]
</p><p>7 This leads to chatty protocols because there is a lot of back and forth for each method call as methods tend to be pretty low in granularity. [sent-27, score-0.586]
</p><p>8 To transform an image, for example, you want to make one call and pass in all the transforms so they can be done in that one call rather than making a separate remote method invocation for each transform. [sent-29, score-0.264]

</p><p>12 When configuration is needed try to do it in bulk so that a program will get all it's configuration attributes in one big structure rather than making a lot of individual calls. [sent-64, score-0.425]
</p><p>13 Another approach is to use lazy initialization so you just get configuration as needed rather than all at once. [sent-65, score-0.265]

<p>Introduction: This strategy targets reducing the amount of protocol data in packets by sending only the attributes that are needed. Google calls this  Partial Response and Partial Update .
 
Netflix posted about adopting this strategy in their  recent Netflix API redesign . We've seen previously how Netflix improved performance by creating  less chatty protocols .
 
As a consequence packet sizes rise as more data is being stuffed into each packet in order to reduce the number of round trips. But we don't like large packets either (memory usage and packet processing overhead), so we have to think of creative ways to shrink them back down.

<p>Introduction: How do you keep in sync a crescendo of data between data centers over a slow WAN? That's the question   Alberto   posted a few weeks ago. Normally I'm not into all boy bands, but I was frustrated there wasn't a really good answer for his problem. It occurred to me later a WAN accelerator might help turn his slow WAN link into more of a LAN, so the overhead of copying files across the WAN wouldn't be so limiting. Many might not consider a WAN accelerator in this situation, but since my friend Damon Ennis works at the WAN accelerator vendor   Silver Peak  , I thought I would ask him if their product would help. Not surprisingly his answer is yes! Potentially a lot, depending on the nature of your data. Here's a no BS overview of their product:           What is it? - Scalable WAN Accelerator from Silver Peak (http://www.silver-peak.com)   What does it do? - You can send 5x-100x times more data across your expensive, low-bandwidth WAN link.

<p>Introduction: You might think major Internet companies have a latency, availability, and bandwidth advantage because they can afford expensive dedicated point-to-point private line networks between their data centers. And you would be right. It's a great advantage. Or it at least it was a great advantage. Cost is the great equalizer and companies are now scrambling for ways to cut costs. Many of the most recognizable Internet companies are moving to IP VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) as a much cheaper alternative to private lines. This is a strategy you can effectively use too.  This trend has historical precedent in the data center. In the same way leading edge companies moved early to virtualize their data centers, leading edge companies are now virtualizing their networks using IP VPNs to build inexpensive private networks over a shared public network.

<p>Introduction: Update 8 :  The Cost of Latency  by James Hamilton. James summarizing some latency info from      Steve Souder ,   Greg Linden , and   Marissa Mayer .      Speed [is] an undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web. 
 
 Update 7:   How do you know when you need more memcache servers? . Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use stats to know when more servers are needed.  Update 6:   Stock Traders Find Speed Pays, in Milliseconds . Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a  500 millisecond  trading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside, Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.  Update 5:   Shopzilla's Site Redo - You Get What You Measure . At the  Velocity  conference Phil Dixon, from Shopzilla, presented data showing a 5 second speed up resulted in a 25% increase in page views, a 10% increas</p><p>6 0.17616795 <a title="960-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-27-42_Monster_Problems_that_Attack_as_Loads_Increase.html">1413 high scalability-2013-02-27-42 Monster Problems that Attack as Loads Increase</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Who hasn't cursed their network for being slow while waiting for that annoying little hour glass of pain to release all its grains of sand? But what's really going on? Is your network really slow? PacketPushers  Show 45 – Arista – EOS Network Software Architecture  has a good explanation of what may be really at fault (paraphrased):
  

Network operators get calls from application guys saying the network is slow, but the problem is usually dropped packets due to congestion. It's not usually latency, it's usually packet loss. Packet loss causes TCP to back off and retransmit, which causes applications to appear slow.


Packet loss can be caused by a flakey transceiver, but the problem is usually network congestion. Somewhere on the network there's fan-in, a bottleneck develops, queues build up to a certain point, and when a queue overflows it drops packets. Often the first sign of this happening is application slowness.


Queues get deeper and deeper because the network is getting more</p><p>3 0.81809098 <a title="960-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-09-Google_and_Netflix_Strategy%3A_Use_Partial_Responses_to_Reduce_Request_Sizes.html">1001 high scalability-2011-03-09-Google and Netflix Strategy: Use Partial Responses to Reduce Request Sizes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 8 :  The Cost of Latency  by James Hamilton. James summarizing some latency info from      Steve Souder ,   Greg Linden , and   Marissa Mayer .      Speed [is] an undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web. 
 
 Update 7:   How do you know when you need more memcache servers? . Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use stats to know when more servers are needed.  Update 6:   Stock Traders Find Speed Pays, in Milliseconds . Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a  500 millisecond  trading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside, Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.  Update 5:   Shopzilla's Site Redo - You Get What You Measure . At the  Velocity  conference Phil Dixon, from Shopzilla, presented data showing a 5 second speed up resulted in a 25% increase in page views, a 10% increas</p><p>6 0.77144367 <a title="960-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-11-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Conditioning_Collection.html">1421 high scalability-2013-03-11-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Conditioning Collection</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  5 Lessons We’ve Learned Using AWS , Netflix's John Ciancutti says one of the big lessons they've learned is to create less  chatty protocols :
  
 In the Netflix data centers, we have a high capacity, super fast, highly reliable network. This has afforded us the luxury of designing around chatty APIs to remote systems. AWS networking has more variable latency. We’ve had to be much more structured about “over the wire” interactions, even as we’ve transitioned to a more highly distributed architecture. 
  
There's not a lot of advice out there on how to create protocols. Combine that with a rush to the cloud and you have a perfect storm for chatty applications crushing application performance. Netflix is far from the first to be surprised by the less than stellar networks inside AWS. 
 
A chatty protocol is one where a client makes a series of requests to a server and the client must wait on each reply before sending the next request. On a LAN this can work great. LAN's are typically</p><p>2 0.93845582 <a title="960-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-15-Wordnik_-_10_million_API_Requests_a_Day_on_MongoDB_and_Scala.html">990 high scalability-2011-02-15-Wordnik - 10 million API Requests a Day on MongoDB and Scala</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wordnik  is an online dictionary and language resource that has both a website and an API component. Their goal is to  show you as much information as possible, as fast as we can find it, for every word in English, and to give you a place where you can make your own opinions about words known.  As cool as that is, what is really cool is the information they share in their  blog  about their experiences building a web service. They've written an excellent series of articles and presentations you may find useful:

<p>Introduction: Cloud-based services for all things digital will either drive – or die by – bandwidth
 
   Consumers, by definition, consume. In the realm of the Internet, they consume far more than they produce. Or so it’s been in the past. Broadband connectivity across all providers have long offered asymmetric network feeds because it mirrored reality: an HTTP request is significantly smaller than its corresponding response, and in general web-based activity is heavily biased toward fat download and thin upload speeds. The term “broadband” is really a misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very narrowband of a typical consumer’s upload speed.
 
 cloud computing  , or to be more accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing all things digital “in the cloud”, network providers must consider the impact on them – and the satisfaction of their customer base with performa</p><p>4 0.92849821 <a title="960-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-27-Comet_-_An_Example_of_the_New_Key-Code_Databases.html">979 high scalability-2011-01-27-Comet - An Example of the New Key-Code Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Comet is an  active distributed key-value store  built at the University of Washington. The paper describing Comet is  Comet: An active distributed key-value store , there are also  slides , and a  MP3  of a presentation given at  OSDI '10 . Here's a succinct  overview of Comet :
  

Today's cloud storage services, such as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes, fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their data's behavior inside the storage service.

  
I found this paper quite interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-value store, which turns it into what might called a  key-code</p><p>5 0.92672288 <a title="960-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-09-No_to_SQL%3F_Anti-database_movement_gains_steam_%E2%80%93_My_Take.html">654 high scalability-2009-07-09-No to SQL?

<p>Introduction: In  this post  i wrote my view on the anti SQL database movement and where the alternative approach fits in:  - SQL databases are not going away anytime soon.  - The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.  - There is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions alongside traditional SQL databases.  In addition to the options that was mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative approach and how that fits into the puzzle. I used a real life scenario:   scalable Social network based eCommerce site where i outlined how in-memory approach was the only option they could scale and meet their application performance and response time requirements.</p><p>6 0.91551805 <a title="960-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-04-Digg_Architecture.html">554 high scalability-2009-04-04-Digg Architecture</a></p>

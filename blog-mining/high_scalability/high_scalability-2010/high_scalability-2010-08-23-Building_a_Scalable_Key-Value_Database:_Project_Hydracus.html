<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>4 0.13571316 <a title="885-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-15-The_Common_Principles_Behind_the_NOSQL_Alternatives.html">749 high scalability-2009-12-15-The Common Principles Behind the NOSQL Alternatives</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: It's hard to be a relational database lately. After years of faithful service
everywhere you look the world is turning against you:Recently at theNoSQL
conference150 revolutionaries met with their new anti-RDBMS arms suppliers.
And you know what happens when revolutionaries are motivated, educated,
funded, and well armed.The revolution has gone mainstream when Computerworld
writesNo to SQL? Anti-database movement gains steam. It's not just whispers
anymore, it's everywhere.And perennial revolutionary Michael Stonebraker runs
from blog to blog shouting theThe End of a DBMS Era (Might be Upon Us).
Relational vendors are selling legacy software, are 50x slower than other
alternatives, and that can not stand.The Greek Chorus onHacker Newssings of
anger and lies.Certainly some say stick with the past. It's your fault, you
aren't doing it right, give us another chance and all will be as it ever was.

was King.But i</p><p>4 0.80438119 <a title="885-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-16-Seven_Signs_You_May_Need_a_NoSQL_Database.html">779 high scalability-2010-02-16-Seven Signs You May Need a NoSQL Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>5 0.77760845 <a title="885-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL%3A_An_Overview_of_the_Various_Query_Semantics_in_the_Post_Only-SQL_World.html">867 high scalability-2010-07-27-YeSQL: An Overview of the Various Query Semantics in the Post Only-SQL World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of many of the
scalability issues that we face today with traditional database approach.I
think that the main reason so many people have come to see SQL as the source
of all evil is the fact that, traditionally, the query language was burned
into the database implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to
the traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.This view has brought on a
flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a different aspect
that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach, such as a document
model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as Key/Value query.Most of
the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject, and tend to use
query semantics and architecture interchangeably. InPart Iof this post i tried
to provide quick overview of what each query term stands for in the context of
the NoSQL world .Part II illustrates those ideas using  code examples from</p><p>6 0.77446741 <a title="885-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL_Took_Away_the_Relational_Model_and_Gave_Nothing_Back.html">930 high scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL Took Away the Relational Model and Gave Nothing Back</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation Propagation Networks: A
Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation, offers to help us break
free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of
autonomous but interconnected machines.  We can do this byorganizing
computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of
which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the
network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the
structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.The abstract from
his thesis is:In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of
computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The
traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large
memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with
computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected
with stateful storage cells. In so</p><p>2 0.87107116 <a title="885-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-18-Robert_Scoble%27s_Rules_for_Successfully_Scaling_Startups.html">352 high scalability-2008-07-18-Robert Scoble's Rules for Successfully Scaling Startups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignantFriendFeed threadcommiserating PodTech's
unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup.
Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with
them:Have a story.Have everyone on board with that story.If anyone goes off of
that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.Make sure
people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues
should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get
fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.Work ONLY for a leader who
will make the tough decisions.Build a place where excellence is expected,
allowed, and is enabled.Fire idiots quickly.If your engineering team can't
give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only
things that are measured ever get improved.When your stars aren't listened to
the company is in trouble.Getting rid of the CEO, even if it's all his fault,

<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is
still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head
scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are
you still the same person?The Ise Grand Shrine has been in continuous
existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has
been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then
dismantled.Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a
living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what
is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the
shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that
imperative.You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects
like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed
in each new environment.The patterns of recurrence in software are the result
of Darwinian selectio</p><p>4 0.84568185 <a title="885-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-Sharding_and_Connection_Pools.html">532 high scalability-2009-03-11-Sharding and Connection Pools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We
are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple
(any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would
be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally
there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database
server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that
particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and
how you resolved it?Thanks,Scott</p><p>same-blog 5 0.84388274 <a title="885-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-23-Building_a_Scalable_Key-Value_Database%3A_Project_Hydracus.html">885 high scalability-2010-08-23-Building a Scalable Key-Value Database: Project Hydracus</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The world of NoSQL and alternative database implementations (i.e. non-
relational) is deeply fascinating to me. I can't help but be swept up in the
whirl of planet-scale web development scalability techniques and the evolution
of how developers think about building their applications knowing that with
success comes the inevitable need to scale to levels almost unimaginable just
five or ten years ago.I'm going to make a prediction: Developers will be
expected to understand the fundamentals of how different database systems can
be applied within a singular application; their strengths and weaknesses, and
when it is appropriate to leverage them.There's a lot out there about scaling
relational databases. Partitioning your data over application-managed shards
is a topic that has seen its fair share of attention. But I think there's a
whole slew over NoSQL databases that have been built and designed by some very
smart people that are new enough that their internals aren't well understood

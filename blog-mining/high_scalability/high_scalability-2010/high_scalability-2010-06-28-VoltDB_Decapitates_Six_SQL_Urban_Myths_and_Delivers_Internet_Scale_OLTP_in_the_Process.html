</p><p>3 This means there are no buffer pools to manage, so that source of overhead is removed, and there are no blocking disk stalls. [sent-34, score-0.27]

</p><p>5 Only data changed within a single invocation of a stored procedure is in a transaction, transactions can't  span multiple rounds of communication with a client . [sent-56, score-0.374]
</p><p>6 Also, from the same source as the previous link,   The vast majority (almost 100%) of your stored procedure invocations must be single partition for VoltDB to be useful to you. [sent-57, score-0.391]
</p><p>7 All clients must be stopped, the database must be snapshotted, the database must be restarted in a special mode, the data is reloaded, and then clients can be restarted. [sent-78, score-0.328]
</p><p>8 VoltDB is different because it has consciously been architected to remove what  research shows  are the four common sources of overhead in database management systems:  logging (19%),  latching  (19%), locking (17%), B-tree, and buffer management operations  (35%). [sent-94, score-0.465]

<p>Introduction: Two forces account for the trend of moving behavior to data: larger values used in key-value stores and spotty cloud networks. For some time we've seen functions pushed close to data with MapReduce, which is a batch process, but we are now seeing this model extend to interactive applications, which match the current emphasis on highly scalable, real-time, event driven applications.
 
To see the trend look at the increasing support for collocated behavior at the datastore level:
  
 HBase is implementing a  coprocessor feature . 
 Cassandra is also implementing  coprocessors or plugins . 
 Membase is creating  NodeCode , which is a process for executing functions on data in the database. 
 MongoDB supports  JavaScript stored procedures .  
 VoltDB has  Java based stored procedures . 
  In-memory DataGrid  products like GigaSpaces have been doing something like this forever.

<p>Introduction: Update : Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was wrong about what he meant. His real point:  The meaning of the statement was that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a high priority task for them. 
 
At the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto , an audience member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really interesting:  NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.  
 
  The idea being that   NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance, etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships. With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it</p><p>6 0.20259422 <a title="849-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jim Starkey , founder of  NuoDB , in this  thread  on the Cloud Computing group, delivers a  masterful post  on why he thinks the relational model is the best overall compromise amongst the different options, why NewSQL can free itself from the limitations of legacy SQL architectures, and how this creates a brave new lock free world.... 
 
I'll  [Jim Starkey]  go into more detail later in the post for those who care, but the executive summary goes like this:  Network latency is relatively high and human attention span is relatively low.  So human facing computer systems have to perform their work in a small number of trips between the client and the database server.  But the human condition leads inexorably to data complexity.  There are really only two strategies to manage this problem. One is to use coarse granularity storage, glombing together related data into a single blob and letting intelligence on the client make sense of it.  The other is storing fine granularity data on the s</p><p>3 0.76325607 <a title="849-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-14-MemSQL_Architecture_-_The_Fast_%28MVCC%2C_InMem%2C_LockFree%2C_CodeGen%29_and_Familiar_%28SQL%29.html">1304 high scalability-2012-08-14-MemSQL Architecture - The Fast (MVCC, InMem, LockFree, CodeGen) and Familiar (SQL)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an interview with   MemSQL    cofounder’s    Eric Frenkiel    and    Nikita Shamgunov   , in which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their technology.     MemSQL ruffled a few feathers with their claim of being the fastest database in the world. According to their benchmarks MemSQL can execute 200K TPS on an EC2   Quadruple   Extra Large   and on a 64 core machine they can push 1.2 million transactions a second.     Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using a combination of technologies like    MVCC   , code generation,    lock-free data structures   ,    skip lists   , and    in-memory execution   .

<p>Introduction: Update : Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was wrong about what he meant. His real point:  The meaning of the statement was that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a high priority task for them. 
 
At the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto , an audience member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really interesting:  NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.  
 
  The idea being that   NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance, etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships. With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it</p><p>5 0.75497216 <a title="849-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-02-Stack_Overflow_Makes_Slow_Pages_100x_Faster_by_Simple_SQL_Tuning.html">1032 high scalability-2011-05-02-Stack Overflow Makes Slow Pages 100x Faster by Simple SQL Tuning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in  A day in the life of a slow page at Stack Overflow , where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for other pages the improvement was 100x.
 
Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:
  
 Using their  mini-profiler  it was shown that a  badge detail page  was taking 630.3 ms to load, 298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL queries for the page and how long each took. 
 From the historical logs, which are stored in  HAProxy  on a month-by-month basis, Sam was able t</p><p>6 0.75466084 <a title="849-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-22-Spanner_-_It%27s_About_Programmers_Building_Apps_Using_SQL_Semantics_at_NoSQL_Scale.html">1345 high scalability-2012-10-22-Spanner - It's About Programmers Building Apps Using SQL Semantics at NoSQL Scale</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my article  Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.  
 
There's a pattern, already begun, that has accelerated by the need for applications to scale and increase complexity, the end result of which will be that applications give up their independence and enter a kind of  feudal relationship  with their platform provider.
 
To understand how this process works, like a glacier slowly and inevitably carving out a deep river valley, here's the type of question I get quite a lot:
  I've learned PHP and MySQL and I've built a web app that I HOPE will receive traffic comparable to eBay's with a similar database structure. I see all these different opinions and different techniques and languages being recommended and it's so confusing. All I want is perhaps one book or one website that focuses on PHP and MySQL and building a large database web app like eBay's. Does something like this exist?

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?  Mike Stonebraker , the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world, hopes you get something like his new database,  VoltDB : a pure SQL, pure ACID, pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a second. VoltDB  claims to be  100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster than  Cassandra , and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.
  Will VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Ivan de Prado  and  Pere Ferrera , founders of  Datasalt , the company behind  Pangool  and  Splout SQL  Big Data open-source projects.  
 
The amount of payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and shops for improving their relationship with the market. At  Datasalt  we have developed a system in collaboration with the  BBVA bank  that is able to analyze years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web and mobile applications.
 
The main challenge we faced besides processing Big Data input is that  the output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the input . And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.

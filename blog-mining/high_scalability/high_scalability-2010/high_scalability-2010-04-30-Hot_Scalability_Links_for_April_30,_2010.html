<p>Introduction: Lots of good ones this week...Scalability, Availability & Stability Patterns.
Jonas Boner has 197 slides covering a very wide range of scalability topics.
One stop scalability shopping.Horizontal Scalability via Transient, Shardable,
and Share-Nothing Resources. Heroku's Adam Wiggins shares what they've learned
about scaling based on their experiences building a cloud platform and the
hundreds of apps running on it. He describes the next generation architecture
he thinks all software should follow in the future.Scalability of the Hadoop
Distributed File System. Konstantin V. Shvachko writes a great post analyzing
if thelimitations imposed on a distributed file system by the single-node
namespace server architecturecan support 100,000 clients and petabytes of
files.Cassandra by Example. Eric Evans created a nice Cassandra tutorial using
building a Twitter clone as an example. Many people want to see more data
modeling examples. Here you are.UpSizeR: Synthetically Scaling Up a Given

<p>Introduction: InScaling writes in MySQL (slides) Philip Tellis, while working for Yahoo,
describes how using time based partitions they were able to increase their
write capability from 2100 inserts per second (7 million a day) to a sustained
8500 inserts per second (734 million a day). This was capacity enough to
handle the load during Michael Jackson's memorial service. In summary, the
secrets to scalable writes are:Bulk inserts push up insert ratePartitioning
lets you insert more recordsPartition based on incoming data for fast
insertsPartitioning is a standard approach for handling high write loads
because it means data can be written to different hard disks in parallel. In
this example Phillip created a separate table for each day with each table
having it's own database file. Each table is partitioned on time, 12
partitions per day, 2 hours of data per partition. Huge log streams are often
handled this way. Other advantages of this approach: 1) fast drop table
operations 2) space for dropped t</p><p>4 0.12917025 <a title="819-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-30-How_Rackspace_Now_Uses_MapReduce_and_Hadoop_to_Query_Terabytes_of_Data.html">233 high scalability-2008-01-30-How Rackspace Now Uses MapReduce and Hadoop to Query Terabytes of Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from
over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle
ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the greatMapReduce Versus Database War,
you would be correct.Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail
division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved
their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each
machine approach, to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just
couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that
works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability
potential.Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data
streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful
with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text
files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each
individual machine. Then came a</p><p>5 0.12731537 <a title="819-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-17-Product%3A_Hadoop.html">601 high scalability-2009-05-17-Product: Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 5:Hadoop Sorts a Petabyte in 16.25 Hours and a Terabyte in 62
Secondsand has itsgreen cred questionedbecause it took 40 times the number of
machines Greenplum used to do the same work.Update 4:Introduction to Pig. Pig
allows you to skip programming Hadoop at the low map-reduce level. You don't
have to know Java. Using the Pig Latin language, which is a scripting data
flow language, you can think about your problem as a data flow program. 10
lines of Pig Latin = 200 lines of Java.Update 3: Scaling Hadoop to4000 nodes

completed in 37 minutes; 14,000 map tasks writes (reads) 360 MB (about 3

<p>Introduction: I currently use BerkeleyDB as an embedded
databasehttp://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/a decision which was
initially brought on by learning that Google used BerkeleyDB for their
universal sign-on feature.Lustre looks impressive, but their white paper shows
speeds of 800 files created per second, as a good number. However, BerkeleyDB
on my mac mini does 200,000 row creations per second, and can be used as a
distributed file system.I'm having I/O scalability issues with BerkeleyDB on
one machine, and about to implement their distributed replication feature (and
go multi-machine), which in effect makes it work like a distributed file
system, but with local access speeds. That's why I was looking at Lustre.The
key feature difference between BerkeleyDB and Lustre is that BerkeleyDB has a
complete copy of all the data on each computer, making it not a viable
solution for massive sized database applications. However, if you have < 1TB

<p>Introduction: Making the world's knowledge computableToday's Wolfram|Alpha is the first step
in an ambitious, long-term project to make all systematic knowledge
immediately computable by anyone. You enter your question or calculation, and
Wolfram|Alpha uses its built-in algorithms and growing collection of data to
compute the answer.Answer Engine vs Search EngineWhenWolfram|Alphalaunches
later today, it will beone of the most computationally intensive websites on
the internet. TheWolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engineis an "answer
engine" that is able to produce answers to various questions such asWhat is

<p>Introduction: I Want a New Data Store. Jeremy Zawodny of Craigslist wants a new database,
one that can do what it should: perform alter table operations faster, has
efficient queries when most of the data is on disk and not in RAM, and matches
their data that now looks more document oriented than relational. A lot of
people willing to help.Computer Science Unplugged. An extensive collection of
free resources that teach principles of Computer Science such asbinary
numbers,algorithmsanddata compressionthrough engaging games and puzzles that
use cards, string, crayons and lots of running around. And it's free!

<p>Introduction: Sean Hallwith some really good MySQL advice: Tune those queries. Biggest bang
for your buck. Enable the slow query log and watch it. Once you've found a
heavy resource intensive query, optimize it! Tune what receives real-world
traffic. Employ Master-Master Replication. Immediately have a read-only slave
for your application to hit as well.Use Your Memory. Set
innodb_buffer_pool_size, key_buffer_size and other key options.RAID Your Disk
I/O. Use RAID 10 mirroring and striping. On EC2 striping across a number of
EBS volumes using the Linux md software raid.Tune Key Parameters. speeds up
inserts & updates with innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=2; create a tablespace
and underlying datafile for each table with innodb_file_per_table.Full details

5:Damn You Google, Damn You Yahoo! Why D'Ya Do This to Us? Free accounts on a
cloud platform are a constant drain of money.Update 4:Caching becomes even
more important inCPU based billing environments. Avoiding the CPU means saving
money.Update 3:An interesting simple example of this idea showed up on the
Google AppEngine list. With one paging algorithm and one use of AJAX the
yearly cost of the site was $1000. By changing those algorithms the site went
under quota and became free again. This will make life a lot more interesting
for developers.Update 2:Business Model Influencing Software Architectureby

<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from
scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.Hibernate Shards
is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by
adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.Hibernate
Shardskey features:Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards
allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love:
SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use
Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards.Flexible sharding
strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of
the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific
logic.Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going
to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one
of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your

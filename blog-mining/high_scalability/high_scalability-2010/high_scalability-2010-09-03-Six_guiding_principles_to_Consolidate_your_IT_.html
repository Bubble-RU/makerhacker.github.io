<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create
a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll
have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own
forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each
group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to
start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups
(this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that
having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that
some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day,
let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active
though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate
which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if
having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>3 0.09378498 <a title="894-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-Classifying_XTP_systems_and_how_cloud_changes_which_type_startups_will_use.html">531 high scalability-2009-03-11-Classifying XTP systems and how cloud changes which type startups will use</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Recently, I was working on a project that was coming to a close. It was
related to optimizing a database using a Java based in-memory cache to reduce
the load. The application had to process up to a million objects per day and
was characterized by its heavy use of memory and the high number of read,
write and update operations. These operations were found to be the most
costly, which meant that optimization efforts were concentrated here.The
project had already achieved impressive performance increases, but one
question remained unanswered - would changing the JVM increase
performance?Read more at:http://bigdatamatters.com/bigdatamatters/2009/08/jvm-

<p>Introduction: A giant step into the fully distributed future has been taken by the Google
App Engine team with the release of theirHigh Replication Datastore. The HRD
is targeted at mission critical applications that require data replicated to
at least three datacenters, full ACID semantics forentity groups, and lower
consistency guarantees across entity groups.This is a major accomplishment.
Few organizations can implement a true multi-datacenter datastore. Other than
SimpleDB, how many other publicly accessible database services can operate out
of multiple datacenters? Now that capability can be had by anyone. But there
is a price, literally and otherwise. Because the HRD uses three times the
resources as Google App Engine's Master/Slave datastatore, it will cost three
times as much. And because it is a distributed database, with all that implies
in the CAP sense, developers will have to be very careful in how they
architect their applications because as costs increased, reliability
increased, com</p><p>6 0.077979952 <a title="894-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-19-How_to_measure_memory_required_for_a_user_session.html">472 high scalability-2008-12-19-How to measure memory required for a user session</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000
or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is
estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High
Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as
uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.This post focuses on a
customer's backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a
dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA
features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the
challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services
and annual support?Read more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>3 0.59197837 <a title="894-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-28-Elasticity_for_the_Enterprise_--_Ensuring_Continuous_High_Availability_in_a_Disaster_Failure_Scenario.html">816 high scalability-2010-04-28-Elasticity for the Enterprise -- Ensuring Continuous High Availability in a Disaster Failure Scenario</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many enterprises' high-availability architecture is based on the assumption
that you can prevent failure from happening by putting all your critical data
in a centralized database, back it up with expensive storage, and replicate it
somehow between the sites. As I argued in one of my previous posts (Why
Existing Databases (RAC) are So Breakable!) many of those assumptions are
broken at their core, as storage is doomed to failure just like any other
device, expensive hardware doesn't make things any better and database
replication is often not enough.One of the main lessons that we can take from
the likes of Amazon and Google is that the right way to ensure continuous high
availability is by designing our system to cope with failure. We need to
assume that what we tend to think of as unthinkable will probably happen, as
that's the nature of failure. So rather than trying to prevent failures, we
need to build a system that will tolerate them.As we can learn from a recent
outage event in</p><p>4 0.59186292 <a title="894-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-04-Business_continuity_with_real-time_data_integration.html">822 high scalability-2010-05-04-Business continuity with real-time data integration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Enterprises want to protect their data.As the appetite for data volumes grows,
storage technology becomes a critical business asset on which business
continuity relies.My recent survey in the medium-size enterprise segment shows
the five dominant investment directions at the level of data management
architecture: disaster recovery (DR), high availability (HA), backup, data
processing performance and migration to more advanced databases.ďťż This
suggests that corporations generally have sufficiently structured data
collections but are concerned with business continuity and continuous
availability of data. What infrastructures can provide these assurances? In
this post I want to focus on yet another option, and that is the Real-Time
Data Integration model. As an example I am going to discuss Oracle GoldenGate,
which permits you to manage the data critical to your business in safety,
ensuring business continuity without disruption even if the data is

<p>Introduction: The need for IT consolidation is most evident in two types of organizations.
In the first group, IT grew organically with business over the decades, and
survived changes of strategy, management, staff and vendor orientation. The
second group of businesses capital groups are characterized by rapid growth
through acquisitions (followed by attempts to integrate radically different IT
environments). In both groups, their IT infrastructures have typically been
pieced together over the past 20 (or more) years.ďťżRead more

<p>Introduction: Hi,I would like feed back on a ID generator I just made. What positive and
negative effects do you see with this. It's programmed in Java, but could just
as easily be programmed in any other typical language. It's thread safe and
does not use any synchronization. When testing it on my laptop, I was able to
generate 10 million IDs within about 15 seconds, so it should be more than
fast enough.Take a look at the attachment.. (had to rename it from IdGen.java
to IdGen.txt to attach it)IdGen.java</p><p>4 0.51578748 <a title="894-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-30-Is_%22Scaling_Engineer%22_a_new_job_title%3F.html">335 high scalability-2008-05-30-Is "Scaling Engineer" a new job title?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Justin.tv is looking to hire aScaling Engineerto help scale their video
cluster, IRC server, web app, monitoring and search services. I've never seen
this job title before. A quick search that showed only a few previous
instances of it being used. Has anyone else seen Scaling Engineer as a job
title before?It's a great idea. Scaling is certainly a worthy specialty of
it's own. Why there's a difficult lingo, obscure tools, endlessly subtle
concepts, a massive body of knowledge to master, and many competing religious
factions. All a good start. Next I see a chain of Scalability Universities.
Maybe use all those Starbucks that are closing down. Contact me for franchise
opportunities :-)</p><p>5 0.51338947 <a title="894-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-20-Building_a_data_cycle_at_LinkedIn_with_Hadoop_and_Project_Voldemort.html">634 high scalability-2009-06-20-Building a data cycle at LinkedIn with Hadoop and Project Voldemort</a></p>

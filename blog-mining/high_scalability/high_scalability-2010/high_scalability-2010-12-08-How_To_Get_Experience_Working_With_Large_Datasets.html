<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Eric Czech, Chief Architect at Next Big Sound, talks
about some unique approaches taken to solving scalability challenges in music
analytics.Tracking online activity is hardly a new idea, but doing it for the
entire music industry isn't easy. Half a billion music video streams, track
downloads, and artist page likes occur each day and measuring all of this
activity across platforms such as Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, Facebook, and
more, poses some interesting scalability challenges. Next Big Sound collects
this type of data from over a hundred sources, standardizes everything, and
offers that information to record labels, band managers, and artists through a
web-based analytics platform.While many of our applications use open-source
systems like Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Mongo, RabbitMQ, and MySQL, our usage
is fairly standard, but there is one aspect of what we do that is pretty
unique. We collect or receive information from 100+ sources and we struggled

<p>Introduction: Hadoop is a distributed computing platform written in Java. It incorporates
features similar to those of theGoogle File System and of MapReduce to process
vast amounts of data"Hadoop is a Free Java software framework that supports
data intensive distributed applications running on large clusters of commodity
computers. It enables applications to easily scale out to thousands of nodes
and petabytes of data" (Wikipedia)* What platform does Hadoop run on?* Java
1.5.x or higher, preferably from Sun* Linux* Windows for development* Solaris</p><p>5 0.077608079 <a title="956-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-26-Paper%3A_Wikipedia%27s_Site_Internals%2C_Configuration%2C_Code_Examples_and_Management_Issues.html">134 high scalability-2007-10-26-Paper: Wikipedia's Site Internals, Configuration, Code Examples and Management Issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wikipedia andWikimediahave some of the best, most complete real-world
documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas
Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an
overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid,
lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN, how
caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how
they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle
load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of
configuration files. This is a really useful resource.Related

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>4 0.77383357 <a title="956-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-08-Medialets_Architecture_-__Defeating_the_Daunting_Mobile_Device_Data_Deluge.html">1000 high scalability-2011-03-08-Medialets Architecture -  Defeating the Daunting Mobile Device Data Deluge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>5 0.76409477 <a title="956-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-19-Twitter%E2%80%99s_Plan_to_Analyze_100_Billion_Tweets.html">780 high scalability-2010-02-19-Twitter’s Plan to Analyze 100 Billion Tweets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If Twitter is the "nervous system of the web" as some people think, then what
is the brain that makes sense of all those signals (tweets) from the nervous
system? That brain is the Twitter Analytics System and Kevin Weil, as
Analytics Lead at Twitter, is the homunculus within in charge of figuring out
what those over 100 billion tweets (approximately the number of neurons in the
human brain) mean.Twitter has only 10% of the expected 100 billion tweets now,
but a good brain always plans ahead. Kevin gave a talk,Hadoop and Protocol
Buffers at Twitter, at theHadoop Meetup, explaining how Twitter plans to use
all that data to an answer key business questions.What type of questions is
Twitter interested in answering? Questions that help them better understand
Twitter. Questions like:How many requests do we serve in a day?What is the
average latency?How many searches happen in day?How many unique queries, how
many unique users, what is their geographic distribution?What can we tell

<p>Introduction: Update: How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences. Shows how to
analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what
I mean. Steve Souders, author ofHigh Performance WebsitesandYslow, hasten more
best practices to speed up your website:Split the initial payloadLoad scripts
without blockingDon't scatter scriptsSplit dominant content domainsMake static

<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released
information onPregel. Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip.
Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure......to mine a wide range of
graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each
iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages
sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify
its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's
topology.Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this
limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but
so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing
problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much
faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to
use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

<p>Introduction: When you have a large population of servers you have both the opportunity and
the incentive to perform interesting studies. Authors from Google and the
University of California in Optimizing Google's Warehouse Scale Computers: The
NUMA Experience conducted such a study, taking a look at how jobs run on
clusters of machines using a NUMA architecture. Since NUMA is common on server
class machines it's a topic of general interest for those looking to maximize
machine utilization across clusters.Some of the results are surprising:The
methodology of how to attribute such fine performance variations to NUMA
effects within such a complex system is perhaps more interesting than the
results themselves. Well worth reading just for that story.The performance
swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on
Intel Westmere for Web-search frontend. Memory locality is not always King.
Because of the interaction between NUMA and cache sharing/contention it turns

<p>Introduction: I think I have been lucky that several of the projects I been worked on have
exposed me to having to manage large volumes of data. The largest dataset was
probably at MailChannels, though Livedoor.com also had some sizeable data for
their books store and department store. Most of the pain with Livedoor's data
was from it being in Japanese. Other than that, it was pretty static. This was
similar to the data I worked with at the BBC. You would be surprised at how
much data can be involved with a single episode of a TV show. With any in-
house generated data the update size and frequency is much less dramatic, even
if the data is being regularly pumped in from 3rd parties.Those HumansThe real
fun comes when the public (that's you guys) are generating data to be pumped
into the system. MailChannels' work with email, which is human generated
(lies! 95% is actually from spambots). Humans are unpredictable. They suddenly
all get excited about the same thing at the same time, they are demandin</p><p>6 0.84504288 <a title="956-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-09-Why_My_Slime_Mold_is_Better_than_Your_Hadoop_Cluster.html">1225 high scalability-2012-04-09-Why My Slime Mold is Better than Your Hadoop Cluster</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Reducing the costs of IT infrastructure and improving the manageability and
efficiency of web services pose significant challenges for many organizations
in today's economic climate. Recent studies describe the challenges IT
managers face administering the proliferation of x86-based servers used to run
web services applications. Those reports reveal that using large number of
x86-based systems can increase space and power consumption, as well as cost
and asset management overhead. In addition, many of these x86-based systems
run a mixture of operating system and application software leading to
increased management complexity and potential security concerns.Faced with
these challenges, many organizations are attracted by the idea of
consolidating web and application services from multiple x86-based servers to
a smaller number of high-performance servers. This approach strives to help
simplify management, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of
delivering web services.

<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says one of the
big lessons they've learned is to create lesschatty protocols:In the Netflix
data centers, we have a high capacity, super fast, highly reliable network.
This has afforded us the luxury of designing around chatty APIs to remote
systems. AWS networking has more variable latency. We've had to be much more
structured about "over the wire" interactions, even as we've transitioned to a
more highly distributed architecture.There's not a lot of advice out there on
how to create protocols. Combine that with a rush to the cloud and you have a
perfect storm for chatty applications crushing application performance.
Netflix is far from the first to be surprised by the less than stellar
networks inside AWS. A chatty protocol is one where a client makes a series of
requests to a server and the client must wait on each reply before sending the
next request. On a LAN this can work great. LAN's are typically fast, wide,

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: This article is a lightly edited version of 20 Obstacles to Scalability bySean
Hull (with permission) from the always excellent and thought provoking ACM
Queue.1. TWO-PHASE COMMITNormally when data is changed in a database, it is
written both to memory and to disk. When a commit happens, a relational
database makes a commitment to freeze the data somewhere on real storage
media. Remember, memory doesn't survive a crash or reboot. Even if the data is
cached in memory, the database still has to write it to disk. MySQL binary
logs or Oracle redo logs fit the bill.With a MySQL cluster or distributed file
system such as DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) or Amazon Multi-AZ
(Multi-Availability Zone), a commit occurs not only locally, but also at the
remote end. A two-phase commit means waiting for an acknowledgment from the
far end. Because of network and other latency, those commits can be slowed
down by milliseconds, as though all the cars on a highway were slowed down by

<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with
our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting
monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously
how Netflix used Chaos Monkey, a tool to test failover handling by
continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been
added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a
problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is
handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this
approach in this very interesting post: The Netflix Simian Army.I know what
you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down
lately. Dmuino addressedthis potential embarrassment, putting all fears of
cloud inferiority to rest:Unfortunately we're not running 100% on the cloud
today. We're working on it, and we could use more help. The latest outage was

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steve Newman, co-founder of Writely (Google Docs),
tech lead on the Paxos-based synchronous replication in Megastore, and founder
of cloud service providerScalyr.com.Microsoft's Azure service suffered a
widely publicized outage on February 28th / 29th. Microsoft recently published
an excellentpostmortem. For anyone trying to run a high-availability service,
this incident can teach several important lessons.The central lesson is that,
no matter how much work you put into redundancy, problems will arise. Murphy
is strong and, I might say, creative; things go wrong. So preventative
measures are important, but how you react to problems is just as important.
It's interesting to review the Azure incident in this light.The postmortem is
worth reading in its entirety, but here's a quick summary: each time Azure
launches a new VM, it creates a "transfer certificate" to secure
communications with that VM. There was a bug in the code that determines the
certificate expirat</p><p>4 0.71397364 <a title="964-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-10-27-Strategy%3A_Survive_a_Comet_Strike_in_the_East_With_Reserved_Instances_in_the_West.html">1133 high scalability-2011-10-27-Strategy: Survive a Comet Strike in the East With Reserved Instances in the West</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ali Sadat ofMuleSoft gave interesting presentation at Saturday's Talk Cloudy
to Me! event about their experiences movingMule iON, their ESB (enterprise
service bus) product to the cloud.First, a little aboutTalk Cloudy to Me. This
event is the second one day cloud event put on by Sebastian Stadil, founder of
Scalr, as part of the Cloud Computing Meetup group, also created by Sebastian.
Sebastian has become a master at running these mini-conference style events.
Really a quality job by him and his dedicated crew. These events are free,
sponsored by various vendors; they are short, 11-5; the food is good, Thai;
the venue is nice, eBay; they are on topic, with cloud and other speakers
giving 30-45 minute talks.  More on the event when the video comes out. I type
as fast as I can but I can't do much without the video.Back to Ali Sadat.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byPatrick Eaton, Software Engineer and Distributed
Systems Architect at Stackdriver.Stackdriver provides intelligent monitoring-
as-a-service for cloud hosted applications.  Behind this easy-to-use service
is a large distributed system for collecting and storing metrics and events,
monitoring and alerting on them, analyzing them, and serving up all the
results in a web UI.  Because we ourselves run in the cloud (mostly on AWS),
we spend a lot of time thinking about how to deal with faults in the cloud.
We have developed a framework for thinking about fault mitigation for large,
cloud-hosted systems.  We endearingly call this framework the "Four Hamiltons"
because it is inspired by an article from James Hamilton, the Vice President
and Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services.The article that led to this
framework is called "The Power Failure Seen Around the World".  Hamilton
analyzes the causes of the power outage that affected Super Bowl XLVII in
early 2013.</p><p>6 0.67879623 <a title="964-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-01-The_Mullet_Cloud_Selection_Pattern.html">1624 high scalability-2014-04-01-The Mullet Cloud Selection Pattern</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In 5 Lessons We've Learned Using AWS, Netflix's John Ciancutti says the best
way to avoid failure is to fail constantly. In the cloud it's expected
instances can fail at any time, so you always have to be prepared. In the real
world we prepare by running drills. Remember all those exciting fire drills?
It's not just fire drills of course. The military, football teams, fire
fighters, beach rescue, virtually any entity that must react quickly and
efficiently to disaster hones their responsiveness by running drills.Netflix
aggressively moves this strategy into the cloud by randomly failing servers
using a tool they built called Chaos Monkey. The idea is:If we aren't
constantly testing our ability to succeed despite failure, then it isn't
likely to work when it matters most - in the event of an unexpected
outage.They respond to failures bydegrading service, but they always
respond:If the recommendations system is down they'll show popular titles
instead.If the search system is slow then th</p><p>2 0.80416256 <a title="964-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-19-Zynga%27s_Z_Cloud_-_Scale_Fast_or_Fail_Fast_by_Merging_Private_and_Public_Clouds.html">1044 high scalability-2011-05-19-Zynga's Z Cloud - Scale Fast or Fail Fast by Merging Private and Public Clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Release early and often. A/B testing. Creating a landing page and buying ads
on AdSense. All are ways of providing quick feedback in order to validate an
idea. If you are like Zynga, with 250 million active users a month, how do you
cost effectively prove out a game that could flop or get 90 million users
(like CityVille) in an instant?Zynga handles this problem inlle an innovative
way, by inverting the typical cloud burst scenario that has excess traffic
flowing from a datacenter to a cloud, to having a game start in the cloud and
then moving to the datacenter once the game has proved popular enough to
keep.This process is nicely described by Charles Babcock in Lessons From
FarmVille: How Zynga Uses The Cloud, in an interview with Allan Leinwand, CTO
of infrastructure engineering at Zynga.When paired down to its essence,
Zynga's strategy goes something like this:Games are risky.  Even with all
their experience, Zynga can't know how many people will play a game or how
fast the adoption</p><p>3 0.8005926 <a title="964-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-22-Building_and_Scaling_a_Startup_on_Rails%3A_12_Things_We_Learned_the_Hard_Way.html">518 high scalability-2009-02-22-Building and Scaling a Startup on Rails: 12 Things We Learned the Hard Way</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Garry Tan, cofounder of Posterous, lists 12 lessons for scaling that apply to
more than just Rails.Use cloud storage for static files.Use HTTP Cache Control
to tell the browser what it can cache.Use Sphinx for text search.Use InnoDB
for more crash resistant and faster writes.Don't use textbook Rails
ActiveRecord objects. Use New Relic to find exactly what is slow in your
system.Use memcache later so you find your database bottlenecks now.Use
mongrel proctitle to find your slow queries. You are only as fast as your
slowest queries.Use asynchronous job queuing to do work in parallel.Use
monitoring so you'll know when your site went down and why.Learn by reading
the source code, fixing problems, and submitting them back to the
community.Use new plugins. Old plugins can't be trusted.Use new information.
Old information can't be trusted.</p><p>4 0.79943317 <a title="964-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-07-Google_Finds%3A_Centralized_Control%2C_Distributed_Data_Architectures_Work_Better_than_Fully_Decentralized_Architectures.html">1627 high scalability-2014-04-07-Google Finds: Centralized Control, Distributed Data Architectures Work Better than Fully Decentralized Architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For years a war has been fought in the software architecture trenches between
the ideal of decentralized services and the power and practicality of
centralized services. Centralized architectures, at least at themanagement and
control planelevel, are winning. And Google not only agrees, they are
enthusiastic adopters of this model, even in places you don't think it should
work.Here's an excerpt from Google Lifts Veil On "Andromeda" Virtual
Networking, an excellent article by Timothy Morgan, that includes a money
quote fromAmin Vahdat, distinguished engineer and technical lead for
networking at Google:Like many of the massive services that Google has
created, the Andromeda network has centralized control. By the way, so did the
Google File System and the MapReduce scheduler that gave rise to Hadoop when
it was mimicked, so did the BigTable NoSQL data store that has spawned a
number of quasi-clones, and even the B4 WAN and the Spanner distributed file
system that have yet to be cloned. "</p><p>5 0.79633015 <a title="964-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad_Architecture.html">68 high scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad Architecture</a></p>

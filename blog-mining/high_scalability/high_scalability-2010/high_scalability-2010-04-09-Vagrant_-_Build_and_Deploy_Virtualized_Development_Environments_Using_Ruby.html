<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear?

<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Heroku versus GAE & GAE/J 
 
   Update 3 :   Heroku has gone live! . Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.
 
 Update 2 :  Heroku Architecture . A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors.  Dynos themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware, Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as an application caching layer.

<p>Introduction: Are long VM instance spin-up times in the cloud costing you money? That's the question that immediately came to mind when  James Urquhart , in an interview at the  Stata Conference , made this thought provoking comment:  the   faster you can get the resources into the hands of the people who use them, the more money you save overall .
 
One of the many super powers of the cloud is  elasticity , the ability to dynamically acquire and release resources in response to demand. But like any good superhero, their strength must also form the basis of a not quite fatal flaw. Years and years of angsty episodes are usually required to explore this contradiction.
 
In the case of the cloud, the weakness reveals itself in slow VM spin-up times. Spinning up a VM in EC2 can take a little as  1-3 minutes , or can  average 5-10 minutes , or it can take much longer if there's heavy usage in your availability zone. EC2 is not alone. A common complaint about Google App Engine is the  cold-start problem .</p><p>6 0.075583696 <a title="807-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-17-How_the_AOL.com_Architecture_Evolved_to_99.999%25_Availability%2C_8_Million_Visitors_Per_Day%2C_and_200%2C000_Requests_Per_Second.html">1597 high scalability-2014-02-17-How the AOL.com Architecture Evolved to 99.999% Availability, 8 Million Visitors Per Day, and 200,000 Requests Per Second</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things we are seeing is more tools and tool chains for performing very high level operations quite simply.  Vagrant  is such a tool for  building and distributing virtualized development environments .
  

Web developers use virtual environments every day with their web   applications. From EC2 and Rackspace Cloud to specialized solutions such   as EngineYard and Heroku, virtualization is the tool of choice for  easy  deployment and infrastructure management. Vagrant aims to take  those  very same principles and put them to work in the heart of the   application lifecycle. By providing easy to configure, lightweight,   reproducible, and portable virtual machines targeted at development   environments, Vagrant helps maximize your productivity and flexibility.

<p>Introduction: Update:  GIGAOM on  rPath Burns EC2 Appliances in a Web Portal . rBuilder adds a portal that lets users turn software into virtual appliances.    rPath  demoed their virtual appliance management system at Monday's  AWS Meetup . What they do is help you build a generic virtual machine image deployable on Amazon, VMWare, Xen and other targets. The idea is to build your software application independent of the underlying operating system and deploy it in your own or someone else's datacenter without worrying about all the details.   To put their service in context think of rPath as how you build, deploy, and upgrade images and someone like  Right Scale  has how you can run and managed a cluster of deployed images.
   
 To build a Virtual Appliance you pull together all your packages through their web interface or through a Python based "recipe" system, select a VM target, and "cook" it all into a VM  image you can immediately deploy and run.  To make this magic happen they use the  Conary</p><p>3 0.73174167 <a title="807-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle_-_Provisioning_Tool_to_Build_Remote_Servers.html">461 high scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle - Provisioning Tool to Build Remote Servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At  37 Signals  Joshua Sierles describes how 37 Signals uses  Sprinkle  to configure their servers within EC2. Sprinkle  defines a domain specific meta-language for describing and processing the installation of software . You can find an interesting discussion of Sprinkle's creation story by the creator himself, Marcus Crafter, in  Sprinkle Some Powder! .  Marcus divides provisioning tools into two categories:
    Task Based  - the tool issues a list of commands to run on the remote system, either remotely via a network connection or smart client.     Policy/state Based  - the tool determines what needs to be run on the remote system by examining its current and final state.  Sprinkle combines both models together in a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter approach using normal Ruby code as the DSL (domain specific language) to declaratively describe remote system configurations. 37 Signals likes the use of Ruby as the DSL because it makes learning a separate syntax unnecessary.

<p>Introduction: Func  is used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It  targets easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you know what a total nightmare that can be.  Some example commands:
   Using the command line: func "*.example.org" call yumcmd update  Using the Pthon API: import func.overlord.client as fc client = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com") client.yumcmd.update() client.service.start("acme-server") print client.hardware.info()  
  Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than one</p><p>5 0.70884281 <a title="807-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible_-__A_Simple_Model-Driven_Configuration_Management_and_Command_Execution_Framework.html">1230 high scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible -  A Simple Model-Driven Configuration Management and Command Execution Framework</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is guest post by  Michael DeHaan  (@laserllama), a software developer and architect, on  Ansible , a simple deployment, model-driven configuration management, and command execution framework. 
 
I owe High Scalability a great deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used at  Tumblr , and it kicked some ideas into gear.  This article is about what happened from that idea.
 
My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't been good at all three jobs.
 
My other observation (not from the article) was that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of</p><p>6 0.70750219 <a title="807-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-Machine_VM_%2B_Cloud_API_-_Rewriting_the_Cloud_from_Scratch.html">923 high scalability-2010-10-21-Machine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting the Cloud from Scratch</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for "Cloud  API  portability," which implies a series of misconceptions.
 
If we break away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without settling on a common Cloud  API. 
 
In this post i'll be covering five common misconceptions people have  WRT  to cloud portability.
  
  Cloud portability = Cloud API portability . API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.  
  The main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in .Cloud portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-in.  
  Cloud portability isnâ&euro;&trade;t for startups . Every startup that is expecting rapid growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared to do so.</p><p>3 0.88902378 <a title="807-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-29-CTL_-_Distributed_Control_Dispatching_Framework_.html">433 high scalability-2008-10-29-CTL - Distributed Control Dispatching Framework </a></p>

From their website:  CTL is a flexible distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to break management processes into reusable control modules and execute them in distributed fashion over the network.  What does CTL do? CTL helps you leverage your current scripts and tools to easily automate any kind of distributed systems management or application provisioning task. Its good for simplifiying large-scale scripting efforts or as another tool in your toolbox that helps you speed through your daily mix of ad-hoc administration tasks.  What are CTL's features?

<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job on your Hadoop cluster. You will  not  need to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other platforms running bash and Java.
  

  

 Fire-Up Your Hadoop Cluster 

I choose the  Cloudera distribution of Hadoop  which is still 100% Apache licensed, but has some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released by  Doug Cutting , who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also started  Lucene , which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see, is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.

<p>Introduction: Companies earnings outstrip  forecasts , consumer confidence is retuning and city bonuses are  back . What does this mean for business? Growth! After the recent years of cost cutting in IT budgets, there is the sudden fear induced from increased demand. Pre-existing trouble points in IT infrastructures that have lain dormant will suddenly be exposed. Monthly reporting and real time analytics will suffer as data grows. IT departments across the land will be crying out “The engine canna take no more captain”. What can be done?

  
     What we need is a scalable system that grows with the business. A system that can handle sudden increases in data growth without falling over. There are two core principles to a scalable system (1) Users experience constant QoS as demand grows (2) System Architects can grow system capacity proportionally with the available resources. In other words, if demand increases twofold, it is “enough” to purchase twice the hardware.
 
This is linear growth.

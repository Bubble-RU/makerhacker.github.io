<p>Introduction: Get Your High Scalability Fix at Digg Interested in working on cutting-edge
high-scale infrastructure at Digg? We're making a big investment in scaling
and have committed to the NoSQL (Not only SQL) path with Cassandra. We're
using other open-source infrastructure to help us scale including Hadoop,
RabbitMQ, Zookeeper, Thrift, HDFS and Lucene. We're rewriting Digg from the
ground up and we need amazing developers to join our world-class team. If you
think you are up for the challenge, or you know someone who might be, take a
look at our jobs page for more information.</p><p>3 0.15984155 <a title="793-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-04-Digg_Architecture.html">554 high scalability-2009-04-04-Digg Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 4::Introducing Digg's IDDB Infrastructureby Joe Stump.IDDB is a way to
partition both indexes (e.g. integer sequences and unique character indexes)
and actual tables across multiple storage servers (MySQL and MemcacheDB are
currently supported with more to follow).Update 3::Scaling Digg and Other Web
Applications.Update 2::How Digg WorksandHow Digg Really Works(wear ear plugs).
Brought to you straight from Digg's blog. A very succinct explanation of the
major elements of the Digg architecture while tracing a request through the
system. I've updated this profile with the new information.Update:Digg now
receives 230 million plus page views per month and 26 million unique visitors
- traffic that necessitated major internal upgrades.Traffic generated by
Digg's over 22 million famously info-hungry users and 230 million page views
can crash an unsuspecting website head-on into its CPU, memory, and bandwidth
limits. How does Digg handle billions of requests a month?Site:

<p>Introduction: Joe Stump, Lead Architect at Digg, gavethis presentationat the Web 2.0 Expo. I
couldn't find the actual presentation, but fortunatelyKris Jordantook some
great notes. That's how key moments in history are accidentally captured
forever. Joe was also kind enough to respond to my email questions with a
phone call.In this first part of the post Joe shares some timeless wisdom that
you may or may not have read before. I of course take some pains to extract
all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules. What
really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDBWill be the biggest new
kid on the block in scaling. MemcacheDB has been around for a little while and
I've never thought of it in that way. Well learn why Joe is so excited by
MemcacheDB at the end of the post.Impressive Stats80th-100th largest site in

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.11504342 <a title="793-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-13-Sponsored_Post%3A__VoltDB_and_Digg_are_Hiring.html">858 high scalability-2010-07-13-Sponsored Post:  VoltDB and Digg are Hiring</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Matt Aslett from the 451 group created a term called"NewSQL". On the
definition of NewSQL, Aslett writes:"NewSQL" is our shorthand for the various
new scalable/high performance SQL database vendors. We have previously
referred to these products as 'ScalableSQL' to differentiate them from the
incumbent relational database products. Since this implies horizontal
scalability, which is not necessarily a feature of all the products, we
adopted the term 'NewSQL' in the new report.And to clarify, like NoSQL, NewSQL
is not to be taken too literally: the new thing about the NewSQL vendors is
the vendor, not the SQL.As with NoSQL, under the NewSQL umbrella you can see
various providers, with various solutions.I think these can be divided into
several sub-types:New MySQL storage engines. These give MySQL users the same
programming interface, but scale very well. You can Xeround or Akiban in this

<p>Introduction: Digg has been researching ways to scale our database infrastructure for some
time now. We've adopted a traditional vertically partitioned master-slave
configuration with MySQL, and also investigated sharding MySQL with IDDB.
Ultimately, these solutions left us wanting. In the case of the traditional
architecture, the lack of redundancy on the write masters is painful, and both
approaches have significant management overhead to keep running.Since it was
already necessary to abandon data normalization and consistency to make these
approaches work, we felt comfortable looking at more exotic, non-relational
data stores. After considering HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, Tokyo
Cabinet/Tyrant, Voldemort, and Dynomite, we settled on Cassandra.Each system
has its own strengths and weaknesses, but Cassandra has a good blend of
everything. It offers column-oriented data storage, so you have a bit more
structure than plain key/value stores. It operates in a distributed, highly
available, peer-to-pee</p><p>5 0.68658686 <a title="793-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-07-How_to_Avoid_the_Top_5_Scale-Out_Pitfalls.html">717 high scalability-2009-10-07-How to Avoid the Top 5 Scale-Out Pitfalls</a></p>

buying larger servers. Here's the MySQL idea of what ascale-out architecture
lookslike:ThisMySQL articlelists 5 problems to avoid when scaling out:Don't
Think Synchronously. Introduce asynchronous communication, parallelization,
and strategies to deal with approximate or slightly outdated data.Don't Think
Vertically.  Scaling by bigger machines won't work. Plan on horizontal scaling
and asynchronous architectures form the start which make it easy to add
capacity on demand.Don't Mix Transactions with Business
Intelligence.Transactions and analytics are inherently different. Separate out
different types of data onto different databases.Avoid Mixing Hot and Cold
Data.Static and fast changing data are inherently different. Separate out

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>2 0.9898839 <a title="793-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to
start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their
application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I
am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I
plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need
to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure
and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the
application that will become critical over time.</p><p>3 0.98773521 <a title="793-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC_for_web-DB_servers.html">226 high scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC for web-DB servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All,I'm looking for a faster/reliable solution for DR/BC as well as for
sclability for my web/db servers. I came across VMWare Infrastructure and
other products. The I/O performance concerns me to go with virtual servers.
I'm also looking into imaging software such as Acrnois.Could anyone share
their thoughts on how it's being done with bigger names such as google/youtube

<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw
up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK. If they're outside the
UK but have decent support then also include. The service must be cheap and
not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it
shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered
whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK
compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a
small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space. Would S3 be a good
starting point? What is the service like? I hear mixed reviews about it.Many
thanks,Jim</p><p>5 0.98512876 <a title="793-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine_Snippet_Search_New_Indexing_Technology.html">746 high scalability-2009-11-26-Kngine Snippet Search New Indexing Technology</a></p>

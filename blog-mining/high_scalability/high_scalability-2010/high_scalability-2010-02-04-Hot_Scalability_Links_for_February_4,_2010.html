<p>Introduction: Hibernate and iBATIS and other similar tools have documentation with
recommendations for avoiding the "N+1 select" problem. The problem being that
if you wanted to retrieve a set of widgets from a table, one query would be
used to to retrieve all the ids of the matching widgets (select widget_id from
widget where ...) and then for each id, another select is used to retrieve the
details of that widget (select * from widget where widget_id = ?). If you have
100 widgets, it requires 101 queries to get the details of them all.I can see
why this is bad, but what if you're doing entity caching? i.e. If you run the
first query to get your list of ids, and then for each widget you retrive it
from the cache. Surely in that case, N+1(+caching) is good? Assuming of course
that there is a high probability of all of the matching entities being in the
cache.I may be asking a daft question here - one whose answer is obviously
implied by the large scalable mechanisms for storing data that are in use

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

Virtual Machine for PHP? With HipHop Facebook achieved over a 9x increase in
web request throughput and over a 5x reduction in memory consumption compared
to Zend PHP 5.2 engine + APC.But will HipHop really work for you? Is it really
drop-in compatible? Is it really as fast as they say?To answer questions like
this nothing beats a good experience report and here's a great one:Adventures
in Configuring and Running Facebook's HipHopVM (hhvm) JIT Compiler for PHP by
Yermo Lamers.Yermo selected PHP to implement a number of content web sites. He
took an interesting approach, he created a forms, views, validation, and
business logic description language to remove the drudgery of creating the
same code over and over again for each page. Having done this in Perl I think
it's a great a approach. The problem is it can be slow. PHP's slow string

#strataconf@sbtourist: I think BigMemory-like approaches based on large put-
and-forget memory cans, are rarely a solution to performance/scalability
problems.1 Million TCP Connections. Remember when 10K was a real limit and you
had to build out boxes just to handle the load? Amazing. We don't know how
much processing can be attached to these connections, how much memory the apps
use, or what the response latency is to requests over these connections, but
still, that's cool.

<p>Introduction: Wikipedia andWikimediahave some of the best, most complete real-world
documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas
Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an
overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid,
lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN, how
caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how
they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle
load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of
configuration files. This is a really useful resource.Related

thing to shard data to scale, it's a completely different level of
functionality to manage those shards intelligently. Voldemort has stepped up
by adding advanced rebalancing functionality: Dynamic addition of new nodes to
the cluster; Deletion of nodes from cluster; Load balancing of data inside a
cluster.Microsoft Finally Opens Azure for Business.Out of the blue Microsoft
opens up their platform as a service service. Good to have more competition

<p>Introduction: Snoozeis an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual
machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly to other VM
management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it
allows to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources.
Particularly, once installed and configured users can submit and control the
life-cycle of a large number of VMs. However, contrary to existing frameworks
for scalability and fault tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and
healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it
performs distributed VM management and is designed to be energy efficient.
Therefore, it implements features to monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU,
memory, network Rx, network Tx) demands, detect and resolve overload/underload
situations, perform dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and
finally power management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a
generic scheduler</p><p>6 0.85611987 <a title="771-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff_to_Watch_from_Google_IO_2011.html">1055 high scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff to Watch from Google IO 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>3 0.14425801 <a title="860-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-15-Large-scale_Graph_Computing_at_Google.html">631 high scalability-2009-06-15-Large-scale Graph Computing at Google</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To continue the graph theme Google has got into the act and released
information onPregel. Pregel does not appear to be a new type of potato chip.
Pregel is instead a scalable infrastructure......to mine a wide range of
graphs. In Pregel, programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations. In each
iteration, a vertex can, independently of other vertices, receive messages
sent to it in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, modify
its own and its outgoing edges' states, and mutate the graph's
topology.Currently, Pregel scales to billions of vertices and edges, but this
limit will keep expanding. Pregel's applicability is harder to quantify, but
so far we haven't come across a type of graph or a practical graph computing
problem which is not solvable with Pregel. It computes over large graphs much
faster than alternatives, and the application programming interface is easy to
use. Implementing PageRank, for example, takes only about 15 lines of code.

<p>Introduction: Lately I've been reading more cases were different people have started to
realize the limitations of the NoSQL promise to database scalability. Note the
references below:Why does Quora use MySQL as the data store instead of NoSQLs
such as Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB etc?Why did Diaspora abandon MongoDB for
MySQL?How scalable is CouchDB in practice, not just in theory?Take MongoDB for
example. It's damn fast, but it doesn't really know how to save data reliably
to disk. I've had it set up in a replica pair to mitigate that risk. Guess
what - both servers in the pair failed and corrupted their data files at the
same day.It appears that for many, the switch to NoSQL can be rather painful.
IMO that doesn't necessarily mean that NoSQL is wrong in general, but it's a
combination of 1) lack of maturity 2) not the right tool for the job.That
brings the question of what's the alternative solution?In the following post I
tried to summarize the lessons from  Ronnie Bodinger (Head of IT at Avanza</p><p>5 0.12043495 <a title="860-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-26-Reddit%3A_Lessons_Learned_from_Mistakes_Made_Scaling_to_1_Billion_Pageviews_a_Month.html">1507 high scalability-2013-08-26-Reddit: Lessons Learned from Mistakes Made Scaling to 1 Billion Pageviews a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg, the first paid employee at reddit, teaches us a lot about how
to create a successful social site in a really good talk he gave at the RAMP
conference. Watch it here at Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion-
Pitfalls and Lessons.Jeremy uses a virtue and sin approach. Examples of the
mistakes made in scaling reddit are shared and it turns out they did a lot of
good stuff too. Somewhat of a shocker is that Jeremy is now a Reliability
Architect at Netflix, so we get a little Netflix perspective thrown in for
free.Some of the lessons that stood out most for me: Think of SSDs as cheap
RAM, not expensive disk. When reddit moved from spinning disks to SSDs for the
database the number of servers was reduced from 12 to 1 with a ton of
headroom. SSDs are 4x more expensive but you get 16x the performance. Worth
the cost. Give users a little bit of power, see what they do with it, and turn
the good stuff into features. One of the biggest revelations for me was how

<p>Introduction: You're Doing it Wrong by Poul-Henning Kamp. Don't look so guilty, he's not
talking about you know what, he's talking about writing high-performance
server programs: Not just wrong as in not perfect, but wrong as in wasting
half, or more, of your performance. What good is an O(log2(n)) algorithm if
those operations cause page faults and slow disk operations? For most relevant
datasets an O(n) or even an O(n^2) algorithm, which avoids page faults, will
run circles around it. A Microsoft Windows Azure primer: the basicsby Peter
Bright. Nice article explaining the basics of Azure and how it compares to
Google and Amazon.A call to change the name from NoSQL to Postmodern
Databases. Interesting idea, but the problem is the same one I have for

<p>Introduction: And by hot I also mean temperature. Summer has arrived. It's sizzling here in
Silicon Valley. Thank you air conditioning!Scale the web by appointing a
Crawler Czar? Tom Foremski has the idea thatGoogle should open up their
indexso sites wouldn't have to endure the constant pounding by ravenous
crawler bots. Don MacAskill of SmugMug estimates50% of our web server CPU
resourcesare spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work
with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but
does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data
over and over again?Tweets of Gold:jamesurquhart:Key to applications is
architecture. Key for infrastructure supporting archs is configurability.

Distributed Computing.Achieving highest possible scalability is a complex
combination of many factors. This PLoP 2007paperpresents a pattern language

<p>Introduction: 3PAR Remote Copyis a uniquely simple and efficient replication technology that
allows customers to protect and share any application data affordably. Built
upon 3PAR Thin Copy technology, Remote Copy lowers the total cost of storage
by addressing the cost and complexity of remote replication.Common Uses of
3PAR Remote Copy:Affordable Disaster Recovery: Mirror data cost-effectively
across town or across the world.Centralized Archive: Replicate data from
multiple 3PAR InServs located in multiple data centers to a centralized data
archive location.Resilient Pod Architecture: Mutually replicate tier 1 or 2
data to tier 3 capacity between two InServs (application pods).Remote Data
Access: Replicate data to a remote location for sharing of data with remote
users.</p><p>5 0.82568395 <a title="860-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-07-It%27s_a_VM_Wasteland_-_A_Near_Optimal_Packing_of_VMs_to_Machines_Reduces_TCO_by_22%25.html">1419 high scalability-2013-03-07-It's a VM Wasteland - A Near Optimal Packing of VMs to Machines Reduces TCO by 22%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>6 0.81637257 <a title="860-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-29-Amazon%3A_Creating_a_Customer_Utopia_One_Culture_Hack_at_a_Time.html">1466 high scalability-2013-05-29-Amazon: Creating a Customer Utopia One Culture Hack at a Time</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is

<p>Introduction: While working with Memcache the other night, it dawned on me that it’s usage
as a distributed caching mechanism was really just one of many ways to use it.
That there are in fact many alternative usages that one could find for
Memcache if they could just realize what Memcache really is at its core – a
simple distributed hash-table – is an important point worthy of further
discussion.To be clear, when I say “simple”, by no means am I implying that
Memcache’s implementation is simple, just that the ideas behind it are such.
Think about that for a minute. What else could we use a simple distributed
hash-table for, besides caching? How about using it as an alternative to the
traditional shard lookup method we used in our Master Index Lookup scalability
strategy, discussed previously here.</p><p>4 0.19583477 <a title="927-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL_and_Memcached%3A_End_of_an_Era%3F.html">785 high scalability-2010-02-26-MySQL and Memcached: End of an Era?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you look at the early days of this blog, when web scalability was still in
its heady bloom of youth, many of the articles had to do with
leveragingMySQLandmemcached. Exciting times. Shard MySQL to handle high write
loads, cache objects in memcached to handle high read loads, and then write a
lot of glue code to make it all work together. That was state of the art, that
was how it was done. The architecture of many major sites still follow this
pattern today, largely because with enough elbow grease, it works.This was a
pre-cloud, relational database dominated world, built from parts scrounged
from the remnants of enterprises and datacenters past.TwitterandDiggstarted in
this era, but are evolving into something different, as scaling pressures
increase and new purpose built technologies pop into being.With a little
perspective, it's clear the MySQL+memcached era is passing. It will stick
around for a while. Old technologies seldom fade away completely. Some still
ride horses. Some st</p><p>5 0.19463113 <a title="927-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-28-And_the_winner_is%3A_MySQL_or_Memcached_or_Tokyo_Tyrant%3F.html">729 high scalability-2009-10-28-And the winner is: MySQL or Memcached or Tokyo Tyrant?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Matt, from the ever excellentMySQL Performance Blog, decided to run a test
using a simple scenario drawn from his client experience in the gaming space.
The scenario: read a row based on a primary key, update the row, write it to
disk, and use the row to lookup another row. Matt ran three different tests
explained in a series of three different articles:MySQL and MySQL + Memcached,
Memcached Only, andTokyo Tyrant.The lovingly compiled details along with many
cool graphs are in the articles, but in general the lessons learned are:When
memcached hasenough memory(so records being accessed are in RAM), memcached +
MySQL can provide a10x performance boostover MySQL alone. When the RAM is too
small and hot records, those being accessed a lot, aren't in RAM, or perhaps
applications are doing a sequential scan of a table and the entire table isn't
cached, then memcached won't be the big bang improvement you may be hoping
for.When the database is removed and memcached serves both reads and writ</p><p>6 0.16495167 <a title="927-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-22-Gear6_Web_cache_-_the_hardware_solution_for_working_with_Memcache.html">577 high scalability-2009-04-22-Gear6 Web cache - the hardware solution for working with Memcache</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Michael Nygard talks aboutTwo Ways To Boost Your Flagging Web Site. The idea
behind cache farms is to move memory devoted to the various caching layers
into one large farm of caches, as with memcached. The idea behind read pools
is to allocate your database read requests to a pool of dedicated read
servers, thus offloading the write server. Using a combination of the
strategies you aren't forced to scale up the database tier to scale your
website.</p><p>4 0.7076236 <a title="927-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy%3A_How_to_Manage_Sessions_Using_Memcached.html">436 high scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy: How to Manage Sessions Using Memcached</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>5 0.70236105 <a title="927-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy%3A_Break_Up_the_Memcache_Dog_Pile_.html">673 high scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy: Break Up the Memcache Dog Pile </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog
PileEffectinDog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails. Glenn
Franxman also has a Django solution inMintCache.Data is usually cached because

<p>Introduction: Hello! My first post here, so be patient please. I am developing site where I
have lots of static content. But on many pages I have query to update count of
views. I would say this is may cause lots of problems and was interested in
another solution like storing these counts somewhere else. As my knowledge is
bit limited in this way, I am asking you. I can say I understand PHP(OOP ofc)
and MySQL. Nowadays I am getting into servers.Other question I have is:I read
about making lots of things static.(in Flickr Architecture) and am interested
how they do static sites? Lets say they make photo page static? And rebuild
when tagg or comment is added? I am bit interested in it as I want to learn
Smarty better(newbie) and serving content.Moreover, how about PHP? I have read
many books about PHP theoretically but would love to see some RL example of
using objects and exceptions(mainly this as I don't completely understand it)
to learn some good programming habits. So if you can help me with some</p><p>2 0.91616881 <a title="927-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-29-Product%3A_SciDB_-_A_Science-Oriented_DBMS_at_100_Petabytes.html">817 high scalability-2010-04-29-Product: SciDB - A Science-Oriented DBMS at 100 Petabytes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scientists are doing it for themselves. Doing what? Databases. The idea is
that most databases are designed to meet the needs of businesses, not science,
so scientists are banding together atscidb.orgto create their own Domain
Specific Database, for science. The goal is to be able to handle datasets in
the 100PB range and larger.SciDB, Inc. is building an open source database
technology product designed specifically to satisfy the demands of data-
intensive scientific problems. With the advice of the world's leading
scientists across a variety of disciplines including astronomy, biology,
physics, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and climatology, our computer
scientists are currently designing and prototyping this technologyThe
scientists that are participating in our open source project believe that the
SciDB database -- when completed -- will dramatically impact their ability to
conduct their experiments faster and more efficiently and further improve the
quality of life on our pla</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90564597 <a title="927-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-26-Marrying_memcached_and_NoSQL.html">927 high scalability-2010-10-26-Marrying memcached and NoSQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Memcached is one of the most common In-Memory cache implementation.  It was
originally developed by Danga Interactive for LiveJournal, but is now used by
many other sites as a side cache to speed up read mostly operations. It gained
popularity in the non-Java world, too, especially since it's a language-
neutral side cache for which few alternatives existed.  As a side-cache,
Memcache clients relies on the database as the system of record, The database
is still used for write,update and complex query operations.  Since the
memcached specification includes no query operations, memcached is not a
database alternative, unlike most of the NoSQL offerings. It also exclude
memcache from being a real solution for write scalability. As a result of that
many of the heavy sites started to move away from Memcache and replace it with
other NoSQL alternatives as noted in a recent highscalability post MySQL And
Memcached: End Of An Era?The transition away from memcached to NoSQL could
represent a la</p><p>4 0.90400302 <a title="927-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-21-Paper%3A_Parallelizing_the_Web_Browser.html">660 high scalability-2009-07-21-Paper: Parallelizing the Web Browser</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There have been reports thatsoftware engineering is dead. Maybe, like the
future, software engineering is simply not evenly distributed? When you read
this paper I think you'll agree there is some real engineering going on, it's
just that most of the things we need to build do not require real engineering.
Much like my old childhood tree fort could be patched together and was "good
enough." This brings to mind the old joke: If a software tree falls in the
woods would anyone hear it fall? Only if it tweeted on the way down...What
this paper really showed me is we need not only to change programming
practices and constructs, but we also need to design solutions that allow for
deep parallelism to begin with. Grafting parallelism on later is difficult.
Parallel execution requires knowing precisely how components are dependent on
each other and that level of precision tends to go far beyond the human
attention span.In particular this paper deals with how to parallelize the

<p>Introduction: You program in a dynamic language, that runs on a JVM, that runs on a OS
designed40 years ago for a completely different purpose, that runs on
virtualized hardware. Does this make sense? We've talked about this idea
before inMachine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting The Cloud From Scratch, where the
vision is to treatcloud virtual hardware as a compiler target, and converting
high-level language source code directly into kernels that run on it.As new
technologies evolve the friction created by our old tool chains and
architecture models becomes ever more obvious. Take, for example, what
ateamatUCSD is releasing: aphase-change memory prototype  -a solid state
storage device that provides performance thousands of times faster than a
conventional hard drive and up to seven times faster than current state-of-
the-art solid-state drives (SSDs).However, PCM has access latencies several
times slower than DRAM.This technology has obvious mind blowing implications,
but an interesting not so obvious im</p><p>6 0.88140804 <a title="927-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-23-Product%3A_dbShards_-_Share_Nothing._Shard_Everything..html">847 high scalability-2010-06-23-Product: dbShards - Share Nothing. Shard Everything.</a></p>

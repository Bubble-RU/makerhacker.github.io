<p>Introduction: Google runs queries against thousands of in-memory index nodes in parallel and
then merges the results. One of the interesting problems with this approach,
explains Google's Jeff Dean in thislecture at Stanford, is theQuery of Death.A
query can cause a program to fail because of bugs or various other issues.
This means that a single query can take down an entire cluster of machines,
which is not good for availability and response times, as it takes quite a
while for thousands of machines to recover. Thus the Query of Death. New
queries are always coming into the system and when you are always rolling out
new software, it's impossible to completely get rid of the problem.Two
solutions:Test against logs. Google replays a month's worth of logs to see if
any of those queries kill anything. That helps, but Queries of Death may still
happen.Send a canary request. A request is sent to one machine. If the request
succeeds then it will probably succeed on all machines, so go ahead with the

<p>Introduction: Benjamin Erb (@b_erb) from Ulm University recently published his diploma
thesis on"Concurrent Programming for Scalable Web Architectures". The thesis
provides a comprehensive survey on different concepts and techniques of
concurrency inside web architectures, including web servers, application logic
and storage backends. It incorporates research publications, hands-on reports
and also regards popular programming languages, frameworks and
databases.Abstract:Web architectures are an important asset for various large-
scale web applications, such as social networks or e-commerce sites. Being
able to handle huge numbers of users concurrently is essential, thus
scalability is one of the most important features of these architectures.
Multi-core processors, highly distributed backend architectures and new web
technologies force us to reconsider approaches for concurrent programming in
order to implement web applications and fulfil scalability demands. While

<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>6 0.11871307 <a title="772-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-11-Low_Level_Scalability_Solutions_-_The_Conditioning_Collection.html">1421 high scalability-2013-03-11-Low Level Scalability Solutions - The Conditioning Collection</a></p>

Monster Attacks.This is a look at all the bad things that can happen to your
carefully crafted program as loads increase: all hell breaks lose. Sure, you
can scale out or scale up, but you can also choose to program better. Make
your system handle larger loads. This saves money because fewer boxes are
needed and it will make the entire application more reliable and have better
response times. And it can be quite satisfying as a programmer.Large Number Of
ObjectsWe usually get into scaling problems when the number of objects gets
larger. Clearly resource usage of all types is stressed as the number of
objects grow.Continuous Failures Makes An Infinite Event StreamDuring large
network failure scenarios there is never time for the system recover. We are
in a continual state of stress.Lots of High Priority WorkFor example,

<p>Introduction: One important high availability principle is concurrency control.  The idea is
to allow only that much traffic through to your system which your system can
handle successfully.  For example: if your system is certified to handle a
concurrency of 100 then the 101st request should either timeout, be asked to
try later  or wait until one of the previous 100 requests finish.  The 101st
request should not be allowed to negatively impact the experience of the other
100 users.  Only the 101st request should be impacted.Read more here...</p><p>2 0.93019927 <a title="772-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Product%3A_Perdition_Mail_Retrieval_Proxy.html">80 high scalability-2007-09-06-Product: Perdition Mail Retrieval Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perditionis a fully featured POP3 and IMAP4 proxy server. It is able to handle
both SSL and non-SSL connections and redirect users to a real-server based on
a database lookup. Perdition supports modular based database access. ODBC,
MySQL, PostgreSQL, GDBM, POSIX Regular Expression and NIS modules ship with
the distribution. The API for modules is open allowing arbitrary modules to be
written to allow access to any data store.Perdition has many uses. Including,
creating large mail systems where an end-user's mailbox may be stored on one
of several hosts, integrating different mail systems together, migrating
between different email infrastructures, and bridging plain-text, SSL and TLS
services. It can also be used as part of a firewall. The use of perditon to
scale mail services beyond a single box is discussed in high capacity email.</p><p>3 0.89603269 <a title="772-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-08-Eight_Best_Practices_for_Building_Scalable_Systems.html">594 high scalability-2009-05-08-Eight Best Practices for Building Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wille Faler hascreated an excellent list of best practicesfor building
scalable and high performance systems. Here's a short summary of his
points:Offload the database- Avoid hitting the database, and avoid opening
transactions or connections unless you absolutely need to use them.What a
difference a cache makes- For read heavy applications caching is the easiest
way offload the database.Cache as coarse-grained objects as possible- Coarse-
grained objects save CPU and time by requiring fewer reads to assemble
objects.Don't store transient state permanently- Is it really necessary to
store your transient data in the database?Location, Location- put things close
to where they are supposed to be delivered.Constrain concurrent access to
limited resource- it's quicker to let a single thread do work and finish
rather than flooding finite resources with 200 client threads.Staged,
asynchronous processing- separate a process using asynchronicity into separate
steps mediated by queues and execut</p><p>4 0.89260614 <a title="772-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy%3A_How_to_Manage_Sessions_Using_Memcached.html">436 high scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy: How to Manage Sessions Using Memcached</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>5 0.89045262 <a title="772-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers
podcastShow 15 - Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls. The
conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can
be processed by a WAF (Web Application Firewall), which inspects HTTP for
security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much
was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be
necessary, but I digress.Toterminate SSLmost shops run SSL connections into
Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for
developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of
the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.Load
balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very
efficiently in hardware. Efficiently enough that if you are willing to get rid
of the general purpose Linux boxes and use your big iron load balancers, your
server count can be decreased</p><p>6 0.88649338 <a title="772-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-27-Zen_and_the_Art_of_Scaling_-_A_Koan_and_Epigram_Approach.html">1199 high scalability-2012-02-27-Zen and the Art of Scaling - A Koan and Epigram Approach</a></p>

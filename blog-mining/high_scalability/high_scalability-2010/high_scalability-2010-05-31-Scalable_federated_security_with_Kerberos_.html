<p>Introduction: For years a war has been fought in the software architecture trenches between
the ideal of decentralized services and the power and practicality of
centralized services. Centralized architectures, at least at themanagement and
control planelevel, are winning. And Google not only agrees, they are
enthusiastic adopters of this model, even in places you don't think it should
work.Here's an excerpt from Google Lifts Veil On "Andromeda" Virtual
Networking, an excellent article by Timothy Morgan, that includes a money
quote fromAmin Vahdat, distinguished engineer and technical lead for
networking at Google:Like many of the massive services that Google has
created, the Andromeda network has centralized control. By the way, so did the
Google File System and the MapReduce scheduler that gave rise to Hadoop when
it was mimicked, so did the BigTable NoSQL data store that has spawned a
number of quasi-clones, and even the B4 WAN and the Spanner distributed file
system that have yet to be cloned.

<p>Introduction: Inthis posti wrote my view on the anti SQL database movement and where the
alternative approach fits in:- SQL databases are not going away anytime soon.-
The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.- There
is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions
alongside traditional SQL databases.In addition to the options that was
mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative
approach and how that fits into the puzzle. I used a real life scenario:

approach was the only option they could scale and meet their application

<p>Introduction: It started out innocently enough with a simple question, "What exactly *is*
the model for PaaS services scalability? If based on HTTP/REST API
integration, fairly easy. If native middlewareâ€¦ input?" You'll forgive the odd
phrasing - Twitter's limitations sometimes make conversations of this nature â€¦
interesting.The discussion culminated in what appeared to be the sentiment
that middleware was mostly obsolete with respect to PaaS.THE OLD WAYVery
briefly for those of you who are more infrastructure / network minded than
application architecture fluent, let's review the traditional middleware-based
application architecture.Generally speaking, middleware - a.k.a. JMS, MQ
Series and most recently, ESB - is leveraged as means to enable a publish-
subscribe model of sharing data. Basically, it's an integration pattern, but
no one really likes to admit that because of the connotations associated with
the evil word "integration" in the enterprise. But that's what it's used for -

<p>Introduction: Space-based architectures are an alternative to the traditional n-tier model
for enterprise applications. Instead of a vertical tier partitioning, space
based applications are partitioned horizontally into self-sufficient units.
This leads to almost linear scalability of stateful, high-performance
applications.This is arecording of a talk I did last monthwhere I introduce
space based programming and demonstrate how that works in practice on the .NET
platform using Oracle Coherence and GigaSpaces.</p><p>4 0.55413079 <a title="832-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-27-Three_steps_for_turning_a_tier-based-Spring-application_into_dynamically_scalable_services_%28video%29.html">432 high scalability-2008-10-27-Three steps for turning a tier-based-Spring-application into dynamically scalable services (video)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: SummaryIn this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing
stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services
application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out
model.BioNati Shalom is the CTO and Founder ofGigaSpacesand responsible for
the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed
technology and architecture namely CORBA, Jini, J2EE, Grid and SOA. Nati is
the Head of the Israeli Grid consortium and an evangelist of Space Based
Architecture and Data Grid patterns. Blog:Gigaspaces BlogRead the rest of the

<p>Introduction: SmugMug's CEO & Chief Geek Don MacAskill smugly (hard to resist) gushes over
finally finding, after a long and arduous quest, their "best bang-for-the-buck
storage array." It's theDell MD300. His in-depth explanation of why he prefers
the MD3000 should help anyone with their own painful storage deliberations.
His key points are:breakThe price is right; DAS via SAS, 15 spindles at 15K
rpm each, 512MB of mirrored battery-backed write cache; You can disable read
caching; You can disable read-ahead prefetching; The stripe sizes are
configurable up to 512KB; The controller ignores host-based flush commands by
default; They support an â€˜Enhanced JBODâ€™ mode.His reasoning for the
desirability each option is astute and he even gives you the configuration
options for carrying out the configuration. This is not your average CEO.Don
also speculates that a three tier system using flash (system RAM + flash
storage + RAID disks) is a possible future direction. Unfortunately, flash may
not be the dream</p><p>5 0.64391613 <a title="832-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-15-The_Common_Principles_Behind_the_NOSQL_Alternatives.html">749 high scalability-2009-12-15-The Common Principles Behind the NOSQL Alternatives</a></p>

[sent-27, score-1.052]
</p><p>2 I'm going to take the traditional definition of  shard  and generalize it a bit:      shard :   a subset of a data set that is stored and accessed on a particular node. [sent-38, score-0.911]
</p><p>3 sharding :   the process of creating and managing shards to properly match data size to resource usage and availability. [sent-39, score-0.552]
</p><p>4 Databases can use the operating system to manage paging to disk when the data is larger than available RAM or the database can manage on disk storage itself. [sent-45, score-0.893]
</p><p>5 The format of the data and the operations allowed on the data are system specific. [sent-46, score-0.537]
</p><p>6 We generally think of sharding as a means to get around RAM or disk limitations, but it's a more general principle than that, it's a way to get around all types of limitations by matching the data size to a node such that there are enough resources to do whatever needs to be done with the data. [sent-54, score-0.742]
</p><p>7 The common case is for a shard to grow and use too much RAM, so the shard must be managed (split, moved, etc) to remove the RAM constraint. [sent-57, score-0.7]
</p><p>8 The goal of sharding is to continually structure a system to ensure data is chunked in small enough units and spread across enough nodes that data operations are not limited by resource constraints. [sent-64, score-0.974]
</p><p>9 It's difficult for developers to know the distribution of a key apriori, so a disproportionate amount of data can be written to just a few shards while the other shards are left relatively empty. [sent-84, score-0.719]
</p><p>10 When only a few shards are used all the data ends up on just one or two shards, which can easily lead to hot key and exhaustion problems. [sent-92, score-0.581]
</p><p>11 Using more shards reduce the amount of data on each shard which makes for quicker and more predictable operations on shards. [sent-96, score-0.812]
</p><p>12 A 100 byte allocation that was actually allocated from a 100 byte pool when a system started could over time be allocated from 2K pool later and all that memory goes to waste. [sent-110, score-0.633]
</p><p>13 Letting the OS manage virtual memory through paging can lead to page thrashing and when a system starts thrashing it's pretty much over. [sent-117, score-0.535]
</p><p>14 A paging system pages "cold" blocks out of memory to disk and brings in hot blocks off disk into memory. [sent-119, score-0.84]
</p><p>15 When virtual memory and paging are involved that memory can be paging in and out of anywhere. [sent-157, score-0.628]
</p><p>16 Move keys from a shard to another shard or into its own shard . [sent-197, score-1.133]
</p><p>17 A very hot key needs to placed into a shard where it can get the resources. [sent-198, score-0.518]
</p><p>18 Add more shards and move existing data to those shards . [sent-201, score-0.643]
</p><p>19 Will enough memory be freed on the overloaded system or will fragmentation issues prevent the memory from being reclaimed? [sent-204, score-0.595]
</p><p>20 Mapping data to a shard via hashing is quick and efficient, but it's not the only way to map keys to shards. [sent-218, score-0.57]

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Zardosht Kasheff , Software Developer at  Tokutek , a storage engine company that delivers 21st-Century capabilities to the leading open source data management platforms. 
 
As software developers, we value abstraction. The simpler the API, the more attractive it becomes. Arguably, MongoDB’s greatest strengths are its elegant API and its   agility  , which let developers simply code.
 
But when  MongoDB  runs into scalability problems on  big data , developers need to peek underneath the covers to understand the underlying issues and how to fix them. Without understanding, one may end up with an inefficient solution that costs time and money. For example, one may shard prematurely, increasing hardware and management costs, when a simpler replication setup would do. Or, one may increase the size of a replica set when upgrading to SSDs would suffice.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Flickr hits  2 Billion photos  served. That's a lot of hamburgers.   Flickr is both my favorite  bird  and the web's leading photo sharing site. Flickr has an amazing challenge, they must handle a vast sea of ever expanding new content, ever increasing legions of  users, and a constant stream of new features, all while providing excellent performance.  How do they do it?

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>6 0.27162045 <a title="920-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding_the_Hibernate_Way.html">358 high scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding the Hibernate Way</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update :  A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview with  Google engineer Max Ross on Hibernate Shards . Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to Google AppEngine (not much).   To scale you are supposed to partition your data. Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all the details it’s not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff in the right way and it’s very much worth looking at, especially if you us</p><p>4 0.81828761 <a title="920-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-09-Need_Help_with_Database_Scalability%3F_Understand_I-O.html">1514 high scalability-2013-09-09-Need Help with Database Scalability?

<p>Introduction: Guest post by  Asya Kamsky , Principal Solutions Architect at MongoDB. 
 
This post outlines ten things you need to know for operating MongoDB at scale based on my experience working with MongoDB customers and open source users:
  
  MongoDB requires DevOps, too.  MongoDB is a database. Like any other data store, it requires capacity planning, tuning, monitoring, and maintenance. Just because it's easy to install and get started and it fits the developer paradigm more naturally than a relational database, don't assume that MongoDB doesn't need proper care and feeding.  And just because it performs super-fast on a small sample dataset in development doesn't mean you can get away without having a good schema and indexing strategy, as well as the right hardware resources in production! But if you prepare well and understand the best practices, operating large MongoDB clusters can be boring instead of nerve-wracking. 
  Successful MongoDB users monitor everything and prepare for growth.</p><p>6 0.80180198 <a title="920-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-11-Pyshards_aspires_to_build_sharding_toolkit_for_Python.html">345 high scalability-2008-06-11-Pyshards aspires to build sharding toolkit for Python</a></p>

 With this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs .  I like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.  -- Sylvain on  Google Groups 
 
The dream is dead. Google App Engine's bold  pay for what you use  dream dies as it leaves childish things behind and becomes a  real product .  Pricing will change . Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will change. But Google App Engine  will survive.   
 
Google is  shutting down  many of its  projects . GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank for it surving the  more wood behind  more deadly arrows push? Without a radical and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote in the long scroll of good ideas.

<p>Introduction: I haven't developed an AppEngine application yet, I'm just taking a look around their documentation and seeing what stands out  for me. It's not the much speculated   super cluster VM  . AppEngine is solidly grounded in code and structure. It reminds me a little of the guy who ran a   website out of S3   with a splash of   Heroku   thrown in as a chaser.      The idea is clearly to take advantage of our   massive multi-core future   by creating a shared nothing infrastructure based firmly on a core set of infinitely scalable database, storage and CPU services. Don't forget Google also has a few other services to leverage: email, login, blogs, video, search, ads, metrics, and apps.  A shared nothing request is a simple beast. By its very nature shared nothing architectures must be composed of services which are themselves already scalable and Google is signing up to supply that scalable infrastructure. Google has been busy creating a platform of out-of-the-box scalable services to build</p><p>4 0.9844833 <a title="920-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-29-DataSift_Architecture%3A_Realtime_Datamining_at_120%2C000_Tweets_Per_Second.html">1148 high scalability-2011-11-29-DataSift Architecture: Realtime Datamining at 120,000 Tweets Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I remember the excitement of when Twitter first opened up their firehose.  As an early adopter of the Twitter API I could easily imagine some of the cool things you could do with all that data. I also remember the disappointment of learning that in the land of BigData, data has a price, and that price would be too high for little fish like me. It was like learning for the first time there would be no BigData Santa Clause.
 
For a while though I had the pleasure of pondering just how I would handle all that data. It's a fascinating problem. You have to be able to reliably consume it, normalize it, merge it with other data, apply functions on it, store it, query it, distribute it, and oh yah, monetize it. Most of that in realish-time. And if you are trying to create a platform for allowing the entire Internet do to the same thing to the firehose, the challenge is exponentially harder.
 
DataSift is in the exciting position of creating just such a firehose eating, data chomping machine.

<p>Introduction: Update 6: :  Back to the Future for Data Storage .  We are in the middle of a renaissance in data storage with the application of many new ideas and techniques; there's huge potential for breaking out of thinking about data storage in just one way.   Update 5 :  Building Scalable Web Applications with Google App Engine  by Brett Slatkin.
 
 Update 4 :  Why Google App Engine is broken and what Google must do to fix it  by Aral Balkan.  We don't care that it can scale. We care that it does scale. And that it scales when you need it the most.   Issues: 1MB limit on data structures; 1MB limit on data structures; the short-term high CPU quota; quotas in general; Admin? What's that?  Update 3 : BigTable  Blues . Catherine Devlin couldn't port an application to GAE because it can't do basic filtering and can't search 5,000 records without timing out: "Querying from 5000 records - too much for the mighty BigTable, apparently." Followup:  not the future database .

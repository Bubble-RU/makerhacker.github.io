Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it’s true that the marketing wave of NoSQL has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that’s been around for quite a while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all, everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very p</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 A so-called SQL database is a structured relational storage system:     “structured” means that an ensemble of attributes (columns) which will contain data (values) will correspond to a single or composite key. [sent-8, score-0.4]
</p><p>2 A relationship is therefore established between these two tables and repetition of the same information in all the lines of the table is avoided. [sent-11, score-0.343]
</p><p>3 Functional features are structured and modeled in the database…     NoSQL is a structured database which enables access to stored data via a simple key. [sent-12, score-0.394]
</p><p>4 It is therefore possible to execute SQL-type conditional requests and thus recover information or compile statistics by using  WHERE  clauses. [sent-26, score-0.41]
</p><p>5 The write performances will be unitarily better with a NoSQL tool (as opposed to a SQL tool with an equivalent data set on a key-value(s) model), but it doesn’t do everything, as we will see later. [sent-29, score-0.398]
</p><p>6 I’m deliberately not talking about cache systems at this point, even if the cache would be genuinely useful in this case for the elements which tend to be accessed in read, therefore for the SQL part. [sent-30, score-0.507]
</p><p>7 If it doesn’t have relational databases with integrated business / functional notions (object modelisation), I wouldn’t even attempt to touch it with a barge pole. [sent-33, score-0.378]
</p><p>8 This enables Memcached to be deleted and you therefore no longer have to manage the problem of data inconsistency between Memcached and the MySQL database, and you can make the best use of the RAM by only using the InnoDB buffer pool. [sent-48, score-0.404]
</p><p>9 This means, therefore, that if the data don’t all (or nearly all) fit into the memory and that you must therefore create a reasonable number of disk accesses (read, or, even worse… write! [sent-55, score-0.437]
</p><p>10 Don’t underestimate the importance of the functional analysis of the data that you will put in the NoSQL database either. [sent-79, score-0.246]
</p><p>11 A cache will always be useful, no matter what type of database you’re using (SQL or NoSQL) and will always be used in the case of data accessed essentially in read. [sent-103, score-0.274]
</p><p>12 NoSQL databases often work in memory and even offer full memory modes (like a cache but without TTL and with the possibility of replication on a slave which writes to disk). [sent-104, score-0.314]
</p><p>13 However, even with a cache that is sufficiently dimensioned, the requests still cost them processing time (CPU), bandwith, etc. [sent-106, score-0.246]
</p><p>14 The purpose of a pure cache (with TTL hit management) in front will be to relieve the database, no matter which kind, of the burden of any read possible, in order to let it concentrate on the write requests or sending back the more dynamic/volatile data in read. [sent-107, score-0.426]
</p><p>15 So, a cache can be placed equally in front of an SQL or a NoSQL base in order to economize resources. [sent-108, score-0.256]
</p><p>16 As soon as disk accesses become necessary, whether because the dataset in read does not fit in memory or because there is a high number of writes, performance will be poorer, and a bottleneck will occur at the OS/hardware level via the  disk IOs . [sent-115, score-0.242]
</p><p>17 Don’t underestimate the importance of the  functional specifications  of the data that you will load into the NoSQL database, either. [sent-117, score-0.254]
</p><p>18 In the  HandlerSocket   example, the point is above all to unify the data cache   in a single location  (the InnoDB buffer pool) in order to ensure the      consistency of the data without necessarily compromising on the performance provided by a Memcached. [sent-122, score-0.332]
</p><p>19 There is an  interesting variety of   NoSQL databases  with      specific functionalities, but be careful: having extra functionalities means less efficient response times than with the standard key-value(s). [sent-123, score-0.222]
</p><p>20 Take for example the API « Table » of Tokyo Cabinet, which enables management of conditional requests, or even the geospatial functionalities of MongoDB. [sent-124, score-0.41]

How do you scale an  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure? This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can use to make the most of Amazon’s dynamic approach, and the architectural model you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.
 
I base my report on my experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming (Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS (Geographic Information System). It’s true that my experience in gaming ( IsCool, The Game ) is currently the most representative in terms of scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU – daily active users – at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability and da</p><p>3 0.28083515 <a title="961-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors, attended the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto  NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid, InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came from the audience, which was refreshing. 
 
Overall a genial evening with some good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at giving a wide ra</p><p>5 0.25097057 <a title="961-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-09-10_NoSQL_Systems_Reviewed.html">739 high scalability-2009-11-09-10 NoSQL Systems Reviewed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Ellis  reviews in the  NoSQL Ecosystem  the origin of the NoSQL movement and 10 different NoSQL products and how their 1) support for multiple datacenters,  2) the ability to add new machines to a live cluster transparently to the your applications, 3) Data Model, 4) Query API, 5) Persistence Design. The 10 systems reviewed are: Cassandra, CouchDB, HBase, MongoDB, Neo4J, Redis, Riak, Scalaris, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort.
 
A very thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of approaches to not being a relational database.

<p>Introduction: I’ve largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the “NoSQL vs. Relational” conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to build in, I’d like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint. In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I’ve inadvertently given myself plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches, and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say with a fair amount of certainty, that I’ve found a good compromise.

Learn How to Read-write Scale Without a Complete Re-write</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lately I've been reading more cases were different people have started to realize the limitations of the NoSQL promise to database scalability. Note the references below:
     
  Why does Quora use MySQL as the data store instead of NoSQLs such as Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB etc?  
  Why did Diaspora abandon MongoDB for MySQL?  
  How scalable is CouchDB in practice, not just in theory?  
   

Take MongoDB for example. It's damn fast, but it doesn't really know how to save data reliably to disk. I've had it set up in a replica pair to mitigate that risk. Guess what - both servers in the pair failed and corrupted their data files at the same day.

  
It appears that for many, the switch to NoSQL can be rather painful. IMO that doesn't necessarily mean that NoSQL is wrong in general, but it's a combination of 1) lack of maturity 2) not the right tool for the job.
 
That brings the question of what's the alternative solution?

<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of  many of the scalability issues that we face today with traditional  database approach.
 
I think that the main reason so many people  have come to see SQL as the source of all evil is the fact that,  traditionally, the query language was burned into the database  implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to the  traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.
 
This view has  brought on a flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a  different aspect that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach,  such as a document model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as  Key/Value query.
 
Most of the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject,  and tend to use query semantics and architecture interchangeably. In  Part I  of this post i tried to provide quick overview of what  each query term stands for in the context of the NoSQL world .  Part II  illustrates those ide</p><p>6 0.79539925 <a title="961-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by     Frédéric Faure      (architect at    Ysance   ), you can follow him on    twitter   .  
 
Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it’s true that the marketing wave of NoSQL has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that’s been around for quite a while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all, everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very p</p><p>2 0.95646733 <a title="961-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-18-How_to_get_started_with_sizing_and_capacity_planning%2C_assuming_you_don%27t_know_the_software_behavior%3F.html">1566 high scalability-2013-12-18-How to get started with sizing and capacity planning, assuming you don't know the software behavior?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here's a common situation and question from the  mechanical-sympathy  Google group by Avinash Agrawal on the black art of capacity planning:
  

How to get started with sizing and capacity planning, assuming we don't know the software behavior and its completely new product to deal with?

  
 Gil Tene , Vice President of Technology and CTO & Co-Founder, wrote a very  understandable and useful answer  that is worth highlighting:
  

Start with requirements. I see way too many "capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.


There are two key sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:


In the "How Much" part, you need to establish, based on expected business needs, Numbers for things (like connections, users, streams, transactions or messages per second) that you expect to interact with at the peak t</p><p>3 0.95000666 <a title="961-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-03-Stack_Overflow_Architecture_Update_-_Now_at_95_Million_Page_Views_a_Month.html">998 high scalability-2011-03-03-Stack Overflow Architecture Update - Now at 95 Million Page Views a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the  Stack Overflow Architecture . Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up and out in the last few years.
 
Stack Overflow has grown up by more then doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  
 
Stack Overflow has grown out by expanding into the  Stack Exchange Network , which includes Stack Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.
 
What hasn't changed is Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been handling their growth:  Stack Exchange’s Architecture in Bullet Points ,  Stack Overflow’s New York Data Center ,  Designing For Scalability of Manageme</p><p>4 0.94989181 <a title="961-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-14-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_14th%2C_2014.html">1596 high scalability-2014-02-14-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 14th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the

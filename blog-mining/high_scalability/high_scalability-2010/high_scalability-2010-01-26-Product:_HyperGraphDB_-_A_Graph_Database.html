<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>5 0.16182899 <a title="766-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-06-Graph_server.html">621 high scalability-2009-06-06-Graph server</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all
programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.Then you may observe after
coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form
of interacting patterns of flows.Then you may think hey, a program isn't only
useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and
that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over
data and flow over other flows.That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making
available in the Graph extension to their plumbing package (code examples),
which is described in an excellent post:Graph: Abstractions for Structured
Computation.You may remember Prismatic from previous profile we did on

<p>Introduction: GraphChiuses aParallel Sliding Windowsmethod which can: process a graph with
mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-
sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of
computation.The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on
just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar
toPregel, which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style
of MapReduce. Streaming graph updates are supported.About GraphChi, Carlos
Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,says:A Mac Mini running
GraphChi can analyze Twitter's social graph from 2010--which contains 40
million users and 1.2 billion connections--in 59 minutes. "The previous

Theorem: A Proposed Theorem for the Trade-offs in Horizontally Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Successful software design is all about trade-offs. In the typical (if there
is such a thing) distributed system, recognizing the importance of trade-offs
within the design of your architecture is integral to the success of your
system. Despite this reality, I see time and time again, developers choosing a
particular solution based on an ill-placed belief in their solution as a
“silver bullet”, or a solution that conquers all, despite the inevitable
occurrence of changing requirements. Regardless of the reasons behind this
phenomenon, I’d like to outline a few of the methods I use to ensure that I’m
making good scalable decisions without losing sight of the trade-offs that
accompany them. I’d also like to compile (pun intended) the issues at hand, by
formulating a simple theorem that we can use to describe this oft occurring
situation.</p><p>2 0.90935284 <a title="766-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-17-Steve_Ballmer_Says_Microsoft_has_Over_1_Million_Servers_-_What_Does_that_Really_Mean%3F.html">1493 high scalability-2013-07-17-Steve Ballmer Says Microsoft has Over 1 Million Servers - What Does that Really Mean?</a></p>

his calculations are eye popping:Facilities: 15 to 30 large datacentersCapital
expense: $4.25 BillionTotal power: 300MWPower Consumption: 2.6TWh annuallyThe

<p>Introduction: In It's Time for Low Latency  Stephen Rumble et al. explore the idea that it's
time to rearchitect our stack to live in the modern era of low-latency
datacenter instead of high-latency WANs. The implications for
programarchitectures will be revolutionary.  Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished
Engineer at Google, sees ultra low latency as a way to make computer
resources, to be as much as possible, fungible, that is they are
interchangeable and location independent, effectively turning a datacenter
into single computer. Abstract from the paper:The operating systems community
has ignored network latency for too long. In the past, speed-of-light delays
in wide area networks and unoptimized network hardware have made sub-100µs
round-trip times impossible. However, in the next few years datacenters will
be deployed with low-latency Ethernet. Without the burden of propagation
delays in the datacenter campus and network delays in the Ethernet devices, it
will be up to us to ﬁnish the job and see</p><p>4 0.87450773 <a title="766-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex_Architecture.html">258 high scalability-2008-02-24-Yandex Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Anatomy of a crash in a new part of Yandex written in Django. Writing
to a magic session variable caused an unexpected write into an InnoDB database
on every request. Writes took 6-7 seconds because of index rebuilding. Lots of
useful details on the sizing of their system, what went wrong, and how they
fixed it.Yandex is a Russian search engine with 3.5 billion pages in their
search index. We only know a few fun facts about how they do things, nothing
at a detailed architecture level. Hopefully we'll learn more later, but I
thought it would still be interesting. From Allen Stern's interview with
Yandex's CTO Ilya Segalovich, we learn:3.5 billion pages in the search
index.Over several thousand servers.35 million searches a day.Several data
centers around Russia.Two-layer architecture.The database is split in pieces
and when a search is requested, it pulls the bits from the different database
servers and brings it together for the user.Languages used: c++, perl, some
java.FreeBSD</p><p>same-blog 5 0.85454929 <a title="766-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-26-Product%3A_HyperGraphDB_-_A_Graph_Database.html">766 high scalability-2010-01-26-Product: HyperGraphDB - A Graph Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the success ofNeo4jas a graph database in the NoSQL revolution, it's
interesting to see another graph database,HyperGraphDB, in the mix. Their
quick blurb on HyperGraphDB says it is a:general purpose, extensible,
portable, distributed, embeddable, open-source data storage mechanism. It is a
graph database designed specifically for artificial intelligence and semantic
web projects, it can also be used as an embedded object-oriented database for
projects of all sizes.From theNoSQL Archivethe summary on HyperGraphDB is:
API:Java(and Java Langs), Written in:Java,  Query Method:Javaor P2P,
Replication:P2P, Concurrency:STM, Misc: Open-Source, Especially for AI and
Semantic Web.So it has some interesting features, like software transactional
memory andP2P  for data distribution, but I found that my first and most
obvious question was not answered: what the heck is ahypergraphand why do I
care? Buried in the tutorial was:A HyperGraphDB database is a generalized
graph of entities. The gene</p><p>6 0.84202611 <a title="766-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_17%2C_2012.html">1195 high scalability-2012-02-17-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 17, 2012</a></p>

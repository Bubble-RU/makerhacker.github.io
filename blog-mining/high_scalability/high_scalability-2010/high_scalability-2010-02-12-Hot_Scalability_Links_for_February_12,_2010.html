a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. --
CorinthiansWith this new pricing, developments will be driven by the costs.I
like to optimize my apps to make them better or faster, but to optimize them
just to make them cheaper is a waste of time.-- Sylvain onGoogle GroupsThe
dream is dead. Google App Engine's boldpay for what you usedream dies as it
leaves childish things behind and becomes areal product.Pricing will change.
Architectures will change. Customers will change. Hearts and minds will
change. But Google App Engine will survive. Google isshutting downmany of
itsprojects. GAE is not among them. Do we have GAE's pricing change to thank
for it surving the more wood behindmore deadly arrows push? Without a radical
and quick shift towards profitably GAE would no doubt be a historical footnote

next time. Also added a few new design rules from the post.Update: Added a few

<p>Introduction: We can all learn from problems. The Google App Engine team has created a
teachable moment through a remarkably honest and forthcomingpost-mortem for
February 24th, 2010 outagepost, chronicling in elaborate detail a power outage
that took down Google App Engine for a few hours.The world is ending! The
cloud is unreliable! Jump ship! Not. This is not evidence that the cloud is a
beautiful, powerful and unsinkable ship that goes down on its maiden voyage.
Stuff happens, no matter how well you prepare. If you think private
datacenters don't go down, well, then I have some rearangeable deck chairs to
sell you. The goal is to keep improving and minimizing those failure windows.
From that perspective there is a lot to learn from the problems the Google App
Engine team encountered and how they plan to fix them.Please read the article
for all the juicy details, but here's what struck me as key:Power fails. Plan
for it. This seems to happen with unexpected frequency for such expensive and

<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling
65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate
problemBuddyPokeco-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution
at Wednesday'sFacebook Meetup. Slides for the complete talk arehere. For those
not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets
users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line
avatars.In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application.
It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play
mechanics, viral loops, and creative monetization strategies are all part of
if its everyday conceptualization. It mashes together different technologies,
not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way, but in a smart way that gets the
most bang for the buck. Part of it runs on Facebook servers (free). Part of it
runs on flash in a browser (free). Part of it runs on a storage cloud (higher
cost)</p><p>5 0.73351192 <a title="776-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-13-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_13%2C_2011.html">1040 high scalability-2011-05-13-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 13, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am in no way a music expert, but when I listen toSymphony No. 4byCharles
Ives, I imagine it's what a complex software/hardware system might sound like
if we could hear its inner workings. Ives uses a lot of riotously competing
rhythms in this work. It can sound discordant, yet the effect is deeply
layered and eventually harmonious, just like the systems we use, create, and
become part of.I was pointed to this piece by someone who said there were two
conductors. I'd never heard of such a thing! So I was intrigued. The first
version of the performance sounds and looks great, but it unfortunately does
not use two conductors. The second version uses two conductors, but is
unfortunately just a snippet.It's strikingly odd to see two conductors, but I
imagine different parts of our systems using different conductors too, running
at different rhythms, sometimes slow, sometimes fast, sometimes there are
outbursts, sometimes in vicious conflict. Yet conceptually it all stills seems
to hang tog</p><p>3 0.91675299 <a title="776-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_8th%2C_2013.html">1545 high scalability-2013-11-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 8th, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>6 0.89232332 <a title="776-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-07-What_Google_App_Engine_Price_Changes_Say_About_the_Future_of_Web_Architecture.html">1112 high scalability-2011-09-07-What Google App Engine Price Changes Say About the Future of Web Architecture</a></p>

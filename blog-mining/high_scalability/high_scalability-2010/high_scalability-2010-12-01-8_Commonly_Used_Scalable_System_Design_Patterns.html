<p>Introduction: Misco: A MapReduce Framework for Mobile Systems is a very exciting paper to me
because it's really one of the first explorations of some of the ideas in
Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the
Ambient Cloud. What they are trying to do is efficiently distribute work
across a set cellphones using a now familiar MapReduce interface. Usually we
think of MapReduce as working across large data center hosted clusters. Here,
the cluster nodes are cellphones not contained in any data center, but compute
nodes potentially distributed everywhere.I talked withAdam Dou, one of the
paper's authors, and he said they don't see cellphone clusters replacing
dedicated computer clusters, primarily because of thepower requiredfor both
network communication and the map-reduce computations. Large multi-terabyte
jobs aren't in the cards...yet. Adam estimates computationally that cellphones
are performing similarly to desktops of ten years ago. Instead, they want to

<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy thatthe best method to analyse spam is to become a
spammer, this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely
researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part
Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that
their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they
figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales
they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.Two different spam campaigns were
run on aStormbotnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-
peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide
computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit
new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to
download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the
executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon. The

<p>Introduction: From their website:Condoris a specialized workload management system for
compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor
provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme,
resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial or
parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and
where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress,
and ultimately informs the user upon completion.While providing functionality
similar to that of a more traditional batch queueing system, Condor's novel
architecture allows it to succeed in areas where traditional scheduling
systems fail. Condor can be used to manage a cluster of dedicated compute
nodes (such as a "Beowulf" cluster). In addition, unique mechanisms enable
Condor to effectively harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop
workstations. For instance, Condor can be configured to only use desktop
machines where the keyboard and mo</p><p>5 0.67033988 <a title="951-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-17-11_Uses_For_the_Humble_Presents_Queue%2C_er%2C_Message_Queue.html">1373 high scalability-2012-12-17-11 Uses For the Humble Presents Queue, er, Message Queue</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a little known fact that Santa Clause was an early queue innovator. Faced
with the problem of delivering a planet full of presents in one night, Santa,
in his hacker's workshop, created a Present Distribution System using
thousands of region based priority present queues for continuous delivery by
the Rudolphs. Rudolphs? You didn't think there was only one Rudolph did you?
Presents are delivered in parallel by a cluster of sleighs, each with
redundant reindeer in a master-master configuration. Each Rudolph is a cluster
leader and they coordinate work using an early and more magical version of the
ZooKeeper protocol.Programmers have followed Santa's lead and you can find
amessage queue in nearly every major architecture profile onHighScalability.
Historically they may have been introduced after a first generation
architecture needed to scale up from their two tier system into something a
little more capable (asynchronicity, work dispatch, load buffering, database
offloading, etc).</p><p>6 0.6529063 <a title="951-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-08-4_General_Core_Scalability_Patterns.html">897 high scalability-2010-09-08-4 General Core Scalability Patterns</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ricky HoinScalable System Design Patternshas created a great list of
scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary
of the patterns are:Load Balancer- a dispatcher determines which worker
instance will handle a request based on different policies.Scatter and Gather-
a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will
compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will
consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the
client.Result Cache- a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been
made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save
the actual execution.Shared Space- all workers monitors information from the
shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The
information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached.Pipe and
Filter- all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.MapReduce-
targets batch jobs where disk I/O is th</p><p>3 0.73107004 <a title="951-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-20-Ask_HighScalability%3A_How_do_I_organize_millions_of_images%3F.html">1268 high scalability-2012-06-20-Ask HighScalability: How do I organize millions of images?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to store millions of images?
Currently images are stored in a MS SQL database which performance wise isn't
ideal. We'd like to migrate the images over to a file system structure but I'd
assume we don't just want to dump millions of images into a single directory.
Besides having to contend with naming collisions, the windows filesystem might
not perform optimally with that many files.I'm assuming one approach may be to
assign each user a unique CSLID, create a folder based on the CSLID and then
place one users files in that particular folder. Even so, this could result in
hundreds of thousands of folders. Whats the best organizational
scheme/heirachy for doing this?</p><p>4 0.68133444 <a title="951-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-29-One_Story_of_Life_as_Told_Through_Queues.html">1556 high scalability-2013-11-29-One Story of Life as Told Through Queues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Love this little example of the human condition fromJohn Kellden viaIlya
Grigorik. This happens so often to me shopping at Costco or making lane
changes on the highway or picking stocks. Sometimes it's just never the right
line and trying to make it better only makes it worse. Stick and stay. Buy and
hold. Live to queue another day.</p><p>5 0.66119778 <a title="951-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-16-Do_you_have_any_questions_for_the_Elastra_CEO%3F.html">277 high scalability-2008-03-16-Do you have any questions for the Elastra CEO?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It looks like in the near future I'll have a chance to interview the Elastra
CEO. Elastra provides standarddatabases--MySQL, EnterpriseDB and PostgreSQL--
on top of EC2 and S3. They are selling aggressive pricing, expandable and
contactable database resource usage in response to demand, and a simple
management and operations interface to well known databases deployed in a
cloud. Elastra could be an important option for developers looking for a more
traditional cloudy database.I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions
for questions you would like answered? What would you like to know about their
service? What are you looking for in a cloudy database? What would stop you
from adopting it or what would make you decide to adopt it? Any ideas you have
would help a lot and will probably be better than anything I have.</p><p>6 0.64323711 <a title="951-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-04-IPS-IDS_for_heavy_content_site.html">238 high scalability-2008-02-04-IPS-IDS for heavy content site</a></p>

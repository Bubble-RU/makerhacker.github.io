<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>3 0.32731128 <a title="931-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL_Took_Away_the_Relational_Model_and_Gave_Nothing_Back.html">930 high scalability-2010-10-28-NoSQL Took Away the Relational Model and Gave Nothing Back</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems
to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly
increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly
using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and
gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous
information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and
ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only
SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it's true that the marketing wave of NoSQL
has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that's been around for quite a
while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all,
everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend
of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very profitable
either.So, what'</p><p>6 0.24943331 <a title="931-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-20-35%2B_Use_Cases_for_Choosing_Your_Next_NoSQL_Database.html">1064 high scalability-2011-06-20-35+ Use Cases for Choosing Your Next NoSQL Database</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the "NoSQL vs.
Relational" conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about
currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to
build in, I'd like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint.
In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I've inadvertently given myself
plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches,
and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say
with a fair amount of certainty, that I've found a good compromise. You can
read the full storehere.</p><p>4 0.88311362 <a title="931-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-16-Seven_Signs_You_May_Need_a_NoSQL_Database.html">779 high scalability-2010-02-16-Seven Signs You May Need a NoSQL Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>5 0.85634422 <a title="931-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-09-10_NoSQL_Systems_Reviewed.html">739 high scalability-2009-11-09-10 NoSQL Systems Reviewed</a></p>

<p>Introduction: CDNs (content delivery networks) are the secret shadow super powers behind the
web and Dan Rayburn atstreamingmedia.comis the go to investigative reporter
for quality information on CDNs. Every year Dan has a Content Delivery Summit
on all things CDN and those videos arenow available. Dan also gives a kind
ofstate of the industry talkwhere he does something wonderful, he gives real
numbers and prices. Dan really knows his stuff and is an excellent speaker, so
watch the video, but here's my gloss on the state of the CDN so far this
year:Massive growth. Large customers are expecting 126% growth in video
traffic over last year; medium size customers are seeing 48% traffic growth,
small sized customer are seeing 73.3% traffic growth.More traffic != More
profit. Traffic growth doesn't lead to more profit because the traffic growth
is concentrated in larger customers that can make the best deals.Video takes

<p>Introduction: Hello everyone,I'm designing a website/widget that my business partner and I
expect to serve millions of hits daily. As such we must shard our database
(and we're designing with shards in mind right from the beginning). However,
the one thing I haven't been able to figure out from Googling is the best
hardware to go with for shards. I'm using exclusively InnoDB tables.We'll
(eventually) be running 3 groups of database servers:a) Session servers for
php sessions. These will have a very high write volume.b) ID servers. These
will match a couple primary indices (such as user ID) to a given shard. These
will have an intense read load, plus a moderate amount of writes.c) Shard
servers. These will hold the bulk of the data. These will have a high read
load and a lowish write load.Group A is done as a database instead of using
memcached so users aren't logged out if a memcached server goes down. As the
write load is high, a pair of high performance master-master servers seems
obvious. What's</p><p>3 0.97034138 <a title="931-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-22-SLAs_in_the_SaaS_space.html">475 high scalability-2008-12-22-SLAs in the SaaS space</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This may be a bit higher level then the general discussion here, but I think
this is an important issue in how it relates to reliability and uptime. What
kind of SLAs should we be expecting from SaaS services and platforms (e.g.
AWS, Google App Engine, Google Premium Apps, salesforce.com, etc.)? Up to
today, most SaaS services either have no SLAs or offer very weak penalties.
What will it take to get these services up to the point where they can offer
the SLAs that users (and more importantly, businesses) require? I presume most
of the members here want to see more movement into the cloud and to SaaS
services, and I'm thinking that until we see more substantial SLA guarantees,
most businesses will continue to shy away as long as they can.Would love to
hear what others think. Or am I totally off base?</p><p>same-blog 4 0.97005934 <a title="931-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at
giving a wide range o</p><p>5 0.96974277 <a title="931-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-28-PaaS_on_OpenStack_-_Run_Applications_on_Any_Cloud%2C_Any_Time_Using_Any_Thing.html">1031 high scalability-2011-04-28-PaaS on OpenStack - Run Applications on Any Cloud, Any Time Using Any Thing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday, I had a session during the OpenStack Summit where I tried to
present a more general view on how we should be thinking about PaaS in the
context of OpenStack.The key takeaway :The main goal of PaaS is to drive
productivity into the process by which we can deliver new applications.Most of
the existing PaaS solutions take a fairly extreme approach with their
abstraction of the underlying infrastructure and therefore fit a fairly small
number of extremely simple applications and thus miss the real promise of
PaaS.Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk took a more bottom up approach giving us
better set of tradeoffs between the abstraction and control which makes it
more broadly applicable to a larger set of applications.The fact that
OpenStack is opensource allows us to think differently on the things we can do
at the platform layer. We can create a tighter integration between the PaaS
and IaaS layers and thus come up with better set of tradeoffs into the way we
drive productivity without g</p><p>6 0.96817029 <a title="931-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-10-ElasticSearch_-_Open_Source%2C_Distributed%2C_RESTful_Search_Engine.html">775 high scalability-2010-02-10-ElasticSearch - Open Source, Distributed, RESTful Search Engine</a></p>

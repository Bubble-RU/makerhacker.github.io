<p>Introduction: In many of the recent discussions on the design of large scale systems (a.k.a.
Web Scale) it was argued that the right set of tradeoffs for building large
scale systems would be to give away Consistency for Availability and Partition
tolerance. Those arguments relied on the foundation of the CAP theorem
developed in early 2000-2002. One of the core principals behind the CAP
theorem is that you must choose two out of the three CAP properties. In many
of the transactional systems giving away consistency is either impossible or
yields a huge complexity in the design of those systems. In this series of
posts, I've tried to suggest a different set of tradeoffs in which we could
achieve scalability without compromising on consistency. I also argued that
rather than choosing only two out of the three CAP properties we could choose
various degrees of all three. The degrees would be determined by the most
likely availability and partition tolerance scenarios in our specific
application.  The su</p><p>3 0.17245764 <a title="921-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-18-The_Missing_Piece_in_the_Virtualization_Stack_%28Part_1%29.html">762 high scalability-2010-01-18-The Missing Piece in the Virtualization Stack (Part 1)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This and the next post will discuss how virtualization and cloud computing, as
we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today's IT
inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much
simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core
inefficiencies lie. Virtualization principles must be extended to higher
levels of the application stack, to make it easier for all of us to manage,
tune and integrate applications. Otherwise we will continue to spend most of
our time on things that don't provide real value to the business.Read the full

<p>Introduction: On a cold and rainy Fall day, a day stolen from winter rather than our usual
gorgeousIndian Summers, a day not even the SF Giants winning the pennant can
help warm, here are some hot links to read by a digital flame: Using MySQL as

<p>Introduction: This article not about Mariah Carey, or its song. It's about Storing System,
Database.First let's describe what means by odds: In my social network, I
found 93% of the mainstream developers sanctify the database, or at least
consider it in any data persistence challenge as the ultimate, superhero, and
undefeatable solution.I think this problem come from the education,
personally, and some companies also I think it's involved in this.To start to
fix this bad thinking, we all should agree in the following points:Every
challenge have its own solutions, so whatever you want to save/persistent,
there are always many solutions. For example the Web search engines, such as:
Google, Kngine, Yahoo, Bing don't use database at all instead we use Indexes
(Index file) for better performance.The Database in general whatever the
vendor it's slow compared with other solutions such as: Key-Value storing
system, Index file, DHT.The Database currently employ Relation Data model, or

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be
thankful for thesongof the tinniestsparrowatsunrise, I'll save you from all
that. It's hard to tie scalability and thegiving of thankstogether, especially
as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of
time. But I think I found a sentiment in A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and
MIRACLES byJames Bridlethat manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving
thanks meaningfully together:I distrust commercial definitions of innovation,
and particularly of awesomeness. It's an overused term. When I think of
awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.So I
started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for
me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.We're not actually very good
about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use
metaphors and examples. Douglas Adams writes somewhere about how big the

<p>Introduction: We are not yet at the End of History for database theory asPeter Bailisand
theDatabase Groupat UC Berkeley continue to prove with a greatcompanion blog
post to their new paper: Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions. I
like the approach of pairing a blog post with a paper. A paper almost by
definition is formal, but a blog post can help put a paper in context and give
it some heart.From the abstract:Databases can provide scalability by
partitioning data across several servers. However, multi-partition, multi-
operation transactional access is often expensive, employing coordination-
intensive locking, validation, or scheduling mechanisms. Accordingly, many
real-world systems avoid mechanisms that provide useful semantics formulti-
partition operations. This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of
applications including secondary indexing,foreign key enforcement, and
materialized view maintenance. In this work, we identify a new isolation model

<p>Introduction: There was a bit of drama earlier when I posted a free job opening for Zynga.
It caused unfortunate and just plain wrong accusations. It also caused a
number of requests for more free job posts, which I should have anticipated,
but obviously I can't let this blog become cluttered with that kind of stuff.
Earlier I tried a job board type service, but that never really worked out. So
what to do? Someone suggested a sponsored post approach and I think that's a
good compromise. It minimizes the noise, let's people know about work, and
brings in a little revenue. It works like an advertisement. If you are
interested please let me know. When we have any job openings there will be a
sponsored post like this one, that you can easily ignore or pay attention to,
depending on your situation.Squarespace Looking for Full-time Scaling

the confusion that i often see when people associate CAP with scalability
without fully understanding the implications that comes with it and the
alternative approachesYou can read the full articlehere</p><p>2 0.64914036 <a title="921-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-29-HighScalability_Rated_%233_Blog_for_Developers.html">642 high scalability-2009-06-29-HighScalability Rated #3 Blog for Developers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey we're moving up in the world, jumping from 19th place to 3rd place. In
case you aren't sure what I'm talking about, Jurgen Appelo goes through this
massive effort ofranking blogsaccording to Google PageRank, Technorati
Authority, Alexa Rank, Google links, and Twitter Grader Rank.Through some
obviously mistaken calculations HighScalability comes out #3. Given all the
superb competition I'm not exactly sure how that can be. Well, thanks for all
the excellent people who contribute and all the even more excellent people
that read. Now at least I have something worthy to put on my tombstone :-)</p><p>3 0.51416266 <a title="921-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-01-Moving_Beyond_End-to-End_Path_Information_to_Optimize_CDN_Performance.html">712 high scalability-2009-10-01-Moving Beyond End-to-End Path Information to Optimize CDN Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,
we analyze latencies measured</p><p>4 0.46804291 <a title="921-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-15-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_Oct_15_2009_.html">722 high scalability-2009-10-15-Hot Scalability Links for Oct 15 2009 </a></p>

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

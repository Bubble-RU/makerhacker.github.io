<p>Introduction: How does Facebook handle the massive New Year's Eve traffic spike? Thanks to Mike Swift, in  Facebook gets ready for New Year's Eve , we get a little insight as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still interesting.
  Problem Setup   
 Facebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be shared on New Year's eve. 
 Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average of 130 friends. 
 Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then rendered. 
 Different events put different stresses on different parts of Facebook.       
 
 Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of capacity  
 News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve Jobs drive user status updates

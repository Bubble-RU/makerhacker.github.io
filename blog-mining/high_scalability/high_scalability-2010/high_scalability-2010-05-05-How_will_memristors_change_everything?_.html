<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>3 0.94179279 <a title="823-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-01-Squeeze_more_performance_from_Parallelism.html">735 high scalability-2009-11-01-Squeeze more performance from Parallelism</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In many posts, such as: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges I
mentioned that synchronization the access to the shared resource is the major
challenge to write parallel code.The synchronization and coordination take
long time from the overall execution time, which reduce the benefits of the
parallelism; the synchronization and coordination also reduce the
scalability.There are many forms of synchronization and coordination, such
as:Create Task object in frameworks such as: Microsoft TPL, Intel TDD, and
Parallel Runtime Library. Create and enqueue task objects require
synchronization that it's takes long time especially if we create it into
recursive work such as: Quick Sort algorithm.Synchronization the access to
shared data.But there are a few techniques to avoid these issues, such as:
Shared-Nothing, Actor Model, and Hyper Object (A.K.A. Combinable Object).
Simply if we reduce the shared data by re-architect our code this will gives
us a huge benefits in performance and s</p><p>same-blog 4 0.9324854 <a title="823-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-05-How_will_memristors_change_everything%3F_.html">823 high scalability-2010-05-05-How will memristors change everything? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: A non-random sample of my tech friends shows that not many have heard
ofmemristors(though I do suspect vote tampering). I'd read a little about
memristors in2008when the initial hubbub about the existence of memristors was
raised. I, however,  immediately filed them into that comforting conceptual
bucket of potentially revolutionary technologies I didn't have to worry about
because like most wondertech, nothing would ever come of it. Wrong. After
watchingFinding the Missing Memristorby R. Stanley Williams I've had to change
my mind. Memristors have gone from "maybe never" to holy cow this could happen
soon and it could change everything.Let's assume for the sake of dreaming
memristors do prove out. How will we design systems when we have access to a
new material that is two orders of magnitude more efficient from a power
perspective than traditional transistor technologies, contains multiple
petabits (1 petabit = 128TB) of persistent storage, and can be reconfigured to
be either memory</p><p>5 0.93024683 <a title="823-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-25-Is_NoSQL_a_Premature_Optimization_that%27s_Worse_than_Death%3F_Or_the_Lady_Gaga_of_the_Database_World%3F.html">1085 high scalability-2011-07-25-Is NoSQL a Premature Optimization that's Worse than Death?

<p>Introduction: Michael Stonebraker sure knows how to stir up a storm. Unlike for others, that
doesn't make him a troll in my mind, he'sway too accomplishedin the field to
be that, but he does have a bit of Barnum & Bailey in him, which serves to get
the discussion flowing, and that's a good thing. A lot of previously hidden
wisdom and passion unlocks, which we'll try to capture here.This disturbance
in the force is over OldSQL vs NoSQL vsNewSQL. Warning, these are not crisp
categories, there's leakage all over the place, watch your step:OldSQL
(Oracle, MySQL, etc) refers to what some want to term as legacy relational
database like MySQL, that don't scale out horizontally with aplomb.NoSQL
(CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, Riak, Neo4j, etc) refers to, well,
a collection of technologies that aren't OldSQL, these often are designed to
scale out horizontally, aren't on ACID, and use schemaless non-relational
datamodels.NewSQL  (Xeround, Clustrix, NimbusDB, GenieDB, ScaleBase, VoltDB)
are databa</p><p>6 0.92887801 <a title="823-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-12-Report_from_OpenSocial_Meetup_at_Google.html">183 high scalability-2007-12-12-Report from OpenSocial Meetup at Google</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability.

<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites tocache everything? Caching, if
not thesecret sauceof many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But
not so fast says Peter Zaitsev inBeyond great cache hit ratio. The point Peter
makes is that we read about websites likeAmazonandFacebook that can literally
make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome
cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all
those requests takes time. The solution is toremove requests all together. You
do this bycaching larger blocksso you have to make fewer requests. The post
has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small
as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control
invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>6 0.13698998 <a title="911-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-30-Better_Browser_Caching_is_More_Important_than_No_Javascript_or_Fast_Networks_for_HTTP_Performance.html">1396 high scalability-2013-01-30-Better Browser Caching is More Important than No Javascript or Fast Networks for HTTP Performance</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog
PileEffectinDog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails. Glenn
Franxman also has a Django solution inMintCache.Data is usually cached because
it's too expensive to calculate for every hit. Maybe it's a gnarly SQL query

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>3 0.9988575 <a title="911-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers
podcastShow 15 - Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls. The
conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can
be processed by a WAF (Web Application Firewall), which inspects HTTP for
security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much
was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be
necessary, but I digress.Toterminate SSLmost shops run SSL connections into
Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for
developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of
the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.Load
balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very
efficiently in hardware. Efficiently enough that if you are willing to get rid
of the general purpose Linux boxes and use your big iron load balancers, your
server count can be decreased</p><p>4 0.9987945 <a title="911-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-04-Strategy%3A_Cache_Larger_Chunks_-_Cache_Hit_Rate_is_a_Bad_Indicator.html">836 high scalability-2010-06-04-Strategy: Cache Larger Chunks - Cache Hit Rate is a Bad Indicator</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites tocache everything? Caching, if
not thesecret sauceof many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But
not so fast says Peter Zaitsev inBeyond great cache hit ratio. The point Peter
makes is that we read about websites likeAmazonandFacebook that can literally
make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome
cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all
those requests takes time. The solution is toremove requests all together. You
do this bycaching larger blocksso you have to make fewer requests. The post
has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small
as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control
invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.99878538 <a title="911-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-30-More_Troubles_with_Caching.html">911 high scalability-2010-09-30-More Troubles with Caching</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As a tasty pairing withFacebook And Site Failures Caused By Complex, Weakly
Interacting, Layered Systems, is another excellent tale of caching gone wrong
by Peter Zaitsev, in an exciting twin billing:Cache Miss Stormand More on
dangers of the caches. This is fascinating case where the cause turned out to
be software upgrade that ran long because it had to be rolled back. During the
long recovery time many of the cache entries timed out. When the database came
back, slam, all the clients queried the database to repopulate the cache and
bad things happened to the database. The solution was equally interesting: So
the immediate solution to bring the system up was surprisingly simple. We just
had to get traffic on the system in stages allowing Memcache to be warmed up.
There were no code which would allow to do it on application side so we did it
on MySQL side instead. "SET GLOBAL max_connections=20" to limit number of
connections to MySQL and so let application to err when it tries to put</p><p>6 0.99816835 <a title="911-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-03-Running_Hadoop_MapReduce_on_Amazon_EC2_and_Amazon_S3.html">56 high scalability-2007-08-03-Running Hadoop MapReduce on Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3</a></p>

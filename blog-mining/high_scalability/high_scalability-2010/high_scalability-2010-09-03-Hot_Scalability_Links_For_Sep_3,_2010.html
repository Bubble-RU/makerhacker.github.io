<p>Introduction: A non-random sample of my tech friends shows that not many have heard
ofmemristors(though I do suspect vote tampering). I'd read a little about
memristors in2008when the initial hubbub about the existence of memristors was
raised. I, however,  immediately filed them into that comforting conceptual
bucket of potentially revolutionary technologies I didn't have to worry about
because like most wondertech, nothing would ever come of it. Wrong. After
watchingFinding the Missing Memristorby R. Stanley Williams I've had to change
my mind. Memristors have gone from "maybe never" to holy cow this could happen
soon and it could change everything.Let's assume for the sake of dreaming
memristors do prove out. How will we design systems when we have access to a
new material that is two orders of magnitude more efficient from a power
perspective than traditional transistor technologies, contains multiple
petabits (1 petabit = 128TB) of persistent storage, and can be reconfigured to
be either memory</p><p>3 0.084375918 <a title="893-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-20-The_Tumblr_Architecture_Yahoo_Bought_for_a_Cool_Billion_Dollars.html">1461 high scalability-2013-05-20-The Tumblr Architecture Yahoo Bought for a Cool Billion Dollars</a></p>

recallInstagram was profiled on HighScalabilityand they were also bought by
Facebook for a ton of money. A coincidence? You be the judge.Just what is
Yahoo buying? The business acumen of the deal is not something I can judge,
but if you are doing due diligence on the technology then Tumblr would
probably get a big thumbs up. To see why, please keep on reading...With over

focus on user experience, or its friendly and engaged community, but like it

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this beautiful morning:  Group Decision
Making in Honey Bee Swarms. In distributed computing systems nodes reach
aquorum when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum
logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:
A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act
and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow
the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether
they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating
the swarm's move to this site.Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.
Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being
a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.Fire! Fire!
Brent Chapman shows how to put that IT fire out in Incident Command for IT:

<p>Introduction: Royans Tharakan is blogging like a mad man at theVelocity Conference. Read a
summary of many of the presentations on hisblog.Zuckerberg almostguarantees 1
billion Facebook users. AndI almost believe him.Northscale introducesMembase,
a new distributed key-value NoSQL competitor featuring a memcache compatible
interface, yet is persistent like a database. Hopefully we'll have more on
their internals later.Notable Tweets: Aaron Cordova - scalability means "can
change size" and also "works at large sizes" - this conflates two orthogonal
features of cloud computing. Jaime Garcia Reinoso- It's the scalability,
stupid! Alex Averbuch \- when I read/hear "unlimited/inifinite scalability" I
stop reading/listening and start thinking about cake.Dennis Clark- I used to
smirk at developers whose main DB experience was in MUMPS or Pick, until I
realized those are old-school #NoSQL engines.Hypertable vs. HBase Performance
Evaluation. Hypertable's benchmarking shows Hypertable has up to 10 times
better</p><p>6 0.69370365 <a title="893-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-06-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_6th%2C_2011.html">1036 high scalability-2011-05-06-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 6th, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yes, I just got through watching the Superbowl so chips and salsa are on my
mind and in my stomach. In recreational eating more chips requires downing
more salsa. With mulitcore chips it turns out as cores go up salsa goes down,
salsa obviously being a metaphor for speed.Sandia National Laboratories found
in their simulations:a significant increase in speed going from two to four
multicores, but an insignificant increase from four to eight multicores.
Exceeding eight multicores causes a decrease in speed. Sixteen multicores
perform barely as well as two, and after that, a steep decline is registered
as more cores are added. The problem is the lack of memory bandwidth as well
as contention between processors over the memory bus available to each
processor.The implication for those following a diagonal scaling strategy is
to work like heck to make your system fit within eight multicores. After that
you'll need to consider some sort of partitioning strategy. What's interesting

<p>Introduction: Every day brings news of either more failures of the financial systems or out-
right fraud, with the $50 billion Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme being the
latest, breaking all records. This post provide a technical overview of a
solution that was implemented for one of the largest banks in China. The
solution illustrate how one can use Excel as a front end client and at the
same time leverage cloud computing model and mapreduce as well as other
patterns to scale-out risk calculations. I'm hoping that this type of approach
will reduce the chances for seeing this type of fraud from happening in the
future.</p><p>4 0.65213192 <a title="893-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-22-Paper%3A_The_Case_for_RAMClouds%3A_Scalable_High-Performance_Storage_Entirely_in_DRAM_.html">726 high scalability-2009-10-22-Paper: The Case for RAMClouds: Scalable High-Performance Storage Entirely in DRAM </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stanford Info Lab is taking pains to document a direction we've been moving
for a while now, using RAM not just as a cache, but as the primary storage
medium. Manyquality products have built on this model. Even if the vision
isn't radical, the paper does produce a lot of data backing up the transition,
which is in itself helpful. From the The Abstract:Disk-oriented approaches to
online storage are becoming increasingly problematic: they do not scale grace-
fully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications, and improvements in
disk capacity have far out-stripped improvements in access latency and
bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called
RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems
are created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity
servers. We believe that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage
with 100-1000x the throughput of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access
latency. T</p><p>5 0.65186095 <a title="893-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-27-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_27%2C_2012.html">1182 high scalability-2012-01-27-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 27, 2012</a></p>

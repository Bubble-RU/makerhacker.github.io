<p>Introduction: Sorry, the content for this post apparently did not make the transition from
the old HighScalability website, it's all messed up, but there's still a some
useful content...EVE Onlineis "The World's Largest Game Universe", a massively
multiplayer online game (MMO) made by CCP. EVE Online's Architecture is
unusual for a MMOG because it doesn't divide the player load among different
servers or shards. Instead, the same cluster handles the entire EVE universe.
It is an interesting to compare this with theArchitecture of the Second Life
Grid. How do they manage to scale?Information SourcesEVE Insider Dev BlogEVE

<p>Introduction: "Everything in war is simple, but theďťż simplest thing is difficult." -- Carl
von ClausewitzGames are proving grounds for software architecture. They
combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost
sensitivity, and the need for profit. And when games have in-game currency,
like EVE Online has, there's money at play, so you can't just get away with a
c'est la vie attitude. Engineering must be applied. InPlanning for war: how
the EVE Online servers deal with a 3,000 person battle, we learn some
techniques EVE Online uses to handle large games:7 Sensible...Do nothing.Most
games are manageable or have spikes that quickly dissipate. Run it Hot.
There's nothing to throttle as servers run at 100%. Why waste money? Use all
your CPU.Shard it. Games are sharded by solar system and multiple solar
systems run on a node.Move it. Games are moved when a machine becomes
overloaded. Live Node Remap, where a live game is moved to a new node without
disconnecting users, is n</p><p>4 0.11784588 <a title="760-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-04-How_Facebook_Handled_the_New_Year%27s_Eve_Onslaught.html">1168 high scalability-2012-01-04-How Facebook Handled the New Year's Eve Onslaught</a></p>

as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still

shared on New Year's eve.Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the
world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average
of 130 friends.Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a
homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those
requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then
rendered.Different events put different stresses on different parts of
Facebook. Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of

<p>Introduction: Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail
system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded
architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each
with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies
(Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers . The benefit of this
approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA loadbalancing on the
perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move
accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users).
Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has
MySQL support. What we also liked about this approach was that it had no
dependency on a distributed or networked filesystem, so less chance of
corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches
capacity, we just off load users to a less used server. If any server goes
offline, it only affects the fraction of users</p><p>2 0.87559545 <a title="760-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling_IMAP_and_POP3.html">81 high scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling IMAP and POP3</a></p>

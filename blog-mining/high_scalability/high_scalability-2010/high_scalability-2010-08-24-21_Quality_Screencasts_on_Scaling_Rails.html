<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: Several months ago I attended a Joyent presentation where the spokesman hinted
that Joyent had the chops to support a one billion page per month Facebook
Ruby on Rails application. Even under a few seconds of merciless grilling he
would not give up the name of the application. Now we have the big reveal: it
was LinkedIn'sBumper Stickerapp. For those not currently sticking things on
bumps, Bumper Sticker is quite surprisingly aviral media sharing application
that allows users to express their individuality by sticking small virtual
stickers on Facebook profiles. At the time I was quite curious how Joyent's
cloud approach could be leveraged for this kind of app. Now that they've
released a few details, we get to find out.Site:

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived
processes) and why they moved toScalato program against it (high level

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>6 0.11232392 <a title="886-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-13_Screencasts_on_How_to_Scale_Rails.html">530 high scalability-2009-03-11-13 Screencasts on How to Scale Rails</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 4: Heroku versus GAE & GAE/JUpdate 3:Heroku has gone live!.
Congratulations to the team. It's difficult right now to get a feeling for the
relative cost and reliability of Heroku, but it's an impressive accomplishment
and a viable option for people looking for a delivery platform.Update 2:Heroku
Architecture. A great interactive presentation of the Heroku stack. Requests
flow into Nginx used as a HTTP Reverse Proxy. Nginx routes requests into a
Varnish based HTTP cache. Then requests are injected into an Erlang based
routing mesh that balances requests across a grid of dynos. Dynos are your
application "VMs" that implement application specific behaviors. Dynos
themselves are a stack of: POSIX, Ruby VM, App Server, Rack, Middleware,
Framework, Your App. Applications can access PostgreSQL. Memcached is used as
an application caching layer.Update: Aaron WorshamInterview with James

<p>Introduction: Advertising for the Super Bowl is bigger than the game for many viewers. So
you gotta figure advertisers are ready for the traffic bursts generated by
their expensive ads? Not exactly...Yottaareports an amazing 13 advertiser

asking viewers to vote for the ending of a commercial, but load times went to
62 seconds. SodaStream, Calvin Klein, Axe, Got Milk? The Walking Dead, many
movie sites, and many car sites, all were flagged with delay of fame
penalties.Lots of time, money, and creative energy is spent lovingly
perfecting every detail of these commercials. It won't be a surprise to any
programmer that this can't usually be said of the follow through on the
backend.So what can you do? Yottaa has some good tips and Michael Hamrah has a

<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:GlusterFSis a clustered file-system capable of
scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over
Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64
server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).Cluster file systems are still
not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain
though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of
commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.GlusterFS
achieved35 GBps read throughput. The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was
performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband
interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with
multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB
block size. GlusterFS was configured with unify translator and round-robin
scheduler.The advantage</p><p>2 0.84175372 <a title="886-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-20-Product%3A_SmartFrog_a_Distributed_Configuration_and_Deployment_Framework.html">161 high scalability-2007-11-20-Product: SmartFrog a Distributed Configuration and Deployment Framework</a></p>
<p>Introduction: FromWikipedia:SmartFrogis an open-source software framework, written in Java,
that manages the configuration, deployment and coordination of a software
system broken into components. These components may be distributed across
several network hosts. The configuration of components is described using a
domain-specific language, whose syntax resembles that of Java. It is a
prototype-based object-oriented language, and may thus be compared to Self.
The framework is used internally in a variety of HP products. Also, it is
being used by HP Labs partners like CERN.Related ArticlesDistributed Testing

scale. LiveJournal was an early player in the free blog service race and faced

<p>Introduction: f230ce3face848ff842452a614358356This a follow-up post to an earlier poston the
Scaling Rails Screencast Series byGregg Pollack, when there were only 13
screencasts, now there are 21. Eight more have been added on topics like load
testing and database scaling. This series is of surprisingly high quality.
While I didn't view every screencast, I sampled a large set and found them to
have solid content and high production values. In fact, how did they make
these things? The instructor moves around in a little box while the content
flows around him. A very cool effect. But that wouldn't matter if the content
didn't deliver, here's what's new:Episode #14 - Rack & MetalEpisode #15 - Load

Java, but in a very pragmatic way. They use servlets, an application server,
the JDK, and they do the rest themselves. They skip JSP, entity beans, and
JMS.When you need to scale putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky
strategy. Why use JSP when you can do better? When use entity beans when you
can do better? Use servlets because they are a very effective way of handling
http requests. Use Java because it is fast, runs everywhere, and has a boat
load of libraries you can use to build your build your custom system.Probably
the major reason J2EE is absentee is simply LAMP. LAMP is just so incredibly

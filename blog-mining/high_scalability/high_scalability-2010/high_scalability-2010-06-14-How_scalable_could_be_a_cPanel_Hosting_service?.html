<p>Introduction: You want to have a scalable website. You want a website which can handle
traffic spikes (think if you are getting on Digg, Slahsdot, Reddit, Techcrunch
or other very popular websites frontpage).Regular hosting companies
(especially shared hosting) can offer only so much. The servers usually get
crushed under the load in short time.But there is hope. A new breed of hosting
companies emerged recently. A new breed which can offer you the scalability
you need at a fraction of the cost.Welcome to the world of “cloud computing!”
(or “grid computing” or “utility computing”, which are terms for the same
thing).Here's a website which compiled a list of cloud computing hosting
companies (with short descriptions, prices and customer lists for each of
them).Read the entire article aboutCloud computing, grid computing, utility

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere
are several</p><p>5 0.15624461 <a title="841-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-27-Amazon_Announces_Static_IP_Addresses_and_Multiple_Datacenter_Operation.html">289 high scalability-2008-03-27-Amazon Announces Static IP Addresses and Multiple Datacenter Operation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and
single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can
finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in
an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly
DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we
don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is
addingElastic IP AddressesandAvailability Zones.Elastic IP addresses are far
better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight withJessica
Albaand they are:breakStatic IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud
computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a
particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to
explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however,
Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures
by programmatically remapping your public</p><p>6 0.15322413 <a title="841-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-26-Sponsored_Post%3A_New_Relic%2C_Digital_Ocean%2C_NetDNA%2C_Torbit%2C_Reality_Check_Network%2C_Gigaspaces%2C_AiCache%2C_Logic_Monitor%2C_AppDynamics%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEnine%2C_Site24x7.html">1272 high scalability-2012-06-26-Sponsored Post: New Relic, Digital Ocean, NetDNA, Torbit, Reality Check Network, Gigaspaces, AiCache, Logic Monitor, AppDynamics, CloudSigma, ManageEnine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Presentation from theNoSQL conference:slides,video.Update:Why you
won't be building your killer app on a distributed hash tableby Jonathan
Ellis.Why I think Cassandra is the most promising of the open-source
distributed databases --you get a relatively rich data model and a
distribution model that supports efficient range queries. These are not things
that can be grafted on top of a simpler DHT foundation, so Cassandra will be
useful for a wider variety of applications.James Hamilton has published a
thorough summary of Facebook's Cassandra, another scalable key-value store for
your perusal. It's open source and is described as a "BigTable data model
running on a Dynamo-like infrastructure." Cassandra is used in Facebook as an
email search system containing 25TB and over 100m mailboxes.Google Code for

<p>Introduction: In the past year, Intel issued a series of powerful chips under the new
Nehalem microarchitecture, with large numbers of cores and extensive memory
capacity. This new class of chips is is part of a bigger Intel initiative
referred to as Tera-Scale Computing. Cisco has released their Unified
Computing System (UCS) equipped with a unique extended memory and high speed
network within the box, which is specifically geared to take advantage of this
type of CPU architecture .This new class of hardware has the potential to
revolutionize the IT landscape as we know it.In  this post, I want to focus

thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind. Warning #2: this post is wild.Kevin KellyKevin Kelly is Senior

<p>Introduction: Every system has a limit. Although most providers of web hosting services
claim to provide "Unlimited", we all know that any web server has physical
limits which is usually hard to scale up, especially without taking the
machine offline.Most IT hosting companies use stand-alone servers to provide
website hosting. A very few use any form of HA clusters. Those web hosts that
use stand-alone servers do not feature scalability. Every time they need to
upgrade the machines they use, major changes to the systems have to be made.
Others which that do clustering are more scalable. They would add additional
servers to their systems or to remove machines from the set-ups. There are
many scenarios and different models of doing clustering. However I'm not the
one who would write about them. Plus this is not the purpose of this
article.The reason to start this article at High Scalability is to present

<p>Introduction: Update 10:The Value of CDNsby Mike Axelrod of Google. Google implements a
distributed content cache from withinlarge ISPs. This allows them to serve
content from the edge of the network and save bandwidth on the ISPs

really nice and practical tutorial of how to use CloudFront as your
CDN.breakUpdate 8:Akamai’s Services Become Affordable for Anyone! Blazing Web
Site Performance by Distribution Cloud.Distribution Cloud starts at $150 per
month for access to the best content distribution network in the world and the
leader of Content Distribution Networks.Update 7:Where Amazon’s Data Centers
Are Located,Expanding the Cloud: Amazon CloudFront.Why Amazon's CDN Offering
Is No Threat To Akamai, Limelight or CDN Pricing. Amazon has launched their

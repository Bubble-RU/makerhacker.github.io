(relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs)
on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to
represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships
are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and
relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look
at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for

<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most
of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to
the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez
introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide
web of data.Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on
the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10
billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for
applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, withthe
Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible
to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge
structure. This talk will discuss graph databases, their underlying data
model, their querying mechanisms, and the benefits of the graph data structure
for modeling and analysis.</p><p>4 0.14198607 <a title="842-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-30-Running_Large_Graph_Algorithms_-_Evaluation_of_Current_State-of-the-Art_and_Lessons_Learned.html">801 high scalability-2010-03-30-Running Large Graph Algorithms - Evaluation of Current State-of-the-Art and Lessons Learned</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>5 0.14113565 <a title="842-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-03-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_June_3%2C_2010.html">835 high scalability-2010-06-03-Hot Scalability Links for June 3, 2010</a></p>

terabytes in a petabyte, a thousand petabytes in an exabyte, a thousand
exabytes in a zettabyte, and a thousand zettabytes in a yottabyte. In other
words, a yottabyte is 1,000,000,000,000,000GB.The CMS data aggregation system.

<p>Introduction: One of the problems in building distributed systems is figuring out what the
heck is going on. Usually endless streams of log files are consulted like
ancients usingentrailsto divine the will of the Gods.To rise above these
ancient practices we must rise another level of abstraction and that's the
approach described in a Microsoft research paper: G2: A Graph Processing
System for Diagnosing Distributed Systems, which uses execution graphs that
model runtime events and their correlations in distributed systems.The problem
with these schemes is viewing applications, written by programmers in low
level code, as execution graphs. But we're heading in this direction in any
case. To program a warehouse or an internet sized computer we'll have to write
at higher levels of abstraction so code can be executed transparently at
runtime on these giant distributed computers. There are many advantages to
this approach, fault diagnosis and performance monitoring are just one of the
wins.Abstract from</p><p>3 0.74227297 <a title="842-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-14-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_May_14%2C_2010.html">827 high scalability-2010-05-14-Hot Scalability Links for May 14, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lots of good ones this week...Scalability, Availability & Stability Patterns.
Jonas Boner has 197 slides covering a very wide range of scalability topics.
One stop scalability shopping.Horizontal Scalability via Transient, Shardable,
and Share-Nothing Resources. Heroku's Adam Wiggins shares what they've learned
about scaling based on their experiences building a cloud platform and the
hundreds of apps running on it. He describes the next generation architecture
he thinks all software should follow in the future.Scalability of the Hadoop
Distributed File System. Konstantin V. Shvachko writes a great post analyzing
if thelimitations imposed on a distributed file system by the single-node
namespace server architecturecan support 100,000 clients and petabytes of
files.Cassandra by Example. Eric Evans created a nice Cassandra tutorial using
building a Twitter clone as an example. Many people want to see more data

<p>Introduction: Dryad is Microsoft's answer to Google'smap-reduce. What's the question: How do
you process really large amounts of data? My initial impression of Dryad is
it's like a giant Unix command line filter on steroids. There are lots of
inputs, outputs, tees, queues, and merge sorts all connected together by a
master exec program. What else does Dryad have to offer the scalable
infrastructure wars?Dryad models programs as the execution of a directed
acyclic graph. Each vertex is a program and edges are typed communication
channels (files, TCP pipes, and shared memory channels within a process). Map-
reduce uses a different model. It's more like a large distributed sort where
the programmer defines functions for mapping, partitioning, and reducing. Each
approach seems to borrow from the spirit of its creating organization. The
graph approach seems a bit too complicated and map-reduce seems a bit too
simple. How ironic, in the Alanis Morissette sense.Dryad is a middleware layer

<p>Introduction: You're Doing it Wrong by Poul-Henning Kamp. Don't look so guilty, he's not
talking about you know what, he's talking about writing high-performance
server programs: Not just wrong as in not perfect, but wrong as in wasting
half, or more, of your performance. What good is an O(log2(n)) algorithm if
those operations cause page faults and slow disk operations? For most relevant
datasets an O(n) or even an O(n^2) algorithm, which avoids page faults, will
run circles around it. A Microsoft Windows Azure primer: the basicsby Peter
Bright. Nice article explaining the basics of Azure and how it compares to
Google and Amazon.A call to change the name from NoSQL to Postmodern
Databases. Interesting idea, but the problem is the same one I have for
Postmodern Art, when is it? I always feel like I'm in the post-post modern
period, yet for art it's really in the early 1900s. Let's save future
developers from this existential time crisis.Constructions from Dots and

<p>Introduction: Why is there something rather than nothing? That's the kind of question
theLarge Hadron Colliderin CERN is hopefully poised to answer. And what is the
output of this beautiful 17-mile long,6 billion dollar wabi-sabishproton
smashing machine? Data. Great heaping torrents of Grand Canyon sized data. 15
million gigabytes every year. That's 1000 times the information printed in
books every year. It's so much data 10,000 scientists will use agridof80,000+
computers, in 300 computer centers , in 50 different countries just to help
make sense of it all.How will all this data be collected, transported, stored,
and analyzed? It turns out, using what amounts to sort of Internet of
Particles instead of an Internet of Things.Two good articles have recently
shed some electro-magnetic energy in the human visible spectrum on the IT
aspects of the collider:LHC computing grid pushes petabytes of data, beats

<p>Introduction: If like many humans you've found evenPaxos Made Simplea bit difficult to
understand, you might enjoy RAFT as described inIn Search of an Understandable
Consensus Algorithm by Stanford'sDiego Ongaroand John Ousterhout. The video
presentation of the paper is given byJohn Ousterhout. Both the paper and the
video are delightfully accessible.mcherm has a good summary of the paper:A
consensus algorithm is: a cluster of servers should record a series of records
("log entries") in response to requests from clients of the cluster. (It may
also take action based on those entries.) It does so in a way that guarantees
that the responses seen by clients of the cluster will be consistent EVEN in
the face of servers crashing in unpredictable ways (but not loosing data that
was synched to disk), and networks introducing unpredictable delays or
communication blockages.Here's what Raft does. First, it elects a leader, then
the leader records the master version of the log, telling other cluster
servers w</p><p>5 0.81458253 <a title="842-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-08-Servers_Component_-_How_to_choice_and_build_perfect_server.html">653 high scalability-2009-07-08-Servers Component - How to choice and build perfect server</a></p>

[sent-2, score-0.772]
</p><p>2 From that perspective there is a lot to learn from the problems the Google App Engine team encountered and how they plan to fix them. [sent-11, score-0.382]
</p><p>3 This seems to happen with unexpected frequency for such expensive and well tended systems. [sent-14, score-0.311]
</p><p>4 The point here is to consider how a complex distributed system responds to power failures, not dissecting the merits of various diesel powered backup systems. [sent-15, score-0.314]
</p><p>5 It's quite common when disaster planning to assume single independent failures when creating scenarios of doom. [sent-18, score-0.319]
</p><p>6 Developers can be responsible for dealing with problems or a separate op team can be responsible. [sent-28, score-0.439]
</p><p>7 GAE apparently uses a separate ops team, which is nice because it means no beepers for developers. [sent-29, score-0.348]
</p><p>8 When a separate ops team is involved it requires a very complicated set of procedures be put in place so people who know nothing about the software can manage it. [sent-31, score-0.689]
</p><p>9 This process broke down and the ops team didn't know what to do when unexpected problems arose. [sent-33, score-0.693]
</p><p>10 When you read it took 2 hours to reach  "An engineer with familiarity with the unplanned failover procedure" , that's not good. [sent-34, score-0.225]
</p><p>11 Software evolves like 10 times faster than ops interactions, so something was left undone. [sent-36, score-0.334]
</p><p>12 Software releases need to become much more structured in their handoffs to the ops team so that these problems have less of a chance of happening. [sent-37, score-0.638]
</p><p>13 Soldiers endlessly drill precisely so they can deal with emergency situations without thinking. [sent-40, score-0.21]
</p><p>14 Weren't there higher level alarms indicating which systems were failing? [sent-45, score-0.231]
</p><p>15 There's a line of thought that says you can assume partitioning can never happen in a datacenter. [sent-49, score-0.223]
</p><p>16 The network infrastructure should just work and you can assume all or nothing reliability. [sent-50, score-0.215]
</p><p>17 Not all of their machines failed which must have confused the failure detection and failover systems. [sent-52, score-0.265]
</p><p>18 Failover is an all or nothing situation, which makes the failover systems a single point of failure. [sent-55, score-0.242]
</p><p>19 Failing over smaller units of services can be rmore obust, but also has more failure scenarios involved. [sent-56, score-0.198]
</p><p>20 GAE has chosen to take the high road and be honest and forthcoming with the problems they've had and how they plan to fix them. [sent-61, score-0.616]

<p>Introduction: Khan Academy   is a non profit company started by  Salman Khan  with the Big Hairy Audacious Goal of providing a free, world class education to anyone, anywhere, anytime. That’s a lot of knowledge. Having long been inspired and captivated by the Khan Academy, I was really curious to know how they plan to do it.   Ben Kamens  , lead developer at Khan Academy, gives the somewhat surprising answer in an interview:  How to Scale your Startup to Millions of Users .
  The  short answer : develop a strong team, focus on features, let   Google App Engine   do the heavy lifting.
   Some people seem to be turned off by all the GAE love in the interview. Part of it is that the interviewer is Fred Sauer, Developer Advocate for Google App Engine, so there’s a level of familiarity between the two. But the biggest part is simply that they really like GAE, for all the reasons your are supposed to like GAE. And that’s OK. In this day and age you are free to love whichever platform you choose.

<p>Introduction: Using this strategy, Valyala, a commenter on  Are Long VM Instance Spin-Up Times In The Cloud Costing You Money? , was able to reduce their GAE application start-up times from 15 seconds down to to 1.5 seconds:
  

Spin-up time for newly added Google AppEngine instances can be reduced using initial state caching. Usually the majority of spin-up time for the newly created GAE instance is spent in the pre-populating of the initial state, which is created from many data pieces loaded from slow data sources such as GAE's datastore. If the initial state is identical among GAE instances, then the entire state can be serialized and stored in a shared memory (either in the memcache or in the datastore) by the first created instance, so newly created instances could load and quickly unserialize the state from a single blob loaded from shared memory instead of spending a lot of time for creation of the state from multiple data pieces loaded from the datastore.

<p>Introduction: With the  Google IO Developer Conference  completed there are  dozens and dozens  of information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos available so quickly after the conference. 
 
Let's say you don't want to watch all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:
  
  App Engine Backends  by Justin Haugh, Greg Darke. One of this biggest complaints about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new Backend node. 
  Scaling App Engine Applications  by Justin Haugh, Guido van Rossum. Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000 queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides w</p><p>6 0.69094062 <a title="789-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-22-How_BuddyPoke_Scales_on_Facebook_Using_Google_App_Engine.html">763 high scalability-2010-01-22-How BuddyPoke Scales on Facebook Using Google App Engine</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We can all learn from problems. The Google App Engine team has created a teachable moment through a remarkably honest and forthcoming  post-mortem for February 24th, 2010 outage  post, chronicling in elaborate detail a power outage that took down Google App Engine for a few hours.
 
The world is ending! The cloud is unreliable! Jump ship! Not. This is not evidence that the cloud is a beautiful, powerful and unsinkable ship that goes down on its maiden voyage. Stuff happens, no matter how well you prepare. If you think private datacenters don't go down, well, then I have some rearangeable deck chairs to sell you. The goal is to keep improving and minimizing those failure windows. From that perspective there is a lot to learn from the problems the Google App Engine team encountered and how they plan to fix them.
 
Please read the article for all the juicy details, but here's what struck me as key:

<p>Introduction: Being an authentic human being is difficult and apparently authenticating all those S3 requests can be a bit overwhelming as well. Amazon fingered a lot of processor heavy authentication requests as the reason for their downtime:        Early this morning, at 3:30am PST, we started seeing elevated levels of authenticated requests from multiple users in one of our locations.  While we carefully monitor our overall request volumes and these remained within normal ranges, we had not been monitoring the proportion of authenticated requests.  Importantly, these cryptographic requests consume more resources per call than other request types.  Shortly before 4:00am PST, we began to see several other users significantly increase their volume of authenticated calls.  The last of these pushed the authentication service over its maximum capacity before we could complete putting new capacity in place.  In addition to processing authenticated requests, the authentication service also performs accou</p><p>5 0.92543894 <a title="789-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_3rd%2C_2014.html">1572 high scalability-2014-01-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 3rd, 2014</a></p>

  Seymour Cray : A supercomputer is a device for turning compute-bound problems into IO-bound problems. 
  Robert Sapolsky : And why is self-organization so beautiful to my atheistic self? Because if complex, adaptive systems don’t require a blue print, they don’t require a blue print maker. If they don’t require lightning bolts, they don’t require Someone hurtling lightning bolts. 
  @swardley : Asked for a history of PaaS? From memory, public launch - Zimki ('06), BungeeLabs ('06), Heroku ('07), GAE ('08), CloudFoundry ('11) ...

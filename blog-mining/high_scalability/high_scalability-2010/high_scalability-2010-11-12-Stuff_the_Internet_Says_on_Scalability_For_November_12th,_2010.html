<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at
giving a wide range o</p><p>3 0.12367032 <a title="940-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>4 0.10962051 <a title="940-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_4%2C_2011.html">1137 high scalability-2011-11-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 4, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: So much good stuff this week...Adrian Cockcroft Compares NoSQL Availability
Models. Let's risk feeding the CAP trolls, and try to get some insight into
the differences between the many NoSQL contenders. Adrian asks how each NoSQL
product will add a movie to its favorites list, read it back, and how this
works across availability zones. Much trickier than it sounds with multiple
writers. Cassandra and MongoDB answer back.Stuff the Internet Says:@jerng:
Reading up on scalability. WHY THE HELL FOR? Because I want to know the
future.@freerangedata: The #nosql options are the micro brews/craft beers of
data stores. So many good ones, so little time to try them
all.@edward_ribeiro: Soon, Darwinism will start to play its role on #NoSQL
systems. You know, only the fittest will survive.@connectionreq: I'm always

<p>Introduction: Update: Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was
wrong about what he meant. His real point:The meaning of the statement was
that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a
standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a
high priority task for them.At the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto, an audience
member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really
interesting:NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.The
idea being that NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance,
etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its
name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships.
With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to
implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed
usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it's not
about data.My</p><p>4 0.7630074 <a title="940-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-18-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_18%2C_2011.html">1007 high scalability-2011-03-18-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 18, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi...I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am
building it! So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking,
architecture planning, everything. I haven't even gotten into the legal
aspects yet.......It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to
handle that end of the operation. I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at
Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best. I'd like to FIND that very best
person available, to handle the technical aspects. For worse or better, I
don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.I've posted a bazillion ads
on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses. I've put out feelers
among my own network, same result. Not sure what else I can do. Shoestring
budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning. That can actually be a plus, as
it forces people to focus.Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the
right person?ThanksJason</p><p>2 0.87591749 <a title="940-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Hypertable_is_a_New_BigTable_Clone_that_Runs_on_HDFS_or_KFS.html">647 high scalability-2009-07-02-Hypertable is a New BigTable Clone that Runs on HDFS or KFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3: Presentation from theNoSQL conference:slides,video 1,video 2.Update
2: The folks at Hypertable would like you to know that Hypertable is now
officiallysponsored by Baidu, China's Leading Search Engine.As a sponsor of
Hypertable, Baidu has committed an industrious team of engineers, numerous
servers, and support resources to improve the quality and development of the
open source technology.Update: InfoQ interview onHypertable Lead Discusses
Hadoop and Distributed Databases. Hypertable differs from HBase in that it is
a higher performance implementation of Bigtable.Skrentabloggives the heads up
onHypertable,Zvents'open-source BigTable clone. It's written in C++ and can
run on top of either HDFS or KFS. Performance looks encouraging at28M rows of
data inserted at a per-node write rate of 7mb/sec.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.85990512 <a title="940-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff_the_Internet_Says_on_Scalability_For_November_12th%2C_2010.html">940 high scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff the Internet Says on Scalability For November 12th, 2010</a></p>

summary by Krishna Sankar of a version of Jeff Dean's classic talk onGoogle

just 100 servers to work together for the first time is so ridiculously

Yahoo's CTOThe Economics of the Cloud: Dissecting a Must-Read White Paperby
Bernard Golden. I love the depiction of the unseen and unfelt forces that
nevertheless organize everything around them: After a brief introduction, the
authors lay out a central thesis: despite initial concerns about shortcomings
in new technology offerings, "historically, underlying economics have a much
stronger impact on the direction and speed of disruptions, as technological
challenges are resolved or overcome through the rapid innovation we've grown

<p>Introduction: This is aguest repost bySriram Devadas, Engineer at Vistaprint, Web platform
group. A fun and well written analogy of how to scale web applications using a
familiar coffee shop as an example. No coffee was harmed during the making of
this post.I own a small coffee shop.My expense is proportional to resources100
square feet of built up area with utilities, 1 barista, 1 cup coffee maker.My
shop's capacityServes 1 customer at a time, takes 3 minutes to brew a cup of
coffee, a total of 5 minutes to serve a customer.Since my barista works
without breaks and the German made coffee maker never breaks down,my shop's
maximum throughput = 12 customers per hour. Web serverCustomers walk away
during peak hours. We only serve one customer at a time. There is no space to
wait.I upgrade shop. My new setup is better!ExpensesSame area and utilities, 3
baristas, 2 cup coffee maker, 2 chairsCapacity3 minutes to brew 2 cups of
coffee, ~7 minutes to serve 3 concurrent customers, 2 additional customers can</p><p>5 0.84666985 <a title="940-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-17-Database_People_Hating_on_MapReduce.html">216 high scalability-2008-01-17-Database People Hating on MapReduce</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Typical Programmer tackles the technical issues in Relational
DatabaseExperts Jump The MapReduce Shark. The culture clash is still what
fascinates me.David DeWitt writes in the Database Column that MapReduce is a
major step backwards:A giant step backward in the programming paradigm for
large-scale data intensive applicationsA sub-optimal implementation, in that
it uses brute force instead of indexingNot novel at all -- it represents a
specific implementation of well known techniques developed nearly 25 years
agoMissing most of the features that are routinely included in current
DBMSIncompatible with all of the tools DBMS users have come to depend
onListening to databasers and map reducers talk is like eavesdropping on your
average family holiday mashup. Every holiday people who have virtually nothing
in common are thrown together because they incidentally share a little DNA or
are married to the shared DNA. In desperation everyone gravitates to some

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: The transport-level server load balancing architectures described inthe first
half of this articleare more than adequate for many Web sites, but more
complex and dynamic sites can't depend on them. Applications that rely on
cache or session data must be able to handle a sequence of requests from the
same client accurately and efficiently, without failing. In this follow up to
his introduction to server load balancing, Gregor Roth discusses various
application-level load balancing architectures, helping you decide which one
will best meet the business requirements of your Web site.The first half of
this articledescribes transport-level server load balancing solutions, such as
TCP/IP-based load balancers, and analyzes their benefits and disadvantages.
Load balancing on the TCP/IP level spreads incoming TCP connections over the
real servers in a server farm. It is sufficient in most cases, especially for
static Web sites. However, support for dynamic Web sites often requires

<p>Introduction: Simone Brunozzi, technology evangelist for Amazon Web Services in Europe,
describes how Soocial.com was fully ported to Amazon web services.
----------------This period of the year I decided to dedicate some time to
better understand how our customers use AWS, therefore I spent some online
time with Stefan Fountain and the nice guys at Soocial.com, a "one address
book solution to contact management", and I would like to share with you some
details of their IT infrastructure, which now runs 100% on Amazon Web
Services!In the last few months, they've been working hard to cope with tens
of thousands of users and to get ready to easily scale to millions. To make
this possible, they decided to move ALL their architecture to Amazon Web
Services. Despite the fact that they were quite happy with their previous
hosting provider, Amazon proved to be the way to go.-----------------Read the

<p>Introduction: Scalris a fully redundant, self-curing and self-scaling hosting environment
utilizing Amazon's EC2. It has been recently open sourced on Google Code.Scalr
allows you to create server farms through a web-based interface using prebuilt
AMI's for load balancers (pound or nginx), app servers (apache, others),
databases (mysql master-slave, others), and a generic AMI to build on top
of.Scalr promises automatic high-availability and scaling for developers by
health and load monitoring.The health of the farm is continuously monitored
and maintained. When the Load Average on a type of node goes above a
configurable threshold a new node is inserted into the farm to spread the load
and the cluster is reconfigured. When a node crashes a new machine of that
type is inserted into the farm to replace it.break4 AMI's are provided for
load balancers, mysql databases, application servers, and a generic base image
to customize. Scalr allows you to further customize each image, bundle the
image and use t</p><p>5 0.7201466 <a title="824-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-01-On-Demand_Infinitely_Scalable_Database_Seed_the_Amazon_EC2_Cloud.html">79 high scalability-2007-09-01-On-Demand Infinitely Scalable Database Seed the Amazon EC2 Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon's EC2 sounds good, but how do you make use of all that throbbing CPU
power? A few companies are stepping up to fill the how-to gap.Elastraprovides
unlimited on-demand creation of MySQL and PostgresSQL instances for
$.50/server/hour. They contend their clusters perform "nearly" as well as a
local database deployed using local storage.RightScalesays they "enable you to
run your entire web business on Amazon Web Services with reliability,
scalability and performance â&euro;&ldquo; and pushbutton control of complex system
administration tasks." This includes web servers, DNS, and MySQL services.
Prices start at $500 a month.Later I'll write more about these and other
related services like3tera, but these services are the canary in the coal
mine, the face of change, the bellwether of the new data center. How we build
scalable web sites is about to change.</p><p>6 0.70815337 <a title="824-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-An_Open_Source_Web_Solution_-_Lighttpd_Web_Server_and_Chip_Multithreading_Technology__.html">452 high scalability-2008-12-01-An Open Source Web Solution - Lighttpd Web Server and Chip Multithreading Technology  </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sun FireTM X4540 Server as Backup Server for Zmanda's Amanda Enterprise 2.6
Softwareby Thomas Hanvey (Sun Microsystems) and Dmitri Joukovski and Ken
Crandall (Zmanda)September, 2008Explosive data growth, combined with demanding
requirements for data availability, has placed a tremendous burden on IT
operations staff at businesses of all sizes. Yet, many organizations do not
have the staff or budget to purchase and manage complex and expensive backup
and recovery software products.The Sun FireTM X4540 server can deliver massive
storage capacity and remarkable throughput so it is well-suited as a nearline
storage platform for backup and restore applications. Combining the power of
the SolarisTM 10 Operating System with the data integrity and simplified
administration of ZFS, the Sun Fire X4540 server can be an ideal candidate for
streamlining and improving backup and restore operations.Amanda Enterprise
Edition from Zmanda was designed to address these challenges, providing a

profiling tool and learn it in and out. Dev-ops cooperation is essential.The
most critical difference in organizations that handles crises well.Test on
production data.Code behavior (especially performance) is often data
driven.Track and trend.Understanding your historical performance
characteristics is essential for spotting emerging problems.Assumptions will
burn you.Systems are complex and often break in unexpected
ways.Decouple.Isolate performance failures.Cache.Caching is the core of most
optimizations.Federate.Data federation is taking a single data set and
spreading it across multiple database/application
servers.Replicate.Replication is making synchronized copies of data available
in more than one place.Avoid straining hard-to-scale resources.Some resources
are inherently hard to scale: Uncacheable' data, Data with a very high
read+write rate, Non-federatable data, Data in a black-boxUse a compiler

<p>Introduction: Since its inception,Amazon EC2has enabled companies to run highly scalable
infrastructure with minimal overhead.  Over the years, Amazon Web Services has
expanded with new offerings and additional regions around the world.All this
growth has made establishing a global footprint easier than ever.  And yet,
most EC2 customers still choose to operate in a single region.  While this is
fine for many applications, customers with significant web infrastructure are
depriving users of drastically improved performance.  Deploying infrastructure
in EC2's new regions cuts out one of the biggest sources of latency:
distance.Inthis post, I describe howBizosignificantly reduced load times by
implementing Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) to distribute traffic across
all Amazon regions.Click here to read more on Bizo's dev blog</p><p>4 0.81914163 <a title="824-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Paper%3A_Designing_Disaster_Tolerant_High_Availability_Clusters.html">25 high scalability-2007-07-25-Paper: Designing Disaster Tolerant High Availability Clusters</a></p>

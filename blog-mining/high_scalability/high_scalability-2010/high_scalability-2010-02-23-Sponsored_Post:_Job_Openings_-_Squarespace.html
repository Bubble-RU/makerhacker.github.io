<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting
HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting
services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary.
Thanks for the thought though.It's been a long long long process. Importing a
largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like
dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the
site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm
betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things.I'll
explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia
that needs to be handled to make the move complete:If you have a user account
and have posted on HighScalability before then you have a user account, but
since I don't know your passwords I had to make new passwords up for you. So

<p>Introduction: I first heard an enthusiastic endorsement ofSquarespacestreaming from the
ubiquitousLeo Laporteon one of his many Twit Live shows. Squarespace as afully
hosted, completely managed environment for creating and maintaining a website,
blog or portfoliowas of interest to me because they promise scalability and
this site doesn't have enough of that. But sadly, since they don't offer a
link preserving Drupal import our relationship was not meant to be.When a fine
reader of High Scalability, Brian Egge, (and all my readers are thrifty,
brave, and strong) asked me how Squarespace scaled I said I didn't know, but I
would try and find out. I emailed Squarespace a few questions and founder
Anthony Casalena and Director of Technical Operations Rolando Berrios were
kind enough to reply in some detail. The questions were both from Brian and
myself. Answers can be found below.Two things struck me most about
Squarespace's approach:They based their system on a memory grid, in this case

experience of building scalable websites into one place so you can learn how
to build your website with confidence.When it becomes clear you must grow your
website or die, most people have no idea where to start. It's not a skill you
learn in school or pick up from a magazine article on a plane flight home. No,

<p>Introduction: There was a bit of drama earlier when I posted a free job opening for Zynga.
It caused unfortunate and just plain wrong accusations. It also caused a
number of requests for more free job posts, which I should have anticipated,
but obviously I can't let this blog become cluttered with that kind of stuff.
Earlier I tried a job board type service, but that never really worked out. So
what to do? Someone suggested a sponsored post approach and I think that's a
good compromise. It minimizes the noise, let's people know about work, and
brings in a little revenue. It works like an advertisement. If you are
interested please let me know. When we have any job openings there will be a

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be
thankful for thesongof the tinniestsparrowatsunrise, I'll save you from all
that. It's hard to tie scalability and thegiving of thankstogether, especially
as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of
time. But I think I found a sentiment in A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and
MIRACLES byJames Bridlethat manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving
thanks meaningfully together:I distrust commercial definitions of innovation,
and particularly of awesomeness. It's an overused term. When I think of
awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.So I
started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for
me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.We're not actually very good
about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use
metaphors and examples. Douglas Adams writes somewhere about how big the
Hitchhiker's Guid</p><p>4 0.61546558 <a title="781-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP.html">921 high scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I fully and enthusiastically encourage anyone who wants to share a relevant
topic to register and post. People have added a lot of good and useful
content. Don't be shy. It's been asked how a teaser is created when posting so
the full article doesn't display on the front page. A teaser is a paragraph
interesting enough to convince readers to click on the "read more" link to get
the full article.breakCreating a teaser in Drupal is accomplished by inserting
< ! -- break -- > on a separate line directly after the text you want to be
the teaser. Only DO NOT include the spaces. So your post looks like:Teaser

kludgey, but it works.</p><p>6 0.57623643 <a title="781-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-15-Scaling_Ambition_at_StackOverflow.html">777 high scalability-2010-02-15-Scaling Ambition at StackOverflow</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There was a bit of drama earlier when I posted a free job opening for Zynga.
It caused unfortunate and just plain wrong accusations. It also caused a
number of requests for more free job posts, which I should have anticipated,
but obviously I can't let this blog become cluttered with that kind of stuff.
Earlier I tried a job board type service, but that never really worked out. So
what to do? Someone suggested a sponsored post approach and I think that's a
good compromise. It minimizes the noise, let's people know about work, and
brings in a little revenue. It works like an advertisement. If you are
interested please let me know. When we have any job openings there will be a
sponsored post like this one, that you can easily ignore or pay attention to,
depending on your situation.Squarespace Looking for Full-time Scaling

<p>Introduction: It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just let the random
chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting content." #fail.
While someone says this I imagine them flicking their hair back in a "I can't
be bothered with true understanding" disdain. And where does random chance get
its content? From people like these. So:support your local blog!If you would
like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts

<p>Introduction: An interesting and different implementation approach: Tempest: Scalable Time-
Critical Web Services Platform: Tempest is a new framework for developing
time-critical web services. Tempest enables developers to build scalable,
fault-tolerant services that can then be automatically replicated and deployed
across clusters of computing nodes. The platform automatically adapts to load
ďŹ&sbquo;uctuations, reacts when components fail, and ensures consistency between
replicas by repairing when inconsistencies do occur. Tempest relies on a
family of epidemic protocols and on Ricochet, a reliable time critical
multicast protocol with probabilistic guarantees.Tempest is built around a
novel storage abstraction called the TempestCollection in which application
developers store the state of a service. Our platform handles the replication
of this state across clones of the service, persistence, and failure handling.
To minimize the need for specialized knowledge on the part of the application
developer, th</p><p>5 0.84764266 <a title="781-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-22-Cloud_Deployment%3A_It%E2%80%99s_All_About_Cloud_Automation.html">1309 high scalability-2012-08-22-Cloud Deployment: It’s All About Cloud Automation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many organizations are facing the challenge of migrating their IT to the
cloud. But not many know how to actually approach this undertaking. In my
previous post I took a hands-on example of SpringSource's PetClinic reference
application with a Tomcat web server front-end and a Cassandra NoSQL database
backend and showed how to onboard it to the cloudin a manageable fashion. But
many think this methodology is only good for modern applications that were
built with some dynamic/cloud orientation in mind. For example, how different
would the cloud on-boarding process be if I modify my PetClinic example to use
a MySQL relational database instead of the modern Cassandra NoSQL clustered
database? In this blog post I intend to show that cloud on-boarding of
brownfield applications doesn't have to be a huge monolithic migration project
with high risk. Cloud on-boarding can take the pragmatic approach and can be
performed in a gradual process that both mitigates the risk and enables you to

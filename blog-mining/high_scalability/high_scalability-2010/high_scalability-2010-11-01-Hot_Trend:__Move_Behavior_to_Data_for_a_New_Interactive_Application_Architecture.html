</p><p>6 But wait I hear you say, we've always had stored procedures in databases for this exactly the same efficiency reasons. [sent-13, score-0.634]
</p><p>7 But, in short: 1) the move to the cloud, 2) large values, 3)  stored procedures are now horizontally scalable and won't become the bottleneck, 4) more palatable implementation languages (PL/SQL anyone? [sent-16, score-0.564]

</p><p>10 Sharding Could Remove Stored Procedures as the Bottleneck   Another solution is to move the functionality that was in the logic tier to the database tier. [sent-42, score-0.497]
</p><p>11 The difference now is that databases themselves are sharded, which means the functions running in the database may not become the bottleneck. [sent-45, score-0.451]

<p>Introduction: Facebook's Ryan Mack gave a  MySQL Tech Talk  where he talked about using what he called  Non-stored Procedures  for adding edges to Facebook's social graph. The question is: how can edges quickly be added to the social graph? The answer is ultimately one of deciding where logic should be executed, especially when locks are kept open during network hops.
 
Ryan explained a key element of the Facebook data model are the connections between people, things they've liked, and places they've checked-in. A lot of their writes are adding edges to the social graph. 
 
Currently this is a two step process, run inside a transaction:
  
 add a new edge into the graph 
 if the add was successful then increment the number of edges on a node 
  
This approach works until there's a very hot node that is being added to rapidly. For example, a popular game adds a new character and everyone likes it at the same time or a new album comes out and everyone likes it at the same time.

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?  Mike Stonebraker , the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world, hopes you get something like his new database,  VoltDB : a pure SQL, pure ACID, pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a second. VoltDB  claims to be  100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster than  Cassandra , and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.
  Will VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...
 
I first heard the details about VoltDB at  Gluecon , where Mr. Stonebraker pres</p><p>4 0.20936759 <a title="933-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>5 0.18074155 <a title="933-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-06-An_Unorthodox_Approach_to_Database_Design_%3A_The_Coming_of_the_Shard.html">672 high scalability-2009-08-06-An Unorthodox Approach to Database Design : The Coming of the Shard</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Why you don’t want to shard.  by Morgon on the MySQL Performance Blog.  Optimize everything else first, and then if performance still isn’t good enough, it’s time to take a very bitter medicine.    Update 3:   Building Scalable Databases: Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemes  by Dare Obasanjo. Excellent discussion of why and when you would choose a sharding architecture, how to shard, and problems with sharding.  Update 2:   Mr. Moore gets to punt on sharding  by Alan Rimm-Kaufman of 37signals. Insightful article on design tradeoffs and the evils of premature optimization. With more memory, more CPU, and new tech like SSD,  problems can be avoided before more exotic architectures like sharding are needed.  Add features not infrastructure.  Jeremy Zawodny  says he's wrong wrong wrong. we're running multi-core CPUs at slower clock speeds. Moore won't save you.

<p>Introduction: I met the CodeFutures folks, makers of  dbShards , at  Gluecon . They occupy an interesting niche in the database space, somewhere between  NoSQL , which jettisons everything SQL, and  high end analytics platforms  that completely rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.
 
High concept: I think of dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from  HSCALE  (partitioning) +  MySQL Proxy  (transparent intermediate layer) +  Memcached  (client side sharding) +  Gigaspaces  (parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).
 
You may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult questions (not really).
  Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was dbShards created to solve?

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Zardosht Kasheff , Software Developer at  Tokutek , a storage engine company that delivers 21st-Century capabilities to the leading open source data management platforms. 
 
As software developers, we value abstraction. The simpler the API, the more attractive it becomes. Arguably, MongoDB’s greatest strengths are its elegant API and its   agility  , which let developers simply code.
 
But when  MongoDB  runs into scalability problems on  big data , developers need to peek underneath the covers to understand the underlying issues and how to fix them. Without understanding, one may end up with an inefficient solution that costs time and money. For example, one may shard prematurely, increasing hardware and management costs, when a simpler replication setup would do. Or, one may increase the size of a replica set when upgrading to SSDs would suffice.

<p>Introduction: Two forces account for the trend of moving behavior to data: larger values used in key-value stores and spotty cloud networks. For some time we've seen functions pushed close to data with MapReduce, which is a batch process, but we are now seeing this model extend to interactive applications, which match the current emphasis on highly scalable, real-time, event driven applications.
 
To see the trend look at the increasing support for collocated behavior at the datastore level:
  
 HBase is implementing a  coprocessor feature . 
 Cassandra is also implementing  coprocessors or plugins . 
 Membase is creating  NodeCode , which is a process for executing functions on data in the database. 
 MongoDB supports  JavaScript stored procedures .  
 VoltDB has  Java based stored procedures . 
  In-memory DataGrid  products like GigaSpaces have been doing something like this forever. The key difference historically being GigaSpaces' tight integration with languages C++ and Java, instead of using</p><p>2 0.97098279 <a title="933-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability_has_Moved_to_Squarespace.com%21_.html">714 high scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability has Moved to Squarespace.com! </a></p>
<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary. Thanks for the thought though.  It's been a long long long process. Importing a largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things. I'll explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia that needs to be handled to make the move complete:

<p>Introduction: Robert Johnson,   a director of engineering at Facebook, celebrated Facebook's monumental achievement of reaching 500 million users by sharing the  scaling principles that helped  reach that milestone. In case you weren't suitably impressed by the 500 million user number, Robert ratchets up the numbers game with these impressive figures:      
 
 1 million users per engineer 
 500 million active users 
 100 billion hits per day 
 50 billion photos 
 2 trillion objects cached, with hundreds of millions of requests per second 
 130TB of logs every day 
 
  
How did Facebook get to this point?
   
  People Matter Most . It's people who build and run systems. The best tools for scaling are an engineering and operations teams that can handle anything. 
  Scale Horizontally . Handling exponentially growing traffic requires spreading load arbitrarily across many machines. Using different databases for tables like accounts and profiles only doubles capacity. This approach hurts efficiency, but</p><p>4 0.96829629 <a title="933-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-26-BigData_using_Erlang%2C_C_and_Lisp_to_Fight_the_Tsunami_of_Mobile_Data.html">1362 high scalability-2012-11-26-BigData using Erlang, C and Lisp to Fight the Tsunami of Mobile Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Jon Vlachogiannis . Jon is the founder and CTO of  BugSense . 
 
 BugSense, is an error-reporting and quality metrics service that tracks thousand of apps every day. When mobile apps crash, BugSense helps developers pinpoint and fix the problem. The startup delivers first-class service to its customers, which include VMWare, Samsung, Skype and thousands of independent app developers. Tracking more than 200M devices requires fast, fault tolerant and cheap infrastructure.    The last six months, we’ve decided to use our BigData infrastructure, to provide the users with metrics about their apps performance and stability and let them know how the errors affect their user base and revenues.    We knew that our solution should be scalable from day one, because more than 4% of the smartphones out there, will start DDOSing us with data.    We wanted to be able to: 
  
 Abstract the application logic and feed browsers with JSON 
 Run complex algorithms on the fly

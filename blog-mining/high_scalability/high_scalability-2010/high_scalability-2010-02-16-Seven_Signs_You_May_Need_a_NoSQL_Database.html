<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>3 0.15343481 <a title="779-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-28-Notes_from_A_NOSQL_Evening_in_Palo_Alto_.html">931 high scalability-2010-10-28-Notes from A NOSQL Evening in Palo Alto </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems
to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly
increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly
using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and
gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous
information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and
ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only
SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it's true that the marketing wave of NoSQL
has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that's been around for quite a
while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all,
everything could be fitted into the « good old SQL model ». The reverse trend
of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very profitable
either.So, what'</p><p>6 0.10376407 <a title="779-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-03-NoSQL_Means_Never_Having_to_Store_Blobs_Again.html">770 high scalability-2010-02-03-NoSQL Means Never Having to Store Blobs Again</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was
wrong about what he meant. His real point:The meaning of the statement was
that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a
standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a
high priority task for them.At the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto, an audience
member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really
interesting:NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.The
idea being that NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance,
etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its
name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships.
With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to
implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed
usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it's not
about data.My</p><p>4 0.82222754 <a title="779-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-05-A_Yes_for_a_NoSQL_Taxonomy.html">737 high scalability-2009-11-05-A Yes for a NoSQL Taxonomy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>3 0.84078622 <a title="779-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_SmarterStats.html">45 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: SmarterStats</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Digg has been researching ways to scale our database infrastructure for some
time now. We've adopted a traditional vertically partitioned master-slave
configuration with MySQL, and also investigated sharding MySQL with IDDB.
Ultimately, these solutions left us wanting. In the case of the traditional
architecture, the lack of redundancy on the write masters is painful, and both
approaches have significant management overhead to keep running.Since it was
already necessary to abandon data normalization and consistency to make these
approaches work, we felt comfortable looking at more exotic, non-relational
data stores. After considering HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, Tokyo
Cabinet/Tyrant, Voldemort, and Dynomite, we settled on Cassandra.Each system
has its own strengths and weaknesses, but Cassandra has a good blend of
everything. It offers column-oriented data storage, so you have a bit more
structure than plain key/value stores. It operates in a distributed, highly
available, peer-to-pee</p><p>5 0.82173008 <a title="779-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-15-How_Google%27s_Instant_Previews_Reduces_HTTP_Requests.html">941 high scalability-2010-11-15-How Google's Instant Previews Reduces HTTP Requests</a></p>

Previews team, giving some fascinating inside details on how Google

Strategy: Biggest Performance Impact Is To Reduce The Number Of HTTP Requests
and one of the major ideas behind the design Instant Previews is to reduce the
number of HTTP requests through a few well chosen tricks. Cosmic!Some of what
Google does to reduce HTTP requests:Data URIs, which are are base64 encodings
of image data, are used instead of static images that are served from the
server. This means the whole preview can be pieced together from image slices
in one request as both the data and the image are returned in the same
request. Google found thateven though base64 encoding adds about 33% to the
size of the image, tests showed that gzip-compressed data URIs are comparable

Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.If datacenters are the
new castles, then what will be the new gunpowder? As soon asgunpowdercame on
the scene, castles, which are defensive structures, quickly became the
future's cold, drafty hotels. Gunpowder fueled cannon balls make short work of
castle walls.There's a long history of "gunpowder" type inventions in the tech
industry. PCs took out the timeshare model. The cloud is taking out the PC
model. There must be something that will take out the cloud.Right now it's
hard to believe the cloud will one day be no more. They seem so much the
future, but something will transcend the cloud. We even have a law that says
so:Bell's Law of Computer Classeswhich holds thatroughly every decade a new,
lower priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform,
network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new
industry.Acomputer</p><p>6 0.26157376 <a title="761-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-15-The_Amazing_Collective_Compute_Power_of_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">778 high scalability-2010-02-15-The Amazing Collective Compute Power of the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.As I was writingan
articleon the architecture of theStorm Botnet, I couldn't help but notice the
deep similarity of how Storm works and changes we're seeing in the evolution
of political systems. In particular, the rise of thevirtual-state. As crazy as
this may sound, I think this is also the direction applications will need
follow to survive in a complex world of billions of compute devices.You may
have already heard ofvirtual corporations. Virtual corporations are companies
with limited office space, a distributed workforce, and production facilities
located wherever it is profitable to locate them. The idea is to stay lean and
compete using therapid development and introduction of new products into high
value-added markets. If you spot a market opportunity with a small time
window, building your own factories and hiring and engineering team simply

<p>Introduction: Chris Dixonunearthed agreat quotefrom Douglas Adams on the nature of
technological adoption that unsurprisingly hits the mark in our ever changing
and evolving world:Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal
and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.Anything
that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and
exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.Anything
invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of thingsSome
that come to mind: horse to car, index card to online search, PC to mobile,
web to app, portal to messaging, Newton to Einstein, oil to electric, rock to
rap, Aquinas to Bacon, buying to renting, files to streaming, network TV to
cordkilling, broadcast to social, programming CPUs to programming biology,
server to cloud, vm to container, wired to wireless, long read to TLDR,

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.We tend to think compute
of resources as residing primarily in datacenters. Given the fast pace of
innovation we will likely see compute resources become pervasive. Some will
reside in datacenters, but compute resources can be anywhere, not just in the
datacenter, we'll actually see the bulk of compute resources live outside of
datacenters in the future.Given the diversity of compute resources it's
reasonable to assume they won't be homogeneous or conform to a standard API.
They will specialize by service. Programmers will have to use those
specialized service interfaces to build applications that are adaptive enough
to take advantage of whatever leverage they can find, whenever and wherever
they can find it. Once found the application will have to reorganize on the
fly to use whatever new resources it has found and let go of whatever
resources it doesn't have</p><p>3 0.94196904 <a title="761-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_30%2C_2012.html">1219 high scalability-2012-03-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 30, 2012</a></p>

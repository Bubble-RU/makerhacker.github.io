</p><p>2 com  This particular post caught my attention primarily because although I've touched on many of these patterns in the past, I've never thought to call them what they are: scalability patterns. [sent-5, score-0.439]
</p><p>3 This is actually more common than you'd think, as it's rarely the case that a network guy and a developer sit down and discuss scalability patterns over beer and deep fried cheese curds (hey, I live in Wisconsin and it's my blog post so just stop making faces until you've tried it). [sent-7, score-0.647]
</p><p>4 The thing is that the scalability patterns leveraged by developers and architects can almost universally be abstracted and applied to the application delivery network - the set of components integrated as a means to ensure availability, performance, and security of applications. [sent-9, score-1.147]
</p><p>5 That's why devops is so important and why devops has to bring dev into ops as much as its necessary to bring some ops into dev. [sent-10, score-0.416]
</p><p>6 For now, let's briefly touch on the scalability patterns and sub- patterns Jesper described with some commentary on how they fit into scalability from a network and application delivery network perspective. [sent-16, score-1.357]
</p><p>7 The secret sauce is almost always in the way in which the aggregation point (strategic point of control) determines how best to distribute the load across the "multiple processing units. [sent-20, score-0.457]
</p><p>8 The load balancing distributes requests across all instances based on the configured load balancing algorithm. [sent-23, score-0.8]
</p><p>9 Partitioning- Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to a component that owns that data specificThis is really where the architecture comes in and where efficiency and performance can be dramatically increased in anapplication delivery architecture. [sent-24, score-0.737]
</p><p>10 This allows for devops to tweak configurations of the underlying operating system, web and application server software for the specific type of request being handled. [sent-26, score-0.54]
</p><p>11 This is, also, where thedifference between "application switching" and "load balancing"becomes abundantly clear as "application switching" is used as a means to determine where to route a particular request which is/can be then load balanced across a pool of resources. [sent-27, score-0.418]
</p><p>12 Vertical partitioning- Spreading the load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions being handled by different processing unitsWhen it comes to routing application requests we really don't separate by function unless that function is easily associated with a URI. [sent-29, score-0.731]
</p><p>13 The most common implementation of vertical partitioning at the application switching layer will be by content. [sent-30, score-0.477]
</p><p>14 This also, in a distributed environment, allows architects to leverage say cloud-based storage for static content while maintaining dynamic content (and its associated data stores) on-premise. [sent-33, score-0.602]
</p><p>15 Queuing and batch- Achieve efficiencies of scale by processing batches of data, usually because the overhead of an operation is amortized across multiple request I admit defeat in applying this sub-pattern to application delivery. [sent-41, score-0.493]
</p><p>16 I know, you're surprised, but this really is very specific to middleware and aside from the ability to leverage queuing for Quality of Service (QoS) at the delivery layer this one is just not fitting in well. [sent-42, score-0.51]
</p><p>17 And make no mistake, storage virtualization is a part of the application delivery network - has been since its inception - and as cloud computing and virtualization have grown so has the importance of a well- defined storage tiering strategy. [sent-46, score-0.89]
</p><p>18 We can bring this back up to the application layer by considering that a relaxation of data constraints with regards to immediacy of access can be applied by architecting a solution that separates datareadsfromwrites. [sent-47, score-0.664]
</p><p>19 Only by recognizing that many architectural patterns are applicable to not only application but infrastructure architecture can we start to apply a whole lot of "lessons that have already been learned" by developers and architects to emerging infrastructure architectural models. [sent-54, score-0.912]
</p><p>20 This abstraction and application from well-understood patterns in application design and architecture will be invaluable in designing the new network; the next iteration of network theory and implementation that will allow it to scale along with the applications it is delivering.

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>4 0.19628133 <a title="906-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-01-The_Pattern_Bible_for_Distributed_Computing.html">400 high scalability-2008-10-01-The Pattern Bible for Distributed Computing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>5 0.17340839 <a title="906-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-19-The_4_Building_Blocks_of_Architecting_Systems_for_Scale.html">1325 high scalability-2012-09-19-The 4 Building Blocks of Architecting Systems for Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture
principles then take a look at Will Larson's Introduction to Architecting
Systems for Scale. Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers
key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:Load
Balancing: Scalability & Redundancy.Horizontal scalability and redundancy are
usually achieved via load balancing, the spreading of requests across multiple
resources.Smart Clients.The client has a list of hosts and load balances
across that list of hosts. Upside is simple for programmers. Downside is it's
hard to update and change.Hardware Load Balancers.Targeted at larger
companies, this is dedicated load balancing hardware. Upside is performance.
Downside is cost and complexity.Software Load Balancers.The recommended
approach, it's  software that handles load balancing, health checks,
etc.Caching.Make better use of resources you already have. Precalculate
results for later use.

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>4 0.77868724 <a title="906-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-19-The_4_Building_Blocks_of_Architecting_Systems_for_Scale.html">1325 high scalability-2012-09-19-The 4 Building Blocks of Architecting Systems for Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture
principles then take a look at Will Larson's Introduction to Architecting
Systems for Scale. Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers
key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:Load
Balancing: Scalability & Redundancy.Horizontal scalability and redundancy are
usually achieved via load balancing, the spreading of requests across multiple
resources.Smart Clients.The client has a list of hosts and load balances
across that list of hosts. Upside is simple for programmers. Downside is it's
hard to update and change.Hardware Load Balancers.Targeted at larger
companies, this is dedicated load balancing hardware. Upside is performance.
Downside is cost and complexity.Software Load Balancers.The recommended
approach, it's  software that handles load balancing, health checks,
etc.Caching.Make better use of resources you already have. Precalculate
results for later use. Application Versus Da</p><p>5 0.77686238 <a title="906-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-07-Case_Study_on_Scaling_PaaS_infrastructure_.html">1260 high scalability-2012-06-07-Case Study on Scaling PaaS infrastructure </a></p>
<p>Introduction: In his blog post,Scaling WSO2 Stratos, Srinath Perera explains the scaling
architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure.
It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new
concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.Overall,
WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading
to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the
paper WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing.
ProblemStratos is multi-tenanted. In other words, there are many tenants. Each
tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants,
where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos
supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products
(e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants
may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, and Gadgets
etc. WSO2 Str</p><p>6 0.77002662 <a title="906-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-12-4_Architecture_Issues_When_Scaling_Web_Applications%3A_Bottlenecks%2C_Database%2C_CPU%2C_IO.html">1646 high scalability-2014-05-12-4 Architecture Issues When Scaling Web Applications: Bottlenecks, Database, CPU, IO</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lately I've been reading more cases were different people have started to
realize the limitations of the NoSQL promise to database scalability. Note the
references below:Why does Quora use MySQL as the data store instead of NoSQLs
such as Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB etc?Why did Diaspora abandon MongoDB for
MySQL?How scalable is CouchDB in practice, not just in theory?Take MongoDB for
example. It's damn fast, but it doesn't really know how to save data reliably
to disk. I've had it set up in a replica pair to mitigate that risk. Guess
what - both servers in the pair failed and corrupted their data files at the
same day.It appears that for many, the switch to NoSQL can be rather painful.
IMO that doesn't necessarily mean that NoSQL is wrong in general, but it's a
combination of 1) lack of maturity 2) not the right tool for the job.That
brings the question of what's the alternative solution?In the following post I

<p>Introduction: You need answers, I know, but all I have here are some questions to consider
when thinking about which database to use. These are taken from my webinar
What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for Scalable Web Applications.
It's a companion article toWhat The Heck Are You Actually Using NoSQL
For?Actually, I don't even know if there are a 101 questions, but there are a

<p>Introduction: Hi all, aI run a site that after a complete redesign have gotten a lot more
traffic. The site provides free flash games, so the biggest traffic share goes
to serving flash files (from about 100K and up to several megabytes in size
each.)I currently host the entire site on a hosting provider that have no
traffic limits. But since they are very cheap (yet have served me very well
all the time with at least 99,9% uptime), I don't trust them in allowing me to
continue consuming more and more bandwidth. I just guess I'm going to reach
some internal limit they have on day, so I'm looking into moving all the flash
content over to a content delivery network of some sort.Some recent traffic

<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application
delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to
addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application
delivery tier of the data center. By Lori Mac Vittie, F5 Networks The "High
Scalability" blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not
disappoint with a posthighlighting a set of scalability design patternsthat
was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on "6 Ways to
Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way." Credit:Michael
Chow/azcentral.com  This particular post caught my attention primarily because
although I've touched on many of these patterns in the past, I've never
thought to call them what they are: scalability patterns. That's probably a
side-effect of forgetting thatbuilding an architecture of any kind is at its
core computer scienceand thus algorithms and design patterns are applicable to

<p>Introduction: So far every massively scalable database is a bundle of compromises. For some
the weak guarantees of Amazon'seventual consistencymodel are too cold. For
many the strong guarantees of standard RDBMSdistributed transactionsare too
hot. Google App Engine tries to get it just right withentity groups. Yahoo! is
also trying to get is just right by offering per-record timeline consistency,
which hopes to serve up a heaping bowl ofrich database functionality and low
latency at massive scale:We describe PNUTS [Platform for Nimble Universal
Table Storage], a massively parallel and geographically distributed database
system for Yahoo!'s web applications. PNUTS provides data storage organized as
hashed or ordered tables, low latency for large numbers of con-current

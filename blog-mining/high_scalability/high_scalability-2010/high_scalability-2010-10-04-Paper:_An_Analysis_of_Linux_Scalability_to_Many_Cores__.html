<p>Introduction: Now that we have theC10K concurrent connection problemlicked, how do we level
up and support 10 million concurrent connections? Impossible you say. Nope,
systems right now are delivering 10 million concurrent connections using
techniques that are as radical as they may be unfamiliar.To learn how it's
done we turn toRobert Graham, CEO of Errata Security, and his absolutely
fantastic talk atShmoocon 2013calledC10M Defending The Internet At
Scale.Robert has a brilliant way of framing the problem that I've never heard
of before. He starts with a little bit of history, relating how Unix wasn't
originally designed to be a general server OS, it was designed to be a control
system for a telephone network. It was the telephone network that actually
transported the data so there was a clean separation between the control plane
and the data plane. Theproblem is we now use Unix servers as part of the data
plane, which we shouldn't do at all. If we were designing a kernel for
handling one applicati</p><p>3 0.12355543 <a title="914-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-12-Paper%3A_Scalable_Eventually_Consistent_Counters_over_Unreliable_Networks.html">1611 high scalability-2014-03-12-Paper: Scalable Eventually Consistent Counters over Unreliable Networks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Counting at scale in a distributed environment issurprisingly hard. And it's a
subject we've covered before in various ways:Big Data Counting: How to count a
billion distinct objects using only 1.5KB of Memory,How to update video views
count effectively?,Numbers Everyone Should Know (sharded
counters).Kellabyte(which is an excellent blog) inScalable Eventually
Consistent Counterstalks about how the Cassandra counter implementation scores
well on the scalability and high availability front, but in so doing has "over
and under counting problem in partitioned environments."Which is often fine.
But if you want more accuracy there's a PN-counter, which is aCRDT (convergent
replicated data type)where "all the changes made to a counter on each node
rather than storing and modifying a single value so that you can merge all the
values into the proper final value. Of course the trade-off here is additional
storage and processing but there are ways to optimize this."And there's a

<p>Introduction: My name isRussell Sullivan, I am the author of AlchemyDB: a highly flexible
NoSQL/SQL/DocumentStore/GraphDB-datastore built on top of redis. I have spent
the last several years trying to find a way to sanely house multiple

<p>Introduction: Our latest strategy is taken from agreat post by Paul Saab of Facebook,
detailing how with changes Facebook has made to memcached they have:...been
able to scale memcached to handle 200,000 UDP requests per second with an
average latency of 173 microseconds. The total throughput achieved is 300,000
UDP requests/s, but the latency at that request rate is too high to be useful
in our system. This is an amazing increase from 50,000 UDP requests/s using
the stock version of Linux and memcached.To scale Facebook has hundreds of
thousands of TCP connections open to their memcached processes. First, this is
still amazing. It's not so long ago you could have never done this. Optimizing
connection use was always a priority because the OS simply couldn't handle
large numbers of connections or large numbers of threads or large numbers of
CPUs. To get to this point is a big accomplishment. Still, at that scale there
are problems that are often solved.Some of the problem Facebook faced and
fixed:Pe</p><p>6 0.091860302 <a title="914-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-11-Yahoo%21_Distribution_of_Hadoop.html">627 high scalability-2009-06-11-Yahoo! Distribution of Hadoop</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This question comes from Ulysses on aninteresting threadfrom the Mechanical
Sympathy news group, especially given how multiple processors are now the
norm:Ulysses:On an 8xCPU Linux instance,  is it at all advantageous to use the
Linux taskset command to pin an 8xJVM process set (co-ordinated as a
www.infinispan.org distributed cache/data grid) to a specific CPU affinity set
(i.e. pin JVM0 process to CPU 0, JVM1 process to CPU1, ...., JVM7process to
CPU 7) vs. just letting the Linux OS use its default mechanism for
provisioning the 8xJVM process set to the available CPUs?In effrort to seek an
optimal point (in the full event space), what are the conceptual trade-offs in
considering "searching" each permutation of provisioning an 8xJVM process set
to an 8xCPU set via taskset?Giventaskset is they key to the question, it would

<p>Introduction: The paper MegaPipe: A New Programming Interface for Scalable Network I/O
(video,slides) hits the common theme that if you want to go faster you need a
better car design, not just a better driver. So that's why the authors started
with a clean-slate and designed a network API from the ground up with support
for concurrent I/O, a requirement for achieving high performance while scaling
to large numbers of connections per thread, multiple cores, etc.  What they
created is MegaPipe, "a new network programming API for message-oriented
workloads to avoid the performance issues of BSD Socket API."The result:
MegaPipe outperforms baseline Linux between 29% (for long connections) and
582% (for short connections). MegaPipe improves the performance of a modiﬁed
version of memcached between 15% and 320%. For a workload based on real-world
HTTP traces, MegaPipe boosts the throughput of nginx by 75%.What's this most

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly

<p>Introduction: This is an article published last year, but as today is Grace Hopper's
birthday I thought it would be a good time to share again an amazing talk from
this amazing woman.Computing pioneerGrace Hopper,inventor of the compiler,
searched for a concrete way to create an intuitive understanding of just how
fast is a nanosecond, a billionth of a second, which was the speed of their
new computer circuits. As an illustration she settled on the length of wire
that is as long as light can travel in one nanosecond. The length is a very
portable11.8 inches. A microseconds worth of wire is a still portable, but a
much bulkier 984 feet. In one millisecond light travels 186 miles, which only
Hercules could carry. In today's terms, at a3.06 GHz clock speed, there's .33
nanoseconds between ticks, or 3.73 inches of light travel.Understanding the

<p>Introduction: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores, by a number of MIT
researchers, is a refreshingly practical paper on what it takes to scale Linux
and common applications like Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake,
Psearchy, and MapReduce to run on 48 core systems. A very timely paper given
moderately massive multicore systems are reportedly the near future of
computing.This paper must have taken a lot of work. They both tracked down
bottlenecks in a number of applications and the Linux kernel and they also
tried to fix them. Modestly speaking the authors said they made "modest"
changes to the kernel and applications, but there's nothing modest about what
they did. It's excellent work.After the next bit, which is the abstract, there
is a list of the problems they found and how they fixed them.The abstract:This
paper analyzes the scalability of seven system applications (Exim, memcached,
Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce) running on Linux on a
48-core computer. Exce</p><p>4 0.73631132 <a title="914-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-26-Scale_to_China.html">165 high scalability-2007-11-26-Scale to China</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello all,does anyone have experience in scaling a european website to
china?The main problem in china is the internet connectivity to websites
outside china, that means latency and packetloss (and perhaps filtering) make
things difficult.The options I see are:1. Host you application in china, but
where? I haven't got a answer from any chinese ISP I contacted. On the other
hand I don't really want to host in china.2. Build your own CDN. Wikipedia
shows how it goes. Get a bunch of machines (but where? see point 1) put squid
on them, implement intelligent cache invalidation and you're set. But where
can I get machines in china? Where do I need them in china? There are soe big
isps with limited peering capability, so I'd need servers in every network.3.
Get professional CDN services. Akamai, ChinaCache, CDNetworks, etc etc.. They
all provide services in china. The problem is: they are all very expensive.4.
Amazon EC2/S3 ? Is it worth thinking about this way? I am not sure, because

<p>Introduction: Hi,We're looking for a highly scalable way of scanning documents being
uploaded and downloaded from our web application. I believe services like
gmail and hotmail are using bespoke solutions from companies like Trend, but
are there some quality "off the shelf" products out there that can easily be
scaled out and have a "loose" API (HTTP based) for application
integration?Once again, thanks for any input.</p><p>6 0.68215257 <a title="914-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-14-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_14%2C_2013.html">1476 high scalability-2013-06-14-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 14, 2013</a></p>

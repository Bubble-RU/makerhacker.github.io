<p>Introduction: Ever come to a point where you feel you've learned enough to share your
experiences in the hopes of helping others traveling the same road? That's
whatMartin Kleppmannhas done in an lovingly written Six things I wish we had
known about scaling, an article well worth your time.It's not advice about
scaling a Twitter, but of building a million user system, which is the sweet
spot for a lot of projects. His conclusion rings true:Building scalable
systems is not all sexy roflscale fun. It's a lot of plumbing and yak shaving.
A lot of hacking together tools that really ought to exist already, but all
the open source solutions out there are too bad (and yours ends up bad too,
but at least it solves your particular problem).Here's a gloss on the six
lessons (plus a bonus lesson):Realistic load testing is hard. Testing a large
distributed system is not like a scientific experiment that can be conducted
under ideal conditions. This is hard for the scientific minded to accept.

<p>Introduction: breakThis JoelOnSoftwarethreadasks the age old question of what and how to
log. The usual trace/error/warning/info advice is totally useless in a large
scale distributed system. Instead, you need tolog everything all the timeso
you can solve problems that have already happened across a potentially huge
range of servers. Yes, it can be done.To see why the typical logging approach
is broken, imagine this scenario: Your site has been up and running great for
weeks. No problems. A foreshadowing beeper goes off at 2AM. It seems some
users can no longer add comments to threads. Then you hear the debugging
deathknell: it's an intermittent problem and customers are pissed. Fix it.
Now.So how are you going to debug this? The monitoring system doesn't show any
obvious problems or errors. You quickly post a comment and it works fine. This
won't be easy. So you think. Commenting involves a bunch of servers and
networks. There's the load balancer, spam filter, web server, database server,
caching s</p><p>same-blog 6 0.95873898 <a title="887-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-24-Sponsored_Post%3A_deviantART%2C_Okta%2C_EzRez%2C_Cloud_Sigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">887 high scalability-2010-08-24-Sponsored Post: deviantART, Okta, EzRez, Cloud Sigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

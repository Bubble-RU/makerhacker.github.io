<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation
from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?
Mike Stonebraker, the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world,
hopes you get something like his new database,VoltDB: a pure SQL, pure ACID,
pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory
DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a
second. VoltDBclaims to be100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster
thanCassandra, and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.Will
VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of
ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product
with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component
in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...I first heard the

<p>Introduction: From their website:FAIis an automated installation tool to install or deploy
Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a
Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat,
autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used
for configuration management of a running system.You can take one or more
virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction
necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your
computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized
management system for your Linux deployment.breakFAI's target group are system
administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of
computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general
purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a
rendering farm, a web server</p><p>3 0.87735361 <a title="858-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-20-The_clouds_are_coming.html">354 high scalability-2008-07-20-The clouds are coming</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pud off*ckedcomany.com (FC) fame, a favorite site of the dot bomb era, and a
site I absolutely loved until my company became featured, has given us a look
at his backend: Why Must You Laugh At My Back End. For those whose don't
remember FC's history, TechCrunch published afitting eulogy:[FC] first went
live in 2000, chronicling failing and troubled companies in its unique and
abrasive style after the dot com bust. Within a year it had a massive audience
and was getting serious mainstream press attention. As the startup economy
became better in 2004, much of the attention the site received went away. But
a large and loyal audience remains at the site, coming back day after day for
its unique slant on the news. At its peak, FC had 4 million unique monthly
visitors.Delightfully, FC was not a real-names kind of site. Hard witty
cynicism ruled and not a single cat picture was in sight. It was a blast of
fun when all around was the enclosing dark.So when I saw Pud's post I was

</p><p>5 Justin talked about how live video was fundamentally different than YouTube's batch video approach, where all the video is stored on disk and replayed later on demand. [sent-18, score-1.502]
</p><p>6 Live video can't be made by pushing video faster, it takes a completely differently architecture. [sent-19, score-0.866]
</p><p>7 Since theYouTube Architecturearticle is the most popular article ever on this site, I thought people might also enjoy learning about live side of the video world. [sent-20, score-0.707]
</p><p>8 tv makes all this live video magic happen, going way beyond the call, providing a tremendous number of juicy details. [sent-22, score-0.714]
</p><p>9 Usher - custom business logic server for playing video streams. [sent-64, score-0.63]
</p><p>10 The complete video path can't have more than 250 msecs of latency before viewers start losing the ability to converse and interact in real-time. [sent-76, score-0.586]
</p><p>11 If you can't just do YouTube faster for live video, what makes live video such a challenge? [sent-81, score-0.839]
</p><p>12 With live video if you exceed your network capacity even for a fraction of a second every single viewer will see buffering all at the same moment. [sent-86, score-0.838]
</p><p>13 Every server can act as an edge server (where the video is streaming out of to a viewer) and an origin server (where the video is streaming into from a broadcaster). [sent-119, score-1.154]
</p><p>14 The entire video stream stays in memory from the time it hits the origin server to when it's copied to other servers and when it's copied to viewers. [sent-127, score-0.89]
</p><p>15 The video servers are fairly dumb, the overlay logic controlling the serving topology is managed by Usher. [sent-138, score-0.616]
</p><p>16 They have a backbone network to get the video streams between datacenters. [sent-161, score-0.697]
</p><p>17 While video streams are not streamed from disk, video is archived to disk. [sent-166, score-1.042]
</p><p>18 The number of video servers may seem a little low for their traffic because with Usher they can run each video server to full capacity. [sent-181, score-1.147]
</p><p>19 Building Usher as the core backbone of their video scalability on top of relatively dumb video servers is an excellent example of this strategy. [sent-295, score-0.94]
</p><p>20 In live video this is often a big event and if you mess up a lot of people will spread the bad word about you. [sent-341, score-0.707]

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: Viddler is in the high quality Video as a Service business for a customer who
wants to pay a fixed cost, be done with it, and just have it work. Similar to
Blip and Ooyala, more focussed on business than YouTube. They serve thousands
of business customers, including high traffic websites like FailBlog,
Engadget, and Gawker.Viddler is a good case to learn from because they are a
small company trying to provide a challenging service in a crowded field. We
are catching them just as they transitioning from a startup that began in one
direction, as a YouTube competitor, and pivoted into a slightly larger company
focussed on paying business customers.Transition is the key word for Viddler:
transitioning from a free YouTube clone to a high quality paid service.
Transitioning from a few colo sites that didn't work well to a new higher
quality datacenter. Transitioning from an architecture that was typical of a
startup to one that features redundancy, high availability, and automation.

Transitioning from a few colo sites that didn't work well to a new higher
quality datacenter. Transitioning from an architecture that was typical of a
startup to one that features redundancy, high availability, and automation.

<p>Introduction: Michael Stonebraker sure knows how to stir up a storm. Unlike for others, that
doesn't make him a troll in my mind, he'sway too accomplishedin the field to
be that, but he does have a bit of Barnum & Bailey in him, which serves to get
the discussion flowing, and that's a good thing. A lot of previously hidden
wisdom and passion unlocks, which we'll try to capture here.This disturbance
in the force is over OldSQL vs NoSQL vsNewSQL. Warning, these are not crisp
categories, there's leakage all over the place, watch your step:OldSQL
(Oracle, MySQL, etc) refers to what some want to term as legacy relational
database like MySQL, that don't scale out horizontally with aplomb.NoSQL
(CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, Riak, Neo4j, etc) refers to, well,
a collection of technologies that aren't OldSQL, these often are designed to
scale out horizontally, aren't on ACID, and use schemaless non-relational
datamodels.NewSQL  (Xeround, Clustrix, NimbusDB, GenieDB, ScaleBase, VoltDB)

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>4 0.95264024 <a title="796-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-15-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Justin.Tv%27s_Live_Video_Broadcasting_Architecture.html">1359 high scalability-2012-11-15-Gone Fishin': Justin.Tv's Live Video Broadcasting Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is one of my favorite posts for a couple of reasons. I think it gives a
lot of useful information in an interesting space. And Kyle Vogt was just a
real pleasure to talk to. He was very helpful and forthcoming, which makes the
whole experience better for everyone.The future is live. The future is real-
time. The future is now. That's the hype anyway. And as it has a habit of
doing, the hype is slowly becoming reality. We are seeing live searches, live
tweets, live location, live reality augmentation, live crab (fresh and local),
and live event publishing. One of the most challenging of all live
technologies is that of live video broadcasting. Imagine a world in which
everyone becomes a broadcaster and a consumer of video streams, all in real-
time (< 250 msec latency), all so you can talk and interact directly without
feeling like you are in the middle of a time shift war. The resources and the
engineering needed to make this happened must be substantial. How do you do
that?To fin</p><p>5 0.95258242 <a title="796-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-05-How_will_memristors_change_everything%3F_.html">823 high scalability-2010-05-05-How will memristors change everything? </a></p>
<p>Introduction: A non-random sample of my tech friends shows that not many have heard
ofmemristors(though I do suspect vote tampering). I'd read a little about
memristors in2008when the initial hubbub about the existence of memristors was
raised. I, however,  immediately filed them into that comforting conceptual
bucket of potentially revolutionary technologies I didn't have to worry about
because like most wondertech, nothing would ever come of it. Wrong. After
watchingFinding the Missing Memristorby R. Stanley Williams I've had to change
my mind. Memristors have gone from "maybe never" to holy cow this could happen
soon and it could change everything.Let's assume for the sake of dreaming
memristors do prove out. How will we design systems when we have access to a
new material that is two orders of magnitude more efficient from a power
perspective than traditional transistor technologies, contains multiple
petabits (1 petabit = 128TB) of persistent storage, and can be reconfigured to
be either memory</p><p>same-blog 6 0.951882 <a title="796-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-16-Justin.tv%27s_Live_Video_Broadcasting_Architecture.html">796 high scalability-2010-03-16-Justin.tv's Live Video Broadcasting Architecture</a></p>

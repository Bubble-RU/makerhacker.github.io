<p>Introduction: Google App Engine (GAE) is focused on making development easy, but limits your
options. Amazon Web Services is focused on making development flexible, but
complicates the development process. Real enterprise applications require both
of these paradigms to achieve successâ&euro;Ś What we really want is the flexibility
of AWS and the simplicity of GAE.For the rest of the post see

scale. LiveJournal was an early player in the free blog service race and faced
issues from quickly adding a large number of users. Blog posts come fast and

<p>Introduction: This post covers two main options for scaling-out MySql and compare between
them. The first is based on data-base clustering and the second is based on In
Memory clustering a.k.a Data Grid. A special emphasis is given to a pattern
which shows how to scale our existing data base without changing it through a
combination of Data Grid and data base as a background service. This pattern
is referred to as Persistency as a Service (PaaS). It also address many of the
fequently asked question related to how performance, reliability and
scalability is achieved with this pattern.</p><p>4 0.53252971 <a title="769-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-07-clusteradmin.blogspot.com_-_blog_about_building_and_administering_clusters.html">243 high scalability-2008-02-07-clusteradmin.blogspot.com - blog about building and administering clusters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Amazon has announced the limited beta of Amazon SimpleDB - a simple web
services interface to create and store multiple data sets, query your data
easily, and return the results. Together with the Simple Storage Service (S3),
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and other web services Amazon offers a complete
utility computing platform. SimpleDB was the missing piece of AWS - the

algorithms not code.Your Bottleneck is Dead. Long Live Your Bottleneck.
Mailinator's Paul Tyma brings up the interesting notion that once bottlenecks
have moved to the CPU because programs can nolonger hide behind IO overhead -
code efficiency becomes important again.Facebook Moving To The JVM: The main

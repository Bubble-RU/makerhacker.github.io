<p>Introduction: Warning, this post is a bit vendor FUDy, but SSL is an important topic and it does bring up some issues worth arguing about. Hacker News has a  good discussion  of the article. Adam Langley started it all with his article  Overclocking SSL  and has made a rebuttal to the F5 article in  Still not computationally expensive . 
 
 My car is eight years old this year. It has less than 30,000 miles on it. 
 
Yes, you heard that right, less than 30,000 miles. I don’t drive my car very often because, well, my commute is a short trip down two flights of stairs. I don’t need to go very far when I do drive it’s only ten miles or so round trip to the grocery store. So from my perspective, gas isn’t really very expensive. I may use a tank of gas a month, which works out to … well, it’s really not even worth mentioning the cost. But for someone who commutes every day – especially someone who commutes a long-distance every day – gas is expensive. It’s a significant expense every month for them and th</p><p>3 0.14718272 <a title="880-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Useful_Cloud_Computing_Blogs.html">445 high scalability-2008-11-14-Useful Cloud Computing Blogs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers podcast  Show 15 – Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls . The conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can be processed by a WAF ( Web Application Firewall ), which inspects HTTP for security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be necessary, but I digress.
 
To  terminate SSL  most shops run SSL connections into Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.
 
Load balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very efficiently in hardware. Efficiently enough that if you are willing to get rid of the general purpose Linux boxes and use your big iron load balancers, your server count c</p><p>5 0.1215139 <a title="880-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something called   Self Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance   (SCIT).  Botnets  are created when vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks like a  dog chasing its tail ). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a great deal of sense once I thought about it.  With SCIT you stop and restart VM instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window vulnerability)....
   
 This short exposure window means worms and viri do not have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack. A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM</p><p>3 0.74568397 <a title="880-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-20-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_20%2C_2011.html">1045 high scalability-2011-05-20-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 20, 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this beautiful morning: 
 
 
  
 
  
  Group Decision Making in Honey Bee Swarms . In distributed computing systems nodes reach a  quorum  when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:   A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating the swarm's move to this site.  Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.   Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.

<p>Introduction: Royans Tharakan is blogging like a mad man at the  Velocity Conference . Read a summary of many of the presentations on his  blog . 
 Zuckerberg almost  guarantees 1 billion Facebook users . And  I almost  believe him. 
 Northscale introduces  Membase , a new distributed key-value NoSQL competitor featuring a memcache compatible interface, yet is persistent like a database. Hopefully we'll have more on their internals later. 
 Notable Tweets:     
 
  Aaron Cordova  -  scalability means "can change size" and also "works at large sizes" - this conflates two orthogonal features of cloud computing.   
  Jaime Garcia Reinoso  - I t's the scalability, stupid!   
  Alex Averbuch   - when I read/hear "unlimited/inifinite scalability" I stop reading/listening and start thinking about cake.  
  Dennis Clark   - I used to smirk at developers whose main DB experience was in MUMPS or Pick, until I realized those are old-school  #NoSQL  engines.

<p>Introduction: Update: :  Eucalyptus Goes Commercial with $5.5M Funding Round .  This removes my objection that it's an academic project only. Go team go!   Rich Wolski , professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, gave a spirited talk on  Eucalyptus  to a large group of very interested cloudsters at the  Eucalyptus Cloud Meetup . If Rich could teach computer science at every school the state of the computer science industry would be stratospheric. Rich is dynamic, smart, passionate, and visionary. It's that vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement Eucalyptus and have been improving it and tracking Amazon's changes ever since.

<p>Introduction: Ezra Zygmuntowicz in a heart warming account of his      4 Years at Engine Yard   , has concluded in his experience that:  the true future of cloud computing for developers is to not think about servers at all. It is now time to focus on the Application and new levels of abstraction that allow folks to use the computing resources in easier and easier ways.

   bryanlatten :  Nothing like a million caching layers to screw up an already complicated deployment. Thankfully, there is beer. 
  jkalucki : Twitter isn't down, you are just using the wrong access methods... 
  andyedinborough : I don't mean to hate, but why would I give up performance and scalability for a dynamic language? Honestly, I don't get it.

<p>Introduction: GridGain   was kind enough to present at the September 17th instance of  the   Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group  . I've been curious about GridGain so I was glad to see them there. In short GridGain is:   an open source computational grid framework that enables Java developers to improve general performance of processing intensive applications by splitting and parallelizing the workload  . GridGain can also be thought of as a set of middleware primitives for building applications. GridGain's peer group of competitors includes GigaSpaces, Terracotta, Coherence, and Hadoop.     The speaker for GridGain was the President and Founder, Nikita Ivanov. He has a very pleasant down-to-earth way about him that contrasts nicely with a field given to religious discussions of complex taxomic definitions. Nikita first talked about cloud computing in general. He feels Java is the perfect gateway for cloud computing. Which is good because   GridGain only works with Java  .

<p>Introduction: Twitter Sees Its 20 Billionth Tweet  writes  Marshall Kirkpatrick of ReadWriteWeb. 
  Startups die for not having customers, so STOP thinking about how to scale . Alessandro Orsi says  focusing on the architecture and scaling possibilities of your app for millions of users is just plain dumb...concentrate on marketing...concentrate on user experience . Alessandro is perfectly correct, but this isn't the year the 2000 when the default architecture that is easy is also not scalable and when sites were built from scratch one painful user at a time.  Today neither is tue. In the era of social networks, where Facebook has 500 million users, successful applications can and often do spike to millions of users seemingly overnight. And you have to have some architecture. With today's tool-chains you don't have to choose easy and non-scalable. There are other options. Of course, it's all pointless without customers and that is what you need to worry about, but it's a false choice in this era to</p><p>5 0.94245368 <a title="880-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-17-Scaling_in_Games_%26_Virtual_Worlds___.html">496 high scalability-2009-01-17-Scaling in Games & Virtual Worlds   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems Laboratories     * The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the high-tech industry.   * The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome of the evolution of these games.    * Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.    * The game server is used both to discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating (by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the server component.   * Using multiple servers is a basic mecha</p><p>6 0.92639482 <a title="880-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-31-Need_help_on_Site_loading_%26_database_optimization_-_URGENT.html">611 high scalability-2009-05-31-Need help on Site loading & database optimization - URGENT</a></p>

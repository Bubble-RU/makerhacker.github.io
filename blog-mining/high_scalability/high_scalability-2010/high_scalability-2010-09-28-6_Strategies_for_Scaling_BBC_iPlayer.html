<p>Introduction: This is a guest post fromPer Buer, founder and CEO of Varnish Software,
provider of Varnish Cache, an open source web application accelerator freely
available at varnish-cache.org. Varnish powers a lot of really big websites
worldwide.We at Varnish Software are all about speed. Varnish Cache is built
for speed. It executes its policy code more or less a thousand times faster
than your typical Java or PHP based application servers, mostly due to the
fact that the configuration is compiled into system call free machine
code.System calls require expensive context switches, stall the CPU and wreck
havoc in the CPU cache so avoiding them makes the code fly. There are strong
limitations on what kind of logic you can move into Varnish Cache, but the
logic that you do move there will run very fast.An example is using Varnish
for access control to serve access controlled content from the caching edge
layer.The Varnish PaywallWho gets to access your content? In a traditional

<p>Introduction: Memcachedis a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system,
generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web
applications by alleviating database load.Danga Interactive developed
memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com, a site which was already
doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1 million users with a bunch
of webservers and a bunch of database servers. memcached dropped the database
load to almost nothing, yielding faster page load times for users, better
resource utilization, and faster access to the databases on a memcache miss.</p><p>4 0.76375026 <a title="908-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy%3A_How_to_Manage_Sessions_Using_Memcached.html">436 high scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy: How to Manage Sessions Using Memcached</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>5 0.76048678 <a title="908-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-04-A_Bunch_of_Great_Strategies_for_Using_Memcached_and_MySQL_Better_Together.html">360 high scalability-2008-08-04-A Bunch of Great Strategies for Using Memcached and MySQL Better Together</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've

<p>Introduction: Wikipedia andWikimediahave some of the best, most complete real-world
documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas
Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an
overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid,
lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN, how
caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how
they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle
load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of
configuration files. This is a really useful resource.Related

<p>Introduction: The BBC's iPlayer site averages 8 million page views a day for 1.3 million
users. Technical Architect Simon Frost describes how they scaled their site
inScaling the BBC iPlayer to handle demand:Use frameworks. Frameworks support
component based development which makes it convenient for team development,
but can introduce delays that have to be minimized. Zend/PHP is used because
it supports components and is easy to recruit for.  MySQL is used for program
metadata. CouchDB is used for key-value access for fast read/write of user-
focused data.Prove architecture before building it. Eliminate guesswork by
coming up with alternate architectures and create prototypes to determine
which option works best. Balance performance with factors like ease of
development.Cache a lot. Data is cached in memcached for a few seconds to
minutes. Short cache invalidation periods keep the data up to date for the
users, but even these short periods make a huge difference in performance.

<p>Introduction: Snoozeis an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual
machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly to other VM
management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it
allows to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources.
Particularly, once installed and configured users can submit and control the
life-cycle of a large number of VMs. However, contrary to existing frameworks
for scalability and fault tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and
healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it
performs distributed VM management and is designed to be energy efficient.
Therefore, it implements features to monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU,
memory, network Rx, network Tx) demands, detect and resolve overload/underload
situations, perform dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and
finally power management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a
generic scheduler</p><p>6 0.8151378 <a title="908-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-04-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_February_4%2C_2010.html">771 high scalability-2010-02-04-Hot Scalability Links for February 4, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>3 0.12439735 <a title="883-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-11-So%2C_Why_is_Twitter_Really_Not_Using_Cassandra_to_Store_Tweets%3F.html">855 high scalability-2010-07-11-So, Why is Twitter Really Not Using Cassandra to Store Tweets?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A firestorm of accusations circled around recently saying that Cassandra, the
elected-by-major-adopters emperor of the NoSQL movement, has no clothes. It
was said Twitter was dumping Cassandra; Reddit outages were linked to
Cassandra; and even Facebook, Cassandra's cradle of birth, was said to have
abandoned Cassandra. Shouts of NoSQL Fail! were heard in the streets. Much
gloating followed. Is the emperor really naked? Casually dressed maybe, but
not naked.(Note: after this point the article contains a flow chart that is
NSFW. Some people are very sensitive about cussing, so if that's you, please
go back, don't read on. Danger! There are no nude pictures or anything, just
some strong language. But this is my most favorite flow chart of all time, so
it's worth it :-)Is Twitter really abandoning Cassandra? Not according to
Twitter, which came out with a post,Cassandra at Twitter Today, explaining
that they are using Cassandra in production for geolocation and analytics.

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>5 0.11615246 <a title="883-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-08-How_FarmVille_Scales_to_Harvest_75_Million_Players_a_Month.html">774 high scalability-2010-02-08-How FarmVille Scales to Harvest 75 Million Players a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several readers had follow-up questions in response to this article. Luke's
responses can be found inHow FarmVille Scales - The Follow-up.If real farming
was as comforting as it is inZynga's mega-hit Farmvillethen my family would
have probably never left those harsh North Dakota winters. None of the scary
bedtime stories my Grandma used to tell about farming are true in
FarmVille.Farmersmake money, plants grow, and animals never visit thered barn.
I guess it's just that keep-your-shoes-clean back-to-the-land charm that has
helped make FarmVille the "largest game in the world" in such an astonishingly
short time.How did FarmVille scale a web application to handle 75 million
players a month? Fortunately FarmVille's Luke Rajlich has agreed to let us in
on a few their challenges and secrets. Here's what Luke has to say...The
format of the interview was that I sent Luke a few general questions and he

Reusing Software- Iterating Because That’s What Computers Do Well- Premature
Optimization- Focusing on What You Can See Rather Than on the Problem-

<p>Introduction: NetApp MetroCluster SoftwareCost-effective is an integrated high-availability
storage cluster and site failover capability.NetApp MetroCluster is an
integrated high-availability and disaster recovery solution that can reduce
system complexity and simplify management while ensuring greater return on
investment. MetroCluster uses clustered server technology to replicate data
synchronously between sites located miles apart, eliminating data loss in case
of a disruption. Simple and powerful recovery process minimizes downtime, with
little or no user action required.At one company I worked at they used the
NetApp snap mirror feature to replicate data across long distances to multiple
datacenters. They had a very fast backbone and it worked well. The issue with
NetApp is always one of cost, but if you can afford it, it's a good option.</p><p>3 0.8676163 <a title="883-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-27-Paper%3A_XORing_Elephants%3A_Novel_Erasure_Codes_for_Big_Data.html">1483 high scalability-2013-06-27-Paper: XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure Codes for Big Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Erasure codesare one of those seemingly magical mathematical creations that
with the developments described in the paper XORing Elephants: Novel Erasure
Codes for Big Data, are set to replace triple replication as the data storage
protection mechanism of choice.The result says Robin Harris (StorageMojo) in
an excellent article, Facebook's advanced erasure codes: "WebCos will be able
to store massive amounts of data more efficiently than ever before. Bad news:
so will anyone else."Robin says with cheap disks triple replication made sense
and was economical. With ever bigger BigData the overhead has become costly.
But erasure codes have always suffered from unacceptably long time to repair
times. This paper describes new Locally Repairable Codes (LRCs) that are
efficiently repairable in disk I/O and bandwidth requirements:These systems
are now designed to survive the loss of up to four storage elements - disks,
servers, nodes or even entire data centers - without losing any data.

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your scaling pleasure, you may not  scale often, but when you
scale, please drink us:Quotably quotable quotes:@mardix: There is no single
point of truth in #NoSQL . #Consistency is no longer global, it's relative to
the one accessing it. #Scalability@kekline: RT @CurtMonash: "...from industry
figures, Basho/Riak is our third-biggest competitor." How often do you
encounter them? "Never have" #nosql@dave_jacobs: Love being in a city where I
can overhear a convo about Heroku scalability while doing deadlifts.

have *never* heard of it!?!@EventCloudPro: One of my vacation realizations?

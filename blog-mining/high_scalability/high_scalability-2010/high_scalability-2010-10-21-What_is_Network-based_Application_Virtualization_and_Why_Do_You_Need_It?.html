<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application
delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to
addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application
delivery tier of the data center. By Lori Mac Vittie, F5 Networks The "High
Scalability" blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not
disappoint with a posthighlighting a set of scalability design patternsthat
was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on "6 Ways to
Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way." Credit:Michael
Chow/azcentral.com  This particular post caught my attention primarily because
although I've touched on many of these patterns in the past, I've never
thought to call them what they are: scalability patterns. That's probably a
side-effect of forgetting thatbuilding an architecture of any kind is at its

<p>Introduction: This and the next post will discuss how virtualization and cloud computing, as
we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today's IT
inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much
simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core
inefficiencies lie. Virtualization principles must be extended to higher
levels of the application stack, to make it easier for all of us to manage,
tune and integrate applications. Otherwise we will continue to spend most of
our time on things that don't provide real value to the business.Read the full

<p>Introduction: Virtualization offers a lot of benefits, but it also comes with acost(memory,
CPU, network, IO, licensing). If you are in or running a cloud then some form
of virtualization may not even be an option. But if you are running your own
string of servers you can choose to go without. Free will and all that. Should
you or shouldn't you?In a detailed comparison the folks at37signalsfound
thatrunning their Rails application servers without virtualizationresulted inA
66% reduction in the response time while handling multiples of the traffic is
beyond what I expected.As is common 37signals runs their big database servers
without virtualization. They use a scale-up approach at the database tier so
extracting every bit of performance out of those servers is key. Application
servers typically use a scale-out approach for scalability, which is
virtualization friendly, but that says nothing about performance.Finding
performance increases, especially when you are running on a dynamic language
is a ch</p><p>5 0.23175658 <a title="924-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-09-Paper%3A_Container-based_Operating_System_Virtualization%3A_A_Scalable%2C_High-performance_Alternative_to_Hypervisors.html">147 high scalability-2007-11-09-Paper: Container-based Operating System Virtualization: A Scalable, High-performance Alternative to Hypervisors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One stumbling block of the the great march towards virtualization is the
relatively poor performance of resource hungry applications like databases. We
are told to develop and test using VMs, but deploy without them. Which kind of
sucks IMHO. Maybe better virtualization technology can remove this split. This
paper talks about a different approach to virtualization called "container-
based" virtualization that can reportedly double the performance of
traditional hypervisor systems like Xen. It does this by trading isolation for
efficiency. Rather than maintaining complete isolation between VMs the
container approach shares resources between VMs and thus gives higher
performance while still guaranteeing strong fault, resource, and security
isolation. It's yet another battle in computing's endless war of creating and
destroying abstraction layers. I learned a lot from from this paper because of
how it compared and contrasted traditional hypervisor and container based
virtualization strate</p><p>6 0.22098558 <a title="924-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization_and_Cloud_Computing_is_Changing_the_Network_to_East-West_Routing.html">1157 high scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization and Cloud Computing is Changing the Network to East-West Routing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>2 0.9761588 <a title="924-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-18-New_Relic_Architecture_-_Collecting_20%2B_Billion_Metrics_a_Day.html">1082 high scalability-2011-07-18-New Relic Architecture - Collecting 20+ Billion Metrics a Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Brian Doll, Application Performance Engineer at New
Relic.New Relic's multitenant, SaaS web application monitoring service
collects and persists over 100,000 metrics every second on a sustained basis,
while still delivering an average page load time of 1.5 seconds.  We believe
that good architecture and good tools can help you handle an extremely large
amount of data while still providing extremely fast service.  Here we'll show
you how we do it. New Relic is Application Performance Management (APM) as a

<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days - you only needed one, but then came along the
AS400's and soon you had ten - but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh
sh%# - now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and
datacenter operations!Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path?As a
technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other
CIO's on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context
to how they can leverage SpringCM' s easy, fast and affordable cloud
Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done
in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a
combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those
services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be
outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud
services.What options do I have?In a recent conversation with a CIO

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byNick Burling, VP of Product Management
ofBluestripe.Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance
optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis -- you hear about
them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest
technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS.People
don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an
infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work.At BlueStripe, we work
with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a
day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team
never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it theHidden DNS
Tax.What is the Hidden DNS Tax?The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance
hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end
architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune
10 company.A DNS lookup can fail, the user gets</p><p>5 0.96439707 <a title="924-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-28-How_to_Get_DNS_Names_of_a_Web_Server.html">290 high scalability-2008-03-28-How to Get DNS Names of a Web Server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the
DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that
will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains
mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web
server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server,
e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use
reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to
get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been
reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on
how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but
I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.The problem is that I'm
still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some
company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my questio</p><p>6 0.96284008 <a title="924-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-30-Scaling_Out_MySQL.html">292 high scalability-2008-03-30-Scaling Out MySQL</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The first meeting of this Online Gaming High Scalability SIG will be on the 9th of July 2009 in central London, starting at 10 AM and finishing around 5PM.  The main topic of this meeting will be potentials for using cloud and grid technologies in online gaming systems. In addition to experience reports from the community, we have invited some of the leading cloud experts in the UK to discuss the benefits such as resource elasticity and challenges such as storage and security that companies from other industries have experienced. We will have a track for IT managers focused on business opportunities and issues and a track for architects and developers more focused on implementation issues.

<p>Introduction: Surge  is a conference put on by OmniTI targeting practical Scalability matters. OmniTI specializes in helping people solve their scalability problems, as is only natural, as it was founded by Theo Schlossnagle, author of the canonical  Scalable Internet Architectures . 
 
Now that Surge 2011 is on the horizon, they've generously made available nearly all the  videos from the Surge 2010  conference.  A pattern hopefully every conference will follow (only don't wait a year please). We lose a lot of collective wisdom from events not being available online in a timely manner.
 
In truth, nearly  all the talks  are on topic and are worth watching, but here are a few that seem especially relevant:

<p>Introduction: In March, 2000, I  did a talk  about how we scaled with semi-static files while splitting data from presentation. For dynamic pages we used mod_perl doing an internal redirect with the XML on the style templates. Since then Apache 2.0 contains the concept of filters to allow for similar functionality.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.81395942 <a title="764-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-25-Designing_applications_for_cloud_deployment.html">764 high scalability-2010-01-25-Designing applications for cloud deployment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week – here is the summary of that presentation.﻿

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives  is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core architectures:  Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but Were Afraid to Ask .
 
The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't appear to be generically possible:
  
 None of the nine locking schemes we consider consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality,  a lock algorithm should thus be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload .  
  
Abstract:
  

This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures, from single-socket – uniform and nonuniform – to multi-socket – directory and broadcastbased – many-cores. We draw a set of observations t</p><p>5 0.64045274 <a title="764-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-DB2_Express-C.html">320 high scalability-2008-05-17-DB2 Express-C</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Searching around the HS website I noticed that there are no articles regarding db2, which has an express edition, free of charge and from what I know there aren't any restrictions.   Being a powerful database system I thought it could make be an alternative to MySQL, PostgreSQL databases.     Here is the IBM statement:   "DB2 Express Edition for Community (DB2 Express-C) is a no charge data server for use in development and deployment. DB2 Express-C supports a full range of APIs, drivers, and interfaces for application development including PHP, C/C++, and .NET. In addition, DB2 Express-C V9 contains advanced XML features. DB2 Express-C provides ISVs an ideal starting database server for Web, enterprise, and eBusiness applications.     This IBM Redbook provides fundamentals of DB2 application development with DB2 Express-C. It covers the DB2 Express-C installation and configuration for application development and skills and techniques for building DB2 applications with XML, PHP, C/C++,</p><p>6 0.53832924 <a title="764-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-24-11_Secrets_of_a_Cloud_Scale_Consultant_That_They_Dont%27_Want_You_to_Know.html">428 high scalability-2008-10-24-11 Secrets of a Cloud Scale Consultant That They Dont' Want You to Know</a></p>

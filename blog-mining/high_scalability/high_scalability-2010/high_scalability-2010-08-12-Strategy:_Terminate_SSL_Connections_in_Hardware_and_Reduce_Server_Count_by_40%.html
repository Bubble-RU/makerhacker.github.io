<p>Introduction: Ezra Zygmuntowicz in a heart warming account of his4 Years at Engine Yard, has
concluded in his experience that:the true future of cloud computing for
developers is to not think about servers at all. It is now time to focus on
the Application and new levels of abstraction that allow folks to use the
computing resources in easier and easier ways. Tweets of

complicated deployment. Thankfully, there is beer.jkalucki: Twitter isn't
down, you are just using the wrong access methods...andyedinborough: I don't
mean to hate, but why would I give up performance and scalability for a
dynamic language? Honestly, I don't get it.AsitSinha: It's amazing.... to see

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this beautiful morning:  Group Decision
Making in Honey Bee Swarms. In distributed computing systems nodes reach
aquorum when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum
logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:
A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act
and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow
the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether
they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating
the swarm's move to this site.Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.
Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being
a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.Fire! Fire!
Brent Chapman shows how to put that IT fire out in Incident Command for IT:

<p>Introduction: Monitor, monitor, monitor. That's the advice every startup gives once they
reach a certain size. But can you ever monitor enough? If you are Bitly and
everyone will complain when you are down, probably not.Here are 10 Things We
Forgot to Monitor from Bitly, along with good stories and copious amounts of
code snippets. Well worth reading, especially after you've already started
monitoring the lower hanging fruit.An interesting revelation from the article
is that:We run bitly split across two data centers, one is a managed
environment with DELL hardware, and the second is Amazon EC2.  Fork Rate. A
strange configuration issue caused processes to be created at a rate of
several hundred a second rather than the expected 1-10/second. Flow control

configured to disable them, can temporarily cause dropped traffic.Swap In/Out

<p>Introduction: InClient Side Load Balancing for Web 2.0 Applicationsauthor Lei Zhu suggests a
very interesting approach to load balancing: forget DNS round robbin, toss
your expensive load balancer, and make your client do the load balancing for
you. Your client maintains a list of possible servers and cycles through them.
All the details are explained in the article, but it's an intriguing idea,
especially for the budget conscious startup.</p><p>5 0.74084818 <a title="878-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-08-Paper%3A_Understanding_and_Building_High_Availability-Load_Balanced_Clusters.html">117 high scalability-2007-10-08-Paper: Understanding and Building High Availability-Load Balanced Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability
load balanced system using mod backhand andWackamole. The idea is you don't
need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of
the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-
based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read.
Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a
resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of
effect of keep-alives on performance.</p><p>6 0.73761964 <a title="878-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-22-Server_load_balancing_architectures%2C_Part_1%3A_Transport-level_load_balancing.html">426 high scalability-2008-10-22-Server load balancing architectures, Part 1: Transport-level load balancing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>3 0.99939805 <a title="878-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-03-Running_Hadoop_MapReduce_on_Amazon_EC2_and_Amazon_S3.html">56 high scalability-2007-08-03-Running Hadoop MapReduce on Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites tocache everything? Caching, if
not thesecret sauceof many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But
not so fast says Peter Zaitsev inBeyond great cache hit ratio. The point Peter
makes is that we read about websites likeAmazonandFacebook that can literally
make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome
cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all
those requests takes time. The solution is toremove requests all together. You
do this bycaching larger blocksso you have to make fewer requests. The post
has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small
as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control
invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>same-blog 6 0.99786872 <a title="878-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>

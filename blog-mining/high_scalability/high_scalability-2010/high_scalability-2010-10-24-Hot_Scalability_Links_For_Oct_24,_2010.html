<p>Introduction: In many of the recent discussions on the design of large scale systems (a.k.a. Web Scale) it was argued that the right set of tradeoffs for building large scale systems would be to give away  C onsistency for  A vailability and  P artition tolerance. Those arguments relied on the foundation of the CAP theorem developed in early 2000-2002. One of the core principals behind the CAP theorem is that you must choose two out of the three CAP properties. In many of the transactional systems giving away consistency is either impossible or yields a huge complexity in the design of those systems. In this series of posts, I've tried to suggest a different set of tradeoffs in which we could achieve scalability without compromising on consistency. I also argued that rather than choosing only two out of the three CAP properties we could choose various degrees of all three. The degrees would be determined by the most likely availability and partition tolerance scenarios in our specific application.</p><p>3 0.1441413 <a title="926-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP.html">921 high scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose the  right tool for the job . Everyone says that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to meet? How can I make all the tools work together?
 
In the NoSQL space this kind of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the trouble and risk.
 
Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to sol</p><p>5 0.11166555 <a title="926-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-17-Against_all_the_odds.html">658 high scalability-2009-07-17-Against all the odds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article not about Mariah Carey, or its song. It's about Storing System, Database.   
First let's describe what means by odds:  In my social network, I found 93% of the mainstream developers sanctify the database, or at least consider it in any data persistence challenge as the ultimate, superhero, and undefeatable solution.  I think this problem come from the education, personally, and some companies also I think it's involved in this.  To start to fix this bad thinking, we all should agree in the following points:
  
 Every challenge have its own solutions, so whatever you want to save/persistent, there are always many solutions. For example the Web search engines, such as: Google, Kngine, Yahoo, Bing don't use database at all instead we use Indexes (Index file) for better performance. 
   
 The Database in general whatever the vendor it's slow compared with other solutions such as: Key-Value storing system, Index file, DHT. 
   
 The Database currently employ Relation Data model</p><p>6 0.10970306 <a title="926-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-07-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Oct_8%2C_2010.html">916 high scalability-2010-10-07-Hot Scalability Links For Oct 8, 2010</a></p>

  @seveas : Scalability 103: Hardware sucks. Software sucks. Everything *will* break, prepare for failure of any component of your system. 
  bloodredsun : The long and short of it is that Cassandra is a fantastic system for write heavy situations. What it is not good at are read heavy situations where deterministic low latency is required, which is pretty much what the pinterest guys were dealing with.

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core architectures:  Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but Were Afraid to Ask .
 
The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't appear to be generically possible:
  
 None of the nine locking schemes we consider consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality,  a lock algorithm should thus be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload .  
  
Abstract:
  

This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures, from single-socket – uniform and nonuniform – to multi-socket – directory and broadcastbased – many-cores. We draw a set of observations t</p><p>same-blog 2 0.86029673 <a title="926-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-24-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Oct_24%2C_2010.html">926 high scalability-2010-10-24-Hot Scalability Links For Oct 24, 2010</a></p>

  Using MySQL as a NoSQL - A story for exceeding 750,000 qps on a commodity server  by Yoshinori Matsunobu. Wonderfully detailed post on how you can lookup a row by ID really fast if you bypass all the typical MySQL query parsing overhead.

For dynamic pages we used mod_perl doing an internal redirect with the XML on the style templates.

<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week – here is the summary of that presentation.﻿

<p>Introduction: If you’ve got the time, we’ve got the HighScalability:
  
 Google+:  90 million users ;  Internet 2011 : 2.1 billion Internet users, 1 trillion YouTube views, 5.9 billion mobile subscriptions; Fusion-io:  One Billion IOPS ; 12 atoms:  size of IBM's new memory bit ; 32 Million:  Stack monthly visitors ; Gmail:  350 Million Users ; TimTebow:  1.5 million Tweets  
 Quotable Quotes:           
 
  Similarity  : There is no canonical schema anymore. Instead you should ask: What high-volume queries will I need to serve with my data? Then work backwards from there. 
  @kvirjee  : Dis/Agree? -- "there is no problem but scalability, and architecture is its solution" 
  @robpegoraro  : Eternal vigilance can be crowdsourced.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo has developed a new language called Pig Latin that fit in a sweet spot
between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level,
procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.The
accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into
physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce
implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined
Hadoop as a subproject.The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo!
are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and
execution of their data analysis tasks, compared tousing Hadoop
directly.References:Apache Pig Wiki</p><p>3 0.18286459 <a title="851-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-17-Product%3A_Hadoop.html">601 high scalability-2009-05-17-Product: Hadoop</a></p>

Secondsand has itsgreen cred questionedbecause it took 40 times the number of
machines Greenplum used to do the same work.Update 4:Introduction to Pig. Pig
allows you to skip programming Hadoop at the low map-reduce level. You don't
have to know Java. Using the Pig Latin language, which is a scripting data
flow language, you can think about your problem as a data flow program. 10
lines of Pig Latin = 200 lines of Java.Update 3: Scaling Hadoop to4000 nodes

<p>Introduction: If Twitter is the "nervous system of the web" as some people think, then what
is the brain that makes sense of all those signals (tweets) from the nervous
system? That brain is the Twitter Analytics System and Kevin Weil, as
Analytics Lead at Twitter, is the homunculus within in charge of figuring out
what those over 100 billion tweets (approximately the number of neurons in the
human brain) mean.Twitter has only 10% of the expected 100 billion tweets now,
but a good brain always plans ahead. Kevin gave a talk,Hadoop and Protocol
Buffers at Twitter, at theHadoop Meetup, explaining how Twitter plans to use
all that data to an answer key business questions.What type of questions is
Twitter interested in answering? Questions that help them better understand
Twitter. Questions like:How many requests do we serve in a day?What is the
average latency?How many searches happen in day?How many unique queries, how
many unique users, what is their geographic distribution?What can we tell

<p>Introduction: Save 25% on Hadoop Conference TicketsApache Hadoop is a hot technology getting
traction all over the enterprise and in the Web 2.0 world. Now, there's going
to be a conference dedicated to learning more about Hadoop. It'll be Friday,
October 2 at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City.Hadoop World, as it's being
called, will be the first Hadoop event on the east coast. Morning sessions
feature talks by Amazon, Cloudera, Facebook, IBM, and Yahoo! Then it breaks
out into three tracks: applications, development / administration, and
extensions / ecosystems. In addition to the conference itself, there will also
be 3 days of training prior to the event for those looking to go deeper. In
addition to general sessions speakers, presenters include Hadoop project
creator Doug Cutting, as well as experts on large-scale data from Intel,
Rackspace, Softplayer, eHarmony, Supermicro, Impetus, Booz Allen Hamilton,
Vertica, About.com, and other companies.Readers get a 25% discount if you

amount of hardware that matters. It's the architecture of the application. You
have to work at making your app architecture so that it takes advantage of
Amazon. You have to have complete fluidity with the storage tier, the web
tier. We are running our own data centers. We are looking more at doing our

<p>Introduction: With the Chapultepec aqueduct, also namedthe great aqueduct, theAztecsbuilt a
novel uninterruptible water supply for providing fresh water to Tenochtitlan,
their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still
around today: It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built
with high availability in mind. We findengineers being engineers, no matter
the age:It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of
compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the
bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466
AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to
mitigate its thirst.The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of
Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of
the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got
dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe while the dirty pipe was
cleaned</p><p>4 0.89860302 <a title="851-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_22%2C_2011.html">1028 high scalability-2011-04-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 22, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A thoughtful reader recently suggested creating a series of posts based on
real-life problems people have experienced and the solutions they've created
to slay the little beasties. It's a great idea. Often we learn best from great
trials and tribulations. I'll start off the new "Problem Report"feature with a
diabolical little problem I dubbed the "Mobbing the Least Used Resource
Error." Please post your own. And if you know someone with an interesting
problem report, please tag them too. It could be a lot of fun. Of course, feel
free to scrub your posts of all embarrassing details, but be sure to keep the
heroic parts in :-)The ProblemThere's an unexpected and frequently fatal type
of error that can happen when new resources are added to a horizontally scaled
architecture. Because the new resource has the least of something, load or
connections or whatever, a load balancer configured with a least metric will
instantaneously direct all new traffic to that new resource. And bam! Your

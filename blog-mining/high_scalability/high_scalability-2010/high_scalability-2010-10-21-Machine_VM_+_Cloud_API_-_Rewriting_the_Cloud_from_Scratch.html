</p><p>9 From the paper:Frameworks which currently use (for example) fork(2) on a host to spawn processes would benefit from using cloud management APIs to request resources and eliminate the distinction between cores and hosts. [sent-11, score-0.285]

<p>Introduction: You program in a dynamic language, that runs on a JVM, that runs on a OS
designed40 years ago for a completely different purpose, that runs on
virtualized hardware. Does this make sense? We've talked about this idea
before inMachine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting The Cloud From Scratch, where the
vision is to treatcloud virtual hardware as a compiler target, and converting
high-level language source code directly into kernels that run on it.As new
technologies evolve the friction created by our old tool chains and
architecture models becomes ever more obvious. Take, for example, what
ateamatUCSD is releasing: aphase-change memory prototype  -a solid state
storage device that provides performance thousands of times faster than a
conventional hard drive and up to seven times faster than current state-of-
the-art solid-state drives (SSDs).However, PCM has access latencies several
times slower than DRAM.This technology has obvious mind blowing implications,

<p>Introduction: Snoozeis an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual
machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly to other VM
management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it
allows to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources.
Particularly, once installed and configured users can submit and control the
life-cycle of a large number of VMs. However, contrary to existing frameworks
for scalability and fault tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and
healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it
performs distributed VM management and is designed to be energy efficient.
Therefore, it implements features to monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU,
memory, network Rx, network Tx) demands, detect and resolve overload/underload
situations, perform dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and
finally power management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a
generic scheduler</p><p>4 0.14749417 <a title="923-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things we are seeing is more tools and tool chains for
performing very high level operations quite simply.Vagrantis such a tool
forbuilding and distributing virtualized development environments.Web
developers use virtual environments every day with their web applications.
From EC2 and Rackspace Cloud to specialized solutions such as EngineYard and
Heroku, virtualization is the tool of choice for easy deployment and
infrastructure management. Vagrant aims to take those very same principles and
put them to work in the heart of the application lifecycle. By providing easy
to configure, lightweight, reproducible, and portable virtual machines
targeted at development environments, Vagrant helps maximize your productivity
and flexibility.If you've created a build and deployment system before Vagrant
does a lot of the work for you:Automated virtual machine creation

<p>Introduction: Write a little "Hello World" program these days and it runs inside a
bewildering Russian Doll of nested environments, each layer adding its own
special performance and complexity tax. First, a language executes in its own
environment of data structure libraries, memory management, and so on. That,
more often than not, will run inside a language VM like the JVM, CLR, or V8.
The language VM will in-turn run inside a process that runs inside an OS. An
application will run in one or more threads inside a process. And the whole
thing will run inside a machine sharing VM layer like Xen. And across all of
that are frameworks for monitoring, elasticity, storage, and so on. That's a
lot of overhead for a such a little program.What if we could remove all these
taxes and run directly on the new bare metal, which some consider to be a
combination of Machine VM + Cloud API? That's exactly what a system
calledMirage, described in the paperTurning down the LAMP: Software

<p>Introduction: Ever wonder what powers Google's world spirit sensing Zeitgeist service? No,
it's not a homunculus ofGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel sitting in each browser.
It's actually a stream processing (think streaming MapReduce on steroids)
system called MillWheel, described in this very well written paper: MillWheel:
Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale. MillWheel isn't just used
for Zeitgeist at Google, it's also used for streaming joins for a variety of
Ads customers, generalized anomaly-detection service, and network switch and
cluster health monitoring.Abstract:MillWheel is a framework for building low-
latency data-processing applications that is widely used at Google. Users
specify a directed computation graph and application code for individual
nodes, and the system manages persistent state and the continuous ďŹ&sbquo;ow of
records, all within the envelope of the framework's fault-tolerance
guarantees. This paper describes MillWheel's programming model as well as its
implementation.</p><p>4 0.9339385 <a title="923-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_3%2C_2012.html">1297 high scalability-2012-08-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 3, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: ThePort Network's Director of Engineering, TJ Muehleman was kind of enough to
share some of the architectural details for their white label social media
system. It currently runs about 50 social networks varying in size from less
than 1000 members to more than 300,000 members, all on a Microsoft stack. In
addition to their social networking platform, they offer Javascript APIs and
web service APIs (both REST and SOAP) which account for a significant
percentage of overall system usage.ThePort is an excellent example of a real
world in-the-trenches product offering real value to customers. One of the
most interesting problems they have to solve is multi-tenancy. How do you
provide good performance, complete customization, support, develop new
features, and provide individual search indexes for each customer? It's not an
easy problem to solve.How did they solve their problems and build a successful
system? Site: http://theport.comPlatformMicrosoft.NET 3.5C# / VB.NETSQL Server

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>6 0.14490283 <a title="802-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-25-Product%3A_Puppet_the_Automated_Administration_System.html">429 high scalability-2008-10-25-Product: Puppet the Automated Administration System</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: Facebook pulls a Microsoft and embraces and extends by opening their
platform to other social sites like Bebo. Very smart and unexpected. More info
atFacebook to let other sites access platform code.This month's regular
FacebookMeetupwas held at Google and the topic of the day wasOpenSocial. For
those of you with real lives, OpenSocial "provides a common set of APIs for
social applications across multiple websites." Over 200 excited people, hoping
to do very exciting things, and dreaming of making an exciting pile of money,
watched an OpenSocial presentation put on by a couple of appropriately
knowledgeable evangelists. I could feel my social graph being more
successfully monetized with each passing minute.Normally the meetings are much
smaller, but Google puts on a very nice spread, so I think people may have
showed up to dine :-) Or they could have showed up to learn why and how they
should code to the new uber social API. By the looks of the full plates and

<p>Introduction: The ever amazingslime moldis not the only way to solve complex compute
problems without performing calculations. There is another:soap film.
Unfortunately for soap film it isn't nearly as photogenic as slime mold, all
we get are boring looking pictures, but the underlying idea is still
fascinating and ten times less spooky.As a quick introduction we'll lean on
Long Ouyang, who has really straightforward  explanation of how soap film
works inApproaching P=NP: Can Soap Bubbles Solve The Steiner Tree Problem In
Polynomial.It's computers, so playing the role of the motivating graph problem
we have theSteiner tree problem, which Ouyang explains as:Find the minimum
spanning tree for a bunch of vertices, given that you can add additional
points.Soap helps solve this problem because:Soap, in water, acts a
surfactant, which decreases the surface tension in water.This acts to minimize
the surface energy of the liquid.This should minimize surface area (graph
weight), and solve the problem.Dip two</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89820749 <a title="802-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-01-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_April_1%2C_2010.html">802 high scalability-2010-04-01-Hot Scalability Links for April 1, 2010</a></p>

Distinguishing Two Major Types of Column-Storesby Daniel Abadi.I have noticed
that Bigtable, HBase, Hypertable, and Cassandra are being called column-stores
with increasing frequency, due to their ability to store and access column
families separately. This makes them appear to be in the same category as
column-stores such as Sybase IQ, C-Store, Vertica, VectorWise, MonetDB,
ParAccel, and Infobright, which also are able to access columns
separately.Cloud Economics, By The Square Footby Rich Miller.But cloud

<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word
alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and
the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world
is:the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more
dough for many more cookies. It’s the difference between making enough dough
in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.Hey, pretty close to
the website notion. Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be
tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed
to do (quoted from the article):Be Patient- When making large batches of
cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.Use
Fresh Ingredients- This is always an important thing to keep in mind.Don’t use
as much leavening- When you’re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember
to scale down the amount of baking powder that you use.Watch the spice- As a

<p>Introduction: I am planning the scaling of a hosted service, similar to typepad etc. and
would appreciate feedback on my plan so far.Looking into scaling storage, I
have come accross MogileFS and OpenAFS. My concern with these is I am not at
all experienced with them and as the sole tech guy I don't want to build
something into this hosting service that proves complex to update and
adminster.So, I'm thinking of building replication and scalability right into
the application, in a similar but simplified way to how MogileFS works (I
think).So, for our database table of uploaded files, here's how it currently
looks (simplified):fileid (pkey)filenameowneridFor adding the replication and
scalability, I would add a few more
columns:serveroneidservertwoidserverthreeids3At the time the user uploads a
file, it will go to a specific server (managed by the application) and the id
of that server will be placed in the "serverone" column. Then hourly or so, a
cron job will run through the "files" table, and copy</p><p>6 0.80865526 <a title="802-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-12-P2P_server_technology%3F.html">598 high scalability-2009-05-12-P2P server technology?</a></p>

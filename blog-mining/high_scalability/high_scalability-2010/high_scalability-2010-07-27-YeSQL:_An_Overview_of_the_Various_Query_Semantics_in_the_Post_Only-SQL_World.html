<p>Introduction: Jonathan Ellis reviews in theNoSQL Ecosystem the origin of the NoSQL movement
and 10 different NoSQL products and how their 1) support for multiple
datacenters,  2) the ability to add new machines to a live cluster
transparently to the your applications, 3) Data Model, 4) Query API, 5)
Persistence Design. The 10 systems reviewed are: Cassandra, CouchDB, HBase,
MongoDB, Neo4J, Redis, Riak, Scalaris, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort.A very
thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the
article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of
approaches to not being a relational database.Related ArticlesNOSQL = Not Only

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at
giving a wide range o</p><p>4 0.14225861 <a title="867-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>5 0.13914165 <a title="867-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-09-No_to_SQL%3F_Anti-database_movement_gains_steam_%E2%80%93_My_Take.html">654 high scalability-2009-07-09-No to SQL? Anti-database movement gains steam â€“ My Take</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Matt Aslett from the 451 group created a term called"NewSQL". On the
definition of NewSQL, Aslett writes:"NewSQL" is our shorthand for the various
new scalable/high performance SQL database vendors. We have previously
referred to these products as 'ScalableSQL' to differentiate them from the
incumbent relational database products. Since this implies horizontal
scalability, which is not necessarily a feature of all the products, we
adopted the term 'NewSQL' in the new report.And to clarify, like NoSQL, NewSQL
is not to be taken too literally: the new thing about the NewSQL vendors is
the vendor, not the SQL.As with NoSQL, under the NewSQL umbrella you can see
various providers, with various solutions.I think these can be divided into
several sub-types:New MySQL storage engines. These give MySQL users the same
programming interface, but scale very well. You can Xeround or Akiban in this
field. The good part is that you still use MySQL, but on the downside it's not
supporting other databa</p><p>4 0.7190432 <a title="867-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-25-Google_Goes_MoreSQL_with_Tenzing_-__SQL_Over_MapReduce_.html">1181 high scalability-2012-01-25-Google Goes MoreSQL with Tenzing -  SQL Over MapReduce </a></p>
<p>Introduction: MoreSQL is a cheeky idea Alex Tatiyants invented inNoSQL No More: Let's double
down with MoreSQL advocating that the cure for NoSQL is not less SQL, but even
more SQL. Use SQL everywhere, for everything. This is of course creates yet
another NewSQL. Hopefully we've exhausted all tasteful variants of the SQL
motif. While the post is ironic (I think), Google may be into MoreSQL in a big
way, as described in a well written and exceptionally detailed paper:Tenzing -
A SQL Implementation On The MapReduce Framework. If you are looking for the
secrets of how to get back to the good old days of joins and aggregate
operators using a SQL syntax, while enjoying the scalability of NoSQL, this
paper is a must read.Abstract:Tenzing is a query engine built on top of
MapReduce for ad hoc analysis of Google data. Tenzing supports a mostly
complete SQL implementation (with several extensions) combined with several

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Data storage has always been one of the most difficult problems
to address, especially as the quantity of stored data is constantly
increasing. This is not simply due to the growing numbers of people regularly
using the Internet, particularly with all the social networks, games and
gizmos now available. Companies are also amassing more and more meticulous
information relevant to their business, in order to optimize productivity and
ROI (Return On Investment). I find the positioning of SQL and NoSQL (Not Only
SQL) as opposites rather a shame: it's true that the marketing wave of NoSQL
has enabled the renewed promotion of a system that's been around for quite a
while, but which was only rarely considered in most cases, as after all,
everything could be fitted into the Â« good old SQL model Â». The reverse trend
of wanting to make everything fit the NoSQL model is not very profitable
either.So, what'</p><p>6 0.7120927 <a title="867-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-15-The_Common_Principles_Behind_the_NOSQL_Alternatives.html">749 high scalability-2009-12-15-The Common Principles Behind the NOSQL Alternatives</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The NoSQL movement faults the SQL query language as the source of many of the
scalability issues that we face today with traditional database approach.I
think that the main reason so many people have come to see SQL as the source
of all evil is the fact that, traditionally, the query language was burned
into the database implementation. So by saying NoSQL you basically say "No" to
the traditional non-scalable RDBMS implementations.This view has brought on a
flood of alternative query languages, each aiming to solve a different aspect
that is missing in the traditional SQL query approach, such as a document
model, or that provides a simpler approach, such as Key/Value query.Most of
the people I speak with seem fairly confused on this subject, and tend to use
query semantics and architecture interchangeably. InPart Iof this post i tried
to provide quick overview of what each query term stands for in the context of
the NoSQL world .Part II illustrates those ideas using  code examples from</p><p>2 0.92988467 <a title="867-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-27-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_27%2C_2011.html">1048 high scalability-2011-05-27-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 27, 2011</a></p>

Internet.SmugMug estimates 50%of their CPU is spent serving crawler robots.
Having a common meta-data repository wouldn't prevent search engines from
having their own special sauce. Then the problem becomes one of syncing data
between repositories and processing change events. A generous soul could even
offer a shared MapReduce service over the data. Now that wouldspeed up the
internet.Scaling Achievements:YouTube Sees 3 Billion Views per Day;Twitter
produces a sustained feed of 35 Mb per second; companies processing billions
of APIs calls (Twitter, Netflix, Amazon, NPR, Google, Facebook, eBay, Bing);

Sync is used to copy large files around. Raspberry Pi is a cheap low power

cloud that provides a web interface for file access files from anywhere.This
is different. Funding astartup using Airbnb as a source of start-up capital.

<p>Introduction: Many people in the Apache Hadoop community have asked Yahoo! to publish the
version of Apache Hadoop they test and deploy across their large Hadoop
clusters. As a service to the Hadoop community, Yahoo is releasing the Yahoo!
Distribution of Hadoop -- a source code distribution that is based entirely on
code found in the Apache Hadoop project.This source distribution includes code
patches that they have added to improve the stability and performance of their
clusters. In all cases, these patches have already been contributed back to
Apache, but they may not yet be available in an Apache release of Hadoop.Read

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by BugSense Founder/CTO Jon Vlachogiannisand Head of
Infrastructure at BugSensePanagiotis Papadomitsos.There has been a lot of
speculation and assumptions around whetherPRISMexists and if it is cost
effective. I don't know whether it exists or not, but I can tell you if it
could be built.Short answer: It can.If you believe it would be impossible for
someone with access to a social "datapool" to find out more about you (if they
really want to track you down) in the tsunami of data, you need to think
again.Devices, apps and websites are transmitting data. Lots of data. The
questions are could the data compiled and searched and how costly would it be
to search for your targeted data. (hint: It is not $4.56 trillion).Let's
experiment and try to build PRISM by ourselves with a few
assumptions:Assumption 1: We have all the appropriate "data connectors" that
will provide us with data.Assumption 2: These connectors provide direct access
to social networks, emails, mobile t</p><p>6 0.9112094 <a title="867-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-17-Product%3A_Hadoop.html">601 high scalability-2009-05-17-Product: Hadoop</a></p>

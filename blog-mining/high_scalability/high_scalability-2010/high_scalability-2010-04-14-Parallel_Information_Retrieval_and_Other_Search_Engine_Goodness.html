<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking The
Datacenter as a Computer book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I
would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!John Fries in aG+
commenthas what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the
book:It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by
interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the
entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and
realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter
anymoreIt's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize
simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to
warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware;
datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to
deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key

<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do
something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one
Ilya Grigorik, Developer Advocate,Make the Web Fastat Google, and author of a
great new book:High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer
should know about networking and web performance. That's a big topic you might
be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed
pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It's like
a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.In case you are not familiar
with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For
years Ilya has been producing excellent content onhis blog and if yousearch
YouTube you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the
book. Authority established.Reading the book I was struck by what a
complicated beast or little World Wide Web has become. That's clear from just

<p>Introduction: We're implementing a website which should be oriented to content and with
massive access by public and we would need a search engine to index and
execute queries on the indexes of contents (stored in a database, most likely
MySQL InnoDB or Oracle).The solution we found is to implement a separate
service to make index constantly the contents of the database at regular
intervals. Anyway, this is a complex and not optimal solution, since we would
like it to index in real time and make it searchable.Could you point me to
some examples or articles I could review to design asolution for such this
context?</p><p>5 0.12688598 <a title="810-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-24-INFOSCALE_2009_in_June_in_Hong_Kong.html">580 high scalability-2009-04-24-INFOSCALE 2009 in June in Hong Kong</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In case you are interested here's the info:INFOSCALE 2009: The 4th
International ICST Conference on Scalable Information Systems. 10-12 June
2009, Hong Kong, China.In the last few years, we have seen the proliferation
of the use of heterogeneous distributed systems, ranging from simple Networks
of Workstations, to highly complex grid computing environments. Such
computational paradigms have been preferred due to their reduced costs and
inherent scalability, which pose many challenges to scalable systems and
applications in terms of information access, storage and retrieval.Grid
computing, P2P technology, data and knowledge bases, distributed information
retrieval technology and networking technology should all converge to address
the scalability concern. Furthermore, with the advent of emerging computing
architectures - e.g. SMTs, GPUs, Multicores. - the importance of designing
techniques explicitly targeting these systems is becoming more and more
important.INFOSCALE 2009 will focus o</p><p>6 0.12102187 <a title="810-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-30-Paper%3A_GraphLab%3A_A_New_Framework_For_Parallel_Machine_Learning.html">850 high scalability-2010-06-30-Paper: GraphLab: A New Framework For Parallel Machine Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Inspired by axkcd comic,Peter Norvig,Director of Research at Google and all
around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving
a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful
systems profiled on HighScalability.The original code is atxkcd 1313: Regex
Golf, which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the
winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is
readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but
soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find
regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's
deliberate strategy for finding a regex.The post demonstrating the iterated
improvement of the program is atxkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite
Problems). As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the
program Peter recommends the following steps: Profiling: Figure out where the
program spends its time. Speed</p><p>5 0.73839682 <a title="810-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-08-Search_fast_in_million_rows.html">342 high scalability-2008-06-08-Search fast in million rows</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have a table .This table has many columns but search performed based on 1
columns ,this table can have more than million rows.The data in these columns
is something like funny,new york,hollywoodUser can search with parameters as
funny hollywood .I need to take this 2 words and then search on column whether
that column contain this words and how many times .It is not possible to index
here .If the results return say 1200 results then without comparing each and
every column i can't determine no of results.I need to compare for each and
every column.This query is very frequent .How can i approach for this
problem.What type of architecture,tools is helpful.I just know that this can
be accomplished with distributed system but how can i make this system. I also
see in this website that LinkedIn uses Lucene for search .Is Lucene is helpful
in my case.My table has also lots of insertion ,however updation in not very
frequent.</p><p>6 0.7368601 <a title="810-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-28-Job_queue_and_search_engine.html">332 high scalability-2008-05-28-Job queue and search engine</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Parallel Information Retrievalis a sample chapter in what appears to be a
book-in-progress titledInformation Retrieval Implementing and Evaluation
Search EnginesbyStefan Buttcher, Google Inc andCharles L. A. Clarke,Gordon V.
Cormack, both of the University of Waterloo. The full table of contents is on-
line and looks to be really interesting:Information retrieval is the
foundation for modern search engines. This text offers an introduction to the
core topics underlying modern search technologies, including algorithms, data
structures, indexing, retrieval, and evaluation. The emphasis is on
implementation and experimentation; each chapter includes exercises and
suggestions for student projects.Currently available is the full text of
chapters: Introduction, Basic Techniques, Static Inverted Indices, Index
Compression, and Parallel Information Retrieval. Parallel Information

<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy thatthe best method to analyse spam is to become a
spammer, this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely
researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part
Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that
their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they
figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales
they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.Two different spam campaigns were
run on aStormbotnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-
peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide
computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit
new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to
download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the
executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon. The

<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novicexI am starting
a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality
possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).I have done some
research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I
have some basic knowledge on these.Following are my requirements1) My budget
is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).2)
I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first
2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And
more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)3)
90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.Based on the above,
could you please answer my following questions?1) Can I go with just a good
dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site
gets big? Or do you think its wise to start with a CDN service?2) Should I</p><p>6 0.87236375 <a title="810-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_22%2C_2013.html">1411 high scalability-2013-02-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 22, 2013</a></p>

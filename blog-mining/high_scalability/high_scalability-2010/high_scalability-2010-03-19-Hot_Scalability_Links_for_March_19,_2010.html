will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Werner VogelsDr. Werner Vogels is Vice President & Chief
Technology Officer at Amazon.com where he is responsible for driving the
company’s technology vision, which is to continuously enhance the innovation
on behalf of Amazon’s customers at a global scale. Prior to joining Amazon, he
worked as a researcher at Cornell University where he was a principal
investigator in several research projects that target the scalability and
robustness of mission-critical enterprise computing systems. He is regarded as
one of the world's top experts on ultra-scalable systems and he uses his
weblog to educate the community about issues such as eventual consistency.

operations using a graph database.If you areDiggorLinkedInyou can build your
own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network
relationships. For those of more modest meansNeo4j, a graph database, is a
good alternative.A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges
(relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs)
on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to
represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships
are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and
relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look
at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for
relationships."A graph looks something like:For more lovely examples take a

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>5 0.14832346 <a title="797-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-06-Graph_server.html">621 high scalability-2009-06-06-Graph server</a></p>

data across the world. Marko Rodriguez in Memoirs of a Graph Addict: Despair
to Redemption tells a stirring tale of how graph programming saved the world
from certain destruction by realizing Aritstotle's dream of an eudaimonia-
driven society. Could a relational database do that? The tools of the
revolution can be found at tinkerprop.com, which describes a databases
agnostic stack for working with property graphs, they include Blueprints - a
property graph model interface; Pipes - a dataflow netowork using process
grapphs; Gremlin - a graph based programming language; Rexster - a RESTful

<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most
of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to
the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez
introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide
web of data.Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on
the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10
billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for
applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, withthe
Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible
to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge
structure. This talk will discuss graph databases, their underlying data
model, their querying mechanisms, and the benefits of the graph data structure
for modeling and analysis.</p><p>4 0.66299742 <a title="797-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-26-Product%3A_HyperGraphDB_-_A_Graph_Database.html">766 high scalability-2010-01-26-Product: HyperGraphDB - A Graph Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With the success ofNeo4jas a graph database in the NoSQL revolution, it's
interesting to see another graph database,HyperGraphDB, in the mix. Their
quick blurb on HyperGraphDB says it is a:general purpose, extensible,
portable, distributed, embeddable, open-source data storage mechanism. It is a
graph database designed specifically for artificial intelligence and semantic
web projects, it can also be used as an embedded object-oriented database for
projects of all sizes.From theNoSQL Archivethe summary on HyperGraphDB is:
API:Java(and Java Langs), Written in:Java,  Query Method:Javaor P2P,
Replication:P2P, Concurrency:STM, Misc: Open-Source, Especially for AI and
Semantic Web.So it has some interesting features, like software transactional
memory andP2P  for data distribution, but I found that my first and most
obvious question was not answered: what the heck is ahypergraphand why do I
care? Buried in the tutorial was:A HyperGraphDB database is a generalized

<p>Introduction: Lots of good ones this week...Scalability, Availability & Stability Patterns.
Jonas Boner has 197 slides covering a very wide range of scalability topics.
One stop scalability shopping.Horizontal Scalability via Transient, Shardable,
and Share-Nothing Resources. Heroku's Adam Wiggins shares what they've learned
about scaling based on their experiences building a cloud platform and the
hundreds of apps running on it. He describes the next generation architecture
he thinks all software should follow in the future.Scalability of the Hadoop
Distributed File System. Konstantin V. Shvachko writes a great post analyzing
if thelimitations imposed on a distributed file system by the single-node
namespace server architecturecan support 100,000 clients and petabytes of
files.Cassandra by Example. Eric Evans created a nice Cassandra tutorial using
building a Twitter clone as an example. Many people want to see more data
modeling examples. Here you are.UpSizeR: Synthetically Scaling Up a Given

<p>Introduction: i didnt find a nearly good solution for this problem yet:imagine, you're
responsible for a small CDN network (static images), with two different
datacenter. the balancing for the two DC is done with a anycast nameservice (a
nameserver in every DC, user gets on nearest location). so, one of the
scenario is that one of the datacenters goes down completly. you can do a
monitoring on the nameserver and only route to the dc which is still alive, no
problem. But what about the TTL from the DNS-Records? Tiny TTLs like 2 min.
are often ignored by several ISP (e.g. AOL). so, the client doesn't get the IP
from the other Datacenter. what could be a solution in this scenario?</p><p>2 0.88246191 <a title="797-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler%2C_Cheaper%2C_Faster%3A_Playtomic%27s_Move_from_.NET_to_Node_and_Heroku.html">1340 high scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler, Cheaper, Faster: Playtomic's Move from .NET to Node and Heroku</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO ofPlaytomic. Playtomic is a game
analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games
played by approximately 20 million people daily.Here's a good summary quote by
Ben Lowry on Hacker News:Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday
700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is
integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just
yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people
operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated
a whole bunch of them very cheaply.Playtomic began with an almost exclusively
Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being
replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire
platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then
spread to second dedicated, then the API server was offloaded to a VPS
provider and 4 - 6 fairl</p><p>same-blog 3 0.87661439 <a title="797-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-19-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_March_19%2C_2010.html">797 high scalability-2010-03-19-Hot Scalability Links for March 19, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One stumbling block of the the great march towards virtualization is the
relatively poor performance of resource hungry applications like databases. We
are told to develop and test using VMs, but deploy without them. Which kind of
sucks IMHO. Maybe better virtualization technology can remove this split. This
paper talks about a different approach to virtualization called "container-
based" virtualization that can reportedly double the performance of
traditional hypervisor systems like Xen. It does this by trading isolation for
efficiency. Rather than maintaining complete isolation between VMs the
container approach shares resources between VMs and thus gives higher
performance while still guaranteeing strong fault, resource, and security
isolation. It's yet another battle in computing's endless war of creating and
destroying abstraction layers. I learned a lot from from this paper because of
how it compared and contrasted traditional hypervisor and container based
virtualization strate</p><p>5 0.82507759 <a title="797-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-21-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_21%2C_2013.html">1479 high scalability-2013-06-21-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 21, 2013</a></p>

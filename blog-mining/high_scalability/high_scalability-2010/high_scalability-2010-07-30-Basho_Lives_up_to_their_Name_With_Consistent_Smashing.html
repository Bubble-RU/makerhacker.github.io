<p>Introduction: hi,   the website i work for is looking to build a email system that can handle a fair few emails (up to a hundred thousand a day).     These comprise emails like registration emails, newsletters, lots of user triggered emails and overnight emails.     At present we queue them in SQL and feed them into an smtp server on one of our web servers when the queue drops below a certain level.     this has caused our mail system to crash as well as hammer our DB server (shared!!!).     We have got an architecture of what we want to build but thought there might be something we could buy off the shelf that allowed us to keep templated emails, lists of recipients, schedule sends etc and report on it. We can't find anything     What do big websites like amazon etc use or people a little smaller but who still send loads of mail (flickr, ebuyer, or other ecommerce sites)     Cheers     tarqs</p><p>3 0.087238729 <a title="868-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-06-An_Unorthodox_Approach_to_Database_Design_%3A_The_Coming_of_the_Shard.html">672 high scalability-2009-08-06-An Unorthodox Approach to Database Design : The Coming of the Shard</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Why you don’t want to shard.  by Morgon on the MySQL Performance Blog.  Optimize everything else first, and then if performance still isn’t good enough, it’s time to take a very bitter medicine.    Update 3:   Building Scalable Databases: Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemes  by Dare Obasanjo. Excellent discussion of why and when you would choose a sharding architecture, how to shard, and problems with sharding.  Update 2:   Mr. Moore gets to punt on sharding  by Alan Rimm-Kaufman of 37signals. Insightful article on design tradeoffs and the evils of premature optimization. With more memory, more CPU, and new tech like SSD,  problems can be avoided before more exotic architectures like sharding are needed.  Add features not infrastructure.  Jeremy Zawodny  says he's wrong wrong wrong. we're running multi-core CPUs at slower clock speeds. Moore won't save you.

<p>Introduction: Mozilla processes TB's of Firefox crash reports daily using HBase, Hadoop, Python and Thrift protocol. The project is called  Socorro , a system for collecting, processing, and displaying crash reports from clients. Today the Socorro application stores about 2.6 million crash reports per day. During peak traffic, it receives about 2.5K crashes per minute. 
 
In this article we are going to demonstrate a proof of concept showing how Mozilla could integrate Hazelcast into Socorro and achieve caching and processing 2TB of crash reports with 50 node Hazelcast cluster. The video for the demo is available  here .
 
      
 
Currently, Socorro has pythonic collectors, processors, and middleware that communicate with HBase via the Thrift protocol. One of the biggest limitations of the current architecture is that it is very sensitive to latency or outages on the HBase side. If the collectors cannot store an item in HBase then they will store it on local disk and it will not be accessible to th</p><p>5 0.071905792 <a title="868-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc_-_Database_Clustering_via_JDBC.html">151 high scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc - Database Clustering via JDBC</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Practically any software project nowadays could not survive without a database (DBMS) backend storing all the business data that is vital to you and/or your customers. When projects grow larger, the amount of data usually grows larger exponentially. So you start moving the DBMS to a separate server to gain more speed and capacity. Which is all good and healthy but you do not gain any extra safety for this business data. You might be backing up your database once a day so in case the database server crashes you don't lose EVERYTHING, but how much can you really afford to lose?Â 
 
Well clearly this depends on what kind of data you are storing. In our case the users of our solutions use our software products to do their everyday (all day) work. They have "everything" they need for their business stored in the database we are providing. So is 24 hours of data loss acceptable? No, not really. One hour? Maybe. But what we really want is a second database running with the EXACT same data.

<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server, e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.     The problem is that I'm still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my qu</p><p>4 0.48093745 <a title="868-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Product%3A_ISPMan_Centralized_ISP_Management_System_.html">228 high scalability-2008-01-28-Product: ISPMan Centralized ISP Management System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  FRESH Ports  and their website:    ISPman  is an ISP management software written in perl, using an LDAP backend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP.  It can be used to manage, DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration, cyrus mail boxes, proftpd etc.    
 
 ISPMan was written as a management tool for the network at 4unet where between 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is crazily growing. Managing these domains and their users was a little time consuming, and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these daemons fluently.  Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and users.  LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server can be scaled from 1 to n as required.  An LDAP entry called maildrop tells the SMTP server (postfix) where to deliver the mail.  The SMTP servers can be loadbalanced with one of many load balancing techniques.  The program is written with scalability and High availability in mind.  This may not be the right s</p><p>5 0.47450295 <a title="868-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-10-Is_there_a_difference_between_partitioning_and_federation_and_sharding%3F.html">89 high scalability-2007-09-10-Is there a difference between partitioning and federation and sharding?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unlike Theo Schlossnagle, author of   Scalable Internet Architectures  , I am not a stickler for semantics because I have an unswerving faith in the ultimate unknowability of the world as experienced by others. That's why it is Theo who bravely tackles the differences in his informative blog post   Partitioning vs. Federation vs. Sharding  . Royans Tharakan also talks about it on his   blog  .   Is there a difference and does it really matter to all our intrepid scalable website builders?            Generally whatever Theo says is probably close to the truth. Yet, in my mind I think of partitioning as a   basic level category   and federation and sharding as more specific (subordinate) instances of partitioning. And partitioning is a more specific instance of the more more general (superordinate) category divide-and-conquer. Which isn't a useful way to think about the topic at all.     So, let's say federation is like Star Trek.

<p>Introduction: For some Friday Fun nerd style, I thought this  demonstration from Basho  on the difference between single master, sharding, and consistent smashing was really clever. I love the use of safety glasses! And it's harder to crash a server with a hammer than you might think...

<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a firm schema.  I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding.  The data is essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song.  This lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together.  This will be in a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by artist album or song.  By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by.  The problem is that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it?  Should I go with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table?  Perhaps it might</p><p>3 0.58212572 <a title="868-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-08-Paper%3A_Understanding_and_Building_High_Availability-Load_Balanced_Clusters.html">117 high scalability-2007-10-08-Paper: Understanding and Building High Availability-Load Balanced Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability load balanced system using mod backhand and  Wackamole . The idea is you don't need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read. Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of effect of keep-alives on performance.</p><p>4 0.54950392 <a title="868-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-20-what_is_j2ee_stack.html">162 high scalability-2007-11-20-what is j2ee stack</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Flickr's lone database guy Dathan Pattishall made his excellent presentation available on how on how Flickr scales its backend to handle tremendous loads. Some of this information is available in  Flickr Architecture , but the paper is so good it's worth another read.

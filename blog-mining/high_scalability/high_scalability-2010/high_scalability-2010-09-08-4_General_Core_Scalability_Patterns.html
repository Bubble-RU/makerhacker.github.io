The “ High Scalability ” blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not disappoint with a post  highlighting a set of scalability design patterns  that was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on “ 6 Ways to Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way. ”

<p>Introduction: Jesper Söderlund not only put together a few interesting  scalability patterns , he also came up with a few interesting  scalability lessons :
  
  Lesson #1 . Put Smarty compile and template caches on an active-active DRBD cluster with high load and your servers will DIE! 
  Lesson #2 . Don't use out-of-the-box configurations. 
  Lesson #3 . Single points of contention will eventually become a bottleneck. 
  Lesson #4 . Plan in advance.  
  Lesson #5 . Offload your databases as much as possible. 
  Lesson #6 . File systems matter and can run out of space / inodes.

<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture principles then take a look at Will Larson's  Introduction to Architecting Systems for Scale . Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:

<p>Introduction: Making Hadoop Run Faster   
 

One of the challenges in processing data is that the speed at which we can input data is quite often much faster than the speed at which we can process it. This problem becomes even more pronounced in the context of Big Data, where the volume of data keeps on growing, along with a corresponding need for more insights, and thus the need for more complex processing also increases.


 Batch Processing to the Rescue 


Hadoop was designed to deal with this challenge in the following ways:


1. Use a distributed file system: This enables us to spread the load and grow our system as needed.


2. Optimize for write speed: To enable fast writes the Hadoop architecture was designed so that writes are first logged, and then processed. This enables fairly fast write speeds.


3. Use batch processing (Map/Reduce) to balance the speed for the data feeds with the processing speed.


 Batch Processing Challenges 


The challenge with batch-processing is that it assumes</p><p>6 0.12619784 <a title="897-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-01-Scale-out_vs_Scale-up.html">891 high scalability-2010-09-01-Scale-out vs Scale-up</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Srinath Perera has put together a  strong list of architecture patterns  based on three meta patterns:  distribution, caching, and asynchronous processing. He contends these three are the primal patterns and the following patterns are but different combinations:
  
  LB (Load Balancers) + Shared nothing Units . Units that do not share anything with each other fronted with a load balancer that routes incoming messages to a unit based on some criteria. 
  LB + Stateless Nodes + Scalable Storage . Several stateless nodes talking to a scalable storage, and a load balancer distributes load among the nodes. 
  Peer to Peer Architectures (Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Content Addressable Networks (CAN)) . Algorithm for scaling up logarithmically. 
  Distributed Queues . Queue implementation (FIFO delivery) implemented as a network service.

<p>Introduction: Ricky Ho  in  Scalable System Design Patterns  has created a great list of scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary of the patterns are:
  
  Load Balancer  - a dispatcher determines which worker instance will handle a request based on different policies. 
  Scatter and Gather  - a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the client. 
  Result Cache  - a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save the actual execution. 
  Shared Space  - all workers monitors information from the shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached. 
  Pipe and Filter  - all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.

<p>Introduction: The ever amazing   slime mold   is not the only way to solve complex compute problems without performing calculations. There is another:  soap film . Unfortunately for soap film it isn’t nearly as photogenic as slime mold, all we get are boring looking pictures, but the underlying idea is still fascinating and ten times less spooky.   As a quick introduction we’ll lean on Long Ouyang, who has really straightforward  explanation of how soap film works in   Approaching P=NP: Can Soap Bubbles Solve The Steiner Tree Problem In Polynomial  .  It’s computers, so playing the role of the motivating graph problem we have the   Steiner tree problem  , which Ouyang explains as:
  
  Find the minimum spanning tree for a bunch of vertices, given that you can add additional points. 

  
 Soap helps solve this problem because: 
  
  Soap, in water, acts a surfactant, which decreases the surface tension in water.  
  This acts to minimize the surface energy of the liquid.  
  This should minimize surf</p><p>same-blog 2 0.84657055 <a title="897-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-08-4_General_Core_Scalability_Patterns.html">897 high scalability-2010-09-08-4 General Core Scalability Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jesper Söderlund put together an excellent list of four general scalability patterns and four subpatterns in his post  Scalability patterns and an interesting story :
  
 
  Load distribution  - Spread the system load across multiple processing units                
 
  Load balancing / load sharing  - Spreading the load across many components with equal properties for handling the request 
  Partitioning  - Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to a component that owns that data specific           
 
  Vertical partitioning  - Spreading the load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions being handled by different processing units 
  Horizontal partitioning  - Spreading a single type of data element across many instances, according to some partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation, etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.

<p>Introduction: This article on scaling cookie baking recipes showed up in one my key word alerts. Lots of weird things show up in alerts, but I really like cookies and the parallels were just so delicious. Scaling in the cookie baking world is:   the process of multiplying your recipe by many times to produce much more dough for many more cookies. It’s the difference between making enough dough in one batch to make two dozen cookies, or 2000 cookies.      Hey, pretty close to the website notion.  Yet as any good cook knows any scaled up recipe must be tweaked a little as things change at scale. Let's see what else we're supposed to do (quoted from the article):     Be Patient  - When making large batches of cookies, the most important thing that you have to remember is not to rush.   Use Fresh Ingredients  - This is always an important thing to keep in mind.    Don’t use as much leavening  - When you’re making a large batch of cookie dough, remember to scale down the amount of baking powder that you</p><p>5 0.73472053 <a title="897-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce_for_Machine_Learning_on_Multicore.html">581 high scalability-2009-04-26-Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning to take advantage of the potential speed up.      In this paper, we develop a broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a time.      Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model can be written in a certain “summation form,” which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt Google’s map-reduce  paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM</p><p>6 0.70263731 <a title="897-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-17-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_17%2C_2011.html">1063 high scalability-2011-06-17-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 17, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A non-random sample of my tech friends shows that not many have heard
ofmemristors(though I do suspect vote tampering). I'd read a little about
memristors in2008when the initial hubbub about the existence of memristors was
raised. I, however,  immediately filed them into that comforting conceptual
bucket of potentially revolutionary technologies I didn't have to worry about
because like most wondertech, nothing would ever come of it. Wrong. After
watchingFinding the Missing Memristorby R. Stanley Williams I've had to change
my mind. Memristors have gone from "maybe never" to holy cow this could happen
soon and it could change everything.Let's assume for the sake of dreaming
memristors do prove out. How will we design systems when we have access to a
new material that is two orders of magnitude more efficient from a power
perspective than traditional transistor technologies, contains multiple
petabits (1 petabit = 128TB) of persistent storage, and can be reconfigured to
be either memory</p><p>4 0.098158933 <a title="826-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation Propagation Networks: A
Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation, offers to help us break
free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of
autonomous but interconnected machines.  We can do this byorganizing
computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of
which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the
network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the
structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.The abstract from
his thesis is:In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of
computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The
traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large
memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with
computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected
with stateful storage cells.

<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and
Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper: Pursue robust
indefinite scalability, wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural
networks, starting from scratch.What is this strange thing calledindefinite
scalability? They sound like words that don't really go together:Indefinite
scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended
computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense
as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network
designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable
because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-
core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of
numbers before address space is exhausted and then that algorithm must be re-
engineered.Our idea is to expose indefinitely scalable computational power to
programmers using rei</p><p>4 0.7560671 <a title="826-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-03-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_3rd%2C_2014.html">1572 high scalability-2014-01-03-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 3rd, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Famous computer scientist John Backus, he's the B in BNF(Backus-Naur form) and
the creator of Fortran, gave a Turing Award Lecture titled Can programming be
liberated from the von Neumann style?: a functional style and its algebra of
programs, that has layed out a division in programming that lives long after
it was published in 1977. It's the now familiar argument for why functional
programming is superior:The assignment statement is the von Neumann bottleneck
of programming languages and keeps us thinking in word-at-a-time terms in much
the same way the computer's bottleneck does....The second world of
conventional programming languages is the world of statements. The primary
statement in that world is the assignment statement itself. All the other
statements of the language exist in order to make it possible to perform a
computation that must be based on this primitive construct: the assignment
statement.Here's a response by DijkstraA review of the 1977 Turing Award

<p>Introduction: Hey we're moving up in the world, jumping from 19th place to 3rd place. In
case you aren't sure what I'm talking about, Jurgen Appelo goes through this
massive effort ofranking blogsaccording to Google PageRank, Technorati
Authority, Alexa Rank, Google links, and Twitter Grader Rank.Through some
obviously mistaken calculations HighScalability comes out #3. Given all the
superb competition I'm not exactly sure how that can be. Well, thanks for all
the excellent people who contribute and all the even more excellent people
that read. Now at least I have something worthy to put on my tombstone :-)</p><p>2 0.88293481 <a title="826-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-01-Moving_Beyond_End-to-End_Path_Information_to_Optimize_CDN_Performance.html">712 high scalability-2009-10-01-Moving Beyond End-to-End Path Information to Optimize CDN Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,
we analyze latencies measured</p><p>same-blog 3 0.8795858 <a title="826-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-12-The_Rise_of_the_Virtual_Cellular_Machines.html">826 high scalability-2010-05-12-The Rise of the Virtual Cellular Machines</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

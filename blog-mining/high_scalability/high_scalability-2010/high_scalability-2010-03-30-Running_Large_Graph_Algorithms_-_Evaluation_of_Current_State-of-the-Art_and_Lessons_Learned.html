representing, traversing, and performing other common social network
operations using a graph database.If you areDiggorLinkedInyou can build your
own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network
relationships. For those of more modest meansNeo4j, a graph database, is a
good alternative.A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges
(relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs)
on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to
represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships
are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and
relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look
at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for
relationships."A graph looks something like:For more lovely examples take a

<p>Introduction: Dr. Daniel Abadi, author of theDBMS Musings blog and Cofounder ofHadapt, which
offers a product improving Hadoop performance by 50x on relational data, is
now taking his talents to graph data in Hadoop's tremendous inefficiency on
graph data management (and how to avoid it), which shares the secrets of
getting Hadoop to perform 1000x better on graph data.TL;DR:Analysing graph
data is at the heart ofimportant data mining problems.Hadoop is the tool of
choice for many of these problems.Hadoop style MapReduce works best on
KeyValue processing, not graph processing, and can be well over a factor of
1000 less efficient than it needs to be.Hadoop inefficiency has consequences
in real world. Inefficiencies on graph data problems like improving power
utilization, minimizing carbon emissions, and improving product designs, leads
to a lot value being left on the table in the form of negative environmental
consequences, increased server costs, increased data center space, and
increased energy cos</p><p>4 0.26658911 <a title="801-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Paper%3A_Graph_Databases_and_the_Future_of_Large-Scale_Knowledge_Management.html">626 high scalability-2009-06-10-Paper: Graph Databases and the Future of Large-Scale Knowledge Management</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most
of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to
the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez
introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide
web of data.Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on
the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10
billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for
applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, withthe
Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible
to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge
structure. This talk will discuss graph databases, their underlying data
model, their querying mechanisms, and the benefits of the graph data structure
for modeling and analysis.</p><p>5 0.26151571 <a title="801-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-14-When_all_the_Program%27s_a_Graph_-_Prismatic%27s_Plumbing_Library.html">1406 high scalability-2013-02-14-When all the Program's a Graph - Prismatic's Plumbing Library</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the problems in building distributed systems is figuring out what the
heck is going on. Usually endless streams of log files are consulted like
ancients usingentrailsto divine the will of the Gods.To rise above these
ancient practices we must rise another level of abstraction and that's the
approach described in a Microsoft research paper: G2: A Graph Processing
System for Diagnosing Distributed Systems, which uses execution graphs that
model runtime events and their correlations in distributed systems.The problem
with these schemes is viewing applications, written by programmers in low
level code, as execution graphs. But we're heading in this direction in any
case. To program a warehouse or an internet sized computer we'll have to write
at higher levels of abstraction so code can be executed transparently at
runtime on these giant distributed computers. There are many advantages to
this approach, fault diagnosis and performance monitoring are just one of the
wins.Abstract from</p><p>4 0.90962648 <a title="801-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-18-Disks_Ain%27t_Dead_Yet%3A_GraphChi_-_a_disk-based_large-scale_graph_computation.html">1285 high scalability-2012-07-18-Disks Ain't Dead Yet: GraphChi - a disk-based large-scale graph computation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GraphChiuses aParallel Sliding Windowsmethod which can: process a graph with
mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-
sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of
computation.The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on
just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar
toPregel, which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style
of MapReduce. Streaming graph updates are supported.About GraphChi, Carlos
Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,says:A Mac Mini running

relationships. For those of more modest meansNeo4j, a graph database, is a
good alternative.A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges
(relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs)
on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to
represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships
are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and
relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look
at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for
relationships."A graph looks something like:For more lovely examples take a
look at theGraph Image Gallery.Here's agood summaryby</p><p>6 0.87217742 <a title="801-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-10-Paper%3A_Graph_Databases_and_the_Future_of_Large-Scale_Knowledge_Management.html">626 high scalability-2009-06-10-Paper: Graph Databases and the Future of Large-Scale Knowledge Management</a></p>

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a
valuable raw mat</p><p>4 0.95211607 <a title="801-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-21-Strategy%3A_Limit_Result_Sets.html">189 high scalability-2007-12-21-Strategy: Limit Result Sets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Release It!authorMichael Nygard tells a tale of two web sites, both brought
low by unexpectedly huge unbounded results sets that slowed down their sites
to the speed of a Christmas checkout line.I've committed this error more than
a few times. During testing the results sets are often small, so you don't see
problems. Or when a product is new you don't have a lot of data so everything
is fine, until some magic line is crossed and you get that dreaded 2AM fix it
call.breakMy most embarrassing bug of this type caused a rather spectacular
failure at a customer site as the variance in response times was out of spec
and this kicked in penalty clauses. What happened was the customer had a
larger network than we could even test (customers always get the good stuff).
I took a lock and went to get all the data. Because the result set was so much
larger in their larger system I took the lock for many more milliseconds than
I should have.

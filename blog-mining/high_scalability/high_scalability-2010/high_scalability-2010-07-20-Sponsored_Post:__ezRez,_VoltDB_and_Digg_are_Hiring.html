<p>Introduction: It is widely recognized that MySQL is the most popular database software in the world. Since its inception in 1995, there have been 11 million product installations around the world in a wide variety of markets. There are more installations of MySQL in use today than any other database architecture. From startup companies hoping to be the next Web2.0 poster child to large global enterprises, the MySQL database architecture has proven to be flexible, extendable, scalable, and more than capable of filling high-capacity database roles in very different venues.</p><p>2 0.98921174 <a title="861-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-16-Paper%3A_Scaling_Online_Social_Networks_without_Pains.html">723 high scalability-2009-10-16-Paper: Scaling Online Social Networks without Pains</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We saw in  Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?  scaling social networks is a lot harder than you might think. This paper,  Scaling Online Social Networks without Pains , from a team at Telefonica Research in Spain hopes to meet the challenge of status distribution, user generated content distribution, and managing the social graph through a technique they call  One-Hop Replication  (OHR). OHR  abstracts and delegates the complexity of scaling up from the social network application . The abstract:   
 Online Social Networks (OSN) face serious scalability challenges due to their rapid growth and popularity. To address this issue we present a novel approach to scale up OSN called One Hop Replication (OHR). Our system combines partitioning and replication in a middleware to transparently scale up a centralized OSN design, and therefore, avoid the OSN application to undergo the costly transition to a fully distributed system to meet its scalability needs. OHR exploits some</p><p>3 0.98710042 <a title="861-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-10-Letting_Clients_Know_What%27s_Changed%3A_Push_Me_or_Pull_Me%3F.html">205 high scalability-2008-01-10-Letting Clients Know What's Changed: Push Me or Pull Me?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a false belief I thought I came here to stay We're all just visiting All just breaking like waves The oceans made me, but who came up with me? Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out .     So true Perl Jam   (Push me Pull me lyrics)  , so true. I too have wondered how web clients should be notified of model changes. Should servers push events to clients or should clients pull events from servers? A topic worthy of its own song if ever there was one.       To pull events the client simply starts a timer and makes a request to the server. This is polling. You can either pull a complete set of fresh data or get a list of changes. The server "knows" if anything you are interested in has changed and makes those changes available to you.  Knowing what has changed can be relatively simple with a publish-subscribe type backend or you can get very complex with fine grained bit maps of attributes and keeping per client state on what I client still needs to see.     Polling is heavy man.</p><p>4 0.98522443 <a title="861-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-08-Eight_Best_Practices_for_Building_Scalable_Systems.html">594 high scalability-2009-05-08-Eight Best Practices for Building Scalable Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wille Faler has  created an excellent list of best practices  for building scalable and high performance systems. Here's a short  summary of his points:
   Offload the database  - Avoid hitting the database, and avoid opening transactions or connections unless you absolutely need to use them.    What a difference a cache makes  - For read heavy applications caching is the easiest way offload the database.    Cache as coarse-grained objects as possible  - Coarse-grained objects save CPU and time by requiring fewer reads to assemble objects.    Donâ&euro;&trade;t store transient state permanently  - Is it really necessary to store your transient data in the database?    Location, Location  - put things close to where they are supposed to be delivered.    Constrain concurrent access to limited resource  - it's quicker to let a single thread do work and finish rather than flooding finite resources with 200 client threads.    Staged, asynchronous processing  - separate a process using asynchronicity int</p><p>5 0.98474824 <a title="861-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-12-Netflix%3A_Developing%2C_Deploying%2C_and_Supporting_Software_According_to_the_Way_of_the_Cloud.html">1155 high scalability-2011-12-12-Netflix: Developing, Deploying, and Supporting Software According to the Way of the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At a  Cloud Computing Meetup , Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:  Keeping Movies Running Amid Thunderstorms . While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the cloud, issues with capacity planning,  thundering herds , latency problems, and  simian armageddon , I found myself most taken with how they handle  software deployment in the cloud .
 
I've worked on half a dozen or more build and deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant software deployments:  the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to completely run a new release while running the old release at the same time .
 
The process goes something like:

<p>Introduction: Enterprises want to protect their data.   As the appetite for data volumes grows, storage technology becomes a critical business asset on which business continuity relies.  My recent survey in the medium-size enterprise segment shows the five dominant investment directions at the level of data management architecture: disaster recovery (DR), high availability (HA), backup, data processing performance and migration to more advanced databases.﻿
   
  This suggests that corporations generally have sufficiently structured data collections but are concerned with business continuity and continuous availability of data. What infrastructures can provide these assurances? In this post I want to focus on yet another option, and that is the Real-Time Data Integration model.

<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability load balanced system using mod backhand and  Wackamole . The idea is you don't need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read. Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of effect of keep-alives on performance.</p><p>4 0.11256791 <a title="813-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-20-VMware_to_bridge_a_DMZ.__.html">686 high scalability-2009-08-20-VMware to bridge a DMZ.  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey guys,  There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy vmware...everywhere.  I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when it comes to resources.  What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.  Today we get lots of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well.  40x HP blades, apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's.  (20 servers in 2 datacentres).  The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our internal networks.  This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have ever lived by while working on the inet.  No airgaps from the unknown to the known!  I am interested in feedback on this scenario.  From a resource perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.  Do you think t</p><p>5 0.10889821 <a title="813-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-10-Webcast%3A_Advanced_Database_High_Availability_and_Scalability_Solutions.html">4 high scalability-2007-07-10-Webcast: Advanced Database High Availability and Scalability Solutions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many enterprises' high-availability architecture is based on the assumption that you can prevent failure from happening by putting all your critical data in a centralized database, back it up with expensive storage, and replicate it somehow between the sites. As I argued in one of my previous posts ( Why Existing Databases (RAC) are So Breakable! ) many of those assumptions are broken at their core, as storage is doomed to failure just like any other device, expensive hardware doesn’t make things any better and database replication is often not enough.
 
One of the main lessons that we can take from the likes of Amazon and Google is that the right way to ensure continuous high availability is by designing our system to cope with failure. We need to assume that what we tend to think of as unthinkable will probably happen, as that’s the nature of failure. So rather than trying to prevent failures, we need to build a system that will tolerate them.

<p>Introduction: The need for IT consolidation is most evident in two types of organizations. In the first group, IT grew organically with business over the decades, and survived changes of strategy, management, staff and vendor orientation. The second group of businesses capital groups are characterized by rapid growth through acquisitions (followed by attempts to integrate radically different IT environments). In both groups, their IT infrastructures have typically been pieced together over the past 20 (or more) years.ďťż

<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000 or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.
 
This post focuses on a customer’s backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services and annual support?

<p>Introduction: nginx is a high performance smtp/pop/imap proxy that lets you do custom authorization and lookups and is very scalable. (just add nodes)     Nginx by default is a reverse proxy and this is what it is doing here for pop/imap connections. It is also an excellelent reverse proxy for web servers.     Advantage: You dont have to have a speacial database or ldap schema. Just an url to  do auth and lookup with.   A url that may be accessed by a unix or a tcp socket. Write your own auth handler - according to your own policy.     For example:    A user called atif tries to login with the pass testxyz.   You pass this infomation to a URL such as   socket:/var/tmp/xyz.sock   or   http://auth.corp.mailserver.net:someport/someurl     The auth server replies with either a FAILURE such as      Auth-Status: Invalid Login or password     or with a success such as   Auth-Status: OK   Auth-Server: OneOfThe100Servers   Auth-Port: optionalyAPort     We have implemented it at our ISP and it has saves us a</p><p>4 0.68039322 <a title="813-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-22-The_high_scalability_community.html">220 high scalability-2008-01-22-The high scalability community</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     First of all; thanks for a creating a GREAT resource on high scalability architecture. For us building high scalability solutions from the west coast of (tiny) Norway good input on the subject isn't always abundant.     Which leads me to my next question; Are there any events or conferences on high scalability / SaaS in the US or internationally that any of you would recommend architects or data center managers to attend?</p><p>5 0.67415315 <a title="813-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-31-Facebook_in_20_Minutes%3A_2.7M_Photos%2C_10.2M_Comments%2C_4.6M_Messages.html">966 high scalability-2010-12-31-Facebook in 20 Minutes: 2.7M Photos, 10.2M Comments, 4.6M Messages</a></p>

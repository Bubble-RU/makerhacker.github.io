for NoSQL to go to that great bit bucket in the sky.DBMS Musings:
Distinguishing Two Major Types of Column-Storesby Daniel Abadi.I have noticed
that Bigtable, HBase, Hypertable, and Cassandra are being called column-stores
with increasing frequency, due to their ability to store and access column
families separately. This makes them appear to be in the same category as
column-stores such as Sybase IQ, C-Store, Vertica, VectorWise, MonetDB,
ParAccel, and Infobright, which also are able to access columns
separately.Cloud Economics, By The Square Footby Rich Miller.But cloud
computing offers a middle path, offering cost and usability advantages for
customers, as well as an attractive return for providers.PostgreSQL: meet your

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve?

<p>Introduction: Social Developer Summit- June 29, 2010 - San Franciso, CAA meeting of the
technically social - Building, scaling, and profiting in a social ageWhether
it'ssocial games, social news, social discovery, social search, or other forms
of social solutions, developers today are facing new hurdles in building
instantly scalable products. As new technologies emerge to address the
challenges faced by social application developers, it's increasingly important
to come together for knowledge sharing purposes.The first Social Developer
Summit will bring together social application developers todiscuss the
challenges, solutions, and best practices for building applications in the
rapidly expanding social web economy. At the Social Developer Summit, industry
experts will share tips and case studies for building high performance social
web products.For more information please take a look atSocial Developer
Summit.If you are interested in a sponsored post for an event, job, or

for NoSQL to go to that great bit bucket in the sky.DBMS Musings:
Distinguishing Two Major Types of Column-Storesby Daniel Abadi.I have noticed
that Bigtable, HBase, Hypertable, and Cassandra are being called column-stores
with increasing frequency, due to their ability to store and access column
families separately. This makes them appear to be in the same category as
column-stores such as Sybase IQ, C-Store, Vertica, VectorWise, MonetDB,
ParAccel, and Infobright, which also are able to access columns
separately.Cloud Economics, By The Square Footby Rich Miller.But cloud
computing offers a middle path, offering cost and usability advantages for
customers, as well as an attractive return for providers.PostgreSQL: meet your

<p>Introduction: We saw in Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale? scaling social
networks is a lot harder than you might think. This paper,Scaling Online
Social Networks without Pains, from a team at Telefonica Research in Spain
hopes to meet the challenge of status distribution, user generated content
distribution, and managing the social graph through a technique they callOne-
Hop Replication (OHR). OHRabstracts and delegates the complexity of scaling up
from the social network application. The abstract:Online Social Networks (OSN)
face serious scalability challenges due to their rapid growth and popularity.
To address this issue we present a novel approach to scale up OSN called One
Hop Replication (OHR). Our system combines partitioning and replication in a
middleware to transparently scale up a centralized OSN design, and therefore,
avoid the OSN application to undergo the costly transition to a fully
distributed system to meet its scalability needs. OHR exploits some of the

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.As I was writingan
articleon the architecture of theStorm Botnet, I couldn't help but notice the
deep similarity of how Storm works and changes we're seeing in the evolution
of political systems. In particular, the rise of thevirtual-state. As crazy as
this may sound, I think this is also the direction applications will need
follow to survive in a complex world of billions of compute devices.You may
have already heard ofvirtual corporations. Virtual corporations are companies
with limited office space, a distributed workforce, and production facilities
located wherever it is profitable to locate them. The idea is to stay lean and
compete using therapid development and introduction of new products into high

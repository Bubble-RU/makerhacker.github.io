<p>Introduction: Ever come to a point where you feel you've learned enough to share your
experiences in the hopes of helping others traveling the same road? That's
whatMartin Kleppmannhas done in an lovingly written Six things I wish we had
known about scaling, an article well worth your time.It's not advice about
scaling a Twitter, but of building a million user system, which is the sweet
spot for a lot of projects. His conclusion rings true:Building scalable
systems is not all sexy roflscale fun. It's a lot of plumbing and yak shaving.
A lot of hacking together tools that really ought to exist already, but all
the open source solutions out there are too bad (and yours ends up bad too,
but at least it solves your particular problem).Here's a gloss on the six
lessons (plus a bonus lesson):Realistic load testing is hard. Testing a large
distributed system is not like a scientific experiment that can be conducted
under ideal conditions. This is hard for the scientific minded to accept.

<p>Introduction: Ladar Levison of Lavabit has written anincredible article on howthey took a
centralized off-the-shelf email server that could handle only few thousand
users and built their own custom distributed infrastructure for handling
hundreds of thousands of email users. Lavabit processes 70 gigabytes of data
per day, is made up of 26 servers, hosts 260,000 email addresses, and
processes 600,000 emails a day. That's a lot of email.Lavabit's mission has a
little edge to it too:Lavabit was founded as a direct reaction to the larger
free e-mail services available. We felt it was possible to create an e-mail
service that was fast, reliable, feature rich and didn't achieve profitability
by prostituting its user base to marketers.What I really like about this
article is that Lavabit has some challenging elements in dealing with
different email protocols while being able to scale to a lot of users. There's
more going on than just trying to scale out a database. Many products contain
complicated bits li</p><p>6 0.96205443 <a title="866-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-30-Log_Everything_All_the_Time.html">77 high scalability-2007-08-30-Log Everything All the Time</a></p>

</p><p>5 Andi Mann (VP withCA Technologies) put it well when he says yes, IT staff reductions are always a possible outcome of better IT, "Yet with a sunk cost in training and skills, and the seemingly endless list of projects on most CIOs' desks, is cutting staff numbers really a good outcome? [sent-10, score-0.501]
</p><p>6 " It is that "seemingly endless list of projects" that makes a mass reduction in IT unlikely along with the fact that systems are simply not ready to "take over" from human beings. [sent-12, score-0.395]
</p><p>7 The "intelligence" that exists in any system today is little more than a codified set of rules that were specified by  \- wait for it, wait for it - yes, a human being. [sent-18, score-0.575]
</p><p>8 It was a person who sat down and codified a set of basic rules for automatically responding to deviances in performance and capacity and specified what action should be taken. [sent-19, score-0.337]
</p><p>9 It is only when they are seen and understood by a human being that they become valuable and become "information". [sent-24, score-0.376]

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been so reliable that when a site outage does occur it's a
definite learning opportunity. Fortunately for us we can learn something
because in More Details on Today's Outage, Facebook'sRobert Johnson gave a
pretty candid explanation of what caused a rare 2.5 hour period of down time
for Facebook. It wasn't a simple problem. The root causes were feedback loops
and transient spikes caused ultimately by the complexity of weakly interacting
layers in modern systems. You know, the kind everyone is building these days.
Problems like this are notoriously hard to fix and finding a real solution may
send Facebook back to the whiteboard. There's a technical debt that must be
paid. The outline and my interpretation (reading between the lines) of what
happened is:Remember that Facebookcaches everything. They
have28terabytesofmemcacheddata on 800 servers. The database is the system of
record, but memory is where the action is. So when a problem happens that
involves the caching layer,</p><p>3 0.16708986 <a title="919-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive age of the 17th</p><p>6 0.12814279 <a title="919-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon_Architecture.html">96 high scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon Architecture</a></p>

slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where

organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that
won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors
make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants.  InAfter Life: The
Strange Science Of Decaythere's a truly incredible sequence of gorgeously shot

<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsayis a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on
software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant,
but it applies to software development too.You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on
one of his many TV shows. Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying
to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show
Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few
heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant
owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is
there to help.If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay
is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say"
means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses,
belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he
does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence at
all of</p><p>5 0.82133627 <a title="919-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-19-What_can_the_Amazing_Race_to_the_South_Pole_Teach_us_About_Startups%3F.html">1503 high scalability-2013-08-19-What can the Amazing Race to the South Pole Teach us About Startups?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recentacquisitionshave been
surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's5 day
whirlwind acquisitionofOculus, immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a
now paltry sounding $2 billion.Thebacklashis a pandemic, jumping acrosssocial
networkswith the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can
generate.For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of
every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here,
Facebook's ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been
choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.For the
many who voted for an open future with theirKickstarter dollars, there's a
deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook's promise to leave
Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to
people. It's new, it's different, it creates a better future. It's important

<p>Introduction: It's called "east-west" networking, which when compared to its predecessor,
"north-south" networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane winds and
tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation between the
transformative shift this change in networking patterns has on the data center
with that of El Ni単o's transformative power upon the weather patterns across
the globe.Traditionally, data center networks have focused on North-South
network traffic. The assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly
communicate with servers at the core, rather than across the network to other
clients.But server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual
appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical
infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with workloads
moving to different physical locations on the network as virtual servers are
migrated (in the case of data center networks) and clients move about the

<p>Introduction: Every time a technological innovation has spurred automation - since the time
of Henry Ford right up to a minute ago - someone has claimed that machines
will displace human beings. But the rainbow and unicorn dream attributed to
business stakeholders everywhere, i.e. the elimination of IT, is just that - a
dream. It isn't realistic and in fact it's downright silly to think that
systems that only a few years ago were unable to automatically scale up and
scale down will suddenly be able to perform the complex analysis required of
IT to keep the business running.The rare reports of the elimination of IT
staff due tocloud computingand automation are highlighted in the news because
they evoke visceral reactions in technologists everywhere and, to be honest,
they get the click counts rising. But thejury remains out on this oneand in
fact many postulate that it is not a reduction in staff that will occur, but
atransformationof staff, which may eliminate some old timey positions (think

<p>Introduction: Here's a really good article in the Communications of the ACM on reducing
network packet processing overhead by redesigning the network stack:
Revisiting Network I/O APIs: The Netmap Framework by Luigi Rizzo. As commodity
networking performance increases operating systems need to keep up or all
those CPUs will go to waste. How do they make this happen? Abstract:Today
10-gigabit interfaces are used more and more in datacenters and servers. On
these links, packets flow as fast as one every 67.2 nanoseconds, yet modern
operating systems can take 10-20 times longer just to move one packet between
the wire and the application. We can do much better, not with more powerful
hardware but by revising architectural decisions made long ago regarding the
design of device drivers and network stacks.The netmap framework is a
promising step in this direction. Thanks to a careful design and the
engineering of a new packet I/O API, netmap eliminates much unnecessary
overhead and moves traffic up to 40</p><p>6 0.90123773 <a title="919-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-07-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_Oct_8%2C_2010.html">916 high scalability-2010-10-07-Hot Scalability Links For Oct 8, 2010</a></p>

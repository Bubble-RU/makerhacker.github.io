<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Shawn Hsiao ,  Luke Massa , and  Victor Luu . Shawn runs  TripAdvisor ’s Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his team this past summer. This post is introduced by  Andy Gelfond , TripAdvisor’s head of engineering.   It's been a little over a year since our last post about the  TripAdvisor architecture . It has been an exciting year. Our business and team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown - we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:
  
 56M visitors per month 
 350M+ pages requests a day 
 120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large Hadoop cluster, and quickly growing 
  
We also had a very successful college intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were quickly on boarded and doing the same kind of work a</p><p>3 0.22801284 <a title="812-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-18-Save_up_to_30%25_by_Selecting_Better_Performing_Amazon_Instances.html">1343 high scalability-2012-10-18-Save up to 30% by Selecting Better Performing Amazon Instances</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you like the idea of exploiting market inconsistencies to lower your costs then you will love this  paper  and video from the Hot Cloud '12 conference:  Exploiting Hardware Heterogeneity within the Same Instance Type of Amazon EC2 .
 
The conclusion is interesting and is a source of good guidance:
  
 Amazon EC2 uses diversified hardware to host the same type of instance.   
 The hardware diversity results in performance variation.  
 In general, the variation between the fast instances and slow  instances can reach 40%. In some applications, the variation can even approach up to 60%.   
 By selecting fast instances within the same instance type,  Amazon EC2 users can acquire up to 30% of cost saving, if the fast instances have a relatively low probability. 
  
The abstract:
  

Cloud computing providers might start with near-homogeneous hardware environment. Over time, the homogeneous environment will most likely evolve into heterogeneous one because of possible upgrades and replac</p><p>4 0.20219728 <a title="812-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-07-What_Google_App_Engine_Price_Changes_Say_About_the_Future_of_Web_Architecture.html">1112 high scalability-2011-09-07-What Google App Engine Price Changes Say About the Future of Web Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Authored by  Chris Fregly   :  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.  
   Ahead of the upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi’s recent    presentation    at an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few of my recent    Fluxcapacitor.com    consulting engagements, I’ve compiled a list of 10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS. 
    1) Query AWS resource metadata  
      
   Can’t remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?     awsnow.info    is the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.  Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You’re in luck.  There’s now a    REST API   , as well! 
   Note:  These are default soft limits and will vary by account. 
    2) Tame your S3 buckets  
       
   Delete an entire S3 bucket with a single CLI command:</p><p>4 0.8117699 <a title="812-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-28-Strategy%3A_Guaranteed_Availability_Requires_Reserving_Instances_in_Specific_Zones.html">1165 high scalability-2011-12-28-Strategy: Guaranteed Availability Requires Reserving Instances in Specific Zones</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When EC2 first started the mental model was of a magic Pez dispenser supplying an infinite stream of instances in any desired flavor. If you needed an instance, because of a either a failure or traffic spike, it would be there. As amazing as EC2 is, this model turned out to be optimistic.  
 
From a  thread on the Amazon discussion forum  we learn any dispenser has limits:
  

As Availability Zones grow over time, our ability to continue to expand them can become constrained. In these scenarios, we will prevent customers from launching in the constrained zone if they do not yet have existing resources in that zone. We also might remove the constrained zone entirely from the list of options for new customers. This means that occasionally, different customers will see a different number of Availability Zones in a particular Region. Both approaches aim to help customers avoid accidentally starting to build up their infrastructure in an Availability Zone where they might have less ability</p><p>5 0.78120208 <a title="812-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-18-Strategy%3A_Kill_Off_Multi-tenant_Instances_with_High_CPU_Stolen_Time.html">1286 high scalability-2012-07-18-Strategy: Kill Off Multi-tenant Instances with High CPU Stolen Time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Are all instances created equal? Perhaps because under multi-tenancy multiple virtual machines run on the same physical host, not all applications will run equally well on every instance. In that case it makes sense to measure and move to a better performing instance. 
 
That's the interesting idea from  @botchagalupe :
  

Imagine something like a "performance monkey" where an infrastructure is so bound that it can kill lower performing instances automatically.

  
 @adrianco  says Netflix has throught of doing the same: 
  

We've looked at killing off multi-tenant instances that have high CPU stolen time...

<p>Introduction: Vaibhav Puranik  in  Web  serving in the cloud – our experiences with nginx and instance sizes  describes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types. The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference was interesting:
  
 In the long term they will save money using the larger instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes, which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save money even though they are more expensive.

<p>Introduction: Ever wonder what powers Google's world spirit sensing  Zeitgeist service ? No, it's not a homunculus of  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel  sitting in each browser. It's actually a stream processing (think streaming MapReduce on steroids) system called MillWheel, described in this very well written paper:  MillWheel: Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale . MillWheel isn't just used for Zeitgeist at Google, it's also used for streaming joins for a variety of Ads customers, generalized anomaly-detection service, and network switch and cluster health monitoring.
 
Abstract:
  MillWheel is a framework for building low-latency data-processing applications that is widely used at Google. Users specify a directed computation graph and application code for individual nodes, and the system manages persistent state and the continuous ﬂow of records, all within the envelope of the framework’s fault-tolerance guarantees.

<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing  recent AWS price changes ,  seldo  mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good question was asked:
  

How do you even do anything without using EBS?

  
Amazon certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS services like RDS or ELB.
 
If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls  gives a great answer :
  

Well, you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that, you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual node failure. I prefer to believe that if you can't roll your entire infrastructure over to new nodes monthly then you're unprepared fo</p><p>6 0.78118998 <a title="812-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-18-Beyond_Threads_and_Callbacks_-_Application_Architecture_Pros_and_Cons.html">1425 high scalability-2013-03-18-Beyond Threads and Callbacks - Application Architecture Pros and Cons</a></p>

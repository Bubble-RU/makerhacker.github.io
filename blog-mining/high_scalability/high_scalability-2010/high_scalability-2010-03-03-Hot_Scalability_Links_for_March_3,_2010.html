<p>Introduction: Here are a few updates on the articlePaper: Don't Settle For Eventual:
Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS from Mike Freedman
and Wyatt Lloyd.Q: How software architectures could change in response to
casual+ consistency?A: I don't really think they would much. Somebody would
still run a two-tier architecture in their datacenter:  a front-tier of
webservers running both (say) PHP and our client library, and a back tier of
storage nodes running COPS.  (I'm not sure if it was obvious given the
discussion of our "thick" client -- you should think of the COPS client
dropping in where a memcache client library does...albeit ours has per-session
state.) Q: Why not just use vector clocks?A: The problem with vector clocks
and scalability has always been that the size of vector clocks in O(N), where
N is the number of nodes.  So if we want to scale to a datacenter with 10K
nodes, each piece of metadata must have size O(10K).  And in fact, vector
clocks alone only allow yo</p><p>3 0.17679179 <a title="787-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>4 0.16355726 <a title="787-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-13-Paper%3A_NoSQL_Databases_-_NoSQL_Introduction_and_Overview.html">1022 high scalability-2011-04-13-Paper: NoSQL Databases - NoSQL Introduction and Overview</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christof Strauch, from Stuttgart Media University, has written an incredible
120+ page paper titledNoSQL Databases as an introduction and overview to NoSQL
databases . The paper was written between 2010-06 and 2011-02, so it may be a
bit out of date, but if you are looking to take in the NoSQL world in one big
gulp, this is your chance. I asked Christof to give us a  short taste of what
he was trying to accomplish in his paper:The paper aims at giving a systematic
and thorough introduction and overview of the NoSQL field by assembling
information dispersed among blogs, wikis and scientific papers. It firstly
discusses reasons, rationales and motives for the development and usage of
nonrelational database systems. These can be summarized by the need for high
scalability, the processing of large amounts of data, the ability to
distribute data among many (often commodity) servers, consequently a
distribution-aware design of DBMSs.The paper then introduces fundamental

<p>Introduction: Update:Streamy Explains CAP and HBase's Approach to CAP.We plan to employ
inter-cluster replication, with each cluster located in a single DC. Remote
replication will introduce some eventual consistency into the system, but each
cluster will continue to be strongly consistent.Ryan Barrett, Google App
Engine datastore lead, gave this talkTransactions Across Datacenters (and
Other Weekend Projects)at the Google I/O 2009 conference.While the talk
doesn't necessarily break new technical ground, Ryan does an excellent job
explaining and evaluating the different options you have when architecting a
system to work across multiple datacenters. This is calledmultihoming,
operating from multiple datacenters simultaneously.As multihoming is one of
the most challenging tasks in all computing, Ryan's clear and thoughtful style
comfortably leads you through the various options. On the trip you learn:The
differentmulti-homing optionsare: Backups, Master-Slave, Multi-Master, 2PC,
and Paxos. You'll als</p><p>6 0.13373797 <a title="787-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-08-Google_AppEngine_-_A_First_Look.html">301 high scalability-2008-04-08-Google AppEngine - A First Look</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was
wrong about what he meant. His real point:The meaning of the statement was
that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a
standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a
high priority task for them.At the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto, an audience
member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really
interesting:NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.The
idea being that NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance,
etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its
name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships.
With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to
implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed
usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it's not
about data.My</p><p>4 0.71875417 <a title="787-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-16-Paper%3A_Warp%3A_Multi-Key_Transactions_for_Key-Value_Stores.html">1459 high scalability-2013-05-16-Paper: Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>5 0.71363074 <a title="787-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-03-Paper%3A_Brewer%27s_Conjecture_and_the_Feasibility_of_Consistent_Available_Partition-Tolerant_Web_Services.html">108 high scalability-2007-10-03-Paper: Brewer's Conjecture and the Feasibility of Consistent Available Partition-Tolerant Web Services</a></p>

that are commonly desired: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
It is impossible to achieve all three. In this note, we prove this conjecture

<p>Introduction: Like many other media content providers, libraries and museums are
increasingly moving their content onto the Web.  While the move itself is no
easy process (with digitization, web development, and training costs), being
able to successfully deliver content to a wide audience is an ongoing concern,
particularly for large libraries.Much of the concern is financial, as most
libraries do not have the internal budget or outside investors that for-profit
businesses enjoy.  Even large university libraries will face serious budget
constraints that even other university departments, such as science and
technology would not face.Creating a scalable infrastructure and also
distributing a large digital collection that can handle multiple requests,
requires planning that many librarians have not even imagined.  They must stop
thinking in terms of "one-item-per-customer" and start thinking in terms of
numerous users accessing the same information simultaneously.Content Delivery

<p>Introduction: Rodrigo Camposshared some interesting benchmark resultsfor AWS instances in
the South America Region (Sao Paulo) and US East Region (North Virginia). He
summarized the results in this thread on theGuerrilla Capacity
Planninglist:The same instance type shows a different behavior depending on
the region that it is running, this is particularly critical if you depend on
multiple regions for disaster recovery or geographical load balancingGenerally
speaking performance is better and more consistent in the South America region
when compared to Virginia, this is probably due to the fact that SA region was
the latest to be deployed. Maybe the SA datacenter uses new server models or
it is just underutilized, but this is a wild guessWrite performance for the
medium instance type in Virginia abruptly decays, dropping from almost 400
call/s to something around 300 calls/s, this is not very clear in the scatter
plot but if you draw a time-based chart you can clearly see this pattern. This

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors,
attended the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format
was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid,
InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in
front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A
NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading
questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came
from the audience, which was refreshing. Overall a genial evening with some
good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just
automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point
rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some
complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that
was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at
giving a wide range o</p><p>5 0.93078732 <a title="787-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-23-State_of_the_CDN%3A_More_Traffic%2C_Stable_Prices%2C_More_Products%2C_Profits_-_Not_So_Much.html">1289 high scalability-2012-07-23-State of the CDN: More Traffic, Stable Prices, More Products, Profits - Not So Much</a></p>
<p>Introduction: CDNs (content delivery networks) are the secret shadow super powers behind the
web and Dan Rayburn atstreamingmedia.comis the go to investigative reporter
for quality information on CDNs. Every year Dan has a Content Delivery Summit
on all things CDN and those videos arenow available. Dan also gives a kind
ofstate of the industry talkwhere he does something wonderful, he gives real
numbers and prices. Dan really knows his stuff and is an excellent speaker, so
watch the video, but here's my gloss on the state of the CDN so far this
year:Massive growth. Large customers are expecting 126% growth in video
traffic over last year; medium size customers are seeing 48% traffic growth,
small sized customer are seeing 73.3% traffic growth.More traffic != More
profit. Traffic growth doesn't lead to more profit because the traffic growth
is concentrated in larger customers that can make the best deals.Video takes
up the largest amount of traffic on a CDNs network but gives the least amount

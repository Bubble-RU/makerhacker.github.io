[sent-59, score-0.24]
</p><p>2 You would have access to whatever is allowed on whatever you are running on. [sent-68, score-0.169]
</p><p>3 The wide variety of different clouds and different compute resources will make it difficult to come up with a true standardization layer. [sent-88, score-0.249]
</p><p>4 The question for applications is how far will cloud interoperability go? [sent-114, score-0.168]
</p><p>5 For a different view on the potential power of all these computer resources take a look at the amazingFAWN(Fast Array of Wimpy Nodes)project out of Carnegie Mellon University. [sent-129, score-0.17]
</p><p>6 Our prototype FAWN cluster links together a large number of tiny nodes built using embedded processors and small amounts (2-16GB) of flash memory into an ensemble capable of handling 1300 queries per second per node, while consuming fewer than 4 watts of power per node. [sent-132, score-0.326]
</p><p>7 Given that data intensive applications are I/O sensitive it makes sense not to share. [sent-159, score-0.168]
</p><p>8 Once flash densities increase even the per byte cost advantage that disks have now for large data sets and streaming media may be breached, the Ambient Cloud itself will be a formidable storage device. [sent-179, score-0.264]
</p><p>9 One huge tension we have now whendesigning systemscenters on the great disk vs RAM vs flash memory debate. [sent-185, score-0.182]
</p><p>10 For large datasets RAM is used as a cache and disk as the storage of record. [sent-187, score-0.165]
</p><p>11 As flash capacity and cost per unit is hitching a ride on Moore's Law, we can speculate that in a few years that flash and flash/RAM hybrids will start replacing disk based architectures. [sent-197, score-0.302]
</p><p>12 Gordon is asystem architecture for data-centric applications that combines low-power processors, flash memory, and datacentric programming systems to improve performance for data-centric applications while reducing power consumption. [sent-207, score-0.289]
</p><p>13 To summarize, FAWN is a good template for a super scalable key- value data storage because:It operates efficiently on the hardware profile common in the Ambient Cloud: lower power and flash storage. [sent-208, score-0.273]
</p><p>14 Cleversafe - Space and Bandwidth Efficient High AvailabilityThe Ambient Cloud differs from the traditional cloud in one very important way: nodes are unreliable. [sent-211, score-0.181]
</p><p>15 Here's their explanation:Using information dispersal --slicing the data and spreading it out among servers, only to be reassembled when you need it--that very same file has a 60% storage overhead in a standard configuration. [sent-225, score-0.161]
</p><p>16 It's possible using flash based storage might make a more parallelized design possible, especially if techniques like eventual consistency and client based read repair were employed. [sent-255, score-0.222]
</p><p>17 GAE is built on a distributed file system so getting each entity is really retrieving a different disk block from a different cluster. [sent-297, score-0.162]
</p><p>18 We've already gone over several examples of how this works in other markets, there's not reason in shouldn't work with compute resources as well. [sent-344, score-0.152]
</p><p>19 The reason why I think a market is so critical to the Ambient Cloud is because I think it's the only way to make the dynamic pool of exponentially growing compute resources available to applications. [sent-352, score-0.258]
</p><p>20 Since the resources are dynamic there needs to be some sort of exchange set up to allow applications to know when new resources become available and search for existing resources. [sent-354, score-0.202]

so:Bell's Law of Computer Classeswhich holds thatroughly every decade a new,

<p>Introduction: If Google was a boxer then MapReduce would be a probing right hand that sets
up the massive left hook that is Dremel, Google's--scalable (thousands of
CPUs, petabytes of data, trillions of rows), SQL based, columnar, interactive
(results returned in seconds), ad-hoc--analytics system. If Google was a
magician then MapReduce would be the shiny thing that distracts the mind while
the trick goes unnoticed. I say that because even though Dremel has been
around internally at Google since 2006, we have not heard a whisper about it.
All we've heard about is MapReduce, clones of which have inspired entire new
industries.Tricky.Dremel, according to Brian Bershad, Director of Engineering
at Google, is targeted at solvingBigData class problems:While we all know that
systems are huge and will get even huger, the implications of this size on
programmability, manageability, power, etc. is hard to comprehend. Alfred

<p>Introduction: The world of scalable databases is not a simple one. They come in every race,
creed, and color. Rick Cattell has brought some harmony to that world by
publishingHigh Performance Scalable Data Stores, a nicely detailed one stop
shop paper comparing scalable databases soley on the content of their
character. Ironically, the first step in that evaluation is dividing the world
into four groups:Key-value stores: Redis, Scalaris, Voldmort, and
Riak.Document stores: Couch DB, MongoDB, and SimpleDB.Record stores: BigTable,
HBase, HyperTable, and Cassandra.Scalable RDBMSs: MySQL Cluster, ScaleDB,
Drizzle, and VoltDB.The paper describes each system and then compares them on
the dimensions of Concurrency Control, Data Storage Replication, Transaction
Model, General Comments, Maturity, K-hits, License Language.And the winner is:
there are no winners. Yet. Rick concludes by pointing to a great convergence:I

<p>Introduction: In the "should I or shouldn't I" debate around deploying SSD, it always helps
to have real-world data. Fiesta! with alive-blog summary of a presentation by
Kenny Gorman onShutterfly on MongoDB Performance Tuning.What if you still need
more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs.
Shutterfly usesFacebook's flashcache: kernel module to cache data on SSD.
Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single
mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O.
Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can
delay sharding: less complexity.The wholeseries of posts has a lot of great
information and is worth a longer look, especially if you are considering
using MongoDB. Related ArticlesSlides forMongoSF 2011 slides: MongoDB

<p>Introduction: Wildly popular VC blogger Fred Wilson defines in an excellent 27 minute
videothe ten most important criteria he uses when deciding to give the gold,
that is, fund a web application. Note, this video isfrom 2010, so no doubt the
ideas are still valid, but the importance of mobile vs web apps has probably
shifted to mobile, as Mr. Wilson says in a recent post: mobile is growing like
a weed. Speed- speed is more than a feature, it's a requirement. Mainstream
users are unforgiving. If something is slow they won't use it. Pingdom is used
to track speed across their portfolio. A trend they've noticed is that as an
application slows down they don't grow as quickly. Instant Utility- a service
must be instantly useful to users. Lengthy setup and configuration is a
killer. Tricks like crawling the web to populate information you expect to get
from your users later makes the service initially useful. YouTube won, for
example, with instant availability of uploaded video.Voice- Consumer software

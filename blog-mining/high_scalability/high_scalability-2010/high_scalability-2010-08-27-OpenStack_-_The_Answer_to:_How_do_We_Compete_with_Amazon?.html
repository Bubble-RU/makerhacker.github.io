cloudsters at theEucalyptus Cloud Meetup. If Rich could teach computer science
at every school the state of the computer science industry would be

vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his
group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and
glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he
decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as
a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement

<p>Introduction: This is a part interview part guest with Sebastian Stadil, founder ofScalr, a
cheaper open-source version of RightScale. Scalr takes care of all the web
site infrastructure bits to on Amazon (and other clouds) so you don't have
to.I first met Sebastian at one of the original Silicon Valley Cloud Computing
Group meetups, a group which he founded. The meetings started in the tiny
offices of Intalio where Sebastian was working with this new fangled Amazon
thing to create an auto-scaling server farm on EC2. I remember distinctly how
Sebastian met everyone at the door with a handshake and a smile, making us all
feel welcome. Later I took one of the classes he created on how to use AWS. I
guess he figured all this cloud stuff was going somewhere and decided to start
Scalr.My only regret about this post is that the name Amazon does not begin
with the letter 'S', that would have made for an epic title.Getting to Know

<p>Introduction: Adrian Cockcroft on the future ofCloud, Open Source, SaaS and the End of
Enterprise Computing:Most big enterprise companies are actively working on
their AWS rollout now. Most of them are also trying to get an in-house cloud
to work, with varying amounts of success, but even the best private clouds are
still years behind the feature set of public clouds, which is has a big impact
on the agility and speed of product developmentWhile theSnowden
revelationshave tattered the thin veil of trust secreting Big Brother from We
the People, they may also be driving a fascinating new tension in architecture
choices between Cloud Native (scale-out, IaaS), Amazon Native (rich service
dependencies), and Enterprise Native (raw hardware, scale-up).This tension
became evident in a recentHipChat interviewwhere HipChat, makers of an AWS
based SaaS chat product, were busy creating an on-premises version of their
product that could operate behind the firewall in enterprise datacenters. This

CIO's on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context
to how they can leverage SpringCM' s easy, fast and affordable cloud

in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a
combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those
services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be
outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud
services.What options do I have?In a recent conversation with a CIO

<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a meetup Wednesday onOpenStack,
whose tag line isthe open source, open standards cloud. I was shocked at the
large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of
them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free
t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are
really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud
doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from
Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems
to be. The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:OpenStack allows any organization
to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software
running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically
creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack
Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage using

<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>3 0.91682857 <a title="888-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-24-A_Scalable%2C_Commodity_Data_Center_Network_Architecture.html">371 high scalability-2008-08-24-A Scalable, Commodity Data Center Network Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Looks interesting...Abstract:Today's data centers may contain tens of
thousands of computers with significant aggregate bandwidth requirements. The
network architecture typically consists of a tree of routing and switching
elements with progressively more specialized and expensive equipment moving up
the network hierarchy. Unfortunately, even when deploying the highest-end IP
switches/routers, resulting topologies may only support 50% of the aggregate
bandwidth available at the edge of the network, while still incurring
tremendous cost. Nonuniform bandwidth among data center nodes complicates
application design and limits overall system performance.In this paper, we
show how to leverage largely commodity Ethernet switches to support the full
aggregate bandwidth of clusters consisting of tens of thousands of elements.
Similar to how clusters of commodity computers have largely replaced more
specialized SMPs and MPPs, we argue that appropriately architected and
interconnected commodity s</p><p>4 0.91607547 <a title="888-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala_-_P2P_Online_Storage_Cloud.html">368 high scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala - P2P Online Storage Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected
availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P
systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show
you how! They havelaunched Wuala, the social online storage service which
scales as new nodes join the P2P network.The goal ofWua.lais to provide
distributed online storage that is:largescalablereliablesecureby harnessing
the idle resources of participating computers.This challenge is an old dream
of computer science. In fact asAndrew Tanenbaumwrote in 1995:"The design of a
world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by
millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise
for the reader"After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich,
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system,

<p>Introduction: "I'll never need to scale so why bother? We aren't Twitter or Facebook or
Google after all." This is the most common email I get, a question in the form
of a thinly disguised rationalization for not having to worry about scaling.
And in these days of giant transformer-like machines they are probably right.
But what if there areBarry Bonds enhancing type forces at work that argue for
the chances of your needing to scale being higher than you think?And if that
happens, how will you cross the scalability chasm? Will you want to completely
change your architecture or evolve it from a tool-chain that was meant to
scale from the start? Architecturally, that's the question you have to answer.
Today's tool-chains are making it possible to grow a system from small to
large without needing to implement complete architectural phase changes at
various scale inflection points, but that's a different topic. We're trying to
think about why you may actually need to scale, that is the question.Tumblr i</p><p>6 0.90942758 <a title="888-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-02-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_2%2C_2010.html">851 high scalability-2010-07-02-Hot Scalability Links for July 2, 2010</a></p>

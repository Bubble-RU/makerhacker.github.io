<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the
System of the World.-- Isaac NewtonThe practice of IT reminds me a lot of the
practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there
was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific
revolution with hisSystem of the World. And everything changed. That was New
System of the World number one.New System of the World number two was written
about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible Baroque Cycle
series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society
grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science.
Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of
forces.In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we've
never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything
clear?

<p>Introduction: There are so many architectural ideas swirling in the bit wind these days. Two
of the biggest battles are cloud vs. bare metal and RAM vs. disk vs. SSD.
37signals has published two solid articles that are counter hype cycle in
their message:Technologists who grew up when RAM cost $1,000 per megabyte can
have a hard time dealing with the luxury of RAM being virtually free.The
progress of technology is throwing an ever greater number of optimizations
into the "premature evil" bucket never to be seen again.37signals made quite a
stir with their money shot of the864GB of RAM they bought for a mere $12Kas
part of their caching layer for Basecamp. That's a lot of memory for not a lot
of money. There's nothing like actually seeing it in the flesh to bring the
point home. Does that makeMemory Based Architecturesa little more
appealing?37signals then followed up with another provocative article:Three

<p>Introduction: Joe Stump, Lead Architect at Digg, gavethis presentationat the Web 2.0 Expo. I
couldn't find the actual presentation, but fortunatelyKris Jordantook some
great notes. That's how key moments in history are accidentally captured
forever. Joe was also kind enough to respond to my email questions with a
phone call.In this first part of the post Joe shares some timeless wisdom that
you may or may not have read before. I of course take some pains to extract
all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules. What
really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDBWill be the biggest new
kid on the block in scaling. MemcacheDB has been around for a little while and
I've never thought of it in that way. Well learn why Joe is so excited by
MemcacheDB at the end of the post.Impressive Stats80th-100th largest site in

<p>Introduction: I love it when a somewhat older article like Pinterest Cut Costs From $54 To
$20 Per Hour By Automatically Shutting Down Systems hits Hacker News and
generates agood conversation. One of the common sentiments about the cloud was
raised: why doesn't Pinterest save a lot of money by running their own
hardware instead of using the cloud?Ryan Park, Operations Engineer at
Pinterest, responds in what I think is the perfectmodern responseto that
ultimate existential design dilemma:Our #1 requirement has been to keep up
with the growth in traffic on the site. We've been growing so fast that
there's literally no way we could have ordered and racked equipment fast
enough. We were also a very small team -- a year ago there were only about a
dozen people in the whole company. At this point we're much larger, which
gives us room to consider more options like colo or multiple cloud
providers.AWS certainly feels pretty costly when you compare colo prices to
the list price for on-demand instances.

<p>Introduction: After Googlecut prices on their Google Cloud Platform Amazon quickly followed
with their ownprice cuts. Even more interesting is what the future holds for
pricing. The near future looks great. After that? We'll see.Adrian Cockcroft
highlights that Google thinksprices should followMoore's law, which means we
should expect prices to halve every 18-24 months.That's good news. Greater
cost certainty means you can make much more aggressive build out plans. With
the savings you can hire more people, handle more customers, and add those
media rich features you thought you couldn't afford. Design is directly
related to costs.Without Google competing with Amazon there's little doubt the
price reduction curve would be much less favorable.As a late cloud entrant
Google is now in a customer acquisition phase, so they are willing to pay for
customers, which means lower prices are an acceptable cost of doing business.
Profit and high margins are not the objective. Getting market share is what is

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 2 (part 1) of an interviewI did for theBoundary
blog.Boundary:  There's another battle coming down the pike between Amazon
(AWS) and Google (GCE). How should the CTO decide which one's best?Hoff: Given
that GCE is still closed to public access we have very little common
experience on which to judge. The best way to decide is as always, by running
a few experiments. Pick a few representative projects, a representative team,
implement the projects on both infrastructures, crunch some numbers, figure
out the bigger picture and then select the one you wanted in the first place
.Sebastian Stadil, founder of Scalr, recently wrote about his experiences on
both platforms and found some interesting differences: AWS has a much richer
set of services; GCE is on-demand only, so AWS can be cheaper; GCE has faster
disk and faster network IO, especially between datacenters; GCE has faster
boot times and can mount read-only partitions across multiple machines; and
GCE shares i</p><p>5 0.76163346 <a title="865-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-20-Packet_Pushers%3A_How_to_Build_a_Low_Cost_Data_Center.html">1027 high scalability-2011-04-20-Packet Pushers: How to Build a Low Cost Data Center</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers Show 41 episode was to reveal and
ruminate over the horrors of a successfulattack on RSA, which puts the whole
world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there
was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost
datacenter.Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile
back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by
summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal: Look at
Arista and Juniper. JuniperHas a range of stackable switches, which includes
some 10 gig.If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on
their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric
solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric.
Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.
Thinks Juniper would make a good deal in order to get a few reference sites

<p>Introduction: InLog Everything All the TimeI advocate applications shouldn't bother logging
at all. Why waste all that time and code? No, wait, that's not right. I preach
logging everything all the time. Doh. Facebook obviously feels similarly which
is why they opened sourcedScribe, their internal logging system, capable of
logging 10s of billions of messages per day. These messages include access
logs, performance statistics, actions that went to News Feed, and many
others.Imagine hundreds of thousands of machines across many geographical
dispersed datacenters just aching to send their precious log payload to the
central repository off all knowledge. Because really, when you combine all the
meta data with all the events you pretty much have a complete picture of your
operations. Once in the central repository logs can be scanned, indexed,
summarized, aggregated, refactored, diced, data cubed, and mined for every
scrap of potentially useful information.Just imagine the log stream from all

<p>Introduction: Should you pay more in the cloud or pay less for bare metal in the datacenter?
This is a crucial decision point facing startups today. Which way should you
go? In thisWebpulp.tv interview, Joe Stump, always a go-to guy when you need a
metric ass-ton (a favorite expression of Joe's) of good advice on cutting edge
practices for the modern startup, laughs at conventional wisdom by sayingthe
cloud is really not more expensive than bare metal.The argument for a cheaper
cloud has a three main points:Raw Hardware Costs are Close. Buying hardware is
cheaper than renting hardware from Amazon, but it's close when you
considerreserved instances. A reserved instance costs about $250 a year and a
new server costs about $1500. Let's say Amazon is 30% slower. That means for a
cluster of 20 machines you would need a another 7 servers. This takes 10
minutes and 4 button clicks to provision on the cloud (the advantage of a
scale-out architecture + automation + cloud aware tools). So 7 extra servers

<p>Introduction: In the past year, Intel issued a series of powerful chips under the new
Nehalem microarchitecture, with large numbers of cores and extensive memory
capacity. This new class of chips is is part of a bigger Intel initiative
referred to as Tera-Scale Computing. Cisco has released their Unified
Computing System (UCS) equipped with a unique extended memory and high speed
network within the box, which is specifically geared to take advantage of this
type of CPU architecture .This new class of hardware has the potential to
revolutionize the IT landscape as we know it.In  this post, I want to focus

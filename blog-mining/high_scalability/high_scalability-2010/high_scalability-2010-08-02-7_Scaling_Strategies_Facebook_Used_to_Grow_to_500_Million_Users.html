<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 1 of  an interview  I did for the  Boundary blog . 
 
 Boundary:   What is Facebook’s secret sauce for managing what’s got to be the biggest Big Data project, if you will, on the Web? 
 
 Hoff:  From several presentations we’ve learned what Facebook insiders like  Aditya Agarwal  and  Robert Johnson , both former Directors of Engineering, consider their secret sauce:
  
  Scaling Takes Iteration . Solutions often work in the beginning, but you’ll have to modify them as you go. PHP, for example, is simple to use at first, but is not a good choice when you have tens of thousands of web servers. 
   
  Scaling Takes Iteration . You can say that again. 
   
  Don’t Over-Design .  Just use what you need as you scale your system out. Figure out where you need to iterate on a solution, optimize something, or completely build a part of the stack yourself. 
   
  Choose the Right Tool for the Job . Realize that any choice comes with overhead. If you really need to use P</p><p>3 0.22657001 <a title="870-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-10-The_Four_Meta_Secrets_of_Scaling_at_Facebook.html">840 high scalability-2010-06-10-The Four Meta Secrets of Scaling at Facebook</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, gave an excellent  Scale at Facebook  talk that covers their architecture, but the talk is really more about how to scale an organization by preserving the best parts of its culture. The key take home of the talk is: 
  

You can get the code right, you can get the products right, but you need to get the culture right first. If you don't get the culture right then your company won't scale.

  
This leads into the four meta secrets of scaling at Facebook:
  
 Scaling takes Iteration 
 Don't Over Design 
 Choose the right tool for the job, but realize that your choice comes with overhead. 
 Get the culture right. Move Fast - break things. Huge Impact - small teams. Be bold - innovate. 
      Some Background    
  Facebook is big : 400 million active users; users spend an average of 20 minutes a day; 5 billion pieces of content (status updates, comments, likes, photo uploads, video uploads, chat messages, inbox messages, group events, f</p><p>4 0.21028614 <a title="870-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-07-Startups_are_Creating_a_New_System_of_the_World_for_IT.html">1240 high scalability-2012-05-07-Startups are Creating a New System of the World for IT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive</p><p>5 0.19611269 <a title="870-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-12-High_Performance_at_Massive_Scale_%E2%80%93__Lessons_learned_at_Facebook.html">720 high scalability-2009-10-12-High Performance at Massive Scale –  Lessons learned at Facebook</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: " High Performance at Massive Scale –  Lessons learned at Facebook ". The abstract for the talk is:
  

Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web architectures.

<p>Introduction: To celebrate the new year Facebook has  shared the results  of a little end of the year introspection. It has been a fecund year for Facebook:
  
 43,869,800 changed their status to single 
 3,025,791 changed their status to "it's complicated" 
 28,460,516 changed their status to in a relationship 
 5,974,574 changed their status to engaged 
 36,774,801 changes their status to married 
  
If these numbers are simply to large to grasp, it doesn't get any better when you look at happens in a mere 20 minutes:
  
 Shared links: 1,000,000  
 Tagged photos: 1,323,000 
 Event invites sent out: 1,484,000 
 Wall Posts: 1,587,000  
 Status updates: 1,851,000 
 Friend requests accepted: 1,972,000 
 Photos uploaded: 2,716,000 
 Comments: 10,208,000 
 Message: 4,632,000 
  
If you want to see how Facebook supports these huge numbers take a look at a few  posts .
 
One wonders what the new year will bring?

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recent  acquisitions  have been surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's  5 day whirlwind acquisition  of   Oculus  , immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a now paltry sounding $2 billion.
   The    backlash    is a pandemic, jumping across    social networks    with the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can generate.  
   For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here, Facebook’s ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.  
  For the many who voted for an open future with their  Kickstarter dollars , there’s a deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook’s promise to leave Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to people. It's new, it's different, it create</p><p>5 0.86356562 <a title="870-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-23-Facebook_Secrets_of_Web_Performance.html">1444 high scalability-2013-04-23-Facebook Secrets of Web Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a repost of part 1 of  an interview  I did for the  Boundary blog . 
 
 Boundary:   What is Facebook’s secret sauce for managing what’s got to be the biggest Big Data project, if you will, on the Web? 
 
 Hoff:  From several presentations we’ve learned what Facebook insiders like  Aditya Agarwal  and  Robert Johnson , both former Directors of Engineering, consider their secret sauce:
  
  Scaling Takes Iteration . Solutions often work in the beginning, but you’ll have to modify them as you go. PHP, for example, is simple to use at first, but is not a good choice when you have tens of thousands of web servers. 
   
  Scaling Takes Iteration . You can say that again. 
   
  Don’t Over-Design .  Just use what you need as you scale your system out. Figure out where you need to iterate on a solution, optimize something, or completely build a part of the stack yourself. 
   
  Choose the Right Tool for the Job . Realize that any choice comes with overhead.

<p>Introduction: Morgan Tocker has an awesome article and comment thread in the  MySQL Performance Blog  about  When should you store serialized objects in the database?  Before the NoSQL age is was very common to simulate schemalessness by storing blobs in MySQL. Sharding was implemented by running multiple MySQL instances and spreading writes across them. While not ideal for the purpose, developers felt comfortable with MySQL. They knew how to install it, back it up, replicate it, in short:Â  they knew how to make it work. Yet they also needed to store objects without the penalty of joins. Searches and aggregate queries were handled by indexes kept in separate tables, this offloaded the fast path to objects.
 
This all made perfect sense. Usually we just want stuff to work and going with what you know is often the best path to that goal. And what we have known is MySQL. All the different pros and cons of this approach are covered wonderfully in the post.
 
But the world has changed.

  $1.5 billion : The cost of cutting London-Toyko latency by 60ms;  9 days : It took AOL 9 years to hit 1 million users. Facebook 9 months. Draw Something 9 days;   ~362 sq ft solar array : powers 1 sq ft of data center. 
 Is Amazon is trying to margenalize OpenStack by  partnering with Eucalyptus ? 
 As the DevOps turns. You won't see this on TMZ.  Adrian Cockcroft :  There is no central control, the teams do it for themselves in the cloud;  John Allspaw : s/NoOps/OpsDoneMaturelyButStillOps/g;  Edward Capriolo : Trust developers not. Good thing is we all agree DevOps is necessary, the differences are in the how and whom. 
 In a word (or two), Wordnik has  gone cloud . Gone is their big iron, in are envious EC2 instances. Driving the move was HA in multi-datacenters, elasticity for traffic bursts, and incremental cluster upgrades. There has been almost no reduction in performance.

<p>Introduction: hi,   the website i work for is looking to build a email system that can handle a fair few emails (up to a hundred thousand a day).     These comprise emails like registration emails, newsletters, lots of user triggered emails and overnight emails.     At present we queue them in SQL and feed them into an smtp server on one of our web servers when the queue drops below a certain level.     this has caused our mail system to crash as well as hammer our DB server (shared!!!).     We have got an architecture of what we want to build but thought there might be something we could buy off the shelf that allowed us to keep templated emails, lists of recipients, schedule sends etc and report on it. We can't find anything     What do big websites like amazon etc use or people a little smaller but who still send loads of mail (flickr, ebuyer, or other ecommerce sites)     Cheers     tarqs</p><p>same-blog 5 0.93704736 <a title="870-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-02-7_Scaling_Strategies_Facebook_Used_to_Grow_to_500_Million_Users.html">870 high scalability-2010-08-02-7 Scaling Strategies Facebook Used to Grow to 500 Million Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Johnson,   a director of engineering at Facebook, celebrated Facebook's monumental achievement of reaching 500 million users by sharing the  scaling principles that helped  reach that milestone. In case you weren't suitably impressed by the 500 million user number, Robert ratchets up the numbers game with these impressive figures:      
 
 1 million users per engineer 
 500 million active users 
 100 billion hits per day 
 50 billion photos 
 2 trillion objects cached, with hundreds of millions of requests per second 
 130TB of logs every day 
 
  
How did Facebook get to this point?
   
  People Matter Most . It's people who build and run systems. The best tools for scaling are an engineering and operations teams that can handle anything. 
  Scale Horizontally . Handling exponentially growing traffic requires spreading load arbitrarily across many machines. Using different databases for tables like accounts and profiles only doubles capacity. This approach hurts efficiency, but</p><p>6 0.93359768 <a title="870-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-07-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_7th%2C_2014.html">1607 high scalability-2014-03-07-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 7th, 2014</a></p>

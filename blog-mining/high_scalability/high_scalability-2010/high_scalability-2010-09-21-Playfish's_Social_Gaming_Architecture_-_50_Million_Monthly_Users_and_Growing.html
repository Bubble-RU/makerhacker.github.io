</p><p>3 Asynchronous games are games where players can play at different times. [sent-34, score-1.159]
</p><p>4 Since your friends are rarely all on-line at the same time, social games are played asynchronously. [sent-35, score-0.801]
</p><p>5 Examples of asynchronous game play are familiar games like Scrabble or Texas Hold'em, where players take turns. [sent-42, score-1.062]
</p><p>6 More innovative are games like Playfish's Biggest Brain, a game where friends keep trying to prove who is smarter, uses a leader board to display pictures of your friends and their scores, so you can always see who is in the lead. [sent-43, score-1.145]
</p><p>7 Asynchronous games can be hardcore strategy games, something like the  Diplomacy board game  from the 1950s. [sent-46, score-0.851]

</p><p>9 Playfish games are not global in the sense that a million people don't try to play the same game at the same time. [sent-51, score-0.934]
</p><p>10 It's difficult to predict which games will be successful, so when a game does take off it must be able to expand immediately. [sent-71, score-0.778]
</p><p>11 Playfish must support and develop multiple games simultaneously, with new games always pushing on the schedule. [sent-82, score-0.944]
</p><p>12 Because the game is played asynchronously in a smart client, game latency is not critical, which means when a game is loading--flash game + assets--is the most noticeable latency the users experiences and they must reduce this as much as possible. [sent-93, score-1.491]
</p><p>13 Users can give game designers real-time feedback and effect the design of games they play. [sent-100, score-0.82]
</p><p>14 Social games are expanding out into  new markets , attracting people who have never played games before. [sent-104, score-1.095]
</p><p>15 Playfish tries to design games for social interaction, where you get a benefit to the game by inviting friends. [sent-131, score-0.94]
</p><p>16 They are far more concerned about the opportunity cost of not being able to develop new games and improve existing games in a rapidly evolving market. [sent-149, score-0.944]
</p><p>17 Playfish collects an enormous amount of data on game play that they use to continually improve existing games and help decide what games to invent next. [sent-174, score-1.382]

<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson:  Game Industry Legends: Rob Pardo , where the future of gaming is discussed, there was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:
  Q. If the game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of those technical issues?

 


 Rob Pardo : I certainly think there's a lot of potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with the infrastructure that can have all those games up there.

<p>Introduction: "Everything in war is simple, but the﻿ simplest thing is difficult." -- Carl von Clausewitz 
  

  

  
Games are proving grounds for software architecture. They combine scale, high performance, challenging problems, a rabid user base, cost sensitivity, and the need for profit. And when games have in-game currency, like EVE Online has, there's money at play, so you can't just get away with a c'est la vie attitude. Engineering must be applied. 
 
In  Planning for war: how the EVE Online servers deal with a 3,000 person battle , we learn some techniques EVE Online uses to handle large games:
  7 Sensible...   
  Do nothing.  Most games are manageable or have spikes that quickly dissipate.  
  Run it Hot . There's nothing to throttle as servers run at 100%. Why waste money? Use all your CPU. 
  Shard it . Games are sharded by solar system and multiple solar systems run on a node. 
  Move it . Games are moved when a machine becomes overloaded.

<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems Laboratories     * The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the high-tech industry.   * The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome of the evolution of these games.    * Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.    * The game server is used both to discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating (by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the server component.   * Using multiple servers is a basic mecha</p><p>5 0.29810262 <a title="904-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-19-Sponsored_Post%3A_Playfish%2C_Electronic_Arts%2C_Tagged%2C_Undertone%2C_Box.net%2C_Wiredrive%2C_Joyent%2C_DeviantART%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">922 high scalability-2010-10-19-Sponsored Post: Playfish, Electronic Arts, Tagged, Undertone, Box.net, Wiredrive, Joyent, DeviantART, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a really far ranging and insightful interview by Steve Peterson:  Game Industry Legends: Rob Pardo , where the future of gaming is discussed, there was a section on how the cloud might be used in games. I know there are a lot of game developers in my audience, so I thought it might be useful:
  Q. If the game is free-to-play but I have to download 10 gigabytes to try it out, that can keep me from trying it. That's part of what cloud gaming is trying to overcome; do you think cloud gaming is going to make some inroads because of those technical issues?

 


 Rob Pardo : I certainly think there's a lot of potential in cloud gaming, it's just picking the right games. There's a lot of hurdles for cloud gaming to overcome, one of which is having to have all these servers to be able to host all these games, since it's not like you need any less computing power to play these games. First of all you need someone with the infrastructure that can have all those games up there.

<p>Introduction: Update:  As expected I'm undergoing a massive spam attack for speaking truth to dark powers. This is the time to be strong. Together we can make a change. What change you may ask? I can't say, just change and lots more change. Let's link arms together and bravely stand against the forces of chaos for a better yesterday and a better tomorrow.   CAPTCHA doesn't work. Even Google can't make CAPTCHA work ( Spammers Choose GMail ). And even if CAPTCHA worked it wouldn't really work because CAPTCHA solving markets ( Inside India’s CAPTCHA solving economy ) have evolved where for a mere $2 you can buy 1000 human broken CAPTCHA's. And we know once the free market tackles a problem that's it. Game over :-)  Making ever more clever CAPTCHA programs won't outwit and outlast the CAPTCHA solving markets. Until Skynet evolves the only way to defeat humans is with humans.

<p>Introduction: "Online games and virtual worlds have familiar scaling requirements, but don’t be fooled: everything you know is wrong." Jim Waldo, Sun Microsystems Laboratories     * The computational environment for online games or virtual worlds is close to the exact inverse of that found in most markets serviced by the high-tech industry.   * The need for a heavyweight client is, in part, an outcome of the evolution of these games.    * Latency is the enemy of fun—and therefore the enemy of online games and virtual worlds.    * The game server is used both to discourage cheating (by making it much more difficult) and to detect cheating (by seeing patterns of divergence between the game state reported by the client and the game state held by the server). Peer-to-peer technologies might seem a natural fit for the first role of the game server, but this second role means that few if any games or worlds trust their peers enough to avoid the server component.   * Using multiple servers is a basic mecha</p><p>6 0.78721583 <a title="904-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-22-EVE_Online_Architecture.html">424 high scalability-2008-10-22-EVE Online Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact socially with friends using  Playfish  games on social platforms like The Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the fastest growing segment of the game industry:  social gaming , which is the love child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by why EA bought them for  $300 million  and they think a  $1 billion game  is possible): building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve systems, agile development and deployment, and  selling virtual good  as a business model.
 
How can a small company make all this happen? To explain the magic I interviewed Playfish's Jodi Moran, Senior Director of Engineering, an</p><p>2 0.97827834 <a title="904-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-10-LevelDB_-_Fast_and_Lightweight_Key-Value_Database_From_the_Authors_of_MapReduce_and_BigTable.html">1096 high scalability-2011-08-10-LevelDB - Fast and Lightweight Key-Value Database From the Authors of MapReduce and BigTable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: LevelDB  is an exciting new entrant into the pantheon of embedded databases, notable both for its pedigree, being authored by the makers of the now mythical Google MapReduce and BigTable products, and for its emphasis on efficient disk based random access using log-structured-merge (LSM) trees. 
 
The plan is to keep LevelDB fairly low-level. The intention is that it will be a useful building block for higher-level storage systems. Basho is  already investigating  using LevelDB as one if its storage engines.
 
In the past many systems were built around embedded databases, though most developers now use database servers connected to via RPCs. An embedded database is a database distributed as a library and linked directly into your application. The application is responsible for providing a service level API, sharding, backups, initiating consistency checking, initiation rollback,  startup, shutdown, queries, etc. Applications become the container for the database and the manager of the</p><p>3 0.97800398 <a title="904-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-12-MySpace_Architecture.html">511 high scalability-2009-02-12-MySpace Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Presentation: Behind the Scenes at MySpace.com . Dan Farino, Chief Systems Architect at MySpace shares details of some of MySpace's cool internal operations tools.   MySpace.com  is one of the fastest growing site on the Internet with 65 million subscribers and 260,000 new users registering each day. Often criticized for poor performance, MySpace has had to tackle scalability issues few other sites have faced. How did they do it?

<p>Introduction: CNBC, like many large web sites, relied  on a CDN for content delivery.  Recently, we started looking  to see if we could improve this model.  Our criteria was:     - improve response time  - have better control over traffic (real time reporting, change management and alerting)  - better utilize internal datacenters and their infrastructure  - shield users from any troubles at the origin infrastructure  - cost out       After researching the market, we turned to two vendors: Dyn (Dynamic Network Services) and  aiScaler . We' have had   about a year worth of experience with  aiScaler  (search for "CNBC" to see my previous post ), but Dyn was a new vendor for us.  We started building our relationship at Velocity conference in the summer of 2009.    Dyn has recently started offering a geo-aware DNS load balancing solution, using Anycast and the distributed nature of their DNS presence to enable a key component of what we were trying to achieve: steer users to geographically closest origin</p><p>5 0.97639328 <a title="904-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-07-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_7%2C_2013.html">1472 high scalability-2013-06-07-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 7, 2013</a></p>

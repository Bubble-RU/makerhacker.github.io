<p>Introduction: Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of Technology at Facebook gave a great
presentation at UC San Diego on our favorite subject: "High Performance at
Massive Scale -  Lessons learned at Facebook". The abstract for the talk
is:Facebook has grown into one of the largest sites on the Internet today
serving over 200 billion pages per month. The nature of social data makes
engineering a site for this level of scale a particularly challenging
proposition. In this presentation, I will discuss the aspects of social data
that present challenges for scalability and will describe the the core
architectural components and design principles that Facebook has used to
address these challenges. In addition, I will discuss emerging technologies
that offer new opportunities for building cost-effective high performance web
architectures.There's a lot of interesting about this talk that we'll get into

<p>Introduction: This post about using Hive and Hadoop for analytics comes straight from
Facebook engineers.Scalable analysis on large data sets has been core to the
functions of a number of teams at Facebook - both engineering and non-
engineering. Apart from ad hoc analysis and business intelligence applications
used by analysts across the company, a number of Facebook products are also
based on analytics.These products range from simple reporting applications
like Insights for the Facebook Ad Network, to more advanced kind such as
Facebook's Lexicon product.As a result a flexible infrastructure that caters
to the needs of these diverse applications and users and that also scales up
in a cost effective manner with the ever increasing amounts of data being
generated on Facebook, is critical. Hive and Hadoop are the technologies that
we have used to address these requirements at Facebook.Read the rest of the

<p>Introduction: There's some amount of debate whether Facebookreallycrossed over the one
trillion page view per month threshold. While one report says it did,another
respected firm says it did not; that its monthly page views are a mere 467
billion per month.In the big scheme of things, the discrepancy is somewhat
irrelevant, as neither show thetrueload on Facebook's infrastructure - which
is far more impressive a set of numbers than its externally measured "page
view" metric.  Mashable reported in "Facebook Surpasses 1 Trillion Pageviews
per Month" that the social networking giant saw "approximately 870 million
unique visitors in June and 860 million in July" and followed up with some per
visitor statistics, indicating "each visitor averaged approximately 1,160 page
views in July and 40 per visit -- enormous by any standard. Time spent on the
site was around 25 minutes per user."From an architectural standpoint it's
notjustabout the page views. It's about requests and responses, many of which

<p>Introduction: Facebook made quite a splash when they released theirnative iOS app, not
because of their app per se, but because of their conclusion that theirbiggest
mistake was betting on HTML5, so they had to go native.As you might imagine
this was a bit like telling a Great White Shark that its bark is worse than
its bite.  Acommon refrainwas Facebook simply had made a bad HTML5 site, not
that HTML5 itself is bad, as plenty of other vendors have made slick well
performing mobile sites.An interesting and relevant conversation given the
rising butt kickery of mobile. But we were lacking details. Now we aren't. If
you were wondering just why Facebook ditched HTML5, Tobie Langel inPerf
Feedback - What's slowing down Mobile Facebook, lists out the reasons:Tooling
/ Developer APIs. Most importantly, the lack of tooling to track down memory
problems. Scrolling performance.Scrolling must be fast and smooth and full
featured. It's not.GPU.A clunky API and black box approach make it an
unreliable accelerat</p><p>6 0.81233037 <a title="845-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-14-Who_Has_the_Most_Web_Servers%3F.html">599 high scalability-2009-05-14-Who Has the Most Web Servers?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Guys,At one of my jobs I have to administer a CISCO ACE (application control
engine) hardware load-balancer.I don't particularly love this beast, but it's
very very powerful.There appears to be little real-world info out there, so it
could be interesting writing an article on that.But I don't have other HW LB's
to compare it to and I don't want to rehash the product page.What would
interest you in a 'product review' of a loadbalancer?No replies means it's not
an interesting topic, so no article then ;-)</p><p>same-blog 3 0.64957947 <a title="845-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring_the_software_behind_Facebook%2C_the_world%E2%80%99s_largest_site.html">845 high scalability-2010-06-22-Exploring the software behind Facebook, the world’s largest site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Peter Alguacil at Pingdom wrote a HighScalability worthy article on Facebook's
architecture: Exploring the software behind Facebook, the world's largest
site. It covers the challenges Facebook faces, the software Facebook uses, and
the techniques Facebook uses to keep on scaling. Definitely worth a look.</p><p>4 0.60431641 <a title="845-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Product%3A_ISPMan_Centralized_ISP_Management_System_.html">228 high scalability-2008-01-28-Product: ISPMan Centralized ISP Management System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: FromFRESH Portsand their website:ISPmanis an ISP management software written
in perl, using an LDAPbackend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP. It can be
used to manage,DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration,
cyrusmail boxes, proftpd etc.ISPMan was written as a management tool for the
network at 4unet wherebetween 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is
crazily growing.Managing these domains and their users was a little time
consuming,and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these
daemonsfluently. Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and
users.LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server canbe
scaled from 1 to n as required. An LDAP entry called maildroptells the SMTP
server (postfix) where to deliver the mail. The SMTPservers can be
loadbalanced with one of many load balancingtechniques. The program is written
with scalability and Highavailability in mind.This may not be the right
software for you if you want to run a sm</p><p>5 0.56045401 <a title="845-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-15-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_15%2C_2012.html">1265 high scalability-2012-06-15-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 15, 2012</a></p>

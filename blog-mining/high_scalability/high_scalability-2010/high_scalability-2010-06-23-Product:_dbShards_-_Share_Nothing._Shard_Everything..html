They occupy an interesting niche in the database space, somewhere between  NoSQL , which jettisons everything SQL, and  high end analytics platforms  that completely rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.
 
High concept: I think of dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from  HSCALE  (partitioning) +  MySQL Proxy  (transparent intermediate layer) +  Memcached  (client side sharding) +  Gigaspaces  (parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).
 
You may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult questions (not really).
  Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was dbShards created to solve?   

I’m Cory Isaacson, CEO/CTO of CodeFutures Corp</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 dbShards operates in conjunction with commodity databases to make database sharding easy to implement and manage, accommodating rapid growth in data size and transaction volumes. [sent-9, score-0.268]
</p><p>2 dbShards is a full, general purpose database scalability platform, allowing you to scale both reads and writes across multiple nodes. [sent-27, score-0.276]
</p><p>3 We have seen that the DBMS engines themselves are excellent at “most recently used” caching, so by sharding your database you change the data size to memory/CPU balance. [sent-28, score-0.228]
</p><p>4 Ideally we balance the shards such that at least the indexes are in memory, often much of the data too. [sent-29, score-0.212]
</p><p>5 That means that any normal SQL statements automatically take advantage of the native DBMS’s raw performance for reads (which is very fast). [sent-30, score-0.196]
</p><p>6 Then we shard across multiple servers and provide linear scalability (i. [sent-34, score-0.346]
</p><p>7 , 4 shards is 4X the write performance of 1 shard). [sent-36, score-0.212]
</p><p>8 Lastly, dbShards offers Parallel Query, where users can perform what we call a “Go Fish” query across all shards, with the results collated automatically by the environment. [sent-37, score-0.289]
</p><p>9 In many cases using this approach we can provide much better than linear improvement as shards are added, and this type of access cannot be supported at all by a caching layer. [sent-40, score-0.32]
</p><p>10 As such it delivers linear scalability improvements as shards are added to the environment. [sent-53, score-0.317]
</p><p>11 Further, dbShards utilized our own plug-in driver technology, so the application in fact connects directly to each native database running on each shard server. [sent-54, score-0.358]
</p><p>12 The reason for this is simply the balance between CPU, memory and database size — get that right for a given application utilizing a sharding approach, and everything flies. [sent-57, score-0.227]
</p><p>13 One issue with sharding is the introduction of more failure points, given the very nature of the distributed database structure across multiple servers. [sent-58, score-0.232]
</p><p>14 It supports failover, and in fact customers can perform  planned failover so that specific shard databases can be taken offline for maintenance without disruption of the application. [sent-62, score-0.426]
</p><p>15 dbShards implements a concept called Virtual Shards, where we design more shards into the architecture than are actually deployed physically. [sent-84, score-0.212]
</p><p>16 Because we have the ability to take a replicate server for a shard offline without disruption, re-sharding (or “Shard Mitosis” as we like to call it) can then be performed by separating out one physical shard into two or more physical shards along virtual shard definition boundaries. [sent-85, score-0.838]
</p><p>17 For example, if a database is sharded by customer_no, then we might define 200 Virtual Shards, but shards with only 2 Physical Shards. [sent-86, score-0.331]
</p><p>18 The dbShards driver examines each query and directs it to the proper shard based on the “shard key”, or directs it to all shards using our parallel query mechanism (which we like to call a “Go Fish” query). [sent-93, score-0.69]
</p><p>19 Go Fish queries are automatically distributed and results collated in a very high performance fashion, so the application developer issues a single SELECT and gets back a single result set. [sent-94, score-0.208]
</p><p>20 Database Sharding is typically a lot of work, and requires major modifications to an application to support it, but with dbShards the whole thing is transparent to the application developer. [sent-101, score-0.195]

<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Why you don’t want to shard.  by Morgon on the MySQL Performance Blog.  Optimize everything else first, and then if performance still isn’t good enough, it’s time to take a very bitter medicine.    Update 3:   Building Scalable Databases: Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemes  by Dare Obasanjo. Excellent discussion of why and when you would choose a sharding architecture, how to shard, and problems with sharding.  Update 2:   Mr. Moore gets to punt on sharding  by Alan Rimm-Kaufman of 37signals. Insightful article on design tradeoffs and the evils of premature optimization. With more memory, more CPU, and new tech like SSD,  problems can be avoided before more exotic architectures like sharding are needed.  Add features not infrastructure.  Jeremy Zawodny  says he's wrong wrong wrong. we're running multi-core CPUs at slower clock speeds. Moore won't save you.

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great scalability solution, but caching also  comes with problems .  Sharding  is a great scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in a  post-mortem  about their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database Foursquare uses, also contributed their  post-mortem  of what went wrong too.
 
Now that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?
 
First, like for  Facebook , huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in a pretty cool industry.
 
Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built by a small group of people, under immense pressure</p><p>6 0.19269772 <a title="847-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding_the_Hibernate_Way.html">358 high scalability-2008-07-26-Sharding the Hibernate Way</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update :  A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview with  Google engineer Max Ross on Hibernate Shards . Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to Google AppEngine (not much).   To scale you are supposed to partition your data. Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all the details it’s not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff in the right way and it’s very much worth looking at, especially if you us</p><p>4 0.85983229 <a title="847-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-28-How_to_Organize_a_Database_Table%E2%80%99s_Keys_for_Scalability.html">476 high scalability-2008-12-28-How to Organize a Database Table’s Keys for Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all shards.     There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys across a shard cluster. Each has its pro’s and con’s and the one chosen should be specific to the problems you’re trying to solve.</p><p>5 0.82471156 <a title="847-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-11-Pyshards_aspires_to_build_sharding_toolkit_for_Python.html">345 high scalability-2008-06-11-Pyshards aspires to build sharding toolkit for Python</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've been interested in sharding concepts since first hearing the term "shard" a few years back. My interest had been piqued earlier, the first time I read about Google's original approach to distributed search. It was described as a hashtable-like system in which independent physical machines play the role of the buckets. More recently, I needed the capacity and performance of a Sharded system, but did not find helpful libraries or toolkits which would assist with the configuration for my language of preference these days, which is Python. And, since I had a few weeks on my hands, I decided I would begin the work of creating these tools.       The result of my initial work the Pyshards project, a still-incomplete python and MySQL based horizontal partitioning and sharding toolkit. HighScalability.com readers will already know that horizontal partitioning is a data segmenting pattern in which distinct groups of physical row-based datasets are distributed across multiple partitions.

<p>Introduction: There have been reports that  software engineering is dead . Maybe, like the future, software engineering is simply not evenly distributed? When you read this paper I think you'll agree there is some real engineering going on, it's just that most of the things we need to build do not require real engineering. Much like my old childhood tree fort could be patched together and was "good enough." This brings to mind the old joke: If a software tree falls in the woods would anyone hear it fall? Only if it tweeted on the way down...  What this paper really showed me is we need not only to change programming practices and constructs, but we also need to design solutions that allow for deep parallelism to begin with. Grafting parallelism on later is difficult. Parallel execution requires knowing precisely how components are dependent on each other and that level of precision tends to go far beyond the human attention span.  In particular this paper deals with how to parallelize the browser on</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96342552 <a title="847-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-23-Product%3A_dbShards_-_Share_Nothing._Shard_Everything..html">847 high scalability-2010-06-23-Product: dbShards - Share Nothing. Shard Everything.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I met the CodeFutures folks, makers of  dbShards , at  Gluecon . They occupy an interesting niche in the database space, somewhere between  NoSQL , which jettisons everything SQL, and  high end analytics platforms  that completely rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.
 
High concept: I think of dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from  HSCALE  (partitioning) +  MySQL Proxy  (transparent intermediate layer) +  Memcached  (client side sharding) +  Gigaspaces  (parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).
 
You may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult questions (not really).
  Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was dbShards created to solve?

<p>Introduction: This is a follow up article by   Cory Isaacson  to the first article on DbShards,   Product: dbShards - Share Nothing. Shard Everything   , describing some of the details about how DbShards works on the inside. 
 
The dbShards architecture is a true “shared nothing” implementation of Database Sharding. The high-level view of dbShards is shown here:    The above diagram shows how dbShards works for achieving massive database scalability across multiple database servers, using native DBMS engines and our dbShards components. The important components are:
  
  dbS/Client : A design goal of dbShards is to make database sharding as seamless as possible to an application, so that application developers can write the same type of code they always have. A key component to making this possible is the dbShards Client. The dbShards Client is our intelligent driver that is an exact API emulation of a given vendor’s database driver. For example, with MySQL we have full support for JDBC, and the the</p><p>4 0.94521821 <a title="847-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-29-Product%3A_SciDB_-_A_Science-Oriented_DBMS_at_100_Petabytes.html">817 high scalability-2010-04-29-Product: SciDB - A Science-Oriented DBMS at 100 Petabytes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scientists are doing it for themselves. Doing what? Databases. The idea is that most databases are designed to meet the needs of businesses, not science, so scientists are banding together at  scidb.org  to create their own Domain Specific Database, for science. The goal is to be able to handle datasets in the 100PB range and larger.
  

SciDB, Inc. is building an open source database  technology product designed specifically to satisfy the demands of  data-intensive scientific problems.  With the advice of the world's  leading  scientists across a variety of disciplines including astronomy, biology,   physics, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and climatology, our  computer  scientists are currently designing and prototyping this technology


The scientists that are participating in our open source project  believe that the SciDB database — when completed — will dramatically  impact their ability to conduct their experiments faster and more  efficiently  and further improve the qual</p><p>5 0.93656105 <a title="847-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-22-Applying_Scalability_Patterns_to_Infrastructure_Architecture.html">906 high scalability-2010-09-22-Applying Scalability Patterns to Infrastructure Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application delivery tier of the data center.

The “ High Scalability ” blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not disappoint with a post  highlighting a set of scalability design patterns  that was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on “ 6 Ways to Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way. ”

This particular post caught my attention primarily because although I’ve touched on many of these patterns in the past, I’ve never thought to call them

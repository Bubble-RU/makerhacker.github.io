<p>Introduction: Consistent hashing is one of those ideas that really puts the science in
computer science and reminds us why all those really smart people spend years
slaving over algorithms. Consistent hashing is "a scheme that provides hash
table functionality in a way that the addition or removal of one slot does not
significantly change the mapping of keys to slots" and was originally a way of
distributing requests among a changing population of web servers. My first
reaction to the idea was "wow, that's really smart" and I sadly realized I
would never come up with something so elegant. I then immediately saw
applications for it everywhere. And consistent hashing is used everywhere:
distributed hash tables, overlay networks, P2P, IM, caching, and CDNs. Here's
the abstract from the original paper and after the abstract are some links to
a few very good articles with accessible explanations of consistent hashing
and its applications in the real world.breakAbstract:We describe a family of

<p>Introduction: In a great article, Amazon S3 Performance Tips & Tricks, Doug Grismore,
Director of Storage Operations for AWS, has outed the secret arcana normally
reserved for Premium Developer Support customers on how to really use S3:Size
matters. Workloads with less than 50-100 total requests per second don't
require any special effort. Customers that routinely perform thousands of
requests per second need a plan.Automated partitioning. Automated systems
scale S3 horizontally by continuously splitting data into partitions based on
high request rates and the number of keys in a partition (which leads to slow
lookups). Lessons you've learned with sharding may also apply to S3.   Avoid
hot spots. Like most sharding schemes, you want to avoid hot spots by the
smart selection of key names. S3 objects are stored inbuckets.  Each object is
identified using a key. Keys are kept in sorted order. Keys in S3 are
partitioned by prefix. Objects that sort together are stored together, so you
want to select key</p><p>4 0.12974919 <a title="892-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Paper%3A_Replication_Under_Scalable_Hashing.html">19 high scalability-2007-07-16-Paper: Replication Under Scalable Hashing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale is IBMs in memory data grid product (IMDG). It can
be used as a key-value store which partitions the keys (using a form of
consistent hashing) over a set of servers such that each server is responsible
for a subset of the keys. It automatically handles replication which can be
either synchronous of asynchronous and handles advanced placement so that
replicas can be placed in different physical zones when compared to the
placement of the primary. Think buildings, racks, floor, data centers.It is
fully elastic in that servers can be added and removed and it automatically
redistributes the partition primaries and backups. It can be scaled from one
server to hundreds if not thousands of JVMs in a single grid. Each additional
server provides more CPU, memory capacity and network and it scales linearly
with grid growth.It also has a key-graph mode where a graph of objects can be
associated with a single key and it allows fine grained modification of that
graph. Th</p><p>6 0.11436669 <a title="892-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Product%3A_Project_Voldemort_-_A_Distributed_Database.html">651 high scalability-2009-07-02-Product: Project Voldemort - A Distributed Database</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Counting at scale in a distributed environment issurprisingly hard. And it's a
subject we've covered before in various ways:Big Data Counting: How to count a
billion distinct objects using only 1.5KB of Memory,How to update video views
count effectively?,Numbers Everyone Should Know (sharded
counters).Kellabyte(which is an excellent blog) inScalable Eventually
Consistent Counterstalks about how the Cassandra counter implementation scores
well on the scalability and high availability front, but in so doing has "over
and under counting problem in partitioned environments."Which is often fine.
But if you want more accuracy there's a PN-counter, which is aCRDT (convergent
replicated data type)where "all the changes made to a counter on each node
rather than storing and modifying a single value so that you can merge all the
values into the proper final value. Of course the trade-off here is additional
storage and processing but there are ways to optimize this."And there's a

<p>Introduction: Srinath Perera has put together astrong list of architecture patternsbased on
three meta patterns:  distribution, caching, and asynchronous processing. He
contends these three are the primal patterns and the following patterns are
but different combinations:LB (Load Balancers) + Shared nothing Units. Units
that do not share anything with each other fronted with a load balancer that
routes incoming messages to a unit based on some criteria.LB + Stateless Nodes
+ Scalable Storage. Several stateless nodes talking to a scalable storage, and
a load balancer distributes load among the nodes.Peer to Peer Architectures
(Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Content Addressable Networks (CAN)).

talks for:Day 1,Day 2,Day 3(thanksHenry at the Paper Trail blog). Summaries
for each of the accepted papers arehere.One of the more interesting papers
from a NoSQL perspective wasCache Craftiness for Fast Multicore Key-Value
Storage, a wonderfully detailed description of the low level techniques used
to implement Masstree:A storage system specialized for key-value data in which
all data ﬁts in memory, but must persist across server restarts. It supports
arbitrary, variable-length keys. It allows range queries over those keys:
clients can traverse subsets of the database, or the whole database, in sorted
order by key. On a 16-core machine Masstree achieves six to ten million
operations per second on parts A-C of the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark
benchmark, more than 30 as fast as VoltDB [5] or MongoDB [2].If you are

<p>Introduction: Consistent Hashing is a specific implementation of hashing that is well suited
for many of today's web-scale load balancing problems. Specifically, it can be
seen in use in various caching solutions like Memcached and is applicable to
NoSQL solutions as well. Consistent Hashing is used particularly because it
provides a solution for the typical "hashcode mod n" method of distributing
keys across a series of servers. It does this by allowing servers to be added
or removed without significantly upsetting the distribution of keys, nor does
it require that all keys be rehashed to accommodate the change in the number
of servers.ďťżYou can read the full storehere.</p><p>3 0.91107839 <a title="892-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-01-HotPads_on_AWS.html">615 high scalability-2009-06-01-HotPads on AWS</a></p>

Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing.
Specifically the InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group(IPNSIG
).Ansible-likefaster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical
warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning
telegraph system.It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more
interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that
was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances
and with muchlonger delays:The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also
called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a
set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2]
Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances,
so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to
large delays and errors.[2] While the In</p><p>5 0.85315704 <a title="892-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-17-Paper%3A_Consistent_Hashing_and_Random_Trees%3A_Distributed_Caching_Protocols_for_Relieving_Hot_Spots_on_the_World_Wide_Web.html">280 high scalability-2008-03-17-Paper: Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Consistent hashing is one of those ideas that really puts the science in
computer science and reminds us why all those really smart people spend years
slaving over algorithms. Consistent hashing is "a scheme that provides hash
table functionality in a way that the addition or removal of one slot does not
significantly change the mapping of keys to slots" and was originally a way of
distributing requests among a changing population of web servers. My first
reaction to the idea was "wow, that's really smart" and I sadly realized I
would never come up with something so elegant. I then immediately saw
applications for it everywhere. And consistent hashing is used everywhere:
distributed hash tables, overlay networks, P2P, IM, caching, and CDNs. Here's
the abstract from the original paper and after the abstract are some links to
a few very good articles with accessible explanations of consistent hashing
and its applications in the real world.breakAbstract:We describe a family of

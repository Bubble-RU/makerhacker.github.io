<p>Introduction: Slashdot effect: overwhelming unprepared sites with an avalanche of reader's
clicks after being mentioned on Slashdot. Sure, we now have the "Digg effect"
and other hot new stars, but Slashdot was the original. And like many stars
from generations past, Slashdot plays the elder statesman's role with with
class, dignity, and restraint. Yet with millions and millions of users
Slashdot is still box office gold and more than keeps up with the young'ins.
And with age comes the wisdom of learning how to handle all those users. Just
how does Slashdot scale and what can you learn by going old school?breakSite:

<p>Introduction: With Amazonannouncing new High I/O 2TB SSD instancesthe age of SSD has almost
arrived. I say almost because the $27K a year price tag for the hi1.4xlarge on
demand instance type is outside the budget of many. Yet even at the full on
demand rate theprice per IOP for the high IO instance is attractive:27 cents
($27K/100K IOPS) per vs$1.25 for disk.With the obvious benefits of giant SSD
machines combined with 10 Gbps networking, it's interesting to consider: what
architecture decisions might you make differently in the future?More Headroom
for Vertical Scaling Simplifies EverythingThe beauty of higher hardware
performance is it shifts effort away from the programmer which allows
developers to focus on the business of business, minimizing trickeration. This
has always been the allure ofvertical scalingand is well realized by SSDs
through a combination of high throughput, low latencies, and just as
important, high densities.We have a few early examples showing the performance

<p>Introduction: Hello everybody!I am a developer of a website with a lot of traffic. Right now
we are managing the whole website using perl + postgresql + fastcgi +
memcached + mogileFS + lighttpd + roundrobin DNS distributed over 5 servers
and I must say it works like a charm, load is stable and everything works very
fast and we are recording about 8 million pageviews per day.The only problem
is with postgres database since we have it installed only on one server and if
this server goes down, the whole "cluster" goes down. That's why we have a
master2slave replication so we still have a backup database except that when
the master goes down, all inserts/updates are disabled so the whole website is
just read only.But this is not a problem since this configuration is working
for us and we don't have any problems with it.Right now we are planning to
build our own analytics service that would be customized for our needs. We
tried various different software packages but were not satisfied with any of
them.</p><p>5 0.074852832 <a title="917-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-05-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_In_The_Ambient_Cloud.html">1355 high scalability-2012-11-05-Gone Fishin': Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing In The Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers Show 41 episode was to reveal and
ruminate over the horrors of a successfulattack on RSA, which puts the whole
world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there
was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost
datacenter.Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile
back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by
summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal: Look at
Arista and Juniper. JuniperHas a range of stackable switches, which includes
some 10 gig.If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on
their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric
solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric.
Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.
Thinks Juniper would make a good deal in order to get a few reference sites

<p>Introduction: Joel Spolsky and JeffAtwood areraising VC moneyforStackOverflow.This is
interesting for three reasons: 1) Joel has always seemed like a keep it small
and grow organically type of guy, so this is a big step in a different
direction. 2) It means they think there's a very big market in the Q&A; space
and they mean to capture as much as the market as possible. 3) Most
importantly for this blog, Joel gives some good advice on when to stay fresh
and local and when it's time to jump for the brass ring, scale up your
ambition, and go for VC money. Please seeJoel's blogpost for the details, but
here's when to go VC:There's a land grab going on.There is a provable concept
that's repeatable.The business itself could benefit from the publicity.The
investor will add substantial value to the business.The business can
potentially have a big exit or become a large, publically traded company.The

<p>Introduction: Update:Arjenlinks to videoSupporting Scalable Online Statistical
Processingwhich shows"rather than doing complete aggregates, use statistical
sampling to provide a reasonable estimate (unbiased guess) of the result."When
you have a lot of data,samplingallows you to draw conclusions from a much
smaller amount of data. That's why sampling is a scalability solution. If you
don't have to process all your data to get the information you need then
you've made the problem smaller and you'll need fewer resources and you'll get
more timely results.breakSampling is not useful when you need a complete list
that matches a specific criteria. If you need to know the exact set of people
who bought a car in the last week then sampling won't help.But, if you want to
know many people bought a car then you could take a sample and then create
estimate of the full data-set. The difference is you won't really know the
exact car count. You'll have a confidence interval saying how confident you
are in your es</p><p>5 0.78696305 <a title="917-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-07-Five_Ways_to_Stop_Framework_Fixation_from_Crashing_Your_Scaling_Strategy.html">347 high scalability-2008-07-07-Five Ways to Stop Framework Fixation from Crashing Your Scaling Strategy</a></p>

an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

<p>Introduction: This is whatMike Peters says he can do: make your site run 10 times faster.
His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40
IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50
concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively
handling 500 concurrent connections per second with CPU at 8% and no
degradation in performance."Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:Database
write access (read is cheaper)Database read accessPHP, ASP, JSP and any other
server side scriptingClient side JavaScriptMultiple/Fat Images, scripts or css
files from different domains on your pageSlow keep-alive client connections,
clogging your available socketsMike's solutions:breakSwitch all database
writes to offline processingMinimize number of database read access to the
bare minimum. No more than two queries per page.Denormalize your database and

<p>Introduction: Cloud computing promises a number of advantages for the deployment of data-
intensive applications. Most prominently, these include reducing cost with a
pay-as-you-go pricing model and (virtually) unlimited throughput by adding
servers if the workload increases. At theSystems Group, ETH Zurich, we did an
extensiveend-to-end performance studyto compare the major cloud offerings
regarding their ability to fulfill these promises and their implied cost.The
focus of the work is on transaction processing (i.e., read and update work-
loads), rather than analytics workloads. We used theTPC-W, a standardized
benchmark simulating a Web-shop, as the baseline for our comparison. The TPC-W
defines that users are simulated through emulated browsers (EB) and issue page
requests, called web-interactions (WI), against the system. As a major
modification to the benchmark, we constantly increase the load from 1 to 9000
simultaneous users to measure the scalability and cost variance of the system.

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>same-blog 4 0.92774242 <a title="917-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-08-4_Scalability_Themes_from_Surgecon.html">917 high scalability-2010-10-08-4 Scalability Themes from Surgecon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Haas in hisSURGE Recap of theSurgeconference, reflected a bit, and came
up with an interesting checklist of general themes from what he was seeing.
I'm directly quoting his post, so please see the post for a full discussion.
He uses this framework to think about the larger picture and where PostgreSQL
stands in its progression.Make use of the academic literature.Inventing your
own way to do something is fine, but at least consider the possibility that
someone smarter than you has thought about this problem before.Failures are
inevitable, so plan for them.  Try to minimize the possibility of cascading
failures, and plan in advance how you can operate in degraded mode if disaster
(or the Slashdot effect) strikes.Disk technology matters.Drive firmware bugs
are common and nightmarish, and you can expect very limited help from the
manufacturer, especially if the drive is billed as consumer-grade rather than
enterprise-grade. SSDs can save you a lot of money, both because a given

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

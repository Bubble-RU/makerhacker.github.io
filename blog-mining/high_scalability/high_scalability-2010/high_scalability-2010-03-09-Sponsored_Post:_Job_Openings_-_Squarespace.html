<p>Introduction: There was a bit of drama earlier when I posted a free job opening for Zynga.
It caused unfortunate and just plain wrong accusations. It also caused a
number of requests for more free job posts, which I should have anticipated,
but obviously I can't let this blog become cluttered with that kind of stuff.
Earlier I tried a job board type service, but that never really worked out. So
what to do? Someone suggested a sponsored post approach and I think that's a
good compromise. It minimizes the noise, let's people know about work, and
brings in a little revenue. It works like an advertisement. If you are
interested please let me know. When we have any job openings there will be a
sponsored post like this one, that you can easily ignore or pay attention to,
depending on your situation.Squarespace Looking for Full-time Scaling

<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting
HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting
services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary.
Thanks for the thought though.It's been a long long long process. Importing a
largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like
dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the
site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm
betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things.I'll
explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia
that needs to be handled to make the move complete:If you have a user account
and have posted on HighScalability before then you have a user account, but
since I don't know your passwords I had to make new passwords up for you. So

<p>Introduction: I first heard an enthusiastic endorsement ofSquarespacestreaming from the
ubiquitousLeo Laporteon one of his many Twit Live shows. Squarespace as afully
hosted, completely managed environment for creating and maintaining a website,
blog or portfoliowas of interest to me because they promise scalability and
this site doesn't have enough of that. But sadly, since they don't offer a
link preserving Drupal import our relationship was not meant to be.When a fine
reader of High Scalability, Brian Egge, (and all my readers are thrifty,
brave, and strong) asked me how Squarespace scaled I said I didn't know, but I
would try and find out. I emailed Squarespace a few questions and founder
Anthony Casalena and Director of Technical Operations Rolando Berrios were
kind enough to reply in some detail. The questions were both from Brian and
myself. Answers can be found below.Two things struck me most about
Squarespace's approach:They based their system on a memory grid, in this case

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be
thankful for thesongof the tinniestsparrowatsunrise, I'll save you from all
that. It's hard to tie scalability and thegiving of thankstogether, especially
as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of
time. But I think I found a sentiment in A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and
MIRACLES byJames Bridlethat manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving
thanks meaningfully together:I distrust commercial definitions of innovation,
and particularly of awesomeness. It's an overused term. When I think of
awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.So I
started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for
me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.We're not actually very good
about thinking about scale and complexity in real terms, so we have to use
metaphors and examples. Douglas Adams writes somewhere about how big the

<p>Introduction: An unstated assumption is that clouds are scalable. But are they? Stick
thousands upon thousands of machines together and there are a lot of potential
bottlenecks just waiting to choke off your scalability supply. And if the
cloud is scalable what are the chances that your application is really
linearly scalable? At 10 machines all may be well. Even at 50 machines the
seas look calm. But at 100, 200, or 500 machines all hell might break loose.
How do you know?You know through real life testing. These kinds of tests are
brutally hard and complicated. who wants to do all the incredibly precise and
difficult work of producing cloud scalability tests?GridDynamicshas stepped up
to the challenge and has just released theirCloud Performance Reports.The
report is quite detailed so I'll just cover what I found most interesting.
GridDynamics in this report test three configurations:breakGridGainrunning a
Monte-Carlo simulation on EC2. This test is a CPU only test, a data grid is
not accessed.

<p>Introduction: SummaryIn this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing
stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services
application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out
model.BioNati Shalom is the CTO and Founder ofGigaSpacesand responsible for
the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed
technology and architecture namely CORBA, Jini, J2EE, Grid and SOA. Nati is
the Head of the Israeli Grid consortium and an evangelist of Space Based
Architecture and Data Grid patterns. Blog:Gigaspaces BlogRead the rest of the

<p>Introduction: It's trendy today to say "I don't read blogs anymore, I just let the random
chance of my social network guide me to new and interesting content." #fail.
While someone says this I imagine them flicking their hair back in a "I can't
be bothered with true understanding" disdain. And where does random chance get
its content? From people like these. So:support your local blog!If you would
like to be a part of random chance, here are a few new podcasts/blogs/vidcasts
that you may not know about and that I've found interesting:DevOps Cafe. With
thisnew video series where John and Damon visit high performing companies and
record an insider's tour of the tools and processes those companies are using
to solve their DevOps problems, DevOps is a profession that finally seems to

<p>Introduction: There was a bit of drama earlier when I posted a free job opening for Zynga.
It caused unfortunate and just plain wrong accusations. It also caused a
number of requests for more free job posts, which I should have anticipated,
but obviously I can't let this blog become cluttered with that kind of stuff.
Earlier I tried a job board type service, but that never really worked out. So
what to do? Someone suggested a sponsored post approach and I think that's a
good compromise. It minimizes the noise, let's people know about work, and
brings in a little revenue. It works like an advertisement. If you are
interested please let me know. When we have any job openings there will be a
sponsored post like this one, that you can easily ignore or pay attention to,
depending on your situation.Squarespace Looking for Full-time Scaling

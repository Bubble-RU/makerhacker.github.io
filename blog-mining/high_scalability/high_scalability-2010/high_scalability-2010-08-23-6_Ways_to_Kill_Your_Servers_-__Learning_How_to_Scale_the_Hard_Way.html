<p>Introduction: Hey,I do have a website that I would like to scale. Right now we have 10
servers but this does not scale well.I know how to deal with my apache web
servers but have problems with sql servers.I would like to use the "scale out"
system and add servers when we need. We have over 100Gb of data for mysql and
we tried to have around 20G per server. It works well except that if a server
goes down then 1/5 of the user can't access the website. We could use
replication but we would need to at least double sql servers to replicate each
server. And maybe in the future it's not gonna be enough we would need maybe 3
slaves per master ... well I don't really like this idea.I would prefer to
have 8 servers that all deal with data from the 5 servers we have right now
and then we could add new servers when we need. I looked at NFS but that does
not seem to be a good idea for SQL servers ? Can you confirm?</p><p>5 0.14576197 <a title="884-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-07-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Web_asset_server_concept_-_3rd_party_software_available%3F.html">1402 high scalability-2013-02-07-Ask HighScalability: Web asset server concept - 3rd party software available?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>6 0.14272496 <a title="884-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Many_updates_against_MySQL.html">366 high scalability-2008-08-17-Many updates against MySQL</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,I am an owner of an large community website and currently we are having
problems with our database architecture. We are using 2 database servers and
spread tables across them to divide read/writes. We have about 90% reads and
10% writes. We use Memcached on all our webservers to cache as much as we can,
traffic is load balanced between webservers. We have 2 extra servers ready to
put to use!We have looked into a couple of solution so far:Continuent
Uni/Cluster aka Sequoia -> Commercial version way too expensive and Java isn't
as fast as it suppose to be.MySQL Proxy -> We couldn't find any good example
on how to create a master - master with failover scenario.MySQL Clustering ->
Seems to be not mature enough, had a lot of performance issues when we tried
to go online with it.MySQL DRDB HA -> Only good for failover, cannot be
scaled!MySQL Replication -> Well don't get me started ;)So now I turn to you
guys to help me out, I am with my hands in my hair and see the site still

<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture
forPoppen.de, a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be
careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they
manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new,
using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached,
RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.What is Poppen.de?Poppen.de (NSFW) is
the top dating website in Germany, and while it may be a small site compared
to giants like Flickr or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to

<p>Introduction: Hi everybody :)We have a bunch of webservers (about 14 at this time) running
Apache. As application framework we're using PHP with the APC Cache installed
to improve performance. For load balancing we're using a Big F5 system with
dynamic ratio (SNMP driven)To sync new/updated sourcecode we're using
subversion to "automaticly" update these servers with our latest software
relases. After updating the new source to these production servers the load of
the mashines is raising to hell.While updating the servers, they are still in
"production", serving webpages to the users. Otherwise the process of updating
would take ages. Most of the time we're only updating in the morning hours
while less users are online, because of the above issue.My guess is, that the
load is raising that high, because APC needs to recompile a bunch of new files
each time. Before and while compiling the performance simply is "bad".My goal
would be to find a better solution. We want to "sync" code no matter how many

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steffen Konerow, author of theHigh Performance
Blog.Learning how to scale isn't easy without any prior experience. Nowadays
you have plenty of websites likehighscalability.comto get some inspiration,
but unfortunately there is no solution that fits all websites and needs. You
still have to think on your own to find a concept that works for your
requirements. So did I.A few years ago, my bosses came to me and said "We've
got a new project for you. It's the relaunch of a website that has already 1
million users a month. You have to build the website and make sure we'll be
able to grow afterwards". I was already an experienced coder, but not in these
dimensions, so I had to start learning how to scale - the hard way.The
software behind the website was a PHP content management system, based on
Smarty and MySQL. The first task was finding a proper hosting company who had
the experience and would also manage the servers for us. After some research
we found one, told t</p><p>5 0.93539155 <a title="884-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-04-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_4th%2C_2013.html">1527 high scalability-2013-10-04-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 4th, 2013</a></p>

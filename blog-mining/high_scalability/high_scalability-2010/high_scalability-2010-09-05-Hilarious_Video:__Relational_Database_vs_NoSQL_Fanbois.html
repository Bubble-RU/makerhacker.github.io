<p>Introduction: This is so funny I laughed until I cried! Definitely NSFW. OMG it's hilarious, but it's also not a bad overview of the issues. Especially loved:  You read the latest post on HighScalability.com and think you are a f*cking Google and architect and parrot slogans like Web Scale and Sharding but you have no idea what the f*ck you are talking about . There are so many more gems like that.

<p>Introduction: I try to keep this blog targeted and on topic. So even though I may be thankful for the  song  of the tinniest  sparrow  at  sunrise , I'll save you from all that. It's hard to tie scalability and the  giving of thanks  together, especially as it sometimes occurs to me that this blog may be a self-indulgent waste of time. But I think I found a sentiment in  A New THEORY of AWESOMENESS and MIRACLES  by  James Bridle  that manages to marry the topic of this blog and giving thanks meaningfully together:
  

I distrust commercial definitions of innovation, and particularly of awesomeness. It’s an overused term. When I think of awesomeness, I want something awe-inspiring, vast and mind-expanding.


  So I started thinking about things that I think are awesome, or miraculous, and for me, it kept coming back to scale and complexity.

<p>Introduction: Abstractâ&euro;&rdquo; This paper presents the architecture and characteristics of a memory database intended to be used as a cache engine for web applications. Primary goals of this database are speed and efficiency while running on SMP systems with several CPU cores (four and more). A secondary goal is the support for simple metadata structures associated with cached data that can aid in efficient use of the cache. Due to these goals, some data structures and algorithms normally associated with this field of computing needed to be adapted to the new environment.</p><p>6 0.39913446 <a title="895-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-13-Strategy%3A_Saving_Your_Butt_With_Deferred_Deletes.html">809 high scalability-2010-04-13-Strategy: Saving Your Butt With Deferred Deletes</a></p>

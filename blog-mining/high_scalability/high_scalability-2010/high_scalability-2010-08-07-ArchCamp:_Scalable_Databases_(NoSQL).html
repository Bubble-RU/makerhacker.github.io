The ArchCamp unconference was held this past Friday at HackerDojo in Mountain View, CA.  There was plenty of pizza, beer, and great conversation.  This session started out free-form, but shaped up pretty quickly into a discussion of the popular open source scalable NoSQL databases and the architectural categories in which they belong.</p><p>2 0.1041432 <a title="874-tfidf-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-Event%3A_CloudCamp_Silicon_Valley_Unconference_on_30th_September.html">388 high scalability-2008-09-23-Event: CloudCamp Silicon Valley Unconference on 30th September</a></p>
<p>Introduction: CloudCamp   is an interesting unconference where early adapters of Cloud Computing technologies exchange ideas. With the rapid change occurring in the industry, we need a place we can meet to share our experiences, challenges and solutions. At CloudCamp, you are encouraged you to share your thoughts in several open discussions, as we strive for the advancement of Cloud Computing. End users, IT professionals and vendors are all encouraged to participate.      CloudCamp Silicon Valley 08   is scheduled for Tuesday, September 30, 2008 from 06:00 PM - 10:00 PM in Sun Microsystems' EBC Briefing Center   15 Network Circle   Menlo Park, CA 94025     CloudCamp follows an interactive, unscripted unconference format. You can propose your own session or you can attend a session proposed by someone else. Either way, you are encouraged to engage in the discussion and “Vote with your feet”, which means … “find another session if you don’t find the session helpful”.

<p>Introduction: I along with 180 other people and veritable who's who of NoSQL vendors, attended the  A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto  NoSQL Meetup on Tuesday. The format was a panel of 10 vendors--10gen, Basho, CouchOne, Cloudant, Cloudera, GoGrid, InfiniteGraph, Membase, Riptano, Scality--sitting in two rows of chairs in front of what seemed like a pretty diverse audience. Tim Anglade (founder, A NOSQL Summer) moderated. Tim kept things moving by asking a few leading questions and the panel chimed in with answers. Quite a few questions came from the audience, which was refreshing. 
 
Overall a genial evening with some good discussion. I was pleased that the panel members didn't just automatically slip into marketing speak. Most of the discussions were on point rather than just another excuse to hit the talking points. There were some complaints about the talk not being technical enough, but I don't think that was really the purpose of this kind of talk. The panel format is excellent at giving a wide ra</p><p>4 0.08564958 <a title="874-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-09-10_NoSQL_Systems_Reviewed.html">739 high scalability-2009-11-09-10 NoSQL Systems Reviewed</a></p>

A very thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of approaches to not being a relational database.

<p>Introduction: NoSQL is a trend that is gaining steam primarily in the world of Open Source. There are numerous NoSQL solutions available for all levels of complexity: from queryable distributed solutions like MongoDB to simpler distributed key-value storage solutions like Cassandra. Then there’s Riak, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort, CouchDB, and Redis. However, very few of these packaged NoSQL products are available for the other end of the platform market: Microsoft Windows. I’m going to outline what’s available now and briefly touch on some opportunities that are still available to the daring Microsoft engineer.

<p>Introduction: Hello all,     Reading the site you can note that "1 Master for writes, N Slaves for reads" scheme is used offen.     How is this implemented? Who decides where writes and reads go? Something in application level or specific database proxies, like Slony-I?     Thanks.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.94566786 <a title="874-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-07-ArchCamp%3A_Scalable_Databases_%28NoSQL%29.html">874 high scalability-2010-08-07-ArchCamp: Scalable Databases (NoSQL)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: ArchCamp: Scalable Databasess (NoSQL) 
 
The ArchCamp unconference was held this past Friday at HackerDojo in Mountain View, CA.  There was plenty of pizza, beer, and great conversation.  This session started out free-form, but shaped up pretty quickly into a discussion of the popular open source scalable NoSQL databases and the architectural categories in which they belong.</p><p>3 0.85899383 <a title="874-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-06-Paper%3A_High-Performance_Concurrency_Control_Mechanisms_for_Main-Memory_Databases.html">1299 high scalability-2012-08-06-Paper: High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for Main-Memory Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you stayed up all night watching the life reaffirming  Curiosity landing on Mars , then this paper,  High-Performance Concurrency Control Mechanisms for Main-Memory Databases , has nothing to do with that at all, but it is an excellent look at how to use optimistic MVCC schemes to reduce lock overhead on in-memory datastructures:
  A database system optimized for in-memory storage can support  much higher transaction rates than current systems.  However,  standard concurrency control methods used today do not scale to  the high transaction rates achievable by such systems. In this paper we introduce two efficient concurrency control methods specifically designed for main-memory databases. Both use multiversioning to isolate read-only transactions from updates but differ in  how atomicity is ensured: one is optimistic and one is pessimistic. To avoid expensive context switching, transactions  never block  during normal processing but they may have to wait before commit to ensure corr</p><p>4 0.85699177 <a title="874-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-22-It%27s_the_Fraking_IOPS_-_1_SSD_is_44%2C000_IOPS%2C_Hard_Drive_is_180.html">1066 high scalability-2011-06-22-It's the Fraking IOPS - 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS, Hard Drive is 180</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future? Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's  Artur Bergman  wants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the math already.
 
Here's Artur's logic:
  
 Wikia is all SSD in production. The new Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential, 6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past, you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs. 
 SSDs are cheaper than drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives. 
 With 8 million files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based). 
 4 GB/sec random read average latency 1 msec. 
 2.2 GB/sec random write average latency 1 msec. 
 50TBs of SSDs in one machine for $80,000.

<p>Introduction: This is a question everyone must struggle with when building out their datacenter. Storage choices are always the ones I have the least confidence in.  David Marks in his blog  You Can Change It Later!  asks the question   Should I get a SAN to scale my site architecture?   and answers no. A better solution is to use commodity hardware, directly attach storage on servers, and partition across servers to scale and for greater availability.  David's reasoning is interesting:
  A SAN creates a SPOF (single point of failure) that is dependent on a vendor to fly and fix when there's a problem. This can lead to long down times during this outage you have no access to your data at all.   Using easily available commodity hardware minimizes risks to your company, it's not just about saving money. Zooming over to Fry's to buy emergency equipment provides the kind of agility startups need in order to respond quickly to ever changing situations.  It's hard to beat the power and flexibility (backup</p><p>6 0.83750302 <a title="874-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-02-a8cjdbc_-_update_verision_1.3.html">171 high scalability-2007-12-02-a8cjdbc - update verision 1.3</a></p>

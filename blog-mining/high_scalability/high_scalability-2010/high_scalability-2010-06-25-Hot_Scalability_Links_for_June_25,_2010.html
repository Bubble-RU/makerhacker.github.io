<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Doug Judd , original creator of Hypertable and the CEO of Hypertable, Inc. 
 
 Hypertable delivers 2X better throughput in most tests -- HBase fails 41 and 167 billion record insert tests, overwhelmed by garbage collection -- Both systems deliver similar results for random read uniform test 
 
We recently conducted a test comparing the performance of Hypertable ( @hypertable ) version 0.9.5.5 to that of HBase ( @HBase ) version 0.90.4 (CDH3u2) running Zookeeper 3.3.4.  In this post, we summarize the results and offer explanations for the discrepancies. For the full test report, see  Hypertable vs. HBase II .
  Introduction  
Hypertable and HBase are both open source, scalable databases modeled after Google's proprietary Bigtable database.  The primary difference between the two systems is that Hypertable is written in C++, while HBase is written in Java.  We modeled this test after the one described in section 7 of the  Bigtable paper  and tuned both systems fo</p><p>3 0.15946272 <a title="848-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-05-Hot_Scalability_Links_For_November_5th%2C_2010.html">935 high scalability-2010-11-05-Hot Scalability Links For November 5th, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: So much good stuff this week...
  
 Adrian Cockcroft  Compares NoSQL Availability Models .  Let's risk feeding the CAP trolls, and try to get some insight into the differences between the many NoSQL contenders . Adrian asks how each NoSQL product will add a movie to its favorites list, read it back, and how this works across availability zones. Much trickier than it sounds with multiple writers. Cassandra and MongoDB answer back. 
 Stuff the Internet Says:              
 
  @jerng : Reading up on scalability. WHY THE HELL FOR? Because I want to know the future. 
  @freerangedata : The #nosql options are the micro brews/craft beers of data stores. So many good ones, so little time to try them all. 
  @edward_ribeiro : Soon, Darwinism will start to play its role on #NoSQL systems. You know, only the fittest will survive.

<p>Introduction: Update 3 : Presentation from the  NoSQL conference :  slides ,  video 1 ,  video 2 .
 
 Update 2 : The folks at Hypertable would like you to know that  Hypertable is now officially  sponsored by Baidu , China’s Leading Search Engine.  As a sponsor of Hypertable, Baidu has committed an industrious team of engineers, numerous servers, and support resources to improve the quality and development of the open source technology. 
 
 Update : InfoQ interview on  Hypertable Lead Discusses Hadoop and Distributed Databases . Hypertable differs from HBase in that it is a higher performance implementation of Bigtable.
 
 Skrentablog  gives the heads up on  Hypertable ,  Zvents'  open-source BigTable clone. It's written in C++ and can run on top of either HDFS or KFS. Performance looks encouraging at  28M rows of data inserted at a per-node write rate of 7mb/sec .</p><p>5 0.135216 <a title="848-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-14-Big_List_of_Scalabilty_Conferences.html">1115 high scalability-2011-09-14-Big List of Scalabilty Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Which of the many conferences should you attend? I get this question a lot, so I compiled a list. The list isn't life, it's not a top 10, and it won't say if a conference is naughty or nice, but they are conferences I know about, have attended, or referenced in an article. By no means is this list exhaustive. If you know of a conference people should consider attending, please add them in the comments. If you have an opinion about a particular conference, please comment on that too.
 
Some have a low opinion of conferences. I'm not one of them. Sure, some conferences can be a waste of time, and those should fade away. And sure, we see a lot more conference-as-monetization strategy these days. But it's conferences that help motivate people to do their best work. Would we see even half the slide decks, papers, or talks describing how people do what they do without conferences as motivation? No we would not.

  @kevinweil : Twitter monthly signups have increased more than 50% since December, and we're now doing well over 150 million Tweets per day. 
  @ChrisShain : Prediction: Black art of query optimization will become black art of #nosql data modeling, for same reasons. Minimize IOs, query time.

 Now we really know why vampires feed on blood...they are elastically acquiring more compute power.  Your Next Computer May Be Made of...Blood!  It's those  memristors  again. Ancient vamps are really just giant super computers. 
  Twitter now at 155 million tweets a day , up from 55 million a year ago. 
   10,000-core Linux supercomputer built in Amazon cloud  By Jon Brodkin. T he 10,000 cores were composed of 1,250 instances with eight cores each, as well as 8.75TB of RAM and 2PB disk space. The cluster ran for eight hours at a cost of $8,500 .

<p>Introduction: And by hot I also mean temperature. Summer has arrived. It's sizzling here in Silicon Valley. Thank you air conditioning!
  
 Scale the web by appointing a Crawler Czar? Tom Foremski has the idea that  Google should open up their index  so sites wouldn't have to endure the constant pounding by ravenous crawler bots. Don MacAskill of SmugMug estimates  50% of our web server CPU resources  are spent serving crawlers. What a waste. How this would all work with real-time feeds, paid  feeds (Twitter, movies, ...), etc. is unknown, but does it make sense for all that money to be spent on extracting the same data over and over again?

<p>Introduction: If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will. --  Steve Jobs   
 
       
 
 
America as the New World has a long history of inspiring  Utopian communities . Early experiments were famously religious. But there have been many others as new waves of thought have inspired people to organize and try something different.
 
In the 1840s Transcendentalists, believing the true path lay in the perfection of the individual, created intentional communities like  Brook Farm . We've also seen  socialist ,  anarchist ,  hippy , and virtually every other kind of Utopia in-between. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote an infamous book,  Walden Two , with a more "scientific" take on creating a Utopian community and Ayn Rand in  Atlas Shrugged  had her free market version.
 
I believe in startup organizations we see the modern version of Utopian energy in action. We now call it by names like "culture hacking", but the goal is the same: to create a new form of human community to achieve a profound go</p><p>3 0.93076485 <a title="848-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Product%3A_3_PAR_REMOTE_COPY.html">27 high scalability-2007-07-25-Product: 3 PAR REMOTE COPY</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 3PAR Remote Copy  is a uniquely simple and efficient replication technology that allows customers to protect and share any application data affordably. Built upon 3PAR Thin Copy technology, Remote Copy lowers the total cost of storage by addressing the cost and complexity of remote replication.  Common Uses of 3PAR Remote Copy:  Affordable Disaster Recovery: Mirror data cost-effectively across town or across the world.  Centralized Archive: Replicate data from multiple 3PAR InServs located in multiple data centers to a centralized data archive location.  Resilient Pod Architecture: Mutually replicate tier 1 or 2 data to tier 3 capacity between two InServs (application pods).  Remote Data Access: Replicate data to a remote location for sharing of data with remote users.</p><p>4 0.92266566 <a title="848-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-07-It%27s_a_VM_Wasteland_-_A_Near_Optimal_Packing_of_VMs_to_Machines_Reduces_TCO_by_22%25.html">1419 high scalability-2013-03-07-It's a VM Wasteland - A Near Optimal Packing of VMs to Machines Reduces TCO by 22%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation  we learn some shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):
  
  Average server utilization in many data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.  
 Surely that's just for old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade. 
  
It's a VM wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same server.
 
It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithm</p><p>5 0.9066959 <a title="848-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-02-Total_Cost_of_Ownership_for_different_web_development_frameworks.html">338 high scalability-2008-06-02-Total Cost of Ownership for different web development frameworks</a></p>

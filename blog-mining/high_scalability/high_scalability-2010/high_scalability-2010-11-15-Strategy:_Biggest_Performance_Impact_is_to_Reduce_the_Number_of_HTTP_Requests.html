<p>Introduction: Update 8 :  The Cost of Latency  by James Hamilton. James summarizing some latency info from      Steve Souder ,   Greg Linden , and   Marissa Mayer .      Speed [is] an undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web. 
 
 Update 7:   How do you know when you need more memcache servers? . Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use stats to know when more servers are needed.  Update 6:   Stock Traders Find Speed Pays, in Milliseconds . Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a  500 millisecond  trading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside, Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.

Some of what Google does to reduce HTTP requests:
  
  Data URIs , which are are base64 encodings of image data, are used instead of static images that are served from the server. This means the whole preview can be pieced together from image slices in one request as both the data and the image are returned in the same request.

<p>Introduction: This is what  Mike Peters says he can do : make your site run 10 times faster. His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40 IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50 concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively handling 500 concurrent connections per second with CPU at 8% and no degradation in performance."  Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:
   Database write access (read is cheaper)    Database read access    PHP, ASP, JSP and any other server side scripting    Client side JavaScript    Multiple/Fat Images, scripts or css files from different domains on your page    Slow keep-alive client connections, clogging your available sockets   Mike's solutions:      Switch all database writes to offline processing    Minimize number of database read access to the bare minimum.

Yottaa  reports an amazing 13 advertiser websites crashed  during the Super Bowl. Coke was interactively au currant, asking viewers to vote for the ending of a commercial, but load times went to 62 seconds. SodaStream, Calvin Klein, Axe, Got Milk? The Walking Dead, many movie sites, and many car sites, all were flagged with delay of fame penalties.
 
Lots of time, money, and creative energy is spent lovingly perfecting every detail of these commercials. It won't be a surprise to any programmer that this can't usually be said of the follow through on the backend.

<p>Introduction: Likewise the current belief that, in the case of artificial machines the very large and the very small are equally feasible and lasting is a manifest error. Thus, for example, a small obelisk or column or other solid figure can certainly be laid down or set up without danger of breaking, while the large ones will go to pieces under the slightest provocation, and that purely on account of their own weight. -- Galileo  
Galileo observed how things broke if they were naively scaled up. Interestingly, Google noticed a similar pattern when building larger software systems using the same techniques used to build smaller systems. 
 
 Luiz André Barroso , Distinguished Engineer at Google, talks about this fundamental property of scaling systems in his fascinating talk,  Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering the Teenage Decade . Google found the larger the scale the greater the impact of latency variability. When a request is implemented by work done in parallel, as is common with today's service</p><p>4 0.70277029 <a title="942-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-04-How_Can_Batching_Requests_Actually_Reduce_Latency%3F.html">1558 high scalability-2013-12-04-How Can Batching Requests Actually Reduce Latency?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg gave a talk on  Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion–Pitfalls and Lessons  and  one of the issues  they had was that they:
  

Did not account for increased latency after moving to EC2. In the datacenter they had submillisecond access between machines so it was possible to make a 1000 calls to memache for one page load. Not so on EC2. Memcache access times increased 10x to a millisecond which made their old approach unusable. Fix was to batch calls to memcache so a large number of gets are in one request.

  
Dave Pacheco had an  interesting question  about batching requests and its impact on latency:
  

 I was confused about the memcached problem after moving to the cloud.  I understand why network latency may have gone from submillisecond to milliseconds, but how could you improve latency by batching requests? Shouldn't that improve efficiency, not latency, at the possible expense of latency (since some requests will wait on the client as they get batched)?</p><p>5 0.69757903 <a title="942-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-06-Super_Bowl_Advertisers_Ready_for_the_Traffic%3F_Nope..It%27s_Lights_Out..html">1401 high scalability-2013-02-06-Super Bowl Advertisers Ready for the Traffic?

<p>Introduction: Low Cost, High Performance, Strong Security: Pick Any Three  by Chris Palmer has a funny and informative presentation where the main message is:  reduce the size and frequency of network communications, which will make your pages load faster, which will improve performance enough that you can use HTTPS all the time, which will make you safe and secure on-line, which is a good thing .
  The benefits of HTTPS for security are overwhelming, but people are afraid of the performance hit. The argument is successfully made that the overhead of HTTPS is low enough that you can afford the cost if you do some basic optimization. Reducing the number of HTTP requests is a good source of low hanging fruit.
   From the Yahoo UI Blog :
  
 Reducing the number of HTTP requests has the biggest impact on reducing response time and is often the easiest performance improvement to make.

    From the Experience of Gmail :

<p>Introduction: The Gear6 Web Cache hybrid DRAM-flash memory architecture allows for 5-10 times more memcache memory per unit of rack space than DRAM-only configurations, and cuts memory costs by 50%. Other software enhancements include a slab allocator that is more efficient than traditional memcache implementations due to its fine-grained bucket sizing. Gear6 Web Cache also supports object sizes greater than 1 megabyte and manages evictions based on the cost of replacing objects, depending on the size and frequency of object access. It intelligently places cache instances across DRAM and flash, taking into account their different characteristics, while at the same time monitoring their health and detecting and deâ&euro;?allocating faulty or failing memory.  Gear6 Web Cache is a Memcached protocol compliant solution that scales and accelerates web applications, reduces memory footprint, enhances availability and implements comprehensive Memcached management features. Designed to work with all popular memcac</p><p>3 0.90707219 <a title="942-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-20-Paper%3A_Flux%3A_An_Adaptive_Partitioning_Operator_for_Continuous_Query_Systems.html">604 high scalability-2009-05-20-Paper: Flux: An Adaptive Partitioning Operator for Continuous Query Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable, which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.  Abstract:
   The long-running nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across multiple queries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their constituent, stateful operators â&euro;&ldquo; e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators. To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static techniques for partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue to function robustly in the face of these imbalances. To address this challenge, we introduce</p><p>4 0.90365332 <a title="942-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-15-Vedis_-_An_Embedded_Implementation_of_Redis_Supporting_Terabyte_Sized_Databases.html">1580 high scalability-2014-01-15-Vedis - An Embedded Implementation of Redis Supporting Terabyte Sized Databases</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don't know about you, but when I first learned about Redis my initial thought was wow, why hasn't anyone done this before? My next thought was why put this functionality in a separate process? Why not just embed it in your own server code and skip the network path completely? Especially in a Service Oriented Architecture there's no need for an extra hop or extra software installation and configuration.
 
Now you can embed Redis-like code directly into your server with  Vedis  - an  embeddable datastore  C library built with over 70 commands similar in concept to Redis but without the networking layer since Vedis run in the same process of the host application. It's transactional, cross platform, thread safe, key-value, supports terabyte sized databases, has a GPL-like license (which isn't great for commercial apps), and supports an on-disk as well as in-memory datastore.

Unlike most other datastores (i.e. memcache, Redis), Vedis does not have a separate server</p><p>5 0.8843832 <a title="942-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy%3A_Stop_Using_Linked-Lists.html">1462 high scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy: Stop Using Linked-Lists</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What data structure is more sacred than the link list? If we get rid of it what silly interview questions would we use instead? But not using linked-lists is exactly what Aater Suleman recommends in  Should you ever use Linked-Lists?  
 
In  The Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connections  one of the important strategies is not scribbling data all over memory via pointers because following pointers increases cache misses which  reduces performance . And there’s nothing more iconic of pointers than the link list.
 
Here are Aeter's reasons to be anti-linked-list:
  
 They reduce the benefit of out-of-order execution.  
 They throw off hardware prefetching.  
 They reduce DRAM and TLB locality.  
 They cannot leverage SIMD.  
 They are harder to send to GPUs.  
  
He also demolishes the pros of linked-lists, finding arrays a better option in almost every case. Good discussion in the comment section as not everyone agrees.

<p>Introduction: Update:Social networks in the database: using a graph database. A nice post on
representing, traversing, and performing other common social network
operations using a graph database.If you areDiggorLinkedInyou can build your
own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network
relationships. For those of more modest meansNeo4j, a graph database, is a
good alternative.A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges
(relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs)
on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to
represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships
are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and
relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look
at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for
relationships."A graph looks something like:For more lovely examples take a
look at theGraph Image Gallery.Here's agood summaryby</p><p>3 0.15068585 <a title="806-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>4 0.13243799 <a title="806-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-14-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_May_14%2C_2010.html">827 high scalability-2010-05-14-Hot Scalability Links for May 14, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lots of good ones this week...Scalability, Availability & Stability Patterns.
Jonas Boner has 197 slides covering a very wide range of scalability topics.
One stop scalability shopping.Horizontal Scalability via Transient, Shardable,
and Share-Nothing Resources. Heroku's Adam Wiggins shares what they've learned
about scaling based on their experiences building a cloud platform and the
hundreds of apps running on it. He describes the next generation architecture
he thinks all software should follow in the future.Scalability of the Hadoop
Distributed File System. Konstantin V. Shvachko writes a great post analyzing
if thelimitations imposed on a distributed file system by the single-node
namespace server architecturecan support 100,000 clients and petabytes of
files.Cassandra by Example. Eric Evans created a nice Cassandra tutorial using
building a Twitter clone as an example. Many people want to see more data
modeling examples. Here you are.UpSizeR: Synthetically Scaling Up a Given

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-
grid.It's 2003: Add a caching layer.It's 2004: Add scale-out and
partitioning.It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a
distributed file system.It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.It's 2008: Cloud

<p>Introduction: In update toPrismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning on Social Networks
to Figure Out What You Should Read on the Web, Jason Wolfe, even in the face
of deadening fatigue from long nights spent getting their iPhone app out, has
gallantly agreed to talk a little more about Primatic's approach to Machine
Learning.Documents and users are two areas where Prismatic applies ML (machine
learning):ML on DocumentsGiven an HTML document: learn how to extract the main
text of the page (rather than the sidebar, footer, comments, etc), its title,
author, best images, etcdetermine features for relevance (e.g., what the
article is about, topics, etc.)The setup for most of these tasks is pretty
typical. Models are trained using big batch jobs on other machines that read
data from s3, save the learned parameter files to s3, and then read (and
periodically refresh) the models from s3 in the ingest pipeline.All of the
data that flows out of the system can be fed back into this pipeline, which

<p>Introduction: (Please bare with me, I'm a new, passionate, confident and terrified
programmer :D )Background:I'm pre-launch and 1 year into the development of my
application. My target is to be able to eventually handle millions of
registered users with 5-10% of them concurrent. Up to this point I've used
auto-increment to assign unique identifiers to rows. I am now considering
switching to a non-sequential strategy. Oh, I'm using the LAMP
configuration.My reasons for avoiding auto-increment:1. Complicates
replication when scaling horizontally. Risk of collision is significant (when
running multiple masters). Note: I've read the other entries in this forum
that relate to ID generation and there have been some great suggestions --
including a strategy that uses auto-increment in a way that avoids this
pitfall... That said, I'm still nervous about it.2. Potential bottleneck when
retrieving/assigning IDs -- IDs assigned at the database.My reasons for being
nervous about non-sequential IDs:1. To guarant</p><p>same-blog 3 0.89304274 <a title="806-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-08-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_April_8%2C_2010.html">806 high scalability-2010-04-08-Hot Scalability Links for April 8, 2010</a></p>

doubleclick. Amazing. A constant ~390,000 impressions a second are being
served and 25 trillion since 1996. Thanks to Mike Rhoads for title

McKendrick.The next challenge on enterprise agendas: application complexity.
This is something that lots of hardware -- whether from the cloud or internal
data center -- cannot fixLeo Laporte and Steve Gibson talked about how the
iPad was a denial of service attack on UPS delivery schedules. UPS trucks were
filled with iPads.Cassandra: Fact vs fiction. Jonathan Ellies puts the
beatdown on Cassandra misinformation. Don't you dare say Cassandra can't work
across datacenters!JIT'd code calling conventions. Cliff Click Jr shows how
Java's calling convention canmatch compiled C code in speed, but allows for
the flexibility of calling (code,slow) non-JIT'd code. Some assembly code

<p>Introduction: Disqus - Scaling the Worlds Largest Django App. Interesting overview of a
commenting system with 75 million comments and 250 million visitors. Lots of
good details on how they partition their database, testing, continuous
integration, feature switches, caching, delayed signals, and more.Things I
learnt tracking a billion events in 24 hours: Know your host, Scaling isn't
just servers, My servers need to talk to me more, Kill switches for users,
What you don't know is the problem, Don't mix server roles, Know your most
important users outside of your site.Tweets of Gold:georgebarnett: I read High
Scalability for useful articles about large scaling. Sadly though, nothing
useful ever shows up. #NoLongerBotheringnorthscale: wow that is fast! :) RT

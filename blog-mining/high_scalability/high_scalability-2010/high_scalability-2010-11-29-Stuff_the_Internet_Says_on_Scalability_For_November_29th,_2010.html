<p>Introduction: With theGoogle IO Developer Conferencecompleted there aredozens and dozensof
information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty
free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos
available so quickly after the conference. Let's say you don't want to watch
all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen
scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:App
Engine Backends by Justin Haugh, Greg Darke. One of this biggest complaints
about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new
Backend node.Scaling App Engine Applicationsby Justin Haugh, Guido van Rossum.
Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make
it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000
queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good
discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides when to spawn
instances;</p><p>4 0.77562982 <a title="949-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_22%2C_2011.html">1084 high scalability-2011-07-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 22, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Between love and madness lies HighScalability:Google now 10x better: MapReduce
sorts 1 petabyte of data using 8000 computers in 33 minutes; 1 Billion on
Social Networks;Tumblr at 10 Billion Posts;Twitter at 100 Million
Users;Testing at Google Scale: 1800 builds, 120 million test suites, 60
million tests run daily.From theDash Memoon Google's Plan:Go is a very
promising systems-programming language in the vein of C++. We fully hope and
expect that Go becomes the standard back-end language at Google over the next
few years.On GAE Go can load from a cold start in 100ms and the typical
instance size is 4MB. Is it any wonder Go is a go? Should we expect to see
Java and Python deprecated because Go is so much cheaper to run at
scale?Potent Quotables:@caciufo: 30x more scalability w/ many-core. So perf
doesn't have to level out or vex programmers. #IDF2011@joerglew: Evaluating

<p>Introduction: Data mining and fast queries are always in that bin of hard to do things where
doing something smarter can yield big results. Bloom Filters are one such do
it smarter strategy, compressed bitmap indexes are another. In one application
"FastBit outruns other search indexes by a factor of 10 to 100 and doesn't
require much more room than the original data size." The data size is an
interesting metric. Our old standard b-trees can be two to four times larger
than the original data. In a test searching an Enron email database FastBit
outran MySQL by 10 to 1,000 times.FastBit is a software tool for searching
large read-only datasets. It organizes user data in a column-oriented
structure which is efficient for on-line analytical processing (OLAP), and
utilizes compressed bitmap indices to further speed up query processing.
Analyses have proven the compressed bitmap index used in FastBit to be
theoretically optimal for one-dimensional queries. Compared with other optimal
indexing methods, bit</p><p>3 0.89940614 <a title="949-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-20-How_Twitter_Improved_JVM_Performance_by_Reducing_GC_and_Faster_Memory_Allocation.html">1551 high scalability-2013-11-20-How Twitter Improved JVM Performance by Reducing GC and Faster Memory Allocation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nettyis a high-performance NIO(New IO) client server framework for Java that
Twitter uses internally as a protocol agonostic RPC system. Twitterfound some
problemswith Netty 3's memory management for buffer allocations beacause it
generated a lot of garbage during operation. When you send as many messages as
Twitter it creates a lot of GC pressure and the simple act of zero filling
newly allocated buffers consumed 50% of memory bandwidth. Netty 4 fixes this
situation with:Short-lived event objects, methods on long-lived channel
objects are used to handle I/O events.Secialized buffer allocator that uses
pool which implementsbuddy memory allocationandslab allocation.The result:5
times less frequent GC pauses: 45.5 vs. 9.2 times/min5 times less garbage

the size of the buffer increases. Some problems with smaller buffers.Given how

<p>Introduction: In How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack Salvatore
'antirez' Sanfilippo shows how to solve some common problems in Redis by
taking advantage of its unique data structure handling capabilities. Common
Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks
programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional
stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these
tasks in your framework?Show latest items listings in your home page. This is
a live in-memory cache and is very fast.LPUSHis used to insert a content ID at

short-term high CPU quota; quotas in general; Admin? What's that?Update 3:

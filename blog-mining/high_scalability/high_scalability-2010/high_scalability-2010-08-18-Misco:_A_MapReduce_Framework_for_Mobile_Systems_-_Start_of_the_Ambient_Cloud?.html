<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.If datacenters are the
new castles, then what will be the new gunpowder? As soon asgunpowdercame on
the scene, castles, which are defensive structures, quickly became the
future's cold, drafty hotels. Gunpowder fueled cannon balls make short work of
castle walls.There's a long history of "gunpowder" type inventions in the tech
industry. PCs took out the timeshare model. The cloud is taking out the PC
model. There must be something that will take out the cloud.Right now it's
hard to believe the cloud will one day be no more. They seem so much the
future, but something will transcend the cloud. We even have a law that says
so:Bell's Law of Computer Classeswhich holds thatroughly every decade a new,
lower priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform,
network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new
industry.Acomputer</p><p>5 0.18340461 <a title="882-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-15-The_Amazing_Collective_Compute_Power_of_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">778 high scalability-2010-02-15-The Amazing Collective Compute Power of the Ambient Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.Earlier we talked about
how a single botnet could harness more compute power than our largest super
computers. Well, that's just the start of it. The amount of computer power
available to the Ambient Cloud will be truly astounding.2 Billion Personal
ComputersThe number of personal computers is still growing. By 2014 one
estimate is there will be2 billion PCs. That's a giant reservoir of power to
exploit, especially considering these new boxes are stuffed with multiple
powerful processors and gigabytes of memory.7 Billion SmartphonesBy now it's
common wisdom smartphones are the computing platform of the future. It's
plausible to assume the total number ofmobile phonesin use will roughly equal
the number of people on earth. That's 7 billion smartphones.Smartphones aren't
just tiny little wannabe computers anymore either. They are real computers and

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation Propagation Networks: A
Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation, offers to help us break
free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of
autonomous but interconnected machines.  We can do this byorganizing
computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of
which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the
network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the
structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.The abstract from
his thesis is:In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of
computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The
traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large
memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with
computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected
with stateful storage cells. In so</p><p>4 0.71813941 <a title="882-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-02-Using_the_Ambient_Cloud_as_an_Application_Runtime.html">786 high scalability-2010-03-02-Using the Ambient Cloud as an Application Runtime</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade

big, complex, and adaptive:Many clouds.Many servers.Many operating

interconnects.Many CDNs.Many cache memory pools.Many application profiles
(simple request-response, live streaming, computationally complex, sensor
driven, memory intensive, storage intensive, monolithic, decomposable,
etc).Many legal jurisdictions. Don't want to perform a function on Patriot Act
"protected" systems then move the function elsewhere.Many SLAs.Many data

<p>Introduction: A non-random sample of my tech friends shows that not many have heard
ofmemristors(though I do suspect vote tampering). I'd read a little about
memristors in2008when the initial hubbub about the existence of memristors was
raised. I, however,  immediately filed them into that comforting conceptual
bucket of potentially revolutionary technologies I didn't have to worry about
because like most wondertech, nothing would ever come of it. Wrong. After
watchingFinding the Missing Memristorby R. Stanley Williams I've had to change
my mind. Memristors have gone from "maybe never" to holy cow this could happen
soon and it could change everything.Let's assume for the sake of dreaming
memristors do prove out. How will we design systems when we have access to a
new material that is two orders of magnitude more efficient from a power
perspective than traditional transistor technologies, contains multiple
petabits (1 petabit = 128TB) of persistent storage, and can be reconfigured to
be either memory</p><p>6 0.7001375 <a title="882-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-02-Piccolo_-_Building_Distributed_Programs_that_are_11x_Faster_than_Hadoop.html">983 high scalability-2011-02-02-Piccolo - Building Distributed Programs that are 11x Faster than Hadoop</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Tech Crunch chomped down on some initial scaling problems with Yahoo's new
live video streaming serviceYahoo Live. After a bit of chewing on Yahoo's old
bones, TC spat out:If Yahoo cant scale something like this (no matter how much
they claim it’s an experiment, it’s still a live service), it shows how far
the once brightest star of the online world has fallen.This kind of thinking
kills innovation. When there's no room for a few hiccups or a little failure
you have to cover your ass so completely nothing new will ever see the light
of day.breakI thought we were supposed to beagile. We are supposed to release
early and often. Not every 'i' has to be dotted and not every last router has
to be installed before we take the first step of a grand new journey.Get it
out there. Let users help you make it better. Listen to customers, make
changes, push the new code out, listen some more, and fix problems as they
come up. Following this process we'll make something the customer wants and

<p>Introduction: Misco: A MapReduce Framework for Mobile Systems is a very exciting paper to me
because it's really one of the first explorations of some of the ideas in
Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the
Ambient Cloud. What they are trying to do is efficiently distribute work
across a set cellphones using a now familiar MapReduce interface. Usually we
think of MapReduce as working across large data center hosted clusters. Here,
the cluster nodes are cellphones not contained in any data center, but compute
nodes potentially distributed everywhere.I talked withAdam Dou, one of the
paper's authors, and he said they don't see cellphone clusters replacing
dedicated computer clusters, primarily because of thepower requiredfor both
network communication and the map-reduce computations. Large multi-terabyte
jobs aren't in the cards...yet. Adam estimates computationally that cellphones
are performing similarly to desktops of ten years ago. Instead, they want to

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byIvan de PradoandPere Ferrera, founders ofDatasalt, the
company behindPangoolandSplout SQLBig Data open-source projects.The amount of
payments performed using credit cards is huge. It is clear that there is
inherent value in the data that can be derived from analyzing all the
transactions. Client fidelity, demographics, heat maps of activity, shop
recommendations, and many other statistics are useful to both clients and
shops for improving their relationship with the market. AtDatasaltwe have
developed a system in collaboration with theBBVA bankthat is able to analyze
years of data and serve insights and statistics to different low-latency web
and mobile applications.The main challenge we faced besides processing Big
Data input is thatthe output was also Big Data, and even bigger than the
input. And this output needed to be served quickly, under high load.The
solution we developed has an infrastructure cost of just a few thousands of
dollars per month thanks to th</p><p>4 0.91490477 <a title="882-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Yslow_to_speed_up_your_web_pages.html">47 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Yslow to speed up your web pages</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scoblethe Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video
channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that
have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things
you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off
the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.For a strategy hit
he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about
when makingFeedBlendr:One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services
you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up
and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up
and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He
told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in
designing their architecture.</p><p>6 0.89349341 <a title="882-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_16%2C_2011.html">1117 high scalability-2011-09-16-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 16, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We build web applications…and there are plenty of them around. Now, if we hit
the jackpot and our application becomes very popular, traffic goes up, and our
servers are brought down by the hordes of people coming to our website. What
do we do in that situation?Of course, I am not talking here about the kind of
traffic Digg, Yahoo Buzz or other social media sites can bring to a website,
which is temporary overnight traffic, or a website which uses cloud computing
like Amazon EC2 service, MediaTemple Grid Service or Mosso Hosting Cloud
service.I am talking about traffic that consistently increases over time as
the service achieves success. Google.com, Yahoo.com, Myspace.com,
Facebook.com, Plentyoffish.com, Linkedin.com, Youtube.com and others are
examples of services which have constant high traffic.Knowing that users want
speed from their applications, these services will always use a Content
Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver that speed.What is a Content Delivery

<p>Introduction: Update 10:The Value of CDNsby Mike Axelrod of Google. Google implements a
distributed content cache from withinlarge ISPs. This allows them to serve
content from the edge of the network and save bandwidth on the ISPs
backbone.Update 9:Just Jump: Start using Clouds and CDNs. Bob Buffone gives a
really nice and practical tutorial of how to use CloudFront as your
CDN.breakUpdate 8:Akamai’s Services Become Affordable for Anyone! Blazing Web
Site Performance by Distribution Cloud.Distribution Cloud starts at $150 per
month for access to the best content distribution network in the world and the
leader of Content Distribution Networks.Update 7:Where Amazon’s Data Centers
Are Located,Expanding the Cloud: Amazon CloudFront.Why Amazon's CDN Offering
Is No Threat To Akamai, Limelight or CDN Pricing. Amazon has launched their

<p>Introduction: Update 2: YouTube Reaches One Billion Views Per Day.That's at least 11,574
views per second, 694,444 views per minute, and 41,666,667 views per
hour.Update:YouTube: The Platform. YouTube adds a new rich set of APIs in
order to become your video platform leader--all for free. Upload, edit, watch,
search, and comment on video from your own site without visiting YouTube.
Compose your site internally from APIs because you'll need to expose them
later anyway.YouTube grew incredibly fast, to over 100 million video views per
day, with only a handful of people responsible for scaling the site. How did
they manage to deliver all that video to all those users? And how have they
evolved since being acquired by Google?Information SourcesGoogle

<p>Introduction: One of the best projects I've ever worked on was creating a large scale web
site publishing system that was almost entirely static. A large team of very
talented creatives made the art work, writers penned the content, and
designers generated templates. All assets were controlled in a database. Then
all that was extracted, after applying many different filters, to a static
site that was uploaded via ftp to dozens of web servers. It worked great.
Reliable, fast, cheap, and simple. Updates were a bit of a pain as it required
pushing a lot of files to a lot of servers, and that took time, but otherwise
a solid system.Alas, this elegant system was replaced with a new fangled
dynamic database based system. Content was pulled from a database using a
dynamic language generated front-end. With a recent series of posts from
Amazon's Werner Vogels, chronicling his experience of transforming his All
Things Distributed blog into a static site using S3's ability to serve web
pages, I get the pleasu</p><p>6 0.14961441 <a title="856-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-How_many_machines_do_you_need_to_run_your_site%3F.html">70 high scalability-2007-08-22-How many machines do you need to run your site?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you have a lot of static content to store and you aren't looking forward to
setting up and maintaining your own giganto SAN, maybe you can push off a lot
of the hard lifting to a CDN?Jesse Robbins at O'Reilly Radar posts that you
have a lot more options now because the number ofContent Distribution Networks
have doubled since last year. In fact, Dan Rayburn says there are now28
CDNproviders in the market. Hopefully you can find reasonable pricing at one
of them.Other than easing your burden, why might a CDN work for you? Because
it makes your site faster and customers like that. How can a CDN so
dramatically improve your site's performance?breakSteve Saunders, author
ofHigh Performance Web Sites: Essential Knowledge for Front-End Engineers, has

Site."About CDNs Steve says:Remember that 80-90% of the end-user response time

<p>Introduction: In the articleThe Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us, a lot of
interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from
Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and
work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn
in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting
the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-
in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer
specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed
development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and
reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5 second procedure;
capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git
for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem;
memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10
minutes; videos, articl</p><p>4 0.74846381 <a title="856-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-27-.Net2_and_AJAX_scalability%3F.html">135 high scalability-2007-10-27-.Net2 and AJAX scalability?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Am I mad to consider using .Net2 and AJAX for a high-scalability application?
In case you wonder why, it's the legacy of a website built on IIS and .Net
1.1, and we're looking for ways to make the content more attractive and
interactive. In this case, it's a medical image library being shared by a few
Wikis and online coursework for medicalstudents ( < 15K users) and doctors ( <
150K users)But I'm worried about the performance overhead. We already have a
performance problem because of personalising the content for users according
to their type (student or doctor), and for doctors, their grade and
speciality.</p><p>5 0.74250317 <a title="856-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-06-Super_Bowl_Advertisers_Ready_for_the_Traffic%3F_Nope..It%27s_Lights_Out..html">1401 high scalability-2013-02-06-Super Bowl Advertisers Ready for the Traffic? Nope..It's Lights Out.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Advertising for the Super Bowl is bigger than the game for many viewers. So
you gotta figure advertisers are ready for the traffic bursts generated by
their expensive ads? Not exactly...Yottaareports an amazing 13 advertiser

asking viewers to vote for the ending of a commercial, but load times went to
62 seconds. SodaStream, Calvin Klein, Axe, Got Milk? The Walking Dead, many
movie sites, and many car sites, all were flagged with delay of fame
penalties.Lots of time, money, and creative energy is spent lovingly
perfecting every detail of these commercials. It won't be a surprise to any
programmer that this can't usually be said of the follow through on the
backend.So what can you do? Yottaa has some good tips and Michael Hamrah has a

<p>Introduction: Like many other media content providers, libraries and museums are
increasingly moving their content onto the Web.  While the move itself is no
easy process (with digitization, web development, and training costs), being
able to successfully deliver content to a wide audience is an ongoing concern,
particularly for large libraries.Much of the concern is financial, as most
libraries do not have the internal budget or outside investors that for-profit
businesses enjoy.  Even large university libraries will face serious budget
constraints that even other university departments, such as science and
technology would not face.Creating a scalable infrastructure and also
distributing a large digital collection that can handle multiple requests,
requires planning that many librarians have not even imagined.  They must stop
thinking in terms of "one-item-per-customer" and start thinking in terms of
numerous users accessing the same information simultaneously.Content Delivery

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your end of July scaling pleasure: YouTube: 3 billion videos

faster...is to host it. Page Speed Service - Web Performance, Delivered. An

the world. No cost information. Your speed may vary. See the longish list of
limitations.Nobody said anything interesting on scalability this week! A
disaster of non-quotable proportions. If I missed something, now is your
chance. Moving an Elephant: Large Scale Hadoop Data Migration at Facebook.
Paul Yang describes the greatest westward expansion since the land bridge
across the Bering Strait. It's a story of moving a 30PB Hadoop cluster from an
over populated datacenter to the wide open spaces of a new continent. Unlike
the early settlers, Facebook did not move the boxes over, that would disrupt

<p>Introduction: It's being reportedYahoo bought Tumblr for $1.1 billion. You may
recallInstagram was profiled on HighScalabilityand they were also bought by
Facebook for a ton of money. A coincidence? You be the judge.Just what is
Yahoo buying? The business acumen of the deal is not something I can judge,
but if you are doing due diligence on the technology then Tumblr would
probably get a big thumbs up. To see why, please keep on reading...With over

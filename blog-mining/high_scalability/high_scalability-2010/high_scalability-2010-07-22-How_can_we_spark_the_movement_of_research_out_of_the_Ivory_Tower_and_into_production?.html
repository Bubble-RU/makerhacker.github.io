</p><p>9 My thoughts on the state of research versus industry were reinforced after listening to Barbara Liskov during her Turing Award Speech. [sent-30, score-0.505]
</p><p>10 It's hard for me to imagine, but it illustrates that vast gulf between industry and academia, the same sort of divide seen in the drug industry. [sent-42, score-0.567]
</p><p>11 Her discovery, like so many others, was published in a prestigious journal, was impeccably well researched, and showed a lot of potential in a sadly growing market, yet drug companies were not beating down her door. [sent-46, score-0.621]
</p><p>12 The Gap isn't Caused by Evilness, it's More of an Awareness Problem on Both SidesWhen the drug companies weren't beating down their door it wasn't necessarily because they were evil, it's because developing a drug is a risky and expensive business. [sent-64, score-0.954]
</p><p>13 When drug companies market the hell out of an approved drug it's because they finally got an approved drug, it makes sense to make the most money they can from it given the investment costs. [sent-66, score-1.237]

</p><p>15 That's what the SPARK program is about,figuring out how researchers can reframe and present their research in a way that is more easily consumed by potential productizers. [sent-77, score-0.639]
</p><p>16 Mochly-Rosen thinks researchers can be a great at generating new drug ideas, companies can develop them, the problem is how to get them to speak the same language and agree on some basic goals and protocols? [sent-83, score-0.676]

</p><p>18 If I am, for example, looking for a sharded, replicated, secure storage system and I find a research project to that effect, it would help me immensely if those researchers thought it a priority to make it easy for developers like me to use it. [sent-95, score-0.784]
</p><p>19 That might make the practical applications aspect of research more attractive as it makes the link between how research is written to potential rewards. [sent-151, score-0.914]

<p>Introduction: Mind the Gap: Reconnecting Architecture and OS Research is a paper presented
atHotOS XIII, the place where researchers talk about making potential futures
happen. For a great overview of the conference take a look at this article by
Matt Welsh: Conference report: HotOS 2011 in Napa.In the VM/cloud age I
question the need of having an OS at all, programs can compile directly
against "raw" hardware, but the paper does a good job of trying to figure out
the new roll operating systems can play in the future. We've been in a long OS
holding pattern, so long that we've seen the rise of PaaS vendors skipping the
OS level abstraction completely, but there's room for a middle ground between
legacy time sharing systems of the past and service level APIs that are but
one possible future.Introduction:For too long, operating systems researchers
and developers have pretty much taken whatever computer architects have dished
out.

<p>Introduction: Algorithms are moving out of the Platonic realm and are becoming dynamic first
class players in real life. We've seen corporations become people. Algorithms
will likely also follow that path to agency.Kevin Slavin in his intriguing TED
talk: How Algorithms Shape Our World, gives many and varied examples of how
algorithms have penetrated RL. One of his most interesting examples is from a
highly technical paper on Relativistic statistical arbitrage, which says to
make money on markets you have to be where the people are, the red dots (on
the diagram below), which means you have to put servers where the blue dots
are, many of which are in the ocean. Here's the diagram from the paper:Mr.
Slavin neatly sums this up by saying:And it's not the money that's so
interesting actually. It's what the money motivates, thatwe're actually
terraforming the Earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency. And in
that light, you go back and you look at Michael Najjar's photographs, and you

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,

<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

<p>Introduction: Inspired by axkcd comic,Peter Norvig,Director of Research at Google and all
around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving
a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful
systems profiled on HighScalability.The original code is atxkcd 1313: Regex
Golf, which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the
winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is
readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but
soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find
regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's
deliberate strategy for finding a regex.The post demonstrating the iterated
improvement of the program is atxkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite
Problems). As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the
program Peter recommends the following steps: Profiling: Figure out where the
program spends its time.

<p>Introduction: Hi,In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread
pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is
tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal
variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user
id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the
code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to
pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought isclass ReferenceIdGenerator
{public static setReferenceId(String login) {threadLocal.set(login +
System.currentMillis());}public static String getReferenceId() {return
threadLocal.get();}private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =new
ThreadLocal();}class MySevlet {void service(.....) {HttpSession session =
request.getSession(false);String userId =
session.get("userId");ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId);try
{doSomething();}finally {ReferenceIdGenerator.remove();}}This method is also</p><p>3 0.96515995 <a title="863-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed_content_system_with_bandwidth_balancing.html">605 high scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed content system with bandwidth balancing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>4 0.96470892 <a title="863-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-05-Big_Data_Counting%3A_How_to_count_a_billion_distinct_objects_using_only_1.5KB_of_Memory.html">1222 high scalability-2012-04-05-Big Data Counting: How to count a billion distinct objects using only 1.5KB of Memory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Matt Abrams (@abramsm), from Clearspring, discussing
how they are able to accurately estimate the cardinality of sets with billions
of distinct elements using surprisingly small data structures. Their servers
receive well over 100 billion events per month.AtClearspringwe like to count
things. Counting the number of distinct elements (the cardinality) of a set is
challenge when the cardinality of the set is large.To better understand the
challenge of determining the cardinality of large sets let's imagine that you
have a 16 character ID and you'd like to count the number of distinct IDs that
you've seen in your logs. Here is an example:4f67bfc603106cb2These 16
characters represent 128 bits. 65K IDs would require 1 megabyte of space. We
receive over 3 billion events per day, and each event has an ID. Those IDs
require 384,000,000,000 bits or 45 gigabytes of storage. And that is just the
space that the ID field requires! To get the cardinality of IDs in our daily

<p>Introduction: InMemSQL Architecture we learned one of the core strategies MemSQL uses to
achieve their need for speed is lock-free skip lists. Skip lists are used to
efficiently handle range queries. Making the skip-lists lock-free helps
eliminate contention and make writes fast. If this all sounds a little pie-in-
the-sky then here's a very good paper on the subject that might help make it
clearer: A Provably Correct Scalable Concurrent Skip List.From the abstract:We
propose a new concurrent skip list algorithm distinguished by a combination of
simplicity and scalability. The algorithm employs optimistic synchronization,
searching without acquiring locks, followed by short lock-based validation
before adding or removing nodes. It also logically removes an item before
physically unlinking it. Unlike some other concurrent skip list algorithms,
this algorithm preserves the skiplist properties at all times, which
facilitates reasoning about its correctness. Experimental evidence shows that

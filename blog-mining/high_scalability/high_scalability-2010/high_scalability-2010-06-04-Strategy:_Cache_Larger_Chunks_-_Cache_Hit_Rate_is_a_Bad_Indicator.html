<p>Introduction: As a tasty pairing with  Facebook And Site Failures Caused By Complex, Weakly Interacting, Layered Systems , is another excellent tale of caching gone wrong by Peter Zaitsev, in an exciting twin billing:  Cache Miss Storm  and  More on dangers of the caches . This is fascinating case where the cause turned out to be software upgrade that ran long because it had to be rolled back. During the long recovery time many of the cache entries timed out. When the database came back, slam, all the clients queried the database to repopulate the cache and bad things happened to the database. The solution was equally interesting: 
  

So the immediate solution to bring the system up was surprisingly simple. We just had to get traffic on the system in stages allowing Memcache to be warmed up. There were no code which would allow to do it on application side so we did it on MySQL side instead. “SET GLOBAL max_connections=20” to limit number of connections to MySQL and so let application to err when i</p><p>4 0.12518957 <a title="836-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy%3A_Break_Up_the_Memcache_Dog_Pile_.html">673 high scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy: Break Up the Memcache Dog Pile </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Asynchronous  HTTP cache validations . A proposed HTTP caching extension:  if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content, then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-experience.   Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin. Slow site: add caching.  Facebook  must have a lot of headaches because they popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called the   Dog Pile  Effect  in  Dog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails .

<p>Introduction: Hi,         I am using drupal for my clients website, and was thinking is it possible to host all ( about 500) of them on the same server(maybe VPS or dedicated).       Here is the situation..... Each clients website has a database with about 50 tables each, all the databases are small in size about 2-5 MB .... and the websites are low traffic websites with say.. 50 hits/day on avg.... that means about 2000 queries/db/day ..... (avg 40 queries per hit)....         Wanted to know if it is possible to have so many databases about 500 on the same server?         what are the things that i should look into if i should make this happen?</p><p>6 0.12273994 <a title="836-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-04-A_Bunch_of_Great_Strategies_for_Using_Memcached_and_MySQL_Better_Together.html">360 high scalability-2008-08-04-A Bunch of Great Strategies for Using Memcached and MySQL Better Together</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Performance guru  Steve Souders  gave his keynote presentation,  Cache is King!  ( slides ), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results on what gave the best web site performance improvements.
 
In his base line test, page loads took 7.65 seconds (median of three runs). What change--Fast Network, No Javascript, or Primed Cache--would make the biggest performance improvement? It was Primed Cache.
  
 Fast Network - Using a fast FIOS network the load time was 4.13 seconds. Steve was surprised how big a difference this made, given how much work must happen in the browser.  
 No JavaScript - 4.74 seconds after disabling JavaScript. Both reduces transfers and skips parsing by the browser. Steve thought the effect would have been larger.

<p>Introduction: Update: Google added videos on   Cluster Computing and MapReduce . There are five lectures:  Introduction, MapReduce, Distributed File Systems, Clustering Algorithms, and Graph Algorithms  .     Advanced website design depends on deep distributed system design knowledge. Where do you get this knowledge? Try Google. They have a a whole   Code for Educators   program with tutorials and lectures on AJAX programming, distributed systems, and web security. Looks pretty nice.</p><p>2 0.99973017 <a title="836-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy%3A_How_to_Manage_Sessions_Using_Memcached.html">436 high scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy: How to Manage Sessions Using Memcached</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dormando  shows an enlightened middle way  for storing sessions in cache and the database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient, smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry users.  The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the database:
    Reads : read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache logic.     Writes :  write to memcached every time, write to the database every N seconds (assuming the data has changed).   There's a small chance of data loss, but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>3 0.9995622 <a title="836-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-03-Running_Hadoop_MapReduce_on_Amazon_EC2_and_Amazon_S3.html">56 high scalability-2007-08-03-Running Hadoop MapReduce on Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites to  cache everything ? Caching, if not the  secret sauce  of many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But not so fast says Peter Zaitsev in  Beyond great cache hit ratio . The point Peter makes is that we read about websites like  Amazon  and  Facebook  that can literally make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all those requests takes time. The solution is to  remove requests all together . You do this by  caching larger blocks  so you have to make fewer requests. 
 
The post has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>6 0.99756509 <a title="836-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>

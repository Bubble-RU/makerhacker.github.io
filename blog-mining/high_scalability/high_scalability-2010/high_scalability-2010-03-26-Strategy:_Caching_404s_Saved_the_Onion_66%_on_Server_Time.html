<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byDave HaglerSystems Architect at AOL.The AOL homepages
receive more than8 million visitors per day.  That's more daily viewers than
Good Morning America or the Today Show on television.  Over a billion page
views are served each month.  AOL.com has been a major internet destination
since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.The architecture
for AOL.com is in it's 5th generation.  It has essentially been rebuilt from
scratch 5 times over two decades.  The current architecture was designed 6
years ago.  Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along
the way, but the overall design remains largely intact.  The code, tools,
development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of
continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very
stable.The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations
andtotals around 25 people.  The majority are in Dulles, Virginia with a

<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a

<p>Introduction: As traffic to cnbc.com continued to grow, we found ourselves in an all-too-
familiar situation where one feels that a BIG change in how things are done
was in order, the status-quo was a road to nowhere. The spending on HW, amount
of space and power required to host additional servers, less-than-stellar
response times, having to resort to frequent "micro"-caching and similar
tricks to try to improve code performance - all of these were surfacing in
plain sight, hard to ignore.While code base could clearly be improved, the
limited Dev resources and having to innovate to stay competitive always limits
ability to go about refactoring. So how can one go about addressing
performance and other needs without a full blown effort across the entire team
? For us, the answer was aiCache - a Web caching and application acceleration
product (aicache.com).breakThe idea behind caching is simple - handle the

<p>Introduction: Pre-generating static files is an oldy but a goody, and as Thomas Brox RĂ¸st
says, it's probably an underused strategy today. At one time this was the
dominate technique for structuring a web site. Then the age of dynamic web
sites arrived and we spent all our time worrying how to make the database
faster and add more caching to recover the speed we had lost in the transition
from static to dynamic.Static files have the advantage of being very fast to
serve. Read from disk and display. Simple and fast. Especially when caching
proxies are used. The issue is how do you bulk generate the initial files, how
do you serve the files, and how do you keep the changed files up to date? This
is the process Thomas covers in his excellent articleServing static files with

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeff Sufrom Factual.What is Varnish?Varnishis an open
source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack
and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for
both static and dynamic content.One great thing about Varnish is that it can
improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.
If you haven't heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven't used it),
please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive,
but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish's more advanced
features, you'll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.Some
of the high profile companies using Varnish include: Twitter, Facebook, Heroku
and LinkedIn.Our Use CaseOne of Factual's first high profile projects was
Newsweek's "America's Best High Schools: The List". After realizing that we
had only a few weeks to increase our throughput by tenfold, we looked into a</p><p>3 0.75338155 <a title="800-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-30-Better_Browser_Caching_is_More_Important_than_No_Javascript_or_Fast_Networks_for_HTTP_Performance.html">1396 high scalability-2013-01-30-Better Browser Caching is More Important than No Javascript or Fast Networks for HTTP Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Performance guruSteve Souders gave his keynote presentation, Cache is King!
(slides), at the HTML5DevCon, besides being an extremely clear explanation of
how caching works on the Internet and how to optimize your use of HTTP to get
the best performance, Steve ran experiments that found some surprising results
on what gave the best web site performance improvements.In his base line test,
page loads took 7.65 seconds (median of three runs). What change--Fast
Network, No Javascript, or Primed Cache--would make the biggest performance
improvement? It was Primed Cache.Fast Network - Using a fast FIOS network the
load time was 4.13 seconds. Steve was surprised how big a difference this
made, given how much work must happen in the browser. No JavaScript - 4.74
seconds after disabling JavaScript. Both reduces transfers and skips parsing
by the browser. Steve thought the effect would have been larger.Primed Cache-

their expensive ads? Not exactly...Yottaareports an amazing 13 advertiser

movie sites, and many car sites, all were flagged with delay of fame

perfecting every detail of these commercials. It won't be a surprise to any
programmer that this can't usually be said of the follow through on the
backend.So what can you do? Yottaa has some good tips and Michael Hamrah has a

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting and still relevant research paper by Jim Gray, Prashant
Shenoy at Microsoft Research that examines the rules of thumb for the design
of data storage systems. It looks at storage, processing, and networking
costs, ratios, and trends with a particular focus on performance and
price/performance.Jim Gray has an updated presentation on this interesting
topic:Long Term Storage Trends and You. Robin Harris has a great post that
reflects on the Rules of Thumb whitepaper on his StorageMojo blog:Architecting

<p>Introduction: Bees have a similar problem to website servers: how to do a lot of work with
limited resources in an ever changing environment. Usually lessons from
biology are hard to apply to computer problems. Nature throws hardware at
problems. Billions and billions of cells cooperate at different levels of
organizations to find food, fight lions, and make sure your DNA is passed
on.Nature's software is "simple," but her hardware rocks. We do the opposite.
For us hardware is in short supply so we use limited hardware and leverage
"smart" software to work around our inability to throw hardware at problems.
But we might be able to borrow some load balancing techniques from bees. What
do bees do that we can learn from?Bees do a dance to indicate the quality and
location of a nectar source. When a bee finds a better source they do a better
dance and resources shift to the new location. This approach may seem
inefficient, but it turns out to be "optimal for the unpredictable nectar
world." Craig Tovey</p><p>same-blog 4 0.81908399 <a title="800-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-26-Strategy%3A_Caching_404s_Saved_the_Onion_66%25_on_Server_Time.html">800 high scalability-2010-03-26-Strategy: Caching 404s Saved the Onion 66% on Server Time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the articleThe Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us, a lot of
interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from
Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and
work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn
in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting
the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-
in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer
specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed
development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and
reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5 second procedure;
capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git
for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem;
memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10
minutes; videos, articl</p><p>5 0.75580281 <a title="800-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-17-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_17th%2C_2014.html">1581 high scalability-2014-01-17-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 17th, 2014</a></p>

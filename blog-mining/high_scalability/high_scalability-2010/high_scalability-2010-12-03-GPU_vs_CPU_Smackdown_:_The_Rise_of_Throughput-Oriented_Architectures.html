</p><p>3 Swap out builder quality appliances with gleaming stainless steel monsters. [sent-8, score-0.12]
</p><p>4 Most people still probably don't even know this part of the house exists. [sent-12, score-0.197]
</p><p>5 The newest addition is a beauty, it's a graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster as described by Werner Vogels in Expanding the Cloud - Adding the Incredible Power of the Amazon EC2 Cluster GPU Instances . [sent-13, score-0.302]
</p><p>6 To get a feeling of the speed involved readBillMcColl's comment:Cloudscale is now able to ANALYZE a SINGLE STREAM of entity events at a rate of TWO MILLION EVENTS PER SECOND (150MB/sec) on an 8-node 10-GigE Amazon cloud cluster. [sent-17, score-0.142]
</p><p>7 To be able build applications that exploit this level of parallelism one needs to enter a very specific mindset of kernels, kernel functions, threads-blocks, grids of threads-blocks, mapping to hierarchical memory, etc. [sent-23, score-0.342]
</p><p>8 There are a number of techniques that every programmer has grown up with, such as branching, that are not available, or should be avoided on GPUs if one wants to truly exploit its power. [sent-25, score-0.185]
</p><p>9 Modern CPUs strongly favor lower latency of operations with clock cycles in the nanoseconds and we have built general purpose software architectures that can exploit these low latencies very well. [sent-26, score-0.486]
</p><p>10 Now that our ability to generate higher and higher clock rates has stalled and CPU architectural improvements have shifted focus towards multiple cores, we see that it is becoming harder to efficiently use these computer systems. [sent-27, score-0.2]
</p><p>11 One trade-off area where our general purpose CPUs were not performing well was that of massive fine grain parallelism. [sent-28, score-0.214]
</p><p>12 The throughput of this pipeline is more important than the latency of the individual operations. [sent-30, score-0.136]
</p><p>13 Because of its focus on latency, the generic CPU yielded rather inefficient system for graphics processing. [sent-31, score-0.171]
</p><p>14 This lead to the birth of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) which was focused on providing a very fine grained parallel model, with processing organized in multiple stages, where the data would flow through. [sent-32, score-0.127]
</p><p>15 The model of a GPU is that of task parallelism describing the different stages in the pipeline, as well as data parallelism within each stage, resulting in a highly efficient, high throughput computation architecture. [sent-33, score-0.401]
</p><p>16 The ACM has a timely article about using GPUs for high performance computing ACM:Understanding Throughput- Oriented Architecture by Michael Garland and David Kirk:Scalability is the programmer's central concern in designing efficient algorithms for throughput- oriented machines. [sent-34, score-0.194]
</p><p>17 Today's architectural trends clearly favor increasing parallelism, and effective algorithmic techniques must scale with hardware parallelism. [sent-35, score-0.207]
</p><p>18 Some techniques suitable for four parallel threads may be entirely unsuitable for 4,000 parallel threads. [sent-36, score-0.137]
</p><p>19 Second, for a surprisingly large number of problems there is now a ready supply of GPU supercomputeryness. [sent-42, score-0.076]
</p><p>20 But that's kind of boring :-) ClearlyGPUs aren't general purpose processors. [sent-52, score-0.214]

info from Steve Souder,Greg Linden, andMarissa Mayer. Speed [is] an
undervalued and under-discussed asset on the web.Update 7:How do you know when
you need more memcache servers?. Dathan Pattishall talks about using memcache
not to scale, but to reduce latency and reduce I/O spikes, and how to use
stats to know when more servers are needed.Update 6:Stock Traders Find Speed
Pays, in Milliseconds. Goldman Sachs is making record profits off a500
millisecondtrading advantage. Yes, latency matters. As an interesting aside,
Libet found 500 msecs is about the time it takes the brain to weave together
an experience of consciousness from all our sensor inputs.Update 5:Shopzilla's

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

<p>Introduction: And now for something completely different, brought to you by David Ackley and
Daniel Cannon in their playfully thought provoking paper: Pursue robust
indefinite scalability, wherein they try to take a fresh look at neural
networks, starting from scratch.What is this strange thing calledindefinite
scalability? They sound like words that don't really go together:Indefinite
scalability is the property that the design can support open-ended
computational growth without substantial re-engineering, in as strict as sense
as can be managed. By comparison, many computer, algorithm, and network
designs -- even those that address scalability -- are only finitely scalable
because their scalability occurs within some finite space. For example, an in-
core sorting algorithm for a 32 bit machine can only scale to billions of

<p>Introduction: How does Facebook handle the massive New Year's Eve traffic spike? Thanks to
Mike Swift, in Facebook gets ready for New Year's Eve, we get a little insight
as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still
interesting.Problem SetupFacebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be
shared on New Year's eve.Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the
world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average
of 130 friends.Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a
homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those
requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then
rendered.Different events put different stresses on different parts of
Facebook. Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of
capacity News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve

<p>Introduction: In some ways the original Amazon cloud, the one most of us still live in, was
like that really cool house that when you stepped inside and saw the oldgreen
shag carpetin the living room, you knew the house hadn't been updated in a
while. The network is a little slow, the processors are a bit dated, and
virtualization made the house just feel smaller. It has been difficult to run
high bandwidth or low latency workloads in the cloud. Bottlenecks everywhere.
Not a big deal for most applications, but for many high performance
applications (HPC) it was a killer.In a typical house you might just do a
remodel. Upgrade a few rooms. Swap out builder quality appliances with
gleaming stainless steel monsters. But Amazon has a big lot, instead of
remodeling they simply keep adding on entire new wings, kind of like the
Winchester Mystery Houseof computing.The first new wing added was aCPU based

<p>Introduction: We are not yet at the End of History for database theory asPeter Bailisand
theDatabase Groupat UC Berkeley continue to prove with a greatcompanion blog
post to their new paper: Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions. I
like the approach of pairing a blog post with a paper. A paper almost by
definition is formal, but a blog post can help put a paper in context and give
it some heart.From the abstract:Databases can provide scalability by
partitioning data across several servers. However, multi-partition, multi-
operation transactional access is often expensive, employing coordination-
intensive locking, validation, or scheduling mechanisms. Accordingly, many
real-world systems avoid mechanisms that provide useful semantics formulti-
partition operations. This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of
applications including secondary indexing,foreign key enforcement, and
materialized view maintenance. In this work, we identify a new isolation model

<p>Introduction: Think of building websites as engineeringcomposite materials. A composite
material is when two or more materials are combined to create a third material
that does something useful that the components couldn't do on their own.
Composites like reinforced concrete have revolutionized design and
construction. When building websites we usually bring different component
materials together, like creating a composite, to get the features we need
rather than building a completely new thing from scratch that does everything
we want.This approach has been seen as a hack because it leads to inelegancies
like data duplication; great gobs of component glue; consistency issues; and
messy operations. But what if the the composite approach is really a strength,
not a hack, but a messy part of the world that needs to be embraced rather
than belittled?They key is tosee data as a material. Right now we are arguing
which is the best single material to build with. Is itNoSQL, relational,
massively parallel,</p><p>5 0.93215877 <a title="953-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-10-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_28%2C_2011.html">1134 high scalability-2011-10-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 28, 2011</a></p>

IO wall with MySQL at 1000 DB updates/sec. They needed more so they went with
Redis. Not quite honest to say no cache was used as everything is RAM, but
maybe that's the point. Use a lot of automation. Inactive users are archived.

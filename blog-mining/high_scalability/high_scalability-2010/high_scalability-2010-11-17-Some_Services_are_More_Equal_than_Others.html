<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byFrederic Faure(architect atYsance)on the differences
between using a cloud infrastructure and building your own. Frederic was kind
enough to translate the original French version of this article into
English.I've been noticing many questions about the differences inherent in
choosing between a Cloud infrastructure such asAWS(Amazon Web Services) and a
traditional physical infrastructure. Firstly, there are a certain number of
preconceived notions on this subject that I will attempt to decode for you.
Then, it must be understood that each infrastructure has its advantages and
disadvantages: a Cloud-type infrastructure does not necessarily fulfill your
requirements in every case, however, it can satisfy some of them by optimizing
or facilitating the features offered by a traditional physical infrastructure.
I will therefore demonstrate the differences between the two that I have
noticed, in order to help you make up your own mind.The FrameworkCloudThere

<p>Introduction: One of the benefits of web applications is that they are generally
transported via TCP, which is a connection-oriented protocol designed to
assure delivery. TCP has a variety of native mechanisms through which delivery
issues can be addressed - from window sizes to selective acks to idle time
specification to ramp up parameters. All these technical knobs and buttons
serve as a way for operators and administrators to tweak the protocol, often
at run time, to ensure the exchange of requests and responses upon which web
applications rely. This is unlike UDP, which is more of a "fire and forget"
protocol in which the server doesn't really care if you receive the data or
not.Now, voice and streaming video and audio over the web has always leveraged
UDP and thus it has always been highly sensitive to jitter. Jitter is, without
getting into layer one (physical) jargon, an undesirable delay in the
otherwise consistent delivery of packets. It causes the delay of and sometimes
outright loss of p</p><p>4 0.70939541 <a title="944-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-21-What_CDN_would_you_recommend%3F.html">576 high scalability-2009-04-21-What CDN would you recommend?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: InNoSQL: Past, Present, FutureEric Brewerhas a particularly fine section on
explaining the often hard to understand ideas ofBASE(Basically Available, Soft
State, Eventually Consistent),ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
Durability),CAP(Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a
pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in
banking.Myth: Money is important, so banksmustuse transactions to keep money
safe and consistent, right?Reality: Banking transactions are inconsistent,
particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a
partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over
Consistency.Why?1)Availability correlates with revenue and consistency
generally does not.2)Historically there was never an idea of perfect
communication so everything was partitioned.Your ATM transaction must go
through so Availability is more important than consistency. If the ATM is down
then you aren't making money.

<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about
building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in
terms of scalability. Thepaperdescribes a new technology by the startup
company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction
of the cost of earlier possibilities.Complete Genomics is building the world's
largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey,
outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.By 2010,
their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30
petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.Do
you find this interesting and relevant to HighScalability.com?</p><p>same-blog 3 0.89541984 <a title="944-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-17-Some_Services_are_More_Equal_than_Others.html">944 high scalability-2010-11-17-Some Services are More Equal than Others</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Remember when the iPhone launched? Remember the complaints about the device
not maintaining calls well? Was it really the hardware? Or was it the service
provider network, overwhelmed by not just the call volume but millions of
hyper-customers experimenting with their new toy? Look - a video! Look a
videoand a call.Hey, I'm on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and streaming audio at
the same time I'm making a call! How awesome is that?Meanwhile, there's an
entire army of operators at a service provider's NOC who are stalking through
the data center with scissors because it's the only way to stop the
madness.Service providers, probably better than any other, understand
"services". For longer than the enterprise has been talking about them,
service providers have been implementing them. They've got their own set of
standards and reference architectures and even language to describe them, but
in a nutshell that's what a service provider does: offers services.The problem

you don't get write amplification If you think about it, a cloud as a rule

<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations. Jeremy Cole inOn
efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GISsuccinctly
explains the many uses for such a feature:Geo-referencing IPs is, in a
nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a
log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity
owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-
reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting
systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more
applications.This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit
of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-
rereferncing data, how to load data, and the performance of different
approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to
the subject.</p><p>6 0.86609066 <a title="944-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-10-Can_cloud_computing_smite_down_evil_zombie_botnet_armies%3F.html">349 high scalability-2008-07-10-Can cloud computing smite down evil zombie botnet armies?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: You're Doing it Wrong by Poul-Henning Kamp. Don't look so guilty, he's not
talking about you know what, he's talking about writing high-performance
server programs: Not just wrong as in not perfect, but wrong as in wasting
half, or more, of your performance. What good is an O(log2(n)) algorithm if
those operations cause page faults and slow disk operations? For most relevant
datasets an O(n) or even an O(n^2) algorithm, which avoids page faults, will
run circles around it. A Microsoft Windows Azure primer: the basicsby Peter
Bright. Nice article explaining the basics of Azure and how it compares to
Google and Amazon.A call to change the name from NoSQL to Postmodern
Databases. Interesting idea, but the problem is the same one I have for
Postmodern Art, when is it? I always feel like I'm in the post-post modern
period, yet for art it's really in the early 1900s. Let's save future
developers from this existential time crisis.Constructions from Dots and

<p>Introduction: O'Reilly Radar's James Turner conducted avery informative interviewwith Joe
Stump, current CTO ofSimpleGeoand former lead architect atDigg, in which Joe
makes some of his usually insightful comments on his experience using
Cassandra vs MySQL. As Digg started out with aMySQL oriented architectureand
has recently beenmoving full speedto Cassandra, his observations on some of
their lessons learned and the motivation for the move are especially valuable.
Here are some of the key takeaways you find useful:Precompute on writes, make
reads fast. This is an oldie as a scaling strategy, but it's valuable to see
how SimpleGeo is applying it to their problem of finding entities within a
certain geographical region. Using Cassandra they've built two clusters: one
for indexes and one for records. The records cluster, as you might imagine, is
a simple data lookup. The index cluster has a carefully constructed key for
every lookup scenario. The indexes are computed on the write, so reads are

<p>Introduction: How Big is a Yottabyte? Not so big that the NSA can't hope to store it
saysCrunchGear: There are a thousand gigabytes in a terabyte, a thousand
terabytes in a petabyte, a thousand petabytes in an exabyte, a thousand
exabytes in a zettabyte, and a thousand zettabytes in a yottabyte. In other
words, a yottabyte is 1,000,000,000,000,000GB.The CMS data aggregation system.
The Large Hadron Collider project is usingMongoDB as a cache.Here we discuss a
new data aggregation system which consumes, indexes and delivers information
from different relational and non-relational data sources to answer cross

<p>Introduction: We've seen a lot ofNoSQLaction lately built around distributed hash tables.
Btrees are getting jealous. Btrees, once the king of the database world, want
their throne back.Paul Buchheitsurfaced a paper:A practical scalable
distributed B-treeby Marcos K. Aguilera and Wojciech Golab, that might help
spark a revolution.From the Abstract:We propose a new algorithm for a
practical, fault tolerant, and scalable B-tree distributed over a set of
servers. Our algorithm supports practical features not present in prior work:
transactions that allow atomic execution of multiple operations over multiple
B-trees, online migration of B-tree nodes between servers, and dynamic
addition and removal of servers. Moreover, our algorithm is conceptually
simple: we use transactions to manipulate B-tree nodes so that clients need
not use complicated concurrency and locking protocols used in prior work. To
execute these transactions quickly, we rely on three techniques: (1) We use
optimistic concurrency contro</p><p>4 0.90473032 <a title="835-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible_-__A_Simple_Model-Driven_Configuration_Management_and_Command_Execution_Framework.html">1230 high scalability-2012-04-18-Ansible -  A Simple Model-Driven Configuration Management and Command Execution Framework</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is guest post byMichael DeHaan(@laserllama), a software developer and
architect, on Ansible, a simple deployment, model-driven configuration
management, and command execution framework.I owe High Scalability a great
deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>5 0.90279227 <a title="835-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_11%2C_2011.html">1141 high scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 11, 2011</a></p>

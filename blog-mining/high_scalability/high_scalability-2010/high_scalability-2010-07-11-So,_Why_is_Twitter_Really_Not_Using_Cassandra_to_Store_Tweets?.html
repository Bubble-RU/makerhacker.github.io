<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Presentation from theNoSQL conference:slides,video.Update:Why you
won't be building your killer app on a distributed hash tableby Jonathan
Ellis.Why I think Cassandra is the most promising of the open-source
distributed databases --you get a relatively rich data model and a
distribution model that supports efficient range queries. These are not things
that can be grafted on top of a simpler DHT foundation, so Cassandra will be
useful for a wider variety of applications.James Hamilton has published a
thorough summary of Facebook's Cassandra, another scalable key-value store for
your perusal. It's open source and is described as a "BigTable data model
running on a Dynamo-like infrastructure." Cassandra is used in Facebook as an
email search system containing 25TB and over 100m mailboxes.Google Code for

<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Cole, a DBA Team Lead/Database Architect at Twitter, gave a really good
talk at the O'Reilly MySQL conference:Big and Small Data at @Twitter, where
the topic was thinking of Twitter from the data perspective.One of the
interesting stories he told was of the transition from Twitter's old way of
storing tweets using temporalsharding, to a more distributed approach using a
new tweet store called T-bird, which is built on top ofGizzard, which is built
using MySQL.Twitter's original tweet store:Temporally sharded tweets was a
good-idea-at-the-time architecture. Temporal sharding simply means tweets from
the same date range are stored together on the same shard.The problem is
tweets filled up one machine, then a second, and then a third. You end up
filling up one machine after another.This is a pretty common approach and one
that has some real flaws:Load balancing. Most of the old machines didn't get
any traffic because people are interested in what is happening now, especially
with T</p><p>6 0.19716294 <a title="855-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-26-Reddit%3A_Lessons_Learned_from_Mistakes_Made_Scaling_to_1_Billion_Pageviews_a_Month.html">1507 high scalability-2013-08-26-Reddit: Lessons Learned from Mistakes Made Scaling to 1 Billion Pageviews a Month</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Can anyone convincingly explain why properties sporting traffic statistics
that may seem in-line with with the capabilities of a single big-iron machine
need so many machines in their architecture?This is a common reaction to
architecture profiles on High Scalability: I could do all that on a few
machines so they must be doing something really stupid. Lo and behold this
same reaction also occurred to the articleThe Architecture Twitter Uses to
Deal with 150M Active Users. On Hacker Newspapsosouid voiced what a lot of
people may have been thinking:I really question the current trend of creating
big, complex, fragile architectures to "be able to scale". These numbers are a
great example of why, the entire thing could run on a single server, in a very
straight forward setup. When you are creating a cluster for scalability, and
it has less CPU, RAM and IO than a single server, what are you gaining? They
are only doing 6k writes a second for crying out loud.This is a surprisingly
hard react</p><p>4 0.71656531 <a title="855-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-19-Twitter_as_a_scalability_case_study.html">323 high scalability-2008-05-19-Twitter as a scalability case study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot has been said already about Twitter's scalability issues. Many have
given Twitter as an anti-pattern of how not to deal with scalability and have
suggested different solutions for scaling it. As Twitter is famously a Ruby-
on-Rails deployment, this case has also been used as a weapon in the
language/platform wars between the RoR and Java camps, and to a lesser degree,
also with the LAMP (PHP) camp</p><p>5 0.70598269 <a title="855-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-24-Build_your_own_twitter_like_real_time_analytics_-_a_step_by_step_guide.html">1251 high scalability-2012-05-24-Build your own twitter like real time analytics - a step by step guide</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Major social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter have developed
their own architectures for handling the need for real-time analytics on huge
amounts of data. However, not every company has the need or resources to build
their own Twitter-like solution.In this example we have taken the same Twitter
/Facebook-like blueprint, and made it simple enough for developers to
implement. We have taken the following approach in our implementation: Use In
Memory Data Grid (XAP) for handling the real time stream data-
processing.BigData data-base (Cassandra) for storing the historical data and
manage the trend analytics Use Cloudify (cloudifysource.org)  for managing and
automating the deployment on private or public cloudThe example demonstrate a
simple case of word count analytics. It uses Spring Social to plug-in to real
twitter feeds. The solution is designed to efficiently cope with getting and
processing the large volume of tweets. First, we partition the tweets so that

<p>Introduction: Hi,I saw an year ago that Netapp sold netcache to blu-coat, my site is a heavy
NetCache user and we cached 83% of our site. We tested with Blue-coat and F5
WA and we are not getting same performce as NetCache.Any of you guys have the
same issue? or somebody knows another product can handle much
traffic?ThanksRodrigo</p><p>2 0.96426845 <a title="855-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-17-Five_Misconceptions_on_Cloud_Portability.html">1144 high scalability-2011-11-17-Five Misconceptions on Cloud Portability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for
"CloudAPIportability," which implies a series of misconceptions.If we break
away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud
portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly
simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without
settling on a common CloudAPI.In this post i'll be covering five common
misconceptions people haveWRTto cloud portability.Cloud portability = Cloud
API portability. API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.The
main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in.Cloud
portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-
in.Cloud portability isn't for startups. Every startup that is expecting rapid
growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability
rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared
to do so.Cloud portability = Compromising on t</p><p>3 0.94289082 <a title="855-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-19-LinkedIn%3A_Creating_a_Low_Latency_Change_Data_Capture_System_with_Databus.html">1211 high scalability-2012-03-19-LinkedIn: Creating a Low Latency Change Data Capture System with Databus</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post bySiddharth Anand, a senior member of LinkedIn's
Distributed Data Systems team.Over the past 3 years, I've had the good fortune
to work with many emerging NoSQL products in the context of supporting the
needs of a high-traffic, customer facing web site.In 2010, I helped Netflix to
successfullytransition its web scale use-cases from Oracle to SimpleDB, AWS'
hosted database service. On completion of that migration, we started a second
migration, this time from SimpleDB to Cassandra. The first transition was key
to our move from our own data center to AWS' cloud. The second was key to our
expansion from one AWS Region to multiple geographically-distributed Regions
-- today Netflix serves traffic out of two AWS Regions, one in Virginia, the
other in Ireland (F1). Both of these transitions have been successful, but
have involved integration pain points such as the creation of database
replication technology.In December 2011, I moved to LinkedIn's Distributed
Data System</p><p>4 0.9360975 <a title="855-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-29-CTL_-_Distributed_Control_Dispatching_Framework_.html">433 high scalability-2008-10-29-CTL - Distributed Control Dispatching Framework </a></p>
<p>Introduction: CTLis aflexible distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to
break management processes into reusable control modules and execute them in
distributed fashion over the network.From their website:CTL is a flexible
distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to break management
processes into reusable control modules and execute them in distributed
fashion over the network.What does CTL do?CTL helps you leverage your current
scripts and tools to easily automate any kind of distributed systems
management or application provisioning task. Its good for simplifiying large-
scale scripting efforts or as another tool in your toolbox that helps you
speed through your daily mix of ad-hoc administration tasks.What are CTL's
features?CTL has many features, but the general highlights are:* Execute
sophisticated procedures in distributed environments - Aren't you tired of
writing and then endlessly modifying scripts that loop over nodes and invoke
remote actions? CTL d</p><p>5 0.92895377 <a title="855-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce_With_Ruby_Using_Hadoop.html">968 high scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce With Ruby Using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use

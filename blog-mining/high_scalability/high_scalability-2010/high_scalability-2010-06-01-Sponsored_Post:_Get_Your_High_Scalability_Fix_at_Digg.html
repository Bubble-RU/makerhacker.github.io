<p>Introduction: Update 4: :  Introducing Digg’s IDDB Infrastructure  by Joe Stump.  IDDB is a way to partition both indexes (e.g. integer sequences and unique character indexes) and actual tables across multiple storage servers (MySQL and MemcacheDB are currently supported with more to follow).   Update 3: :  Scaling Digg and Other Web Applications .  Update 2: :  How Digg Works  and  How Digg Really Works  (wear ear plugs). Brought  to you straight from Digg's blog. A very succinct explanation of the major elements of the Digg architecture while tracing a request through the system. I've updated this profile with the new information.  Update:   Digg now receives 230 million plus page views per month and 26 million unique visitors - traffic that necessitated major internal upgrades .  Traffic generated by Digg's over 22 million famously info-hungry users and 230 million page views can crash an unsuspecting website head-on into its CPU, memory, and bandwidth limits.

<p>Introduction: Joe Stump, Lead Architect at Digg, gave  this presentation  at the Web 2.0 Expo. I couldn't find the actual presentation, but fortunately  Kris Jordan  took some great notes. That's how key moments in history are accidentally captured forever. Joe was also kind enough to respond to my email questions with a phone call.   In this first part of the post Joe shares some timeless wisdom that you may or may not have read before. I of course take some pains to extract all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules. What really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDB  Will be the biggest new kid on the block in scaling .  MemcacheDB has been around for a little while and I've never thought of it in that way. Well learn why Joe is so excited by MemcacheDB at the end of the post.

<p>Introduction: From their website:    FAI  is an automated installation tool to install or deploy Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat, autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used for configuration management of a running system.  You can take one or more virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed, configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized management system for your Linux deployment.  
   
  FAI's target group are system administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a rendering farm,</p><p>3 0.92566085 <a title="833-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-26-Database_Optimize_patterns.html">607 high scalability-2009-05-26-Database Optimize patterns</a></p>

For those whose don't remember FC's history, TechCrunch published a  fitting eulogy :

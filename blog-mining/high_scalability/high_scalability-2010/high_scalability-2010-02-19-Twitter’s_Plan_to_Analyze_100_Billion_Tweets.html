<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: Yahoo has developed a new language called Pig Latin that fit in a sweet spot
between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level,
procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.The
accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into
physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce
implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined
Hadoop as a subproject.The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo!
are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and

<p>Introduction: Toy solutions solving Twitter's "problems" are a favorite scalability trope.
Everybody has this idea that Twitter is easy. With a little architectural hand
waving we have a scalable Twitter, just that simple. Well, it's not that
simple asRaffi Krikorian, VP of Engineering at Twitter, describes in his
superb and very detailed presentation onTimelines at Scale. If you want to
know how Twitter works - then start here.It happened gradually so you may have
missed it, but Twitter has grown up. It started as a strugglingthree-tierish
Ruby on Railswebsite to become a beautifully service driven core that we
actually go to now to see if other services are down. Quite a change.Twitter
now has 150M world wide active users, handles 300K QPS to generate timelines,
and a firehose that churns out 22 MB/sec. 400 million tweets a day flow
through the system and it can take up to 5 minutes for a tweet to flow from
Lady Gaga's fingers to her 31 million followers.A couple of points stood

<p>Introduction: Update 5:Hadoop Sorts a Petabyte in 16.25 Hours and a Terabyte in 62
Secondsand has itsgreen cred questionedbecause it took 40 times the number of
machines Greenplum used to do the same work.Update 4:Introduction to Pig. Pig
allows you to skip programming Hadoop at the low map-reduce level. You don't
have to know Java. Using the Pig Latin language, which is a scripting data
flow language, you can think about your problem as a data flow program. 10
lines of Pig Latin = 200 lines of Java.Update 3: Scaling Hadoop to4000 nodes
at Yahoo!. 30,000 cores with nearly 16PB of raw disk; sorted 6TB of data
completed in 37 minutes; 14,000 map tasks writes (reads) 360 MB (about 3
blocks) of data into a single file with a total of 5.04 TB for the whole
job.Update 2: HadoopSummit and Data-Intensive Computing Symposium Videos and

<p>Introduction: Major social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter have developed
their own architectures for handling the need for real-time analytics on huge
amounts of data. However, not every company has the need or resources to build
their own Twitter-like solution.In this example we have taken the same Twitter
/Facebook-like blueprint, and made it simple enough for developers to
implement. We have taken the following approach in our implementation: Use In
Memory Data Grid (XAP) for handling the real time stream data-
processing.BigData data-base (Cassandra) for storing the historical data and
manage the trend analytics Use Cloudify (cloudifysource.org)  for managing and
automating the deployment on private or public cloudThe example demonstrate a
simple case of word count analytics. It uses Spring Social to plug-in to real
twitter feeds. The solution is designed to efficiently cope with getting and
processing the large volume of tweets. First, we partition the tweets so that

<p>Introduction: Can anyone convincingly explain why properties sporting traffic statistics
that may seem in-line with with the capabilities of a single big-iron machine
need so many machines in their architecture?This is a common reaction to
architecture profiles on High Scalability: I could do all that on a few
machines so they must be doing something really stupid. Lo and behold this
same reaction also occurred to the articleThe Architecture Twitter Uses to
Deal with 150M Active Users. On Hacker Newspapsosouid voiced what a lot of
people may have been thinking:I really question the current trend of creating
big, complex, fragile architectures to "be able to scale". These numbers are a
great example of why, the entire thing could run on a single server, in a very
straight forward setup. When you are creating a cluster for scalability, and
it has less CPU, RAM and IO than a single server, what are you gaining? They
are only doing 6k writes a second for crying out loud.This is a surprisingly
hard react</p><p>4 0.7912817 <a title="780-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-19-How_Twitter_Stores_250_Million_Tweets_a_Day_Using_MySQL.html">1159 high scalability-2011-12-19-How Twitter Stores 250 Million Tweets a Day Using MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremy Cole, a DBA Team Lead/Database Architect at Twitter, gave a really good
talk at the O'Reilly MySQL conference:Big and Small Data at @Twitter, where
the topic was thinking of Twitter from the data perspective.One of the
interesting stories he told was of the transition from Twitter's old way of
storing tweets using temporalsharding, to a more distributed approach using a
new tweet store called T-bird, which is built on top ofGizzard, which is built
using MySQL.Twitter's original tweet store:Temporally sharded tweets was a
good-idea-at-the-time architecture. Temporal sharding simply means tweets from
the same date range are stored together on the same shard.The problem is
tweets filled up one machine, then a second, and then a third. You end up
filling up one machine after another.This is a pretty common approach and one

<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are
hired at many software companies...Agency: So sorry you had to wait in the
reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally
found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you
may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our
manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so
I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?Applicant: I
drive a 2008 Subaru.Agency: That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent
you.Applicant: That's OK. Any car will do.Agency: No, we can only take on
clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way.
There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take
a chance.Applicant: I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been
driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt. Agency: We

<p>Introduction: If Twitter is the "nervous system of the web" as some people think, then what
is the brain that makes sense of all those signals (tweets) from the nervous
system? That brain is the Twitter Analytics System and Kevin Weil, as
Analytics Lead at Twitter, is the homunculus within in charge of figuring out
what those over 100 billion tweets (approximately the number of neurons in the
human brain) mean.Twitter has only 10% of the expected 100 billion tweets now,
but a good brain always plans ahead. Kevin gave a talk,Hadoop and Protocol
Buffers at Twitter, at theHadoop Meetup, explaining how Twitter plans to use
all that data to an answer key business questions.What type of questions is
Twitter interested in answering? Questions that help them better understand
Twitter. Questions like:How many requests do we serve in a day?What is the
average latency?How many searches happen in day?How many unique queries, how
many unique users, what is their geographic distribution?What can we tell

<p>Introduction: This is an email interview withViktor Klang, Director of Engineering
atTypesafe, on theScala Futuresmodel &Akka;,both topics on which is he is
immensely passionate and knowledgeable.How do you structure your application?
That's the question I explored in the articleBeyond Threads And Callbacks. An
option I did not talk about, mostly because of my own ignorance, is a powerful
stack you may not be all that familiar with: Scala and Akka.To remedy my
oversight is our acting tour guide, Typesafe's Viktor Klang, long time Scala
hacker and Java enterprise systems architect. Viktor was very patient in
answering my questions and was enthusiastic about sharing his knowledge. He's
a guy who definitely knows what he is talking about.I've implemented several
Actor systems along with the messaging infrastructure, threading, async IO,
service orchestration, failover, etc, so I'm innately skeptical about
frameworks that remove control from the programmer at the cost of latency.So

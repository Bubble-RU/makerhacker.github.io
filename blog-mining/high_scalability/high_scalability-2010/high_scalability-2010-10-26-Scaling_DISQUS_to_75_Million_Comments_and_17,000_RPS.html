<p>Introduction: Here's anUpdate On Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes
Python.How do you add realtime functionality to a web scale application?
That's whatAdam Hitchcock, a Software Engineer at Disqus talks about in an
excellent talk: Making DISQUS Realtime (slides).Disqus had to take their
commenting system and add realtime capabilities to it. Not something that's
easy to do when at the time of the talk (2013) they had had just hit a billion
unique visitors a month.What Disqus developed is a realtime commenting system
called "realertime" that was tested to handle 1.5 million concurrently
connected users, 45,000 new connections per second, 165,000 messages/second,
with less than .2 seconds latency end-to-end.The nature of a commenting system
is that it is IO bound and has a high fanout, that is a comment comes in and
must be sent out to a lot of readers. It's a problem very similar to
whatTwitter must solve. Disqus' solution was quite interesting as was the path
to their solution.

<p>Introduction: Our last article on Disqus: How Disqus Went Realtime With 165K Messages Per
Second And Less Than .2 Seconds Latency, was a little out of date, but the
folks at Disqus have been busy implementing, not talking, so we don't know a
lot about what they are doing now, but we do have a short update in C1MM and
NGINXby John Watson and an article Trying out this Go thing.So Disqus has
grown a bit:1.3 billion unique visitors10 billion page views500 million users
engaged in discussions3 million communities25 million commentsThey are still
all about realtime, but Go replaced Python in their Realtime system:Original
Realtime backend was written in a pretty lightweight Python + gevent.The
realtime service is a hybrid of CPU intensive tasks + lots of network IO.
Gevent was handling the network IO without an issue, but at higher contention,
the CPU was choking everything. Switching over to Go removed that contention,
which was the primary issue that was being seen.Still runs on 5 machines Nginx

<p>Introduction: Disqus - Scaling the Worlds Largest Django App. Interesting overview of a
commenting system with 75 million comments and 250 million visitors. Lots of
good details on how they partition their database, testing, continuous
integration, feature switches, caching, delayed signals, and more.Things I
learnt tracking a billion events in 24 hours: Know your host, Scaling isn't
just servers, My servers need to talk to me more, Kill switches for users,
What you don't know is the problem, Don't mix server roles, Know your most
important users outside of your site.Tweets of Gold:georgebarnett: I read High
Scalability for useful articles about large scaling. Sadly though, nothing
useful ever shows up. #NoLongerBotheringnorthscale: wow that is fast! :) RT
@cgoldberg: was just running > 100k ops/sec against my 2-node #Membase

<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is
still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head
scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are
you still the same person?The Ise Grand Shrine has been in continuous
existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has
been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then
dismantled.Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a
living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what
is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the
shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that
imperative.You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects
like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed
in each new environment.The patterns of recurrence in software are the result
of Darwinian selectio</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88657218 <a title="928-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-26-Scaling_DISQUS_to_75_Million_Comments_and_17%2C000_RPS.html">928 high scalability-2010-10-26-Scaling DISQUS to 75 Million Comments and 17,000 RPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thispresentation andvideoby Jason Yan and David Cramer discusses how they
scaled DISQUS, a comments as a service service for easily adding comments to
your site and connecting communities. The presentation is very good, so here
are just a few highlights: Traffic: 17,000 requests/second peak; 450,000
websites; 15 million profiles; 75 million comments; 250 million visitors; 40
million monthly users / developer.Forces: unpredictable traffic patterns
because of celebrity gossip and events like disasters; discussion never expire
which means they can't fit in memory; must always be up.Machines: 100 servers;
30% web servers (Appache + mod_wsgi); 10% databases (PostgreSQL); 25% cache
servers (memcached); 20% load balancing / high availability (HAProxy +
heartbeat); 15% Utility servers (Python scripts).Architecture: Requests are
load balanced across an Apache cluster. Apache talks to memcached,
HAProxy/pgbouncer to handle connection pooling to the database, and a central
queue service. Strategi</p><p>3 0.87210071 <a title="928-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-06-Product%3A_Lightcloud_-_Key-Value_Database.html">528 high scalability-2009-03-06-Product: Lightcloud - Key-Value Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lightcloud is a distributed and persistentkey-value databasefromPlurk.com.
Performance is said to be comparable to memcached. It's different
thanmemcachedbbecause it scales out horizontally by adding new nodes. It's
different than memcached because it persists to disk, it's not just a cache.
Now you haveone more optionin the never ending quest to ditch the RDBMS.Their
website does a nice job explaining the system:Built on Tokyo Tyrant. One of
the fastest key-value databases [benchmark]. Tokyo Tyrant has been in
development for many years and is used in production by Plurk.com, mixi.jp and
scribd.com (to name a few)...Great performance (comparable to memcached!)Can

<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation Propagation Networks: A
Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation, offers to help us break
free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of
autonomous but interconnected machines.  We can do this byorganizing
computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of
which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the
network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the
structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.The abstract from
his thesis is:In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of
computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The
traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large
memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with
computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected
with stateful storage cells. In so</p><p>5 0.84882885 <a title="928-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-23-Building_a_Scalable_Key-Value_Database%3A_Project_Hydracus.html">885 high scalability-2010-08-23-Building a Scalable Key-Value Database: Project Hydracus</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The world of NoSQL and alternative database implementations (i.e. non-
relational) is deeply fascinating to me. I can't help but be swept up in the
whirl of planet-scale web development scalability techniques and the evolution
of how developers think about building their applications knowing that with
success comes the inevitable need to scale to levels almost unimaginable just
five or ten years ago.I'm going to make a prediction: Developers will be
expected to understand the fundamentals of how different database systems can
be applied within a singular application; their strengths and weaknesses, and
when it is appropriate to leverage them.There's a lot out there about scaling
relational databases. Partitioning your data over application-managed shards
is a topic that has seen its fair share of attention. But I think there's a
whole slew over NoSQL databases that have been built and designed by some very
smart people that are new enough that their internals aren't well understood

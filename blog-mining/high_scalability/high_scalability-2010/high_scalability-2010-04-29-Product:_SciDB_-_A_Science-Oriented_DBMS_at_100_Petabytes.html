<p>Introduction: You program in a dynamic language, that runs on a JVM, that runs on a OS
designed40 years ago for a completely different purpose, that runs on
virtualized hardware. Does this make sense? We've talked about this idea
before inMachine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting The Cloud From Scratch, where the
vision is to treatcloud virtual hardware as a compiler target, and converting
high-level language source code directly into kernels that run on it.As new
technologies evolve the friction created by our old tool chains and
architecture models becomes ever more obvious. Take, for example, what
ateamatUCSD is releasing: aphase-change memory prototype  -a solid state
storage device that provides performance thousands of times faster than a
conventional hard drive and up to seven times faster than current state-of-
the-art solid-state drives (SSDs).However, PCM has access latencies several
times slower than DRAM.This technology has obvious mind blowing implications,
but an interesting not so obvious im</p><p>4 0.085193388 <a title="817-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>5 0.084620565 <a title="817-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-05-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Memcached_and_Relations.html">1399 high scalability-2013-02-05-Ask HighScalability: Memcached and Relations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi everybodyI'm wondering what you would do: I develop a webapp using Grails,
Memcached and Mysql as persistence. Now, I have following domain classes
(simplified):Product: Can be in one categoryCategory: Can have nested
children, and have multiple products.I need to access all product objects by
id which led me to the idea to store all products in one big Memcached-entry
with a key: PRODUCTMAP and as value, all product attributes as array, like:
[productId1: [title: 'title'], productId2: [title: 'title']]If I browse to
category 4, I simply get my map categoryMap with value [cateoryId:
[productId1, productId2]]I also can list all products of a certain category by
providing that id. The bad thing about this is that I always have to put back
everything if I modify a single product.Who can give advice how to realize
that?Any help will be appreciated!

<p>Introduction: Combining GPU power with PostgreSQLPostgreSQL is one of the world's leading
Open Source databases and it provides enormous flexibility as well as
extensibility. One of the key features of PostgreSQL is that users can define
their own procedures and functions in basically any known programming
language. With the means of functions it is possible to write basically any
server side codes easily.Now, all this extensibility is basically not new.
What does it all have to do with scaling and then? Well, imagine a world where
the data in your database and enormous computing power are tightly integrated.
Imagine a world where data inside your database has direct access to hundreds
of FPUs. Welcome to the world of CUDA, NVIDIA's way of making the power of
graphics cards available to normal, high-performance applications.When it
comes to complex computations databases might very well turn out to be a
bottleneck. Depending on your application it might easily happen that adding

<p>Introduction: On the surface nothing appears more different than soft data and hard raw
materials like iron. Then isn't itironic, in theAlanis Morissettesense, that
in this Age of Information, great wealth still lies hidden deep beneath piles
of stuff? It's so strange how directly digging for dollars in data parallels
the great wealth producing models of the Industrial Revolution.The piles of
stuff is the Internet. It takes lots of prospecting to find the right stuff.
Mighty web crawling machines tirelessly collect stuff, bringing it into their
huge maws, then depositing load after load into rack after rack of distributed
file system machines. Then armies of still other machines take this stuff and
strip out the valuable raw materials, which in the Information Age, are
endless bytes of raw data. Link clicks, likes, page views, content, head
lines, searches, inbound links, outbound links, search clicks, hashtags,
friends, purchases: anything and everything you do on the Internet is a

<p>Introduction: Think of building websites as engineeringcomposite materials. A composite
material is when two or more materials are combined to create a third material
that does something useful that the components couldn't do on their own.
Composites like reinforced concrete have revolutionized design and
construction. When building websites we usually bring different component
materials together, like creating a composite, to get the features we need
rather than building a completely new thing from scratch that does everything
we want.This approach has been seen as a hack because it leads to inelegancies
like data duplication; great gobs of component glue; consistency issues; and
messy operations. But what if the the composite approach is really a strength,
not a hack, but a messy part of the world that needs to be embraced rather
than belittled?They key is tosee data as a material. Right now we are arguing
which is the best single material to build with. Is itNoSQL, relational,
massively parallel,</p><p>5 0.76239377 <a title="817-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_30%2C_2013.html">1509 high scalability-2013-08-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 30, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scientists are doing it for themselves. Doing what? Databases. The idea is
that most databases are designed to meet the needs of businesses, not science,
so scientists are banding together atscidb.orgto create their own Domain
Specific Database, for science. The goal is to be able to handle datasets in
the 100PB range and larger.SciDB, Inc. is building an open source database
technology product designed specifically to satisfy the demands of data-
intensive scientific problems. With the advice of the world's leading
scientists across a variety of disciplines including astronomy, biology,
physics, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and climatology, our computer
scientists are currently designing and prototyping this technologyThe
scientists that are participating in our open source project believe that the
SciDB database -- when completed -- will dramatically impact their ability to
conduct their experiments faster and more efficiently and further improve the
quality of life on our pla</p><p>2 0.86365354 <a title="817-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-21-Paper%3A_Parallelizing_the_Web_Browser.html">660 high scalability-2009-07-21-Paper: Parallelizing the Web Browser</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There have been reports thatsoftware engineering is dead. Maybe, like the
future, software engineering is simply not evenly distributed? When you read
this paper I think you'll agree there is some real engineering going on, it's
just that most of the things we need to build do not require real engineering.
Much like my old childhood tree fort could be patched together and was "good
enough." This brings to mind the old joke: If a software tree falls in the
woods would anyone hear it fall? Only if it tweeted on the way down...What
this paper really showed me is we need not only to change programming
practices and constructs, but we also need to design solutions that allow for
deep parallelism to begin with. Grafting parallelism on later is difficult.
Parallel execution requires knowing precisely how components are dependent on
each other and that level of precision tends to go far beyond the human
attention span.In particular this paper deals with how to parallelize the

<p>Introduction: Hello! My first post here, so be patient please. I am developing site where I
have lots of static content. But on many pages I have query to update count of
views. I would say this is may cause lots of problems and was interested in
another solution like storing these counts somewhere else. As my knowledge is
bit limited in this way, I am asking you. I can say I understand PHP(OOP ofc)
and MySQL. Nowadays I am getting into servers.Other question I have is:I read
about making lots of things static.(in Flickr Architecture) and am interested
how they do static sites? Lets say they make photo page static? And rebuild
when tagg or comment is added? I am bit interested in it as I want to learn
Smarty better(newbie) and serving content.Moreover, how about PHP? I have read
many books about PHP theoretically but would love to see some RL example of
using objects and exceptions(mainly this as I don't completely understand it)
to learn some good programming habits. So if you can help me with some</p><p>4 0.83265191 <a title="817-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-07-Not_Invented_Here%3A_A_Comical_Series_on_Scalability_.html">1453 high scalability-2013-05-07-Not Invented Here: A Comical Series on Scalability </a></p>

<p>Introduction: I met the CodeFutures folks, makers ofdbShards, atGluecon. They occupy an
interesting niche in the database space, somewhere betweenNoSQL, which
jettisons everything SQL, and high end analytics platformsthat completely
rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.High concept: I think of
dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from HSCALE
(partitioning) +MySQL Proxy (transparent intermediate layer) +Memcached
(client side sharding) +Gigaspaces(parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).You
may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out
writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would
prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about
dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult
questions (not really).Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was
dbShards created to solve?I'm Cory Isaacson, CEO/CTO of CodeFutures
Corporation, the makers of dbShards. dbSha</p><p>6 0.80173123 <a title="817-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-08-Product%3A_DRBD_-_Distributed_Replicated_Block_Device.html">271 high scalability-2008-03-08-Product: DRBD - Distributed Replicated Block Device</a></p>

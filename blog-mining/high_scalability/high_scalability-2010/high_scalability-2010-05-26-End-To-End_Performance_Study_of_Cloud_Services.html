<p>Introduction: In a recent thread on Hacker News discussing  recent AWS price changes ,  seldo  mentioned they use AWS for business, they just never use EBS on AWS. A good question was asked:
  

How do you even do anything without using EBS?

  
Amazon certainly makes using EBS the easiest path. And EBS has a better reliability record as of late, but it's still often recommended to not use EBS. This avoids a single point of failure at the cost of a lot of complexity, though as AWS uses EBS internally, not using EBS may not save you if you use other AWS services like RDS or ELB.
 
If you don't want to use EBS, it's hard to know where to even start. A dilemma to which Kevin Nuckolls  gives a great answer :
  

Well, you break your services out onto stateless and stateful machines. After that, you make sure that each of your stateful services is resilient to individual node failure. I prefer to believe that if you can't roll your entire infrastructure over to new nodes monthly then you're unprepared fo</p><p>3 0.21042244 <a title="831-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-20-Product%3A_Amazon%27s_SimpleDB.html">498 high scalability-2009-01-20-Product: Amazon's SimpleDB</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by    Frédéric Faure    (architect at    Ysance   ), you can follow him on    twitter   . 
 
How do you scale an  AWS  (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure? This article will give you a detailed reply in two parts: the tools you can use to make the most of Amazon’s dynamic approach, and the architectural model you should adopt for a scalable infrastructure.
 
I base my report on my experience gained in several AWS production projects in casual gaming (Facebook), e-commerce infrastructures and within the mainstream GIS (Geographic Information System). It’s true that my experience in gaming ( IsCool, The Game ) is currently the most representative in terms of scalability, due to the number of users (over 800 thousand DAU – daily active users – at peak usage and over 20 million page views every day), however my experiences in e-commerce and GIS (currently underway) provide a different view of scalability, taking into account the various problems of availability and da</p><p>6 0.16164914 <a title="831-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-The_Search_for_the_Source_of_Data_-_How_SimpleDB_Differs_from_a_RDBMS.html">306 high scalability-2008-04-21-The Search for the Source of Data - How SimpleDB Differs from a RDBMS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Amazon created a whole new class of service with their  Provisioned IOPS  for RDS, EBS, and DynamoDB. The idea is simple. If you want more performance, you turn a dial up. If you want less, you turn a dial down. A beautifully simple model. You pay for the performance you want, which is different than their previous cloud model, where performance varied, but you paid only for what you used. 
 
The question: Do these higher priced services really work better?
 
 Rodrigo Campos  put this question to the test (only for EBS) by running a benchmark he describes in  IOMelt Provisioned IOPS EBS Benchmark Results - December 2012 .
 
The result?  Yes,   AWS Provisioned IOPS Volumes Really Deliver More Consistent and Higher Performance IO :
  

It is clear that the provisioned IOPS EBS volumes offer a huge performance upgrade when compared to the non-optimized EBS volumes, but as data has to be spread among more underlying disks or systems, it seems that the volume is increasingly more susceptibl</p><p>3 0.66486502 <a title="831-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-20-Product%3A_Amazon%27s_SimpleDB.html">498 high scalability-2009-01-20-Product: Amazon's SimpleDB</a></p>

   Ahead of the upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi’s recent    presentation    at an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few of my recent    Fluxcapacitor.com    consulting engagements, I’ve compiled a list of 10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS. 
    1) Query AWS resource metadata  
      
   Can’t remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?     awsnow.info    is the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.  Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You’re in luck.  There’s now a    REST API   , as well! 
   Note:  These are default soft limits and will vary by account. 
    2) Tame your S3 buckets  
       
   Delete an entire S3 bucket with a single CLI command:</p><p>6 0.62725407 <a title="831-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-26-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_October_26%2C_2012.html">1348 high scalability-2012-10-26-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For October 26, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL architecture."
 
 Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores Â overview:
  

Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture, transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or clock synchronization for this coordination.


This paper presents a novel protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could potentially yield a vio</p><p>2 0.95737267 <a title="831-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-16-Paper%3A_An_Experimental_Investigation_of_the_Akamai_Adaptive_Video_Streaming.html">991 high scalability-2011-02-16-Paper: An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how to make it work. Dan Rayburn  has a post  pointing to a fascinating paper:  An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming , which talks in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the Internet. For Akamai they found:
  
 Each video is encoded in five versions at different bit rates and stored in separate files. 
 The client sends commands to the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds.  
 Akamai uses only the video level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame rate of the video is kept constant. 
 When a sudden drop in the available bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to the a large actuation delay. 
  For a sudden increase of the avai</p><p>3 0.95359343 <a title="831-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-25-Should_JSPs_be_avoided_for_high_scalability%3F.html">131 high scalability-2007-10-25-Should JSPs be avoided for high scalability?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent applications. Furthermore,  over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are more likely to make a purchase after “liking” a brand they find online. ( source  ) 
 
Sears Architect Tomer Gabel provides an insightful overview on how they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:
  
 the architectural considerations behind their solution 
 why they chose memory over disk 
 how they partitioned the data to gain scalability 
 why they chose to execute code with the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution framework 
 how they integrated with Facebook 
 why they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-memory caching and scale

<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!, maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life environments.

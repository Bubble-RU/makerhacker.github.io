not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way, but in a smart way that gets the

<p>Introduction: With theGoogle IO Developer Conferencecompleted there aredozens and dozensof
information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty
free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos
available so quickly after the conference. Let's say you don't want to watch
all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen
scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:App

about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new

Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make
it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000
queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good
discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides when to spawn

<p>Introduction: Why isn't Google's aggressive new database pricing strategy getting more pub?
That's whatBill Katz, instigator of theGAE Meetupand prize winningscience
fiction authoris wondering:It's surprising that the blogosphere hasn't picked
up the biggest difference in pricing:Google's datastore is less than a tenth
of the price of Amazon's SimpleDB while offering a better API.If money matters
to you then the burn rate under GAE could be convincingly lower. Let's compare
the numbers:breakGAE pricing:* $0.10 - $0.12 per CPU core-hour* $0.15 - $0.18
per GB-month of storage* $0.11 - $0.13 per GB outgoing bandwidth* $0.09 -
$0.11 per GB incoming bandwidthSimpleDB Pricing:* $0.14 per Amazon SimpleDB
Machine Hour consumed* Structured Data Storage - $1.50 per GB-month* $0.100
per GB - all data transfer in* $0.170 per GB - first 10 TB / month data

competitive with Amazon. We may see a response by Amazon in the near feature,

yearly cost of the site was $1000. By changing those algorithms the site went

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's Tommy Reilly.  We
atNuoDBwere recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google
Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google
Developer Live Session by clickinghere.  In order to access the capabilities
of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General
Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we
demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our
private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million
transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that
NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don't call it a
cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the
faster the database</p><p>2 0.93694258 <a title="763-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-08-file_synchronization_solutions.html">488 high scalability-2009-01-08-file synchronization solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have two servers connected via Internet (NOT IN THE SAME LAN) serving the
same website (http://www.ourexample.com).The problem is files uploaded on
serverA and serverB cannot see each other immediately,thus rsync with certain
intervals is not a good solution.Can anybody give me some advice on the
following options?1.NFS over Internet for file sharing2.sshfs3.inotify(our
system's kernel does not support this and we donot want to risk upgrading our
kernel as well)4.drbd in active-active mode5 or any other solutionsAny
suggestions will be welcomed.Thank you in advance.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.92108345 <a title="763-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-22-How_BuddyPoke_Scales_on_Facebook_Using_Google_App_Engine.html">763 high scalability-2010-01-22-How BuddyPoke Scales on Facebook Using Google App Engine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you scale a viral Facebook app that has skyrocketed to a mind boggling
65 million installs (the population of France)? That's the fortunate
problemBuddyPokeco-founder Dave Westwood has and he talked about his solution
at Wednesday'sFacebook Meetup. Slides for the complete talk arehere. For those
not quite sure what BuddyPoke is, it's a social network application that lets
users show their mood, hug, kiss, and poke their friends through on-line
avatars.In many ways BuddyPoke is the quintessentially modern web application.
It thrives off the energy of social network driven ecosystems. Game play
mechanics, viral loops, and creative monetization strategies are all part of
if its everyday conceptualization. It mashes together different technologies,
not in a dark Frankensteining sort of way, but in a smart way that gets the
most bang for the buck. Part of it runs on Facebook servers (free). Part of it
runs on flash in a browser (free). Part of it runs on a storage cloud (higher
cost)</p><p>4 0.88308746 <a title="763-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-25-Stuff_to_Watch_from_Surge_2010.html">1047 high scalability-2011-05-25-Stuff to Watch from Surge 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Surgeis a conference put on by OmniTI targeting practical Scalability matters.
OmniTI specializes in helping people solve their scalability problems, as is
only natural, as it was founded by Theo Schlossnagle, author of the
canonicalScalable Internet Architectures. Now that Surge 2011 is on the
horizon, they've generously made available nearly all thevideos from the Surge
2010conference.  A pattern hopefully every conference will follow (only don't
wait a year please). We lose a lot of collective wisdom from events not being
available online in a timely manner.In truth, nearlyall the talksare on topic
and are worth watching, but here are a few that seem especially relevant:Going

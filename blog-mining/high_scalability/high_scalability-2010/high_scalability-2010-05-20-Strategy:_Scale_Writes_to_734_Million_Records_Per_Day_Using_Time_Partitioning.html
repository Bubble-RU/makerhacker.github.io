<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from
over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle
ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the greatMapReduce Versus Database War,
you would be correct.Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail
division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved
their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each
machine approach, to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just
couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that
works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability
potential.Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data
streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful
with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text
files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each
individual machine.

His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40
IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50
concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively

degradation in performance."Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:Database

<p>Introduction: In a great article, Amazon S3 Performance Tips & Tricks, Doug Grismore,
Director of Storage Operations for AWS, has outed the secret arcana normally
reserved for Premium Developer Support customers on how to really use S3:Size
matters. Workloads with less than 50-100 total requests per second don't
require any special effort. Customers that routinely perform thousands of
requests per second need a plan.Automated partitioning. Automated systems
scale S3 horizontally by continuously splitting data into partitions based on
high request rates and the number of keys in a partition (which leads to slow
lookups). Lessons you've learned with sharding may also apply to S3.   Avoid
hot spots. Like most sharding schemes, you want to avoid hot spots by the
smart selection of key names. S3 objects are stored inbuckets.  Each object is
identified using a key. Keys are kept in sorted order. Keys in S3 are
partitioned by prefix. Objects that sort together are stored together, so you
want to select key</p><p>5 0.67330885 <a title="829-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-30-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_April_30%2C_2010.html">819 high scalability-2010-04-30-Hot Scalability Links for April 30, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: Deployment with Capistrano  by Charles Max Wood.  Nice simple step-by-
step for using Capistrano for deployment.From their website:Simply
put,Capistranois a tool for automating tasks on one or more remote servers. It
executes commands in parallel on all targeted machines, and provides a
mechanism for rolling back changes across multiple machines. It is ideal for
anyone doing any kind of system administration, either professionally or
incidentally.* Great for automating tasks via SSH on remote servers, like
software installation, application deployment, configuration management, ad
hoc server monitoring, and more.* Ideal for system administrators, whether
professional or incidental.* Easy to customize. Its configuration files use
the Ruby programming language syntax, but you don't need to know Ruby to do
most things with Capistrano.* Easy to extend. Capistrano is written in the
Ruby programming language, and may be extended easily by writing additional
Ruby modules.breakOne of t</p><p>same-blog 2 0.92357278 <a title="829-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-20-Strategy%3A_Scale_Writes_to_734_Million_Records_Per_Day_Using_Time_Partitioning.html">829 high scalability-2010-05-20-Strategy: Scale Writes to 734 Million Records Per Day Using Time Partitioning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InScaling writes in MySQL (slides) Philip Tellis, while working for Yahoo,
describes how using time based partitions they were able to increase their
write capability from 2100 inserts per second (7 million a day) to a sustained
8500 inserts per second (734 million a day). This was capacity enough to
handle the load during Michael Jackson's memorial service. In summary, the
secrets to scalable writes are:Bulk inserts push up insert ratePartitioning
lets you insert more recordsPartition based on incoming data for fast
insertsPartitioning is a standard approach for handling high write loads
because it means data can be written to different hard disks in parallel. In
this example Phillip created a separate table for each day with each table
having it's own database file. Each table is partitioned on time, 12
partitions per day, 2 hours of data per partition. Huge log streams are often
handled this way. Other advantages of this approach: 1) fast drop table
operations 2) space for dropped t</p><p>3 0.92029697 <a title="829-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-25-Not_All_Regions_are_Created_Equal_-_South_America_Es_Bueno.html">1347 high scalability-2012-10-25-Not All Regions are Created Equal - South America Es Bueno</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rodrigo Camposshared some interesting benchmark resultsfor AWS instances in
the South America Region (Sao Paulo) and US East Region (North Virginia). He
summarized the results in this thread on theGuerrilla Capacity
Planninglist:The same instance type shows a different behavior depending on
the region that it is running, this is particularly critical if you depend on
multiple regions for disaster recovery or geographical load balancingGenerally
speaking performance is better and more consistent in the South America region
when compared to Virginia, this is probably due to the fact that SA region was
the latest to be deployed. Maybe the SA datacenter uses new server models or
it is just underutilized, but this is a wild guessWrite performance for the
medium instance type in Virginia abruptly decays, dropping from almost 400
call/s to something around 300 calls/s, this is not very clear in the scatter
plot but if you draw a time-based chart you can clearly see this pattern. This

<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct
business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time
improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology
has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure
content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web
content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads
technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a
compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise
T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads
technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun
Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage
of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with
CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable

<p>Introduction: Scalris a fully redundant, self-curing and self-scaling hosting environment
utilizing Amazon's EC2. It has been recently open sourced on Google Code.Scalr
allows you to create server farms through a web-based interface using prebuilt
AMI's for load balancers (pound or nginx), app servers (apache, others),
databases (mysql master-slave, others), and a generic AMI to build on top
of.Scalr promises automatic high-availability and scaling for developers by
health and load monitoring.The health of the farm is continuously monitored
and maintained. When the Load Average on a type of node goes above a
configurable threshold a new node is inserted into the farm to spread the load
and the cluster is reconfigured. When a node crashes a new machine of that
type is inserted into the farm to replace it.break4 AMI's are provided for
load balancers, mysql databases, application servers, and a generic base image
to customize. Scalr allows you to further customize each image, bundle the
image and use t</p><p>3 0.17937665 <a title="798-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-10-27-Strategy%3A_Survive_a_Comet_Strike_in_the_East_With_Reserved_Instances_in_the_West.html">1133 high scalability-2011-10-27-Strategy: Survive a Comet Strike in the East With Reserved Instances in the West</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ali Sadat ofMuleSoft gave interesting presentation at Saturday's Talk Cloudy
to Me! event about their experiences movingMule iON, their ESB (enterprise
service bus) product to the cloud.First, a little aboutTalk Cloudy to Me. This
event is the second one day cloud event put on by Sebastian Stadil, founder of
Scalr, as part of the Cloud Computing Meetup group, also created by Sebastian.
Sebastian has become a master at running these mini-conference style events.
Really a quality job by him and his dedicated crew. These events are free,
sponsored by various vendors; they are short, 11-5; the food is good, Thai;
the venue is nice, eBay; they are on topic, with cloud and other speakers
giving 30-45 minute talks.  More on the event when the video comes out. I type
as fast as I can but I can't do much without the video.Back to Ali Sadat.
While he gave a lot of lessons--the integration will your billing system will

<p>Introduction: The Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group had a meetup Wednesday onOpenStack,
whose tag line isthe open source, open standards cloud. I was shocked at the
large turnout. 287 people registered and it looked like a large percentage of
them actually showed up. I wonder, was it the gourmet pizza, the free
t-shirts, or are people really that interested in OpenStack? And if they are
really interested, why are they that interested? On the surface an open cloud
doesn't seem all that sexy a topic, but with contributions from NASA, from
Rackspace, and from a very avid user community, a lot of interest there seems
to be. The brief intro blurb to OpenStack is:OpenStack allows any organization
to create and offer cloud computing capabilities using open source software
running on standard hardware. OpenStack Compute is software for automatically
creating and managing large groups of virtual private servers. OpenStack
Storage is software for creating redundant, scalable object storage using
clusters o</p><p>5 0.1679365 <a title="798-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-27-Amazon_Announces_Static_IP_Addresses_and_Multiple_Datacenter_Operation.html">289 high scalability-2008-03-27-Amazon Announces Static IP Addresses and Multiple Datacenter Operation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and
single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can
finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in
an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly
DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we
don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is

better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight withJessica
Albaand they are:breakStatic IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud
computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a
particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to
explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however,

<p>Introduction: A man had a dream. His dream was to blend a bunch of RSS/Atom/RDF feeds into a
single feed. The man is Beau Lebens ofFeedvilleand like most dreamers he was a
little short on coin. So he took refuge in the home of a cheap hosting
provider and Beau realized his dream, creatingFEEDblendr. But FEEDblendr
chewed up so much CPU creating blended feeds that the cheap hosting provider
ordered Beau to find another home. Where was Beau to go? He eventually found a
new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how
Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of
affordable CPU cycles.Site: http://feedblendr.com/The PlatformEC2 (Fedora Core
6 Lite distro)S3ApachePHPMySQLDynDNS (for round robin DNS)The StatsBeau is a
developer with some sysadmin skills, not a web server admin, so a lot of
learning was involved in creating FEEDblendr.FEEDblendr uses 2 EC2 instances.

runsTripAdvisor's Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his
team this past summer. This post is introduced byAndy Gelfond, TripAdvisor's
head of engineering.It's been a little over a year since our last post about
theTripAdvisor architecture. It has been an exciting year. Our business and
team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have
continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown -
we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work
across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:56M visitors per
month350M+ pages requests a day120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large
Hadoop cluster, and quickly growingWe also had a very successful college

<p>Introduction: If you just want to visit Rome and not go full on Cloud Native like Netflix,
thenSoundslice'sAdrian HolovatyinWhy I left Heroku, and notes on my new AWS
setup provides a simple guide for helping make your first trip a good
one.First, let's dispose of why Soundslice left Heroku. The essence is because
of various issues "Heroku lost my trust." YMMV, but once a fact, what do you
do?After a consultation withScott VanDenPlas, former director of dev ops for
the Obama reelection tech team, they came up a simple transition guide that I
think is quite good and generally useful (full details in theoriginal post):
Bake an AMI. Install all the stuff you need on an AMI and use that as your
deployment unit. This works well for Netflix and for users who value a certain
sort of simplicity more than flexibility. There were a lot of comments saying
how it's better to use Chef/Puppet and configure instances on the fly, but
there's a confidence that only a baked image provides.Set up auto-scaling
rules. T</p><p>6 0.79430431 <a title="798-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-01-Peecho_Architecture_-_scalability_on_a_shoestring.html">1090 high scalability-2011-08-01-Peecho Architecture - scalability on a shoestring</a></p>

Istanbul.I loved the JPA 1.0 back in early 2000s. I started using it together
with EJB 3.0 even before the stable releases. I loved it so much that I
contributed bits and parts for JBoss 3.x implementations.Those were the days
our company was considerably still small in size. Creating new features and
applications were more priority than the performance, because there were a lot
of ideas that we have and we needed to develop and market those as fast as we
can. Now, we no longer needed to write tedious and error prone xml
descriptions for the data model and deployment descriptors. Nor we needed to
use the curse called "XDoclet".On the other side, our company grew steadily,
our web site has become the top portal in the country for live events and
ticketing. We now had the performance problems! Although the company grew
considerably, due to the economics in the industry, we did not make a lot of
money. The challenge we h</p><p>2 0.97336471 <a title="798-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-27-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_January_27%2C_2012.html">1182 high scalability-2012-01-27-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For January 27, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a part interview part guest with Sebastian Stadil, founder ofScalr, a
cheaper open-source version of RightScale. Scalr takes care of all the web
site infrastructure bits to on Amazon (and other clouds) so you don't have
to.I first met Sebastian at one of the original Silicon Valley Cloud Computing
Group meetups, a group which he founded. The meetings started in the tiny
offices of Intalio where Sebastian was working with this new fangled Amazon
thing to create an auto-scaling server farm on EC2. I remember distinctly how
Sebastian met everyone at the door with a handshake and a smile, making us all
feel welcome. Later I took one of the classes he created on how to use AWS. I
guess he figured all this cloud stuff was going somewhere and decided to start
Scalr.My only regret about this post is that the name Amazon does not begin
with the letter 'S', that would have made for an epic title.Getting to Know

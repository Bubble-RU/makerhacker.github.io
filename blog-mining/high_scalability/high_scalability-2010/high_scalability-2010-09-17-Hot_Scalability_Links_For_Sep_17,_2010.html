<p>Introduction: The BBC's iPlayer site averages 8 million page views a day for 1.3 million
users. Technical Architect Simon Frost describes how they scaled their site
inScaling the BBC iPlayer to handle demand:Use frameworks. Frameworks support
component based development which makes it convenient for team development,
but can introduce delays that have to be minimized. Zend/PHP is used because
it supports components and is easy to recruit for.  MySQL is used for program
metadata. CouchDB is used for key-value access for fast read/write of user-
focused data.Prove architecture before building it. Eliminate guesswork by
coming up with alternate architectures and create prototypes to determine
which option works best. Balance performance with factors like ease of
development.Cache a lot. Data is cached in memcached for a few seconds to
minutes. Short cache invalidation periods keep the data up to date for the
users, but even these short periods make a huge difference in performance.

<p>Introduction: Here's anUpdate On Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes
Python.How do you add realtime functionality to a web scale application?
That's whatAdam Hitchcock, a Software Engineer at Disqus talks about in an
excellent talk: Making DISQUS Realtime (slides).Disqus had to take their
commenting system and add realtime capabilities to it. Not something that's
easy to do when at the time of the talk (2013) they had had just hit a billion
unique visitors a month.What Disqus developed is a realtime commenting system
called "realertime" that was tested to handle 1.5 million concurrently
connected users, 45,000 new connections per second, 165,000 messages/second,
with less than .2 seconds latency end-to-end.The nature of a commenting system
is that it is IO bound and has a high fanout, that is a comment comes in and
must be sent out to a lot of readers. It's a problem very similar to
whatTwitter must solve. Disqus' solution was quite interesting as was the path
to their solution. The</p><p>4 0.12661257 <a title="903-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-26-Scaling_DISQUS_to_75_Million_Comments_and_17%2C000_RPS.html">928 high scalability-2010-10-26-Scaling DISQUS to 75 Million Comments and 17,000 RPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thispresentation andvideoby Jason Yan and David Cramer discusses how they
scaled DISQUS, a comments as a service service for easily adding comments to
your site and connecting communities. The presentation is very good, so here
are just a few highlights: Traffic: 17,000 requests/second peak; 450,000
websites; 15 million profiles; 75 million comments; 250 million visitors; 40
million monthly users / developer.Forces: unpredictable traffic patterns
because of celebrity gossip and events like disasters; discussion never expire
which means they can't fit in memory; must always be up.Machines: 100 servers;
30% web servers (Appache + mod_wsgi); 10% databases (PostgreSQL); 25% cache
servers (memcached); 20% load balancing / high availability (HAProxy +
heartbeat); 15% Utility servers (Python scripts).Architecture: Requests are
load balanced across an Apache cluster. Apache talks to memcached,
HAProxy/pgbouncer to handle connection pooling to the database, and a central
queue service. Strategi</p><p>5 0.1179364 <a title="903-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-22-Google_Architecture.html">448 high scalability-2008-11-22-Google Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:Sorting 1 PB with MapReduce. PB is not peanut-butter-and-jelly
misspelled. It's 1 petabyte or 1000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes.It took
six hours and two minutes to sort 1PB (10 trillion 100-byte records) on 4,000
computersand the results were replicated thrice on 48,000 disks.Update:Greg
Lindenpoints to a new Google articleMapReduce: simplified data processing on
large clusters. Some interesting stats: 100k MapReduce jobs are executed each
day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k
MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with
gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.Google is the King of scalability.
Everyone knows Google for their large, sophisticated, and fast searching, but
they don't just shine in search. Their platform approach to building scalable
applications allows them to roll out internet scale applications at an
alarmingly high competition crushing rate. Their goal is always to build a

<p>Introduction: In update toPrismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning on Social Networks
to Figure Out What You Should Read on the Web, Jason Wolfe, even in the face
of deadening fatigue from long nights spent getting their iPhone app out, has
gallantly agreed to talk a little more about Primatic's approach to Machine
Learning.Documents and users are two areas where Prismatic applies ML (machine
learning):ML on DocumentsGiven an HTML document: learn how to extract the main
text of the page (rather than the sidebar, footer, comments, etc), its title,
author, best images, etcdetermine features for relevance (e.g., what the
article is about, topics, etc.)The setup for most of these tasks is pretty
typical. Models are trained using big batch jobs on other machines that read
data from s3, save the learned parameter files to s3, and then read (and
periodically refresh) the models from s3 in the ingest pipeline.All of the
data that flows out of the system can be fed back into this pipeline, which

<p>Introduction: (Please bare with me, I'm a new, passionate, confident and terrified
programmer :D )Background:I'm pre-launch and 1 year into the development of my
application. My target is to be able to eventually handle millions of
registered users with 5-10% of them concurrent. Up to this point I've used
auto-increment to assign unique identifiers to rows. I am now considering
switching to a non-sequential strategy. Oh, I'm using the LAMP
configuration.My reasons for avoiding auto-increment:1. Complicates
replication when scaling horizontally. Risk of collision is significant (when
running multiple masters). Note: I've read the other entries in this forum
that relate to ID generation and there have been some great suggestions --
including a strategy that uses auto-increment in a way that avoids this
pitfall... That said, I'm still nervous about it.2. Potential bottleneck when
retrieving/assigning IDs -- IDs assigned at the database.My reasons for being
nervous about non-sequential IDs:1.

<p>Introduction: In Resolved: Widespread Application Outage, Herokutells their story of how
they dealt with theAmazon outage. While taking 100% responsibility for the
downtime, they also shared a number of the strategies they used to bring their
service back to full working order.One ofHeroku'smost interesting strategies
wasn't a technical hack at all, but how they consciously went about deploying
their Ops personnel in response to the emergency. An outline of their strategy
is: Monitoring systems immediately alerted Ops to the problem. An on-call
engineer applied triage logic to the problem and classified it as serious,
which caused the on-callIncident Commanderto be woken out of restful slumber.

<p>Introduction: Yes, I just got through watching the Superbowl so chips and salsa are on my
mind and in my stomach. In recreational eating more chips requires downing
more salsa. With mulitcore chips it turns out as cores go up salsa goes down,
salsa obviously being a metaphor for speed.Sandia National Laboratories found
in their simulations:a significant increase in speed going from two to four
multicores, but an insignificant increase from four to eight multicores.
Exceeding eight multicores causes a decrease in speed. Sixteen multicores
perform barely as well as two, and after that, a steep decline is registered
as more cores are added. The problem is the lack of memory bandwidth as well
as contention between processors over the memory bus available to each
processor.The implication for those following a diagonal scaling strategy is
to work like heck to make your system fit within eight multicores. After that
you'll need to consider some sort of partitioning strategy. What's interesting

<p>Introduction: A recentInfoWorld articleclaims that "With Cisco expected to enter the blade
market and Sun expected to offer networking equipment, things could get
interesting awfully fast." How does this effect your infrastructure strategy
and decisions?Would you consider to build scalable web applications on the
Cisco Unified Computing System? Or would you consider to build a router out of
a server with the use of OpenSolaris and Project Crossbow as the article
suggests? Will any of these initiatives change the way we build scalable web
infrastructure or are these just attempts to sale these systems?What do you
think?</p><p>5 0.10015105 <a title="939-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-12-Google_TechTalk%3A_Amdahl%27s_Law_in_the_Multicore_Era.html">534 high scalability-2009-03-12-Google TechTalk: Amdahl's Law in the Multicore Era</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally
successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips
with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these
successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to
multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are
reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we
are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be
squashed.To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a
corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer
2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use
symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to
work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore
designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core
efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtaining</p><p>6 0.084465563 <a title="939-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-27-Big_Data_In_the_Cloud_Using_Cloudify.html">1216 high scalability-2012-03-27-Big Data In the Cloud Using Cloudify</a></p>

<p>Introduction: My apologies if you were looking for a post about cell phones. This post is
about high density nanodevices. It's a follow up toHow will memristors change
everything? for those wishing to pursue these revolutionary ideas in more
depth. This is one of those areas where if you are in the space then there's a
lot of available information and if you are on the outside then it doesn't
even seem to exist. Fortunately, Ben Chandler from The SyNAPSE Project, was
kind enough to point me to a great set of presentations given at the12th IEEE
CNNA - International Workshop on Cellular Nanoscale Networks and their
Applications- Towards Megaprocessor Computing. WARNING: these papers contain
extreme technical content. If you are like me and you aren't an electrical
engineer, much of it may make a sort of surface sense, but the deep and twisty
details will fly over head. For the more software minded there are a couple
more accessible presentations:Intelligent Machines built with Memristive

<p>Introduction: In some ways the original Amazon cloud, the one most of us still live in, was
like that really cool house that when you stepped inside and saw the oldgreen
shag carpetin the living room, you knew the house hadn't been updated in a
while. The network is a little slow, the processors are a bit dated, and
virtualization made the house just feel smaller. It has been difficult to run
high bandwidth or low latency workloads in the cloud. Bottlenecks everywhere.
Not a big deal for most applications, but for many high performance
applications (HPC) it was a killer.In a typical house you might just do a
remodel. Upgrade a few rooms. Swap out builder quality appliances with
gleaming stainless steel monsters. But Amazon has a big lot, instead of
remodeling they simply keep adding on entire new wings, kind of like the

<p>Introduction: In the past year, Intel issued a series of powerful chips under the new
Nehalem microarchitecture, with large numbers of cores and extensive memory
capacity. This new class of chips is is part of a bigger Intel initiative
referred to as Tera-Scale Computing. Cisco has released their Unified
Computing System (UCS) equipped with a unique extended memory and high speed
network within the box, which is specifically geared to take advantage of this
type of CPU architecture .This new class of hardware has the potential to
revolutionize the IT landscape as we know it.In  this post, I want to focus
primarily on the potential implications on application architecture, more
specifically on the application platform landscape.  more...</p><p>3 0.82018203 <a title="939-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-19-How_to_measure_memory_required_for_a_user_session.html">472 high scalability-2008-12-19-How to measure memory required for a user session</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind. Warning #2: this post is wild.Kevin KellyKevin Kelly is Senior
Maverick at Wired magazine. He helped launch Wired in 1993, and served as its
Executive Editor until January 1999. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers'
Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online
service started in 1985. He authored the best-sellingNew Rules for the New

<p>Introduction: Update 2:Presentation from theNoSQL conference:slides,video.Update:Why you
won't be building your killer app on a distributed hash tableby Jonathan
Ellis.Why I think Cassandra is the most promising of the open-source
distributed databases --you get a relatively rich data model and a
distribution model that supports efficient range queries. These are not things
that can be grafted on top of a simpler DHT foundation, so Cassandra will be
useful for a wider variety of applications.James Hamilton has published a
thorough summary of Facebook's Cassandra, another scalable key-value store for
your perusal. It's open source and is described as a "BigTable data model
running on a Dynamo-like infrastructure." Cassandra is used in Facebook as an
email search system containing 25TB and over 100m mailboxes.Google Code for

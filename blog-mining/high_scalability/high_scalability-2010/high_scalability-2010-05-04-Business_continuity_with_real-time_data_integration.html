<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000 or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.
 
This post focuses on a customer’s backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services and annual support?

<p>Introduction: Many enterprises' high-availability architecture is based on the assumption that you can prevent failure from happening by putting all your critical data in a centralized database, back it up with expensive storage, and replicate it somehow between the sites. As I argued in one of my previous posts ( Why Existing Databases (RAC) are So Breakable! ) many of those assumptions are broken at their core, as storage is doomed to failure just like any other device, expensive hardware doesn’t make things any better and database replication is often not enough.
 
One of the main lessons that we can take from the likes of Amazon and Google is that the right way to ensure continuous high availability is by designing our system to cope with failure. We need to assume that what we tend to think of as unthinkable will probably happen, as that’s the nature of failure. So rather than trying to prevent failures, we need to build a system that will tolerate them.

<p>Introduction: A series of recent surveys on the subject seems to indicate that this is  indeed the case:
 
 Research  conducted by HP   found that the majority of businesses in the EMEA region  are planning to move their mission-critical apps to the cloud. Of the 940  respondents, 80 percent revealed plans to move mission-critical apps at some  point over the next two to five years.
 
A more recent  survey, by research firm  MeriTalk   and sponsored by VMware and EMC (NYSE: EMC  ), showed that one-third of respondents say they plan to  move some mission-critical applications to the cloud in the next year. Within  two years, the IT managers said they will move 26 percent of their  mission-critical apps to the cloud, and in five years, they expect 44 percent of  their mission-critical apps to run in the cloud.

<p>Introduction: The need for IT consolidation is most evident in two types of organizations. In the first group, IT grew organically with business over the decades, and survived changes of strategy, management, staff and vendor orientation. The second group of businesses capital groups are characterized by rapid growth through acquisitions (followed by attempts to integrate radically different IT environments). In both groups, their IT infrastructures have typically been pieced together over the past 20 (or more) years.ďťż

<p>Introduction: It's time to think of the architecture and application platforms surrounding "Big Data" databases. Big Data is often centered  around new database technologies mostly from the emerging NoSQL world.  The main challenge that these databases solve is how to handle massive amount of data at a reasonable cost and without poor performanc - distributed databases emerged to address this challenge and today we're seeing  high adoption rate   and quite impressive success stories such as the  Netflix use of Cassandra/DataStax solution  .  All that indicate the speed in which this market evolves.
 
  The need for a Big Data Application Platform  
 
Application platforms provide a framework for making the development of applications simpler. They do this by carving out the generic parts of applications such as security, scalability, and reliability (which  are  attributes of a 'good' application) from the parts of the applications that are specific to our business domain.

<p>Introduction: Enterprises want to protect their data.   As the appetite for data volumes grows, storage technology becomes a critical business asset on which business continuity relies.  My recent survey in the medium-size enterprise segment shows the five dominant investment directions at the level of data management architecture: disaster recovery (DR), high availability (HA), backup, data processing performance and migration to more advanced databases.﻿
   
  This suggests that corporations generally have sufficiently structured data collections but are concerned with business continuity and continuous availability of data. What infrastructures can provide these assurances? In this post I want to focus on yet another option, and that is the Real-Time Data Integration model. As an example I am going to discuss Oracle GoldenGate, which permits you to manage the data critical to your business in safety, ensuring business continuity without disruption even if the data is distributed among multiple, h</p><p>2 0.87842864 <a title="822-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-How_to_Scale_with_Ruby_on_Rails.html">389 high scalability-2008-09-23-How to Scale with Ruby on Rails</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By George Palmer of 3dogsbark.com. Covers:   * How you start out: shared hosting,  web server DB on same machine. Move two 2 machines. Minimal code changes.   * Scaling the database. Add read slaves on their own machines. Then master-master setup. Still minimal code changes.   * Scaling the web server. Load balance against multiple application servers. Application servers scale but the database doesn't.   * User clusters. Partition and allocate users to their own dedicated cluster. Requires substantial code changes.   * Caching. A large percentage of hits are read only. Use reverse proxy, memcached, and language specific cache.   * Elastic architectures. Based on Amazon EC2. Start and stop instances on demand. For global applications keep a cache on each continent, assign users to clusters by location, maintain app servers on each continent, use transaction replication software if you must replicate your site globally.</p><p>3 0.87563485 <a title="822-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-07-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_7%2C_2013.html">1472 high scalability-2013-06-07-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 7, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Much of the focus of high performance computing (HPC) has centered on CPU performance. However, as computing requirements grow, HPC clusters are demanding higher rates of aggregate data throughput. Today's clusters feature larger numbers of nodes with increased compute speeds. The higher clock rates and operations per clock cycle create increased demand for local data on each node. In addition, InfiniBand and other high-speed, low-latency interconnects increase the data throughput available to each node.     Traditional shared file systems such as NFS have not been able to scale to meet this growing demand for data throughput on HPC clusters. Scalable cluster file systems that can provide parallel data access to hundreds of nodes and petabytes of storage are needed to provide the high data throughput required by large HPC applications, including manufacturing, electronic design, and research.     This paper describes an implementation of the Sun Lustre file system as a scalable storage</p><p>5 0.87417948 <a title="822-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Web_Consolidation_on_the_Sun_Fire_T1000_using_Solaris_Containers__.html">458 high scalability-2008-12-01-Web Consolidation on the Sun Fire T1000 using Solaris Containers  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Reducing the costs of IT infrastructure and improving the manageability and efficiency of web services pose significant challenges for many organizations in today's economic climate. Recent studies describe the challenges IT managers face administering the proliferation of x86-based servers used to run web services applications. Those reports reveal that using large number of x86-based systems can increase space and power consumption, as well as cost and asset management overhead. In addition, many of these x86-based systems run a mixture of operating system and application software leading to increased management complexity and potential security concerns.     Faced with these challenges, many organizations are attracted by the idea of consolidating web and application services from multiple x86-based servers to a smaller number of high-performance servers. This approach strives to help simplify management, improve performance, and increase the efficiency of delivering web services.

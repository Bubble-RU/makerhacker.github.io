<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steffen Konerow, author of theHigh Performance
Blog.Learning how to scale isn't easy without any prior experience. Nowadays
you have plenty of websites likehighscalability.comto get some inspiration,
but unfortunately there is no solution that fits all websites and needs. You
still have to think on your own to find a concept that works for your
requirements. So did I.A few years ago, my bosses came to me and said "We've
got a new project for you. It's the relaunch of a website that has already 1
million users a month. You have to build the website and make sure we'll be
able to grow afterwards". I was already an experienced coder, but not in these
dimensions, so I had to start learning how to scale - the hard way.The
software behind the website was a PHP content management system, based on
Smarty and MySQL. The first task was finding a proper hosting company who had
the experience and would also manage the servers for us. After some research
we found one, told t</p><p>3 0.21363761 <a title="898-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-17-7_Lessons_Learned_While_Building_Reddit_to_270_Million_Page_Views_a_Month.html">828 high scalability-2010-05-17-7 Lessons Learned While Building Reddit to 270 Million Page Views a Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Huffman, co-founder of social news site Reddit, gave an
excellentpresentation (slides,transcript) on the lessons he learned while
building and growing Reddit to 7.5 million users per month, 270 million page
views per month, and 20+ database servers.Steve says a lot of the lessons were
really obvious, so you may not find a lot of completely new ideas in the
presentation. But Steve has an earnestness and genuineness about him that is
so obviously grounded in experience that you can't help but think deeply about
what you could be doing different. And if Steve didn't know about these
lessons, I'm betting others don't either.There are seven lessons, each has
their own summary section: Lesson one: Crash Often; Lesson 2: Separation of
Services; Lesson 3: Open Schema; Lesson 4: Keep it Stateless; Lesson 5:
Memcache; Lesson 6: Store Redundant Data; Lesson 7: Work Offline.By far the
most surprising feature of their architecture is in Lesson Six, whose
essential idea is: The key to speed is</p><p>4 0.19930054 <a title="898-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-08-4_General_Core_Scalability_Patterns.html">897 high scalability-2010-09-08-4 General Core Scalability Patterns</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund put together an excellent list of four general scalability
patterns and four subpatterns in his postScalability patterns and an
interesting story:Load distribution- Spread the system load across multiple
processing unitsLoad balancing / load sharing- Spreading the load across many
components with equal properties for handling the requestPartitioning-
Spreading the load across many components by routing an individual request to
a component that owns that data specificVertical partitioning- Spreading the
load across the functional boundaries of a problem space, separate functions
being handled by different processing unitsHorizontal partitioning- Spreading
a single type of data element across many instances, according to some
partitioning key, e.g. hashing the player id and doing a modulus operation,
etc. Quite often referred to as sharding.Queuing and batch \- Achieve
efficiencies of scale by processing batches of data, usually because the
overhead of an operation is am</p><p>5 0.11943579 <a title="898-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-22-Applying_Scalability_Patterns_to_Infrastructure_Architecture.html">906 high scalability-2010-09-22-Applying Scalability Patterns to Infrastructure Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application
delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to
addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application
delivery tier of the data center. By Lori Mac Vittie, F5 Networks The "High
Scalability" blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not
disappoint with a posthighlighting a set of scalability design patternsthat
was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on "6 Ways to
Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way." Credit:Michael
Chow/azcentral.com  This particular post caught my attention primarily because
although I've touched on many of these patterns in the past, I've never
thought to call them what they are: scalability patterns. That's probably a
side-effect of forgetting thatbuilding an architecture of any kind is at its
core computer scienceand thus algorithms and design patterns are applicable to

<p>Introduction: Disqus - Scaling the Worlds Largest Django App. Interesting overview of a
commenting system with 75 million comments and 250 million visitors. Lots of
good details on how they partition their database, testing, continuous
integration, feature switches, caching, delayed signals, and more.Things I
learnt tracking a billion events in 24 hours: Know your host, Scaling isn't
just servers, My servers need to talk to me more, Kill switches for users,
What you don't know is the problem, Don't mix server roles, Know your most
important users outside of your site.Tweets of Gold:georgebarnett: I read High

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>5 0.60669768 <a title="898-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-22-The_high_scalability_community.html">220 high scalability-2008-01-22-The high scalability community</a></p>

architecture. For us building high scalability solutions from the west coast
of (tiny) Norway good input on the subject isn't always abundant.Which leads
me to my next question; Are there any events or conferences on high
scalability / SaaS in the US or internationally that any of you would
recommend architects or data center managers to attend?</p><p>6 0.60359722 <a title="898-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-25-Stuff_to_Watch_from_Surge_2010.html">1047 high scalability-2011-05-25-Stuff to Watch from Surge 2010</a></p>

if we could hear its inner workings. Ives uses a lot of riotously competing
rhythms in this work. It can sound discordant, yet the effect is deeply
layered and eventually harmonious, just like the systems we use, create, and
become part of.I was pointed to this piece by someone who said there were two
conductors. I'd never heard of such a thing! So I was intrigued. The first
version of the performance sounds and looks great, but it unfortunately does
not use two conductors. The second version uses two conductors, but is
unfortunately just a snippet.It's strikingly odd to see two conductors, but I
imagine different parts of our systems using different conductors too, running
at different rhythms, sometimes slow, sometimes fast, sometimes there are
outbursts, sometimes in vicious conflict. Yet conceptually it all stills seems
to hang tog</p><p>same-blog 2 0.85127032 <a title="898-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-09-6_Scalability_Lessons.html">898 high scalability-2010-09-09-6 Scalability Lessons</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund not only put together a few interesting scalability patterns,
he also came up with a few interesting scalability lessons:Lesson #1. Put
Smarty compile and template caches on an active-active DRBD cluster with high
load and your servers will DIE!Lesson #2. Don't use out-of-the-box
configurations.Lesson #3. Single points of contention will eventually become a
bottleneck.Lesson #4. Plan in advance. Lesson #5. Offload your databases as
much as possible.Lesson #6. File systems matter and can run out of space /
inodes.For more details and explanations see the original post.</p><p>3 0.73588371 <a title="898-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-03-MapReduce_framework_Disco.html">376 high scalability-2008-09-03-MapReduce framework Disco</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Discois an open-source implementation of the MapReduce framework for
distributed computing. It was started atNokia Research Centeras a lightweight
framework for rapid scripting of distributed data processing tasks. The Disco
core is written in Erlang. The MapReduce jobs in Disco are natively described
as Python programs, which makes it possible to express complex algorithmic and
data processing tasks often only in tens of lines of code.</p><p>4 0.70127952 <a title="898-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_8th%2C_2013.html">1545 high scalability-2013-11-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 8th, 2013</a></p>

data storage engineRiakis anothernew and interesting key-value storeentrant.
Some of the features it offers are:Document-orientedScalable, decentralized
key-value storeStandard get, put, and delete operations. Distributed, fault-
tolerant storage solution.Configurable levels of consistency, availability,
and partition toleranceSupport for Erlang, Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Java,
Python, HTTP open source and NoSQLPluggable backendsEventing
systemMonitoringInter-cluster replicationLinks between records that can be
traversed.Map/Reduce. Functions are executed on the data node. One interesting
difference is that a list keys are required to specify which values are
operated on as apposed to running calculations on all values. Related

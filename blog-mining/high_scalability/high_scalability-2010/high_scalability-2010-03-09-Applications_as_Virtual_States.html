<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.There's a pattern,
already begun, that has accelerated by the need for applications to scale and
increase complexity, the end result of which will be that applications give up
their independence and enter a kind offeudal relationshipwith their platform
provider.To understand how this process works, like a glacier slowly and
inevitably carving out a deep river valley, here's the type of question I get
quite a lot:I've learned PHP and MySQL and I've built a web app that I HOPE
will receive traffic comparable to eBay's with a similar database structure. I
see all these different opinions and different techniques and languages being
recommended and it's so confusing. All I want is perhaps one book or one
website that focuses on PHP and MySQL and building a large database web app
like eBay's. Does something like this exist?I'm always at a loss for words

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.As I was writingan
articleon the architecture of theStorm Botnet, I couldn't help but notice the
deep similarity of how Storm works and changes we're seeing in the evolution
of political systems. In particular, the rise of thevirtual-state. As crazy as
this may sound, I think this is also the direction applications will need
follow to survive in a complex world of billions of compute devices.You may
have already heard ofvirtual corporations. Virtual corporations are companies
with limited office space, a distributed workforce, and production facilities
located wherever it is profitable to locate them. The idea is to stay lean and
compete using therapid development and introduction of new products into high
value-added markets. If you spot a market opportunity with a small time
window, building your own factories and hiring and engineering team simply

help warm, here are some hot links to read by a digital flame: Using MySQL as

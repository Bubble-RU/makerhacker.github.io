<p>Introduction: Update:Good Vibrationsby Radovan SemanÄ?ik. Lot's of interesting questions
about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.Google
Waveis a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML
documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency
updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new,
convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users ofGoogle
Waveand we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open
platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and
become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to
"federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google
Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and
collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation
Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.Hereare

<p>Introduction: A bit over a month ago Amazon experienced its infamous AWS outage in the US
East Region. As a cloud evangelist, I was intrigued by the history of the
outage as it occurred. There were great posts during and after the outage from
those who went down. But more interestingly for me as architect were the
detailed posts of those who managed to survive the outage relatively unharmed,
such as SimpleGeo, Netflix,SmugMug, SmugMug's CTO, Twilio, Bizo and
others.Reading through the experience of others, I tried to summarize
thepatterns, principles and best practicesthat emerged from these posts, as I
believe we can learn a lot from them on how to design our business
applications to truly leverage on the benefits that the cloud offers in high
availability and scalability.The main principles, patterns and best practices
are:Design for failureStateless and autonomous servicesRedundant hot copies

<p>Introduction: Recently I attended a lecture presented by Manik Surtani , JBoss Cache &
Infinispan project lead. The goal of the talk was to provide a technical
overview of both products and outline Infinispan's road-map. Infinispan is the
successor to the open-source JBoss Cache. JBoss Cache was originally targeted
at simple web page caching and Infinispan builds on this to take it into the
Cloud paradigm.Why did I attend? Well, over the past few years I have worked
on projects that have used commercial distributed caching (aka data grid)
technologies such as GemFire, GigaSpaces XAP or Oracle Coherence . These
projects required more functionality than is currently provided by open-source
solutions such as memcached or EHCache. Looking at the road-map for
Infinispan, I was struck by its ambition - will it provide the functionality
that I need?Read more at:http://bigdatamatters.com/bigdatamatters/2009/09

<p>Introduction: SummaryIn this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing
stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services
application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out
model.BioNati Shalom is the CTO and Founder ofGigaSpacesand responsible for
the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed
technology and architecture namely CORBA, Jini, J2EE, Grid and SOA. Nati is

Carriage presentation has come up with a NoSQL taxonomy that thankfully
focuses a little more on what NoSQL is, thanwhat it
isn't:key‐value‐cachememcached, repcached, coherence, infinispan, eXtreme
scale, jboss cache, velocity, terracoqa key‐value‐storekeyspace, flare,

asks. He answers:  the most approachable API with enough power will win.

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>5 0.43875611 <a title="843-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere_Commerce_High_Availability_and_Performance_Configurations.html">321 high scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere Commerce High Availability and Performance Configurations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nobody came up with an example of a website powered by a Websphere product
(which has a community edition) and backed up by a DB2 database.I guess you
all know about usopen.org so here's the story:breakWhile the re-emergence of
35-year-old Andre Agassi and the continued dominance of wunderkind Maria
Sharapova have highlighted the on-court headlines at this year's U.S. Open
Tennis Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., IBM is hoping its new Power5
chip-based IT support for USOpen.org can make news among those more interested
in .NET than tennis nets.Big Blue has partnered with the U.S. Tennis
Association and the U.S. Open -- the most prestigious tennis tournament in the
U.S. -- since 1992. Together, they launched USOpen.org in 1995 so racket heads
could follow the matches online.The iSeries' role this year is in powering a
Web-based end-user application called "Point Tracker," a graphics tool using
autonomic technology that recreates the trajectory of every shot. On-court

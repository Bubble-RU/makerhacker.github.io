</p><p>8 These data storage systems have a number of features in common:• a call level interface (in contrast to a SQL binding)• fast indexes on large amounts of data,• ability to horizontally scale throughput over many servers, and• ability to dynamically define attributes or data schema.

vs. DBMS Benchmarks.Although the process to load data into and tune the
execution of parallel DBMSs took much longer than the MR system, the observed
performance of these DBMSs was strikingly better.Update 2:H-Store: A Next

goal of the H-Store project is to investigate how these architectural and
application shifts affect the performance of OLTP databases, and to study what
performance benefits would be possible with a complete redesign of OLTP
systems in light of these trends. Our early results show that a simple
prototype built from scratch using modern assumptions can outperform current
commercial DBMS offerings by around a factor of 80 on OLTP workloads.Update:

<p>Introduction: It's a truism that we should choose theright tool for the job. Everyone says
that. And who can disagree? The problem is this is not helpful advice without
being able to answer more specific questions like: What jobs are the tools
good at? Will they work on jobs like mine? Is it worth the risk to try
something new when all my people know something else and we have a deadline to
meet? How can I make all the tools work together?In the NoSQL space this kind
of real-world data is still a bit vague. When asked, vendors tend to give very
general answers like NoSQL is good for BigData or key-value access. What does
that mean for for the developer in the trenches faced with the task of solving
a specific problem and there are a dozen confusing choices and no obvious
winner? Not a lot. It's often hard to take that next step and imagine how
their specific problems could be solved in a way that's worth taking the
trouble and risk.Let's change that. What problems are you using NoSQL to
solve? Which</p><p>4 0.13605155 <a title="784-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-13-Paper%3A_NoSQL_Databases_-_NoSQL_Introduction_and_Overview.html">1022 high scalability-2011-04-13-Paper: NoSQL Databases - NoSQL Introduction and Overview</a></p>

120+ page paper titledNoSQL Databases as an introduction and overview to NoSQL
databases . The paper was written between 2010-06 and 2011-02, so it may be a
bit out of date, but if you are looking to take in the NoSQL world in one big
gulp, this is your chance. I asked Christof to give us a  short taste of what
he was trying to accomplish in his paper:The paper aims at giving a systematic
and thorough introduction and overview of the NoSQL field by assembling
information dispersed among blogs, wikis and scientific papers. It firstly
discusses reasons, rationales and motives for the development and usage of
nonrelational database systems. These can be summarized by the need for high
scalability, the processing of large amounts of data, the ability to
distribute data among many (often commodity) servers, consequently a

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: Digg has been researching ways to scale our database infrastructure for some
time now. We've adopted a traditional vertically partitioned master-slave
configuration with MySQL, and also investigated sharding MySQL with IDDB.
Ultimately, these solutions left us wanting. In the case of the traditional
architecture, the lack of redundancy on the write masters is painful, and both
approaches have significant management overhead to keep running.Since it was
already necessary to abandon data normalization and consistency to make these
approaches work, we felt comfortable looking at more exotic, non-relational
data stores. After considering HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, Tokyo
Cabinet/Tyrant, Voldemort, and Dynomite, we settled on Cassandra.Each system
has its own strengths and weaknesses, but Cassandra has a good blend of
everything. It offers column-oriented data storage, so you have a bit more
structure than plain key/value stores. It operates in a distributed, highly
available, peer-to-pee</p><p>4 0.77141935 <a title="784-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-16-Paper%3A_Warp%3A_Multi-Key_Transactions_for_Key-Value_Stores.html">1459 high scalability-2013-05-16-Paper: Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>5 0.7661652 <a title="784-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-06-NoSQL_Pain%3F_Learn_How_to_Read-write_Scale_Without_a_Complete_Re-write.html">1054 high scalability-2011-06-06-NoSQL Pain?

<p>Introduction: Lately I've been reading more cases were different people have started to
realize the limitations of the NoSQL promise to database scalability. Note the
references below:Why does Quora use MySQL as the data store instead of NoSQLs
such as Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB etc?Why did Diaspora abandon MongoDB for
MySQL?How scalable is CouchDB in practice, not just in theory?Take MongoDB for
example. It's damn fast, but it doesn't really know how to save data reliably
to disk. I've had it set up in a replica pair to mitigate that risk. Guess
what - both servers in the pair failed and corrupted their data files at the
same day.It appears that for many, the switch to NoSQL can be rather painful.
IMO that doesn't necessarily mean that NoSQL is wrong in general, but it's a

<p>Introduction: If you are a startup you may find useful Guy Kawasaki's postFinancial Models
for Underachievers: Two Years of the Real Numbers of a Startup. Part of any
business plan are the projected guestimates. They are guestimates because
everyone keeps these numbers hidden like a Swiss bank account. But notRedfin.
They've bravely shared their initial cost projections, their actual numbers
from real life, and the lessons they've learned from the discrepancy between
the two...breakYou can find their model estimates and actuals for Rent, Per
Employee, Per Month (model: $250, actual: $336); Initial Per-Employee
Equipment Cost; Monthly Benefits, Per-Employee; Annual Payroll Tax; Quarterly
Bonus Payout, as a % of the Total Possible; Annual Payroll Increase for
Existing Employees; All-Company Meeting Cost, Per-Meeting, Per-Employee;
Annual Accounting Costs, and a few more.There is also a great lessons section:

nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers
hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of

<p>Introduction: Yahoo has developed a new language called Pig Latin that fit in a sweet spot
between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level,
procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.The
accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into
physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce
implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined
Hadoop as a subproject.The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo!
are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and
execution of their data analysis tasks, compared tousing Hadoop
directly.References:Apache Pig Wiki</p><p>4 0.98695612 <a title="784-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-05-Shutterfly_Saw_a_Speedup_of_500%25_With_Flashcache.html">1169 high scalability-2012-01-05-Shutterfly Saw a Speedup of 500% With Flashcache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the "should I or shouldn't I" debate around deploying SSD, it always helps
to have real-world data. Fiesta! with alive-blog summary of a presentation by
Kenny Gorman onShutterfly on MongoDB Performance Tuning.What if you still need
more performance after doing all of this tuning? One option is to use SSDs.
Shutterfly usesFacebook's flashcache: kernel module to cache data on SSD.
Designed for MySQL/InnoDB. SSD in front of a disk, but exposed as a single
mount point. This only makes sense when you have lots of physical I/O.
Shutterfly saw a speedup of 500% w/ flashcache. A benefit is that you can
delay sharding: less complexity.The wholeseries of posts has a lot of great
information and is worth a longer look, especially if you are considering
using MongoDB. Related ArticlesSlides forMongoSF 2011 slides: MongoDB

<p>Introduction: Hi,we've got a web application, which runs without the common standalone
application servers like tomcat or jboss, rather it runs with an embedded
jetty server. Now we are planing to run instances of this application on
multiple machines, with a load balancer serving the requests.The big question
is: is there a common scenario on how to update these applications? Lets think
of 10 instances on 10 machines (one instance per machine), where we want to
update each of these applications version. The brute force approach would be,
to stop all instances, update and then restart it. This is a lot of manual
work ;) Another problem is down-time: so someone must only shutdown one server
after another, but then there are multiple application versions around.Can
someone please provide us with a hint for this problem? Perhaps papers, tools
or something like that?Thanks a lot :)</p><p>6 0.98550612 <a title="784-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-05-10_Golden_Principles_For_Building_Successful_Mobile-Web_Applications.html">1277 high scalability-2012-07-05-10 Golden Principles For Building Successful Mobile-Web Applications</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Two forces account for the trend of moving behavior to data: larger values
used in key-value stores and spotty cloud networks. For some time we've seen
functions pushed close to data with MapReduce, which is a batch process, but
we are now seeing this model extend to interactive applications, which match
the current emphasis on highly scalable, real-time, event driven
applications.To see the trend look at the increasing support for collocated
behavior at the datastore level:HBase is implementing a coprocessor
feature.Cassandra is also implementing coprocessors or plugins.Membase is
creatingNodeCode, which is a process for executing functions on data in the
database.MongoDB supportsJavaScript stored procedures. VoltDB hasJava based
stored procedures.In-memory DataGridproducts like GigaSpaces have been doing

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation
from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?
Mike Stonebraker, the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world,
hopes you get something like his new database,VoltDB: a pure SQL, pure ACID,
pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory
DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a
second. VoltDBclaims to be100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster
thanCassandra, and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.Will
VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of
ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product
with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component
in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...I first heard the
details about VoltDB at Gluecon, where Mr. Stonebraker presented his highly

<p>Introduction: This is an interview withMemSQLcofounder'sEric FrenkielandNikita Shamgunov, in
which they try to answer critics by going into more depth about their
technology.MemSQL ruffled a few feathers with their claim of being the fastest
database in the world. According to their benchmarks MemSQL can execute 200K
TPS on an EC2QuadrupleExtra Largeand on a 64 core machine they can push 1.2
million transactions a second.Benchmarks are always a dark mirror, so make of
them what you will, but the target market for MemSQL is clear: projects
looking for something both fast and familiar. Fast as in a novel design using
a combination of technologies likeMVCC, code generation,lock-free data
structures,skip lists, andin-memory execution. Familiar as in SQL and nothing
but SQL. The only interface to MemSQL is SQL.It's right to point out MemSQL
gets a boost by being a first release. Only a limited subset of SQL is
supported, neither replication or sharding are implemented yet, and writes

<p>Introduction: Joe Stump, Lead Architect at Digg, gavethis presentationat the Web 2.0 Expo. I
couldn't find the actual presentation, but fortunatelyKris Jordantook some
great notes. That's how key moments in history are accidentally captured
forever. Joe was also kind enough to respond to my email questions with a
phone call.In this first part of the post Joe shares some timeless wisdom that
you may or may not have read before. I of course take some pains to extract
all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules. What
really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDBWill be the biggest new
kid on the block in scaling. MemcacheDB has been around for a little while and
I've never thought of it in that way. Well learn why Joe is so excited by
MemcacheDB at the end of the post.Impressive Stats80th-100th largest site in

<p>Introduction: In a great article, Amazon S3 Performance Tips & Tricks, Doug Grismore,
Director of Storage Operations for AWS, has outed the secret arcana normally
reserved for Premium Developer Support customers on how to really use S3:Size
matters. Workloads with less than 50-100 total requests per second don't
require any special effort. Customers that routinely perform thousands of
requests per second need a plan.Automated partitioning. Automated systems
scale S3 horizontally by continuously splitting data into partitions based on
high request rates and the number of keys in a partition (which leads to slow
lookups). Lessons you've learned with sharding may also apply to S3.   Avoid
hot spots. Like most sharding schemes, you want to avoid hot spots by the
smart selection of key names. S3 objects are stored inbuckets.  Each object is
identified using a key. Keys are kept in sorted order. Keys in S3 are
partitioned by prefix. Objects that sort together are stored together, so you

<p>Introduction: Facebook's Ryan Mack gave aMySQL Tech Talk where he talked about using what he
called Non-stored Proceduresfor adding edges to Facebook's social graph. The
question is: how can edges quickly be added to the social graph? The answer is
ultimately one of deciding where logic should be executed, especially when
locks are kept open during network hops.Ryan explained a key element of the
Facebook data model are the connections between people, things they've liked,
and places they've checked-in. A lot of their writes are adding edges to the
social graph. Currently this is a two step process, run inside a
transaction:add a new edge into the graphif the add was successful then
increment the number of edges on a nodeThis approach works until there's a
very hot node that is being added to rapidly. For example, a popular game adds
a new character and everyone likes it at the same time or a new album comes
out and everyone likes it at the same time.They were limited to the rate they
could add edge</p><p>2 0.96838123 <a title="936-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-28-VoltDB_Decapitates_Six_SQL_Urban_Myths_and_Delivers_Internet_Scale_OLTP_in_the_Process.html">849 high scalability-2010-06-28-VoltDB Decapitates Six SQL Urban Myths and Delivers Internet Scale OLTP in the Process</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What do you get when you take a SQL database and start a new implementation
from scratch, taking advantage of the latest research and modern hardware?
Mike Stonebraker, the sword wielding Johnny Appleseed of the database world,
hopes you get something like his new database,VoltDB: a pure SQL, pure ACID,
pure OLTP, shared nothing, sharded, scalable, lockless, open source, in-memory
DBMS, purpose-built for running hundreds of thousands of transactions a
second. VoltDBclaims to be100 times faster than MySQL, up to 13 times faster
thanCassandra, and 45 times faster than Oracle, with near-linear scaling.Will
VoltDB kill off the new NoSQL upstarts? Will VoltDB cause a mass extinction of
ancient databases? Probably no and no to both questions, but it's a product
with a definite point-of-view and is worth a look as the transaction component
in your system. But will it be right for you? Let's see...I first heard the
details about VoltDB at Gluecon, where Mr. Stonebraker presented his highly

<p>Introduction: My impression of DynamoDB before attending aAmazon DynamoDB for Developerstalk
is that it's the usual quality service produced by Amazon: simple, fast,
scalable, geographically redundant, expensive enough to make you think twice
about using it, and delightfully NoOp.After the talk my impression has become
more nuanced. The quality impression still stands. Look at theforumsand you'll
see the typical issues every product has, but no real surprises. And as a
SimpleDB++, DynamoDB seems to have avoided second system syndrome and produced
a more elegant design.What was surprising is how un-cloudy DynamoDB appears to
be. The cloud pillars of pay for what you use and quick elastic response to
bursty traffic have been abandoned, for some understandable reasons, but the
result is you really have to consider your use cases before making DynamoDB
the default choice.Here are some of my impressions from the talk...DynamoDB is
a clean well lighted place for key-value data. The interface is simple,

<p>Introduction: Update 2: YouTube Reaches One Billion Views Per Day.That's at least 11,574
views per second, 694,444 views per minute, and 41,666,667 views per
hour.Update:YouTube: The Platform. YouTube adds a new rich set of APIs in
order to become your video platform leader--all for free. Upload, edit, watch,
search, and comment on video from your own site without visiting YouTube.
Compose your site internally from APIs because you'll need to expose them
later anyway.YouTube grew incredibly fast, to over 100 million video views per
day, with only a handful of people responsible for scaling the site. How did
they manage to deliver all that video to all those users? And how have they
evolved since being acquired by Google?Information SourcesGoogle

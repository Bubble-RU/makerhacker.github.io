<p>Introduction: Update: More background by Ikai Lan, who worked on the mobile server team at
LinkedIn, sayssome facts were left out: the app made "a cross data center
request, guys. Running on single-threaded Rails servers (every request blocked
the entire process), running Mongrel, leaking memory like a sieve." Which
explains why any non-blocking approach would be a win. And Ikai, I hope as you
do that nobody reads HS and just does what somebody else does without
thinking. The goal here is information that you can use to make your own
decisions. Ryan Paul has written an excellent behind-the-scenes look at
LinkedIn's mobile engineering. While the mobile part of the story--23% mobile
usage; focus on simplicity, ease of use, and reliability; using a room
metaphor; 30% native, 80% HTML; embedded lightweight HTTP server; single
client-app connection--could help guide your mobile strategy, the backend
effects of moving from Rails to Node.js may also prove interesting. After
evaluation, some of the advantag</p><p>3 0.11381883 <a title="941-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-15-Strategy%3A_Biggest_Performance_Impact_is_to_Reduce_the_Number_of_HTTP_Requests.html">942 high scalability-2010-11-15-Strategy: Biggest Performance Impact is to Reduce the Number of HTTP Requests</a></p>

size and frequency of network communications, which will make your pages load
faster, which will improve performance enough that you can use HTTPS all the

benefits of HTTPS for security are overwhelming, but people are afraid of the
performance hit. The argument is successfully made that the overhead of HTTPS
is low enough that you can afford the cost if you do some basic optimization.
Reducing the number of HTTP requests is a good source of low hanging

<p>Introduction: InTaming The Long Latency Tailwe coveredLuiz Barroso's exploration of the long
tail latency (some operations are really slow) problems generated by large
fanout architectures (a request is composed of potentially thousands of other
requests). You may have noticed there weren't a lot of solutions. That's where
a talk I attended,Achieving Rapid Response Times in Large Online
Services(slide deck), byJeff Dean, also of Google, comes in:In this talk, I'll
describe a collection of techniques and practices lowering response times in
large distributed systems whose components run on shared clusters of machines,
where pieces of these systems are subject to interference by other tasks, and
where unpredictable latency hiccups are the norm, not the exception.The goal
is to use software techniques to reduce variability given the increasing
variability in underlying hardware, the need to handle dynamic workloads on a
shared infrastructure, and the need to use large fanout architectures to
operate at</p><p>6 0.094199359 <a title="941-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-26-Facebook%27s_Memcached_Multiget_Hole%3A_More_machines_%21%3D_More_Capacity_.html">728 high scalability-2009-10-26-Facebook's Memcached Multiget Hole: More machines != More Capacity </a></p>

trust authority, Alexa rank, Google hits, and number of comments. When all the

<p>Introduction: Update:Offloading ALL JS Files To Google. Now you can let Google serve all
your javascript files. This article tells you how to do it (upload to Google
Code Project) and why it's a big win (cheap, fast, caching, parallel
downloads, save bandwidth).Don't have a CDN? Why not let Google and Yahoo be
your CDN? At least for Ajax libraries. No charge. Google runs acontent
distribution network and loading architecture for the most popular open source
JavaScript libraries, which include: jQuery, prototype, script.aculo.us,
MooTools, and dojo. The idea is web pages directly include your library of
choice from Google's global, fast, and highly available network. Some have
found much better performance and others experienced slower performance. My
guess is the performance may be slower if your data center is close to you,
but far away users will be much happier. Some negatives: not all libraries are
included, you'll load more than you need because all functionality is
included. Yahoo has had asim</p><p>5 0.66257471 <a title="941-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-07-Looking_for_good_business_examples_of_compaines_using_Hadoop.html">242 high scalability-2008-02-07-Looking for good business examples of compaines using Hadoop</a></p>

<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>3 0.77490014 <a title="941-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-13-Paper%3A_NoSQL_Databases_-_NoSQL_Introduction_and_Overview.html">1022 high scalability-2011-04-13-Paper: NoSQL Databases - NoSQL Introduction and Overview</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Christof Strauch, from Stuttgart Media University, has written an incredible
120+ page paper titledNoSQL Databases as an introduction and overview to NoSQL
databases . The paper was written between 2010-06 and 2011-02, so it may be a
bit out of date, but if you are looking to take in the NoSQL world in one big
gulp, this is your chance. I asked Christof to give us a  short taste of what
he was trying to accomplish in his paper:The paper aims at giving a systematic
and thorough introduction and overview of the NoSQL field by assembling
information dispersed among blogs, wikis and scientific papers. It firstly
discusses reasons, rationales and motives for the development and usage of
nonrelational database systems. These can be summarized by the need for high
scalability, the processing of large amounts of data, the ability to
distribute data among many (often commodity) servers, consequently a
distribution-aware design of DBMSs.The paper then introduces fundamental
concepts, techniques</p><p>4 0.75793725 <a title="941-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_SmarterStats.html">45 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: SmarterStats</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In a strange case of synchronicity, Google just publishedInstant Previews:
Under the hood, a very well written blog post by Matias Pelenur of the Instant
Previews team, giving some fascinating inside details on how Google
implementedInstant Previews. It's syncronicty because I had just posted
Strategy: Biggest Performance Impact Is To Reduce The Number Of HTTP Requests
and one of the major ideas behind the design Instant Previews is to reduce the
number of HTTP requests through a few well chosen tricks. Cosmic!Some of what
Google does to reduce HTTP requests:Data URIs, which are are base64 encodings
of image data, are used instead of static images that are served from the
server. This means the whole preview can be pieced together from image slices
in one request as both the data and the image are returned in the same
request. Google found thateven though base64 encoding adds about 33% to the
size of the image, tests showed that gzip-compressed data URIs are comparable
in size to the o</p><p>6 0.72345269 <a title="941-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-29-Digg_-_Looking_to_the_Future_with_Cassandra.html">732 high scalability-2009-10-29-Digg - Looking to the Future with Cassandra</a></p>

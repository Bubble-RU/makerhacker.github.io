<p>Introduction: Facebook has been so reliable that when a site outage does occur it's a
definite learning opportunity. Fortunately for us we can learn something
because in More Details on Today's Outage, Facebook'sRobert Johnson gave a
pretty candid explanation of what caused a rare 2.5 hour period of down time
for Facebook. It wasn't a simple problem. The root causes were feedback loops
and transient spikes caused ultimately by the complexity of weakly interacting
layers in modern systems. You know, the kind everyone is building these days.
Problems like this are notoriously hard to fix and finding a real solution may
send Facebook back to the whiteboard. There's a technical debt that must be
paid. The outline and my interpretation (reading between the lines) of what
happened is:Remember that Facebookcaches everything. They
have28terabytesofmemcacheddata on 800 servers. The database is the system of
record, but memory is where the action is. So when a problem happens that
involves the caching layer,</p><p>3 0.14072196 <a title="900-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc_-_Database_Clustering_via_JDBC.html">151 high scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc - Database Clustering via JDBC</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Practically any software project nowadays could not survive without a database
(DBMS) backend storing all the business data that is vital to you and/or your
customers. When projects grow larger, the amount of data usually grows larger
exponentially. So you start moving the DBMS to a separate server to gain more
speed and capacity. Which is all good and healthy but you do not gain any
extra safety for this business data. You might be backing up your database
once a day so in case the database server crashes you don't lose EVERYTHING,
but how much can you really afford to lose? Well clearly this depends on what
kind of data you are storing. In our case the users of our solutions use our
software products to do their everyday (all day) work. They have "everything"
they need for their business stored in the database we are providing. So is 24
hours of data loss acceptable? No, not really. One hour? Maybe. But what we
really want is a second database running with the EXACT same data.

they did share some interesting facts:Google was serving more than a billion
searches per day.With Google Instant they served 5-7X more results pages than
previously.Typical search results were returned in less than a quarter of
second.A team of 50+ worked on the project for an extended period of

<p>Introduction: Alan Watts once observed how after we accepted Descartes' separation of the
mind and body we've been trying to smash them back together again ever since
when really they were never separate to begin with.The database normalization-
denormalization dualism has the same mobius shaped reverberations as
Descartes' error. We separate data into a million jagged little pieces and
then spend all our time stooping over, picking them and up, and joining them
back together again.Normalization has been standard practice now for decades.
But times are changing. Many mega-website architects are concluding Watts was
right: the data was never separate to begin with. And even more radical, we
may even need to store multiple copies of data.breakInformation

<p>Introduction: This is an interview with Gabriel Weinberg, founder of Duck Duck Go and
general all around startup guru, on what DDG's architecture looks like in
2012.Innovative search engine upstart DuckDuckGo had30 million searchesin
February 2012 and averages over 1 million searches a day. It's being
positioned bysuper investor Fred Wilsonas a clean, private, impartial and fast
search engine. After talking with Gabriel I like what Fred Wilson said
earlier, it seems closer to the heart of the matter:We invested in DuckDuckGo
for the Reddit, Hacker News anarchists.                  Choosing DuckDuckGo
can be thought of as not just a technical choice, but a vote for revolution.
In an age when knowing your essence is not about about love or friendship, but
about more effectively selling you to advertisers, DDG is positioning
themselves as thedo not track alternative, keepers of theprivacy flame. You
will still be monetized of course, but in a more civilized and anonymous way.

<p>Introduction: This paper, Large-scale Incremental Processing Using Distributed Transactions
and Notifications by Daniel Peng and Frank Dabek, is Google's much anticipated
description of Percolator, their new real-time indexing system.The
abstract:Updating an index of the web as documents are crawled requires
continuously transforming a large repository of existing documents as new
documents arrive. This task is one example of a class of data processing tasks
that transform a large repository of data via small, independent mutations.
These tasks lie in a gap between the capabilities of existing infrastructure.
Databases do not meet the storage or throughput requirements of these tasks:
Google's indexing system stores tens of petabytes of data and processes
billions of updates per day on thousands of machines. MapReduce and other
batch-processing systems cannot process small updates individually as they
rely on creating large batches for efďŹ ciency. We have built Percolator, a

<p>Introduction: We've seen a lot ofNoSQLaction lately built around distributed hash tables.
Btrees are getting jealous. Btrees, once the king of the database world, want
their throne back.Paul Buchheitsurfaced a paper:A practical scalable
distributed B-treeby Marcos K. Aguilera and Wojciech Golab, that might help
spark a revolution.From the Abstract:We propose a new algorithm for a
practical, fault tolerant, and scalable B-tree distributed over a set of
servers. Our algorithm supports practical features not present in prior work:
transactions that allow atomic execution of multiple operations over multiple
B-trees, online migration of B-tree nodes between servers, and dynamic
addition and removal of servers. Moreover, our algorithm is conceptually
simple: we use transactions to manipulate B-tree nodes so that clients need
not use complicated concurrency and locking protocols used in prior work. To
execute these transactions quickly, we rely on three techniques: (1) We use
optimistic concurrency contro</p><p>same-blog 3 0.94854343 <a title="900-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-11-Google%27s_Colossus_Makes_Search_Real-time_by_Dumping_MapReduce.html">900 high scalability-2010-09-11-Google's Colossus Makes Search Real-time by Dumping MapReduce</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As the Kings of scaling, when Google changes its search infrastructure over to
do something completely different, it's news. InGoogle search index splits
with MapReduce, an exclusive interview by Cade Metz with Eisar Lipkovitz, a
senior director of engineering at Google, we learn a bit more of the secret
scaling sauce behindGoogle Instant, Google's new faster, real-time search
system.The challenge for Google has been how to support a real-time world when
the core of their search technology, the famous MapReduce, is batch oriented.
Simple, they got rid of MapReduce. At least they got rid of MapReduce as the
backbone for calculating search indexes. MapReduce still excels as a general
query mechanism against masses of data, but real-time search requires a very
specialized tool, and Google built one. Internally the successor to Google's
famed Google File System, was code named Colossus.Details are slowly coming
out about their new goals and approach:Goal is to update the search index

<p>Introduction: This is guest post byMichael DeHaan(@laserllama), a software developer and
architect, on Ansible, a simple deployment, model-driven configuration
management, and command execution framework.I owe High Scalability a great
deal of credit for the idea behind my latest software project. I was reading
about how an older tool I helped create, Func, was used atTumblr, and it
kicked some ideas into gear. This article is about what happened from that
idea.My observation, which the article reinforced, was that many shops end up
using a configuration management tool (Puppet, Chef, cfengine), a separate
deployment tool (Capistrano, Fabric) and yet another separate ad-hoc task
execution tool (Func, pssh, etc) because one class of tool historically hasn't
been good at all three jobs.My other observation (not from the article) was
that the whole "infrastructure as code" movement, while revolutionary, and
definitely great for many, was probably secretly grating on a good number of
systems administrato</p><p>5 0.94457382 <a title="900-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_11%2C_2011.html">1141 high scalability-2011-11-11-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 11, 2011</a></p>

is that it has a LOT to do with simplicity and consistency.Ray Walters: Quad-

<p>Introduction: To scale in the large you have to partition. Data has to be spread around,
replicated, and kept consistent (keeping replicas sufficiently similar to one
another despite operations being submittedindependently at different sites).
The result is a highly available, well performing, and scalable
system.Partitioning is required, but it's a pain to do efficiently and
correctly. UntilQuantum teleportationbecomes a reality how data is kept

wild ride (OK, maybe not so wild) of different approaches to achieving
consistency.What's cool about this paper is they go over some real systems
that we are familiar with and cover how they work: DNS (single-master, state-

<p>Introduction: Teams fromPrincetonand CMU areworking togetherto solve one of the most
difficult problems in the repertoire: scalable geo-distributed data stores.
Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple
datacenter database functionality for some time, but there's still a general
lack of available systems that work for complex data scenarios.The ideas in
this paper--Don't Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-
Area Storage with COPS--are different. It's not another eventually consistent
system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based
system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally
consistent system that achievesALPSsystem properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL,
etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete
successfully), Low-latency (operations complete quickly (single digit
milliseconds)), Partition-tolerant (operates with a partition), and Scalable

<p>Introduction: Here are a few updates on the articlePaper: Don't Settle For Eventual:
Scalable Causal Consistency For Wide-Area Storage With COPS from Mike Freedman
and Wyatt Lloyd.Q: How software architectures could change in response to
casual+ consistency?A: I don't really think they would much. Somebody would
still run a two-tier architecture in their datacenter:  a front-tier of
webservers running both (say) PHP and our client library, and a back tier of
storage nodes running COPS.  (I'm not sure if it was obvious given the
discussion of our "thick" client -- you should think of the COPS client
dropping in where a memcache client library does...albeit ours has per-session
state.) Q: Why not just use vector clocks?A: The problem with vector clocks
and scalability has always been that the size of vector clocks in O(N), where
N is the number of nodes.  So if we want to scale to a datacenter with 10K
nodes, each piece of metadata must have size O(10K).  And in fact, vector
clocks alone only allow yo</p><p>5 0.12287726 <a title="963-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-12-Paper%3A_Scalable_Eventually_Consistent_Counters_over_Unreliable_Networks.html">1611 high scalability-2014-03-12-Paper: Scalable Eventually Consistent Counters over Unreliable Networks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Counting at scale in a distributed environment issurprisingly hard. And it's a
subject we've covered before in various ways:Big Data Counting: How to count a
billion distinct objects using only 1.5KB of Memory,How to update video views
count effectively?,Numbers Everyone Should Know (sharded
counters).Kellabyte(which is an excellent blog) inScalable Eventually
Consistent Counterstalks about how the Cassandra counter implementation scores
well on the scalability and high availability front, but in so doing has "over
and under counting problem in partitioned environments."Which is often fine.
But if you want more accuracy there's a PN-counter, which is aCRDT (convergent
replicated data type)where "all the changes made to a counter on each node
rather than storing and modifying a single value so that you can merge all the
values into the proper final value. Of course the trade-off here is additional
storage and processing but there are ways to optimize this."And there's a

<p>Introduction: Neil Conwayfrom Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk ata meetup today
in San Francisco on a new paper: Logic and Lattices for Distributed
Programming \- extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. The
description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the
paper:Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong
consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability.
Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of
strong consistency can be very challenging. In this talk, I'll discuss work
from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed
programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative
programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis
technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually
consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a
broader range of programs, drawin</p><p>4 0.8458873 <a title="963-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-18-Georeplication%3A_When_Bad_Things_Happen_to_Good_Systems.html">1374 high scalability-2012-12-18-Georeplication: When Bad Things Happen to Good Systems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Georeplication is one of the standard techniques for dealing when bad things--
failure and latency--happen to good systems. The problem is always: how do you
do that? Murat Demirbas, Associate Professor at SUNY Buffalo, has a couple of
really good posts that can help:MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency andMaking
Geo-Replicated Systems Fast as Possible, Consistent when Necessary. In MDCC:
Multi-Data Center Consistency Murat discusses a paper that says synchronous
wide-area replication can be feasible. There's a quick and clear explanation
of Paxos and various optimizations that is worth the price of admission. We
find that strong consistency doesn't have to be lost across a WAN:The good
thing about using Paxos over the WAN is you /almost/ get the full CAP  (all
three properties: consistency, availability, and partition-freedom). As we
discussed earlier (Paxos taught), Paxos is CP, that is, in the presence of a
partition, Paxos keeps consistency over availability. But, Paxos can still

<p>Introduction: For a great Christmas read forgetThe Night Before Christmas, a heart warming
poem written by Clement Moore for his children, that created the modern idea
of Santa Clause we all know and anticipate each Christmas eve. Instead, curl
up with a some potent eggnog, nog being any drink made with rum, and read
CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control by Mihai Letia, Nuno Preguiรงa,
and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),a
data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent.From the
introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed
consistency issues:Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-
understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large
scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two
approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up
consistency guarantees, for instance using the Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) approach
[7].

<p>Introduction: This is a hilarious presentation byJosh Berkus, calledScale Fail, given at
O'Reilly MySQL CE 2011. Josh is entertaining, well spoken, and cleverly hides
insight inside chaos. And he makes some dang good points along the way.Josh
has a problem, you see Josh has learned how to make sites that are both
scalable and reliable. So he's puzzled why companies "whose downtime
interfaces (Twitter) are more well known than their uptime interfaces" get all
the attention, respect, and money for being failures. Just doing your job
doesn't make you a hero.  You need these self-inflicted wounds in-order to
have the war stories to share at conferences. They get the attention. Just
doing your job is boring. This is so unfair in that way life can be. So if you
want to turn the tables and take the low road to fame and fortune, here's
Josh's program for learning how not to scale:Be trendy. Use the tool that has
the most buzz: NoSQL, Cloud, MapReduce, Rails, RabbitMQ. It helps you not
scale and the VCs like</p><p>4 0.75061625 <a title="963-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-02-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_2%2C_2012.html">1203 high scalability-2012-03-02-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 2, 2012</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Please don't squeeze the HighScalability:Quotable quotes:@karmafile:
"Scalability" is a much more evil word than we make it out to be@ostaquet:
More hardware won't solve #SQL resp. time issues; proper indexing
does.@datachick: All computing technology is the rearrangement of data. Data
is the center of the universe@jamesurquhart: "Complexity is a characteristic
of the system, not of the parts in it."Data is the star of the cat walk,
looking fierce in Ilya Katsov's impeccably constructed post on NoSQL Data
Modeling Techniques: In this article I provide a short comparison of NoSQL
system families from the data modeling point of view and digest several common
modeling techniques.Peter Burnstalks computer nanosecond time scales as a
human might experience them. Your memory == computer registers , L1 cache ==
papers kept close by, L2 cache == books, RAM == the library down the street,
and going to disk is a 3 year odessy for data.Fault Tolerance in a High Volume

Video by Rich Wolskiand a Visualization.com interviewRich Wolski on
Eucalyptus: Open Source Cloud Computing.Eucalyptusis generating some
excitement on theCloud Computinggroup as a potential vendor neutral EC2
compatible cloud platform. Two reasons why Eucalyptus is potentially
important: private clouds and cloud portability:breakPrivate clouds. Let's say
you want a cloud like infrastructure for architectural purposes but you want
it to run on your own hardware in your own secure environment. How would you
do this today? Hm....Cloud portability. With the number of cloud offerings
increasing how can you maintain some level of vendor neutrality among this
"swarm" of different options? Portability is a key capability for cloud
customers as the only real power customers have is in where they take their
business and the only way you can change suppliers is if there's a ready
market of fungible services. And the only</p><p>6 0.73565459 <a title="963-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-03-Ideas_on_how_to_scale_a_shared_inventory_database%3F%3F%3F.html">236 high scalability-2008-02-03-Ideas on how to scale a shared inventory database???</a></p>

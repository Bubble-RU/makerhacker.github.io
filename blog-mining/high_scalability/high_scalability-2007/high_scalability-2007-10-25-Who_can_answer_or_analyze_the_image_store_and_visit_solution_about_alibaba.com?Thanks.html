<p>Introduction: Hi,I'minterested in peoples thoughts on the best choice for a database
clustering solution.I have a database that is mostly varchars and numbers that
doesn't store any binary data at all. It's used at about 70% read and 30%
writes - though we're using memcached at the moment so it's not really hit
that hard.We're currently using mysql with m/cluster, but are interested in a
new solution. Possible candidate so far are unicluster (which doesn't seem
mature yet.) or DRBD.Had anyone had a similar experience and can make any
suggestions?Thanks</p><p>6 0.11266255 <a title="132-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-10-1_Master%2C_N_Slaves.html">178 high scalability-2007-12-10-1 Master, N Slaves</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How does the Wayback Machinework? Now with over 400 billion webpages indexed,
allowing the Internet to be browsed all the way back to 1996, it's an even
more compelling question. I've looked several times but I've never found a
really good answer.Here's some information from a thread on Hacker News. It
starts with mmagin, a former Archive employee:I can't speak to their current
infrastructure (though more of it is open source now - http://archive-
access.sourceforge.net/projects/wayback/ ), but as far as the wayback machine,
there was no SQL database anywhere in it.For the purposes of making the
wayback machine go:Archived data was in ARC file format (predecessor to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive) which is essentially a concatenation
of separately gzipped records. That is, you can seek to a particular offset
and start decompressing a record. Thus you could get at any archived web page
with a triple (server, filename, file-offset) Thus it was spread across a lot
of commodity g</p><p>5 0.49645278 <a title="132-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-07-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Web_asset_server_concept_-_3rd_party_software_available%3F.html">1402 high scalability-2013-02-07-Ask HighScalability: Web asset server concept - 3rd party software available?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>6 0.48421323 <a title="132-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-20-Ask_HighScalability%3A_How_do_I_organize_millions_of_images%3F.html">1268 high scalability-2012-06-20-Ask HighScalability: How do I organize millions of images?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw
up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK. If they're outside the
UK but have decent support then also include. The service must be cheap and
not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it
shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered
whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK
compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a
small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space. Would S3 be a good
starting point? What is the service like? I hear mixed reviews about it.Many

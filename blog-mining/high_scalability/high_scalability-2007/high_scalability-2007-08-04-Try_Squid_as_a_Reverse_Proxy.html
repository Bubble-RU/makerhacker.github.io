<p>Introduction: My company is developing a centralized web platform to service our clients.  We currently use about 3Mb/s on our uplink at our ISP serving web pages for about 100 clients.  We'd like to offer them statistics that mean something to their businesses and have been contemplating writing our own statistics code to handle the task.     All statistics would be gathered at the page view level and we're implementing a HttpModule in ASP.Net 2.0 to handle the gather of the data.  That said, I'm curious to hear comments on writing this data (~500 bytes of log data/page request).  We need to write this data somewhere and then build a process to aggregate the data into a warehouse application used in our reporting system.  Google Analytics is out of the question because we do not want our hosting infrastructure dependant upon a remote server.  Web Trends et al. are too expensive for our clients.     I'm thinking of a couple of options.   1) Writing log data directly to a SQL Server 2000 db and havin</p><p>4 0.10832363 <a title="59-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-15-Using_HTTP_cache_headers_effectively.html">571 high scalability-2009-04-15-Using HTTP cache headers effectively</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     Some time ago , martin fowler bloged about how HTTP cache headers can be very effectively used in web site design.   http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/SegmentationByFreshness.html     How actively HTTP cache headers are considered in web site design? I think it is a great tool to reduce lot of load on server and should be considered before designing any complex caching strategy. Thoughts?

<p>Introduction: Another scalability strategy brought to you by Erik Osterman:     Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies (Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers .      The benefit of this approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA load balancing on the perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users). Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has MySQL support.      What we also liked about this approach was that it had no dependency on a distributed or networked file system, so less chance of corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches capacity, we just off load users to a less u</p><p>6 0.089526884 <a title="59-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-12-Technology_behind_mediatemple_grid_service_.html">90 high scalability-2007-09-12-Technology behind mediatemple grid service </a></p>

<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.     They're using a static server to deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.     I'm curious how other people have dealt with this situation.     Seperating into two different servers would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>3 0.71246034 <a title="59-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com.html">177 high scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com</a></p>

The  various topics  include: Before there Were Clouds, Cloud Computing, P2P Systems, Basic Distributed Computing Concepts, Sensor Networks, Overlays and DHTs, Cloud Programming, Cloud Scheduling, Key-Value Stores, Storage, Sensor Net Routing, Geo-Distribution, P2P Apps, In-network processing, Epidemics, Probabilistic Membership Protocols, Distributed Monitoring and  Management, Publish-Subscribe/CDNs, Measurement Studies, Old Wine: Stale or Vintage?, In Byzantium, Cloud Pricing, Other Industrial Systems, Structure of Networks, Completing the Circle, Green Clouds, Distributed Debugging, Flash!, The Middle or the End?, Availability-Aware Systems, Design Methodologies, Handling Stress, Sources of unreliability in networks, Handling Stress, Selfish algorithms, Securi</p><p>3 0.84851462 <a title="59-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">191 high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have an application with couple of web servers that uses MemcacheD. How can i synchronize concurrent put to the cache? The value of the entry  is list.     Atomic append operation could have been helpful, but unfortunately memcahe doesn't support atomic append.</p><p>4 0.80321097 <a title="59-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-06-Product%3A_ChironFS.html">143 high scalability-2007-11-06-Product: ChironFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across data centers,  then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What is  ChironFS  and how does it work?
 
Adapted from the ChironFS website:   The Chiron Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not FILESYSTEMS.  Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become a real nightmare!</p><p>5 0.77831352 <a title="59-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-27-Product%3A_Sequoia_Database_Clustering_Technology.html">102 high scalability-2007-09-27-Product: Sequoia Database Clustering Technology</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sequoia  is a transparent middleware solution offering clustering, load balancing and failover services for any database. Sequoia is the continuation of the C-JDBC project. The database is distributed and replicated among several nodes and Sequoia balances the queries among these nodes. Sequoia handles node and network failures with transparent failover. It also provides support for hot recovery, online maintenance operations and online upgrades.
  Features in a nutshell    No modification of existing applications or databases.    Operational with any database providing a JDBC driver.    High availability provided by advanced RAIDb technology.    Transparent failover and recovery capabilities.    Performance scalability with unique load balancing and query result caching features.    Integrated JMX-based administration and monitoring.    100% Java implementation allowing portability across platforms with a JRE 1.4 or greater.    Open source licensed under Apache v2 license.

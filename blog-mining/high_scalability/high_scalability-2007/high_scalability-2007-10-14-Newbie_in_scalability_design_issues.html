<p>Introduction: OK, thisinterview is with meon Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger
idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java
World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them
:-)The interview went an interesting direction, but there's more I'd like add
and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have
popped out at me:Java - It's the platform stupid. Java the language isn't the
big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM,
libraries, and toolsets.Java - It's the community stupid. A lot of creativity
is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability
challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing
Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.The fecundity of
the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our
multi-core future. There's a multi-core crisis going in case you haven't
heard. It's all you'll</p><p>5 0.14312418 <a title="121-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-06-Start_Here.html">1 high scalability-2007-07-06-Start Here</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi, if you were to design your own highly scalable website from scratch, what
technologies would you use?Based on Web 2.0 popularity, LAMP seems to be high
in the running. But would you tack on CakePHP? Drupal? or build your
framework/CMS from scratch?What version of Linux runs best for a scalable
website?Would you consider Windows and .NET? Java? Or do you want to throw a
brick at me for even suggesting such heresies?Would you prefer Postgres,
Tomcat, Perl, Python, or any of that other *NIX fancy stuff...why or why
not?Please forget for the moment, "use what you know" argument. I am pretty
versatile, and can look for an expert in whatever platform I choose. So all
skills being equal, I'm looking for the best community support, the fastest
development time and most importantly, the best scaling approach.Let's say,
for fun, that I'm planning for the website to have as many messages going back
& forth as an eBay.Definitely building this on a budget..Jason</p><p>3 0.78767699 <a title="121-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-08-Welcome_to_High_Scalability.html">2 high scalability-2007-07-08-Welcome to High Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi everyone, I'm researching on Scalability for a college paper, and found
this site great, but it has too many tips, articles and the like, but I can't
see a hierarchical organization of subjects, I would need something like a
checklist of things or fields, or technologies to take into account when
assesing scalability.So far I've identified these:- Hardware scalability:-
scale out- scale up- CacheWhat types of cache are there? app-level, os-level,
network-level, I/O-level?- Load Balancing- DB ClusteringAm I missing something
important? (I'm sure I am)I don't expect you to give a lecture here, but maybe
point some things out, give me some useful links...Thanks!</p><p>6 0.68751574 <a title="121-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-06-Start_Here.html">1 high scalability-2007-07-06-Start Here</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have 3 exp in building website using java.I work on only single
server.Website is not very scalable.I always wonder how ebay,youtube,monster
handle traffic, giving responses within seconds.From the google i find this
site and i hope i can also able to build very scalable website .I need
guidelines from where to start ,what are the things we needed.I know that
scalability comes through the use of distributed applications but don't how to
implement it.I see many website build in languages other than java so java is
good choice for building high scalable website.Thanks</p><p>3 0.90923983 <a title="121-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-13-SQL_Server_2008_Database_Performance_and_Scalability.html">410 high scalability-2008-10-13-SQL Server 2008 Database Performance and Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Microsoft SQL Server 2008 incorporates the tools and technologies that are
necessary to implement relational databases, reporting systems, and data
warehouses of enterprise scale, and provides optimal performance and
responsiveness.With SQL Server 2008, you can take advantage of the latest
hardware technologies while scaling up your servers to support server
consolidation. SQL Server 2008 also enables you to scale out your largest data
solutions.This white paper describes the performance and scalability
capabilities of MicrosoftÈÄü SQL ServerÈÄü 2008 and explains how you can use these
capabilities to:* Optimize performance for any size of database with the tools
and features that are available for the database engine, analysis services,
reporting services, and integration services.* Scale up your servers to take
full advantage of new hardware capabilities.* Scale out your database
environment to optimize responsiveness and to move your data closer to your
users.Read the entire article abou</p><p>4 0.90446037 <a title="121-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-21-Google_App_Engine_-_what_about_existing_applications%3F.html">305 high scalability-2008-04-21-Google App Engine - what about existing applications?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently, Google announced Google App Engine, another announcement in the
rapidly growing world of cloud computing. This brings up some very serious
questions:1. If we want to take advantage of one of the clouds, are we doomed
to be locked-in for life?2. Must we re-write our existing applications to use
the cloud?3. Do we need to learn a brand new technology or language for the
cloud?This post presents a pattern that will enable us to abstract our
application code from the underlying cloud provider infrastructure. This will
enable us to easily migrate our EXISTING applications to cloud based
environment thus avoiding the need for a complete re-write.</p><p>5 0.90127712 <a title="121-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-06-Sponsored_Post%3A_FreeAgent%2C_Percona_Live%21%2C_Strata%2C_Box%2C_BetterWorks%2C_New_Relic%2C_NoSQL_Now%21%2C_Surge%2C_Tungsten%2C_AppDynamics%2C_Couchbase%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1111 high scalability-2011-09-06-Sponsored Post: FreeAgent, Percona Live!, Strata, Box, BetterWorks, New Relic, NoSQL Now!, Surge, Tungsten, AppDynamics, Couchbase, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

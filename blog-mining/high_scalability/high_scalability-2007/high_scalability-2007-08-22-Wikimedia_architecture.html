<p>Introduction: Varnishis a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is
targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take
full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered
by these operating systems.Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high
performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be
configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like
computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.Varnish is reported to
be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>5 0.17936906 <a title="72-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-27-Handle_700_Percent_More_Requests_Using_Squid_and_APC_Cache.html">662 high scalability-2009-07-27-Handle 700 Percent More Requests Using Squid and APC Cache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thisposton www.ilovebonnie.net documents some impressive system performance
improvements by the addition ofSquid Cache(a caching proxy) andAPC
Cache(opcode cache for PHP).Apache is able to deliver roughly 700% more
requests per second with Squid when serving 1KB and 100KB images.Server load
is reduced using Squid because the server does not have to create a bunch of
Apache processes to handle the requests.APC Cache took a system that could
barely handle 10-20 requests per second to handling 50-60 requests per second.
A 400% increase.APC allowed the load times to remain under 5 seconds even with
200 concurrent threads slamming on the server.These two caches are easy to
setup and install and allow you to get a lot more performance out of them.The
post has an in-depth discussion and a number of supporting charts. The primary
point is how simple it can be to improve performance and scalability by adding
caching.</p><p>6 0.16519539 <a title="72-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-13-What%27s_your_scalability_plan%3F.html">248 high scalability-2008-02-13-What's your scalability plan?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Slashdot effect: overwhelming unprepared sites with an avalanche of reader's
clicks after being mentioned on Slashdot. Sure, we now have the "Digg effect"
and other hot new stars, but Slashdot was the original. And like many stars
from generations past, Slashdot plays the elder statesman's role with with
class, dignity, and restraint. Yet with millions and millions of users
Slashdot is still box office gold and more than keeps up with the young'ins.
And with age comes the wisdom of learning how to handle all those users. Just
how does Slashdot scale and what can you learn by going old school?breakSite:

<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical
successful website goes through:Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture,
low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers,
database server, and internal storage.Stage 2 - More of the same, just
bigger.Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache
static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding.Stage 4 - The Pain
Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too
long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content,
significant re-architecting for DB.Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink
entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters,
using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster.Stage 6
- Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database
architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again,
optimizing some code,</p><p>4 0.78506452 <a title="72-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-10-Shard_servers_--_go_big_or_small%3F.html">383 high scalability-2008-09-10-Shard servers -- go big or small?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello everyone,I'm designing a website/widget that my business partner and I
expect to serve millions of hits daily. As such we must shard our database
(and we're designing with shards in mind right from the beginning). However,
the one thing I haven't been able to figure out from Googling is the best
hardware to go with for shards. I'm using exclusively InnoDB tables.We'll
(eventually) be running 3 groups of database servers:a) Session servers for
php sessions. These will have a very high write volume.b) ID servers. These
will match a couple primary indices (such as user ID) to a given shard. These
will have an intense read load, plus a moderate amount of writes.c) Shard
servers. These will hold the bulk of the data. These will have a high read
load and a lowish write load.Group A is done as a database instead of using
memcached so users aren't logged out if a memcached server goes down. As the
write load is high, a pair of high performance master-master servers seems
obvious. What's</p><p>5 0.78357273 <a title="72-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-19-Heavy_upload_server_scalability.html">516 high scalability-2009-02-19-Heavy upload server scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,We are running a backup solution that uploads every night the files our
clients worked on during the day (Cabonite-like).We have currently about 10GB
of data per night, via http PUT requests (1 per file), and the files are
written as-is on a NAS.Our architecture is basically compound of a load
balancer (hardware, sticky sessions), 5 servers (Tomcat under RHEL4/5, ) and a
NAS (nfs 3).Since our number of clients is rising, (as is our system load) how
would you recommend we could scale our infrastructure? hardware and software?
Should we go towards NAS sharding, more servers, NIO on tomcat...?Thanks for
your inputs!</p><p>6 0.77357888 <a title="72-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-12-FeedBurner_Architecture.html">7 high scalability-2007-07-12-FeedBurner Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy thatthe best method to analyse spam is to become a
spammer, this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely
researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part
Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that
their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they
figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales
they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.Two different spam campaigns were
run on aStormbotnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-
peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide
computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit
new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to
download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the
executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon. The
downloaded compone</p><p>same-blog 2 0.95118773 <a title="72-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-Wikimedia_architecture.html">72 high scalability-2007-08-22-Wikimedia architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 35:How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational
Database. Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in
order to mimic RDBMS joins:Given the trade off between potential
inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the
latter.Update 34: Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what
that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?Amazon dramatically drops
SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB. This puts
SimpleDB on par withGoogle App Engine. They also announced a few new
features:a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline
uploading of multiple items or attributes. One of the complaints against
SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things.
These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can
store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.Update 33: Amazon announcesElastic

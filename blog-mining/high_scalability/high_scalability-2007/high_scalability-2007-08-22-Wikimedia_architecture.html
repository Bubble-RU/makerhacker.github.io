<p>Introduction: Update 2: Summize  Computes Computing Resources for a Startup . Lots of nice graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost efficient for well used larger machines.  Long term storage costs may eat your saving away. And out of cloud bandwidth costs are high.     Update: via  ProductionScale , a nice Digital Web article on  how to setup S3 to store media files  and how Blue Origin was able to handle 3.5 million requests and 758 GBs in bandwidth in a single day for very little $$$. Also a Right Scale article on  Network performance within Amazon EC2 and to Amazon S3 . 75MB/s between EC2 instances, 10.2MB/s between EC2 and S3 for download, 6.9MB/s upload.       Now that Amazon's S3 (storage service) is   out of beta   and EC2 (elastic compute cloud) has added new   instance types   (the class of machine you can rent) with more CPU and more RAM, I thought it would be interesting to take a look out how their pricing stacks up.

<p>Introduction: Varnish  is a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered by these operating systems.  Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.  Varnish is reported to be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>5 0.17936906 <a title="72-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-27-Handle_700_Percent_More_Requests_Using_Squid_and_APC_Cache.html">662 high scalability-2009-07-27-Handle 700 Percent More Requests Using Squid and APC Cache</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This  post  on www.ilovebonnie.net documents some impressive system performance improvements by the addition of  Squid Cache  (a caching proxy) and  APC Cache  (opcode cache for PHP). 
 
 Apache is able to deliver roughly 700% more requests per second with Squid when serving 1KB and 100KB images. 
 Server load is reduced using Squid because the server does not have to create a bunch of Apache processes to handle the requests. 
 APC Cache took a system that could barely handle 10-20 requests per second to handling 50-60 requests per second. A 400% increase. 
 APC allowed the load times to remain under 5 seconds even with 200 concurrent threads slamming on the server. 
 These two caches are easy to setup and install and allow you to get a lot more performance out of them. 
 
The post has an in-depth discussion and a number of supporting charts. The primary point is how simple it can be to improve performance and scalability by adding caching.</p><p>6 0.16519539 <a title="72-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-13-What%27s_your_scalability_plan%3F.html">248 high scalability-2008-02-13-What's your scalability plan?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Slashdot effect  : overwhelming unprepared sites with an avalanche of reader's clicks after being mentioned on Slashdot. Sure, we now have the "Digg effect" and other hot new stars, but Slashdot was the original. And like many stars from generations past, Slashdot plays the elder statesman's role with with class, dignity, and restraint. Yet with millions and millions of users Slashdot is still box office gold and more than keeps up with the young'ins. And with age comes the wisdom of learning how to handle all those users. Just how does Slashdot scale and what can you learn by going old school?

<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical successful website goes through: 
 
 Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture, low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers, database server, and internal storage. 
 Stage 2 - More of the same, just bigger. 
 Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding. 
 Stage 4 - The Pain Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content, significant re-architecting for DB. 
 Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters, using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster. 
 Stage 6 - Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again, op</p><p>4 0.78506452 <a title="72-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-10-Shard_servers_--_go_big_or_small%3F.html">383 high scalability-2008-09-10-Shard servers -- go big or small?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello everyone,     I'm designing a website/widget that my business partner and I expect to serve millions of hits daily. As such we must shard our database (and we're designing with shards in mind right from the beginning). However, the one thing I haven't been able to figure out from Googling is the best hardware to go with for shards. I'm using exclusively InnoDB tables.     We'll (eventually) be running 3 groups of database servers:   a) Session servers for php sessions. These will have a very high write volume.   b) ID servers. These will match a couple primary indices (such as user ID) to a given shard. These will have an intense read load, plus a moderate amount of writes.   c) Shard servers. These will hold the bulk of the data. These will have a high read load and a lowish write load.       Group A is done as a database instead of using memcached so users aren't logged out if a memcached server goes down. As the write load is high, a pair of high performance master-master serv</p><p>5 0.78357273 <a title="72-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-19-Heavy_upload_server_scalability.html">516 high scalability-2009-02-19-Heavy upload server scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     We are running a backup solution that uploads every night the files our clients worked on during the day (Cabonite-like).   We have currently about 10GB of data per night, via http PUT requests (1 per file), and the files are written as-is on a NAS.   Our architecture is basically compound of a load balancer (hardware, sticky sessions), 5 servers (Tomcat under RHEL4/5, ) and a NAS (nfs 3).     Since our number of clients is rising, (as is our system load) how would you recommend we could scale our infrastructure? hardware and software? Should we go towards NAS sharding, more servers, NIO on tomcat...?       Thanks for your inputs!</p><p>6 0.77357888 <a title="72-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-12-FeedBurner_Architecture.html">7 high scalability-2007-07-12-FeedBurner Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Under the philosophy that  the best method to analyse spam is to become a spammer , this absolutely fascinating paper recounts how a team of UC Berkely researchers went under cover to infiltrate a spam network. Part CSI, part Mission Impossible, and part MacGyver, the team hijacked the botnet so that their code was actually part of the dark network itself. Once inside they figured out the architecture and protocols of the botnet and how many sales they were able to tally. Truly elegant work.   Two different spam campaigns were run on a  Storm  botnet network of 75,800 zombie computers. Storm is a peer-to-peer botnet that uses spam to creep its tentacles through the world wide computer network. One of the campains distributed viruses in order to recruit new bots into the network. This is normally accomplished by enticing people to download email attachments. An astonishing one in ten people downloaded the executable and ran it, which means we won't run out of zombies soon.

<p>Introduction: Update 35  :   How and Why Glue is Using Amazon SimpleDB instead of a Relational Database  . Discusses a key design decision that required duplicating data in order to mimic RDBMS joins:   Given the trade off between potential inconsistencies and scalability, social services have to choose the latter.      Update 34  : Apparently Amazon pulled this article. I'm not sure what that means. Maybe time went backwards or something?   Amazon dramatically drops SimpleDB pricing to $0.25 per GB per month from $1.50 per GB  . This puts SimpleDB on par with   Google App Engine  . They also announced  a few new features:   a SQL-like SELECT API as well as a Batch Put operation to streamline uploading of multiple items or attributes  . One of the complaints against SimpleDB is that programmers end up writing too much code to do simple things. These features and a much cheaper price should help considerably. And you can store lots of data now. GAE is still capped.

goes down then 1/5 of the user can't access the website. We could use
replication but we would need to at least double sql servers to replicate each

<p>Introduction: What have bunch of applications which run on Debian servers, which processes
huge amount of data stored in a shared NFS drive.we have 3 applications
working as a pipeline, which process data stored in the NFS drive. The first
application processes the data and store the output in some folder in the NFS
drive, the second app in the pipeline process the data from the previous step
and so on.The data load to the pipeline is like 1 GBytes per minute. I think
the NFS drive is the bottleneck here.Would buying a specialized file server
improve the performance of data read write from the disk ?</p><p>5 0.14594287 <a title="63-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-23-6_Ways_to_Kill_Your_Servers_-__Learning_How_to_Scale_the_Hard_Way.html">884 high scalability-2010-08-23-6 Ways to Kill Your Servers -  Learning How to Scale the Hard Way</a></p>

<p>Introduction: HackerEarth is a coding skill practice and testing service that in a series of
well written articles describes the trials and tribulations of building their
site and how they overcame them: Scaling Python/Django application with Apache
and mod_wsgi,Programming challenges, uptime, and mistakes in 2013, Post-
mortem: The big outage on January 25, 2014,The Robust Realtime Server,100,000
strong - CodeFactory server,Scaling database with Django and
HAProxy,Continuous Deployment System,HackerEarth Technology Stack.What
characterizes these articles and makes them especially helpful is a drive for
improvement and an openness towards reporting what didn't work and how they
figured out what would work.As they say, mistakes happen when you are building
a complex product with a team of just 3-4 engineers, but investing in
infrastructure allowed them to take more breaks, roam the streets of Bangalore
while their servers are happily serving thousands of requests every minute,
while reaching a 50,000</p><p>5 0.75019658 <a title="63-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-07-Synchronizing_databases_in_different_geographic_locations.html">176 high scalability-2007-12-07-Synchronizing databases in different geographic locations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our company offers a web service that is provided to users from several
different hosting centers across the globe.The content and functionality at
each of the servers is almost exactly the same, and we could have based them
all in a single location. However, we chose to distribute the servers
geographically to offer our users the best performance, regardless where they
might be.Up until now, the only content on the servers that has had to be
synchronized is the server software itself. The features and functionality of
our service are being updated regularly, so every week or two we push updates
out to all the servers at basically the same time. We use a relatively manual
approach to do the updating, but it works fine.Sometime soon, however, our
synchronization needs are going to get a bit more complex.In particular, we'll
soon start offering a feature at our site that will involve a database with
content that will change on an almost second-by-second basis, based on user
input and act</p><p>6 0.74941778 <a title="63-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-How_many_machines_do_you_need_to_run_your_site%3F.html">70 high scalability-2007-08-22-How many machines do you need to run your site?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How does Facebook handle the massive New Year's Eve traffic spike? Thanks to
Mike Swift, in Facebook gets ready for New Year's Eve, we get a little insight
as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still
interesting.Problem SetupFacebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be
shared on New Year's eve.Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the
world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average
of 130 friends.Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a
homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those
requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then
rendered.Different events put different stresses on different parts of
Facebook. Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of
capacity News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve
Jobs drive user status updatesCoping StrategiesTry to predictthe surge in

<p>Introduction: Think of building websites as engineeringcomposite materials. A composite
material is when two or more materials are combined to create a third material
that does something useful that the components couldn't do on their own.
Composites like reinforced concrete have revolutionized design and
construction. When building websites we usually bring different component
materials together, like creating a composite, to get the features we need
rather than building a completely new thing from scratch that does everything
we want.This approach has been seen as a hack because it leads to inelegancies
like data duplication; great gobs of component glue; consistency issues; and
messy operations. But what if the the composite approach is really a strength,
not a hack, but a messy part of the world that needs to be embraced rather
than belittled?They key is tosee data as a material. Right now we are arguing
which is the best single material to build with. Is itNoSQL, relational,
massively parallel,</p><p>3 0.88994557 <a title="63-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Sync_data_on_all_servers.html">98 high scalability-2007-09-18-Sync data on all servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have a few apache servers ( arround 11 atm ) serving a small amount of data
( arround 44 gigs right now ).For some time I have been using rsync to keep
all the content equal on all servers, but the amount of data has been growing,
and rsync takes a few too much time to "compare" all data from source to
destination, and create a lot of I/O.I have been taking a look at MogileFS, it
seems a good and reliable option, but as the fuse module is not finished, we
should have to rewrite all our apps, and its not an option atm.Any ideas?I
just want a "real time, non resource-hungry" solution alternative for rsync.
If I get more features on the way, then they are welcome :)Why I prefer to use
a Distributed File System instead of using NAS + NFS?- I need 2 NAS, if I dont
want a point of failure, and NAS hard is expensive.- Non-shared hardware, all
server has their own local disks.- As files are replicated, I can save a lot
of money, RAID is not a MUST.Thnx in advance for your help and sorry for</p><p>4 0.88009453 <a title="63-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-07-Update_on_Disqus%3A_It%27s_Still_About_Realtime%2C_But_Go_Demolishes_Python.html">1644 high scalability-2014-05-07-Update on Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes Python</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our last article on Disqus: How Disqus Went Realtime With 165K Messages Per
Second And Less Than .2 Seconds Latency, was a little out of date, but the
folks at Disqus have been busy implementing, not talking, so we don't know a
lot about what they are doing now, but we do have a short update in C1MM and
NGINXby John Watson and an article Trying out this Go thing.So Disqus has
grown a bit:1.3 billion unique visitors10 billion page views500 million users
engaged in discussions3 million communities25 million commentsThey are still
all about realtime, but Go replaced Python in their Realtime system:Original
Realtime backend was written in a pretty lightweight Python + gevent.The
realtime service is a hybrid of CPU intensive tasks + lots of network IO.
Gevent was handling the network IO without an issue, but at higher contention,
the CPU was choking everything. Switching over to Go removed that contention,
which was the primary issue that was being seen.Still runs on 5 machines Nginx

<p>Introduction: Hey,I do have a website that I would like to scale. Right now we have 10
servers but this does not scale well.I know how to deal with my apache web
servers but have problems with sql servers.I would like to use the "scale out"
system and add servers when we need. We have over 100Gb of data for mysql and
we tried to have around 20G per server. It works well except that if a server
goes down then 1/5 of the user can't access the website. We could use
replication but we would need to at least double sql servers to replicate each
server. And maybe in the future it's not gonna be enough we would need maybe 3
slaves per master ... well I don't really like this idea.I would prefer to
have 8 servers that all deal with data from the 5 servers we have right now
and then we could add new servers when we need. I looked at NFS but that does
not seem to be a good idea for SQL servers ? Can you confirm?</p><p>6 0.8671993 <a title="63-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-03-GPU_vs_CPU_Smackdown_%3A_The_Rise_of_Throughput-Oriented_Architectures.html">953 high scalability-2010-12-03-GPU vs CPU Smackdown : The Rise of Throughput-Oriented Architectures</a></p>

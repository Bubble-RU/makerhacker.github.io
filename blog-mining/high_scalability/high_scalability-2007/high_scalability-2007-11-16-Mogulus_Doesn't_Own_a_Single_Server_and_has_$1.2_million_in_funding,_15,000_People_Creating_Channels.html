<p>Introduction: A man had a dream. His dream was to blend a bunch of RSS/Atom/RDF feeds into a single feed. The man is Beau Lebens of  Feedville  and like most dreamers he was a little short on coin. So he took refuge in the home of a cheap hosting provider and Beau realized his dream, creating  FEEDblendr . But FEEDblendr chewed up so much CPU creating blended feeds that the cheap hosting provider ordered Beau to find another home. Where was Beau to go? He eventually found a new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of affordable CPU cycles.

<p>Introduction: The future is live. The future is real-time. The future is now. That's the hype anyway. And as it has a habit of doing, the hype is slowly becoming reality. We are seeing live searches, live tweets, live location, live reality augmentation, live crab (fresh and local), and live event publishing. One of the most challenging of all live technologies is that of live video broadcasting. Imagine a world in which everyone becomes a  broadcaster  and a consumer of video streams, all in real-time (< 250 msec latency), all so you can talk and interact directly without feeling like you are in the middle of a time shift war. The resources and the engineering needed to make this happened must be substantial. How do you do that?

<p>Introduction: Tech Crunch chomped down on some initial scaling problems with Yahoo's new live video streaming service   Yahoo Live  . After a bit of chewing on Yahoo's old bones, TC spat out:   If Yahoo cant scale something like this (no matter how much they claim it’s an experiment, it’s still a live service), it shows how far the once brightest star of the online world has fallen  .     This kind of thinking kills innovation. When there's no room for a few hiccups or a little failure you have to cover your ass so completely nothing new will ever see the light of day.        I thought we were supposed to be   agile  . We are supposed to release early and often.  Not every 'i' has to be dotted and not every last router has to be installed before we take the first step of a grand new journey.      Get it out there. Let users help you make it better. Listen to customers, make changes, push the new code out,  listen some more, and fix problems as they come up.

<p>Introduction: With the  Chapultepec aqueduct , also named  the great aqueduct , the  Aztecs  built a novel uninterruptible water supply for providing fresh water to  Tenochtitlan , their fast growing jewel of a capital city. A section of the aqueduct is still around today: 
 
     
 
It's fun to think about how even 600 years ago how it was built with high availability in mind. We find  engineers being engineers , no matter the age:
  

It consisted of a twin pipe distribution system made in part of compacted soil and in part of wood for the crossings of the aqueduct over the bridges built to allow the passage of the canoes. It was finished around 1466 AD, and the main purpose was to supply fresh water to Mexico-Tenochtitlan, to mitigate its thirst.


The main source for the aqueduct was the spring of Chapultepec and the purpose of the twin pipes was to ease the maintenance of the system, because the water was conveyed through one pipe, and when it got dirty, the water was diverted to the other pipe</p><p>4 0.67163372 <a title="156-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-19-What_can_the_Amazing_Race_to_the_South_Pole_Teach_us_About_Startups%3F.html">1503 high scalability-2013-08-19-What can the Amazing Race to the South Pole Teach us About Startups?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled through  Race to the End of the Earth , a fantastic exhibit at the  Royal BC Museum  on the 1911-1912  race to the South Pole  between Norwegian explorer  Roald Amundsen  and British naval officer  Robert Scott , I couldn’t help but think of the two radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.
  I wish I could reproduce the experience of  walking through the exhibit . Plaque after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott’s choices and then nod in agreement with Amundsen’s approach. The core conflict was straight out of any ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet. And Waterfall lost.

<p>Introduction: Update :  Organism without a brain creates external memories for navigation  shows slime mold is even cooler than originally thought, storing a record of where it's been using slime: The authors conclude, the slime isn't just the mold's calling card. Instead, it's a way of marking the environment so that the organism can sense where it's been, and not expend effort on searches that won't pay off. Although the situation isn't an exact parallel, the authors make a comparison to the pheromone trails used by ants. 
 
 
 
In   After Life: The Strange Science Of Decay    there’s a truly incredible sequence of gorgeously shot video showing how    creeping slime mold    solves mazes and performs other other amazing feats of computation.

<p>Introduction: I’ve largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the “NoSQL vs. Relational” conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to build in, I’d like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint. In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I’ve inadvertently given myself plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches, and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say with a fair amount of certainty, that I’ve found a good compromise.

<p>Introduction: Update :   Speed up Apache - how I went from F to A in YSlow .  Good example of using YSlow to speed up a website with solid code examples.  Every layer in the multi-layer cake that is your website contributes to how long a page takes to display.  YSlow , from Yahoo, is a cool tool for discovering how the ingredients of your site's top layer contribute to performance.
 
YSlow analyzes web pages and tells you why they're slow based on the rules for high performance web sites. YSlow is a Firefox add-on integrated with the popular Firebug web development tool.   YSlow gives you:

<p>Introduction: Scoble   the Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.     For a strategy hit he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about when making   FeedBlendr  :     One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in designing their architecture.</p><p>4 0.79997385 <a title="156-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-11-Yahoo_Live%27s_Scaling_Problems_Prove%3A_Release_Early_and_Often_-_Just_Don%27t_Screw_Up.html">244 high scalability-2008-02-11-Yahoo Live's Scaling Problems Prove: Release Early and Often - Just Don't Screw Up</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tech Crunch chomped down on some initial scaling problems with Yahoo's new live video streaming service   Yahoo Live  . After a bit of chewing on Yahoo's old bones, TC spat out:   If Yahoo cant scale something like this (no matter how much they claim it’s an experiment, it’s still a live service), it shows how far the once brightest star of the online world has fallen  .     This kind of thinking kills innovation. When there's no room for a few hiccups or a little failure you have to cover your ass so completely nothing new will ever see the light of day.        I thought we were supposed to be   agile  . We are supposed to release early and often.  Not every 'i' has to be dotted and not every last router has to be installed before we take the first step of a grand new journey.      Get it out there. Let users help you make it better. Listen to customers, make changes, push the new code out,  listen some more, and fix problems as they come up.

<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.
 
Then you may observe after coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form of interacting patterns of flows.
 
Then you may think hey, a program isn't only useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over data and flow over other flows.
 
That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making available in the Graph extension to their  plumbing  package ( code examples ), which is described in an excellent post:  Graph: Abstractions for Structured Computation .
 
You may remember Prismatic from previous profile we did on HighScalability:  Prismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning On Social Networks To Figure Out What You Should Read On The Web .

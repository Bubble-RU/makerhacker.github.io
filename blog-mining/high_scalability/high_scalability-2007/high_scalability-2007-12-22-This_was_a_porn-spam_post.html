<p>Introduction: G'day,I noticed the default sort order for the forum is to show the posts with
the most replies first. That seems a bit odd for a forum. Would it not make
sense to show the posts with the most recently replies first?It is possible to
re-sort the forum threads that way by clicking on the "Last post" header
(twice). It would seem like a more sensible default.I've checked and I see the
same behaviour as both a registered (logged in) and anonymous user.Cheers

<p>Introduction: How do you plan to scale your system as you reach predictable milestones? This
topic came up in another venue and it reminded me about a great comment an
Anonymous wrote a while ago and I wanted to make sure that comment didn't get
lost.The Anonymous scaling plan was relatively simple and direct:My two cents
on what I'm using to start a website from scratch using a single server for
now. Later, I'll scale out horizontally when the need arises.Phase
1breakSingle Server, Dual Quad-Core 2.66, 8gb RAM, 500gb Disk Raid 10OS:
Fedora 8. You could go with pretty much any Linux though. I like Fedora 8 best
for servers.Proxy Cache: Varnish - it is way faster than Squid per my own
benchmarks. Squid chokes bigtime.Web Server: Lighttpd - faster than Apache 2
and easier to configure for me.Object Cache: Memcached. Very scalable.PHP
Cache: APC. Easy to configure and seems to work fine.Language: PHP 5 - no
bloated frameworks, waste of time for me. You spend too much time trying to
figure out the frame</p><p>4 0.10958855 <a title="190-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability_has_Moved_to_Squarespace.com%21_.html">714 high scalability-2009-10-02-HighScalability has Moved to Squarespace.com! </a></p>
<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting
HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting
services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary.
Thanks for the thought though.It's been a long long long process. Importing a
largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like
dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the
site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm
betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things.I'll
explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia
that needs to be handled to make the move complete:If you have a user account
and have posted on HighScalability before then you have a user account, but
since I don't know your passwords I had to make new passwords up for you. So
pleasecontact me and I'll give you your password so you can login and change

<p>Introduction: With over 15 billion page views a month Tumblr has become an insanely popular
blogging platform. Users may like Tumblr for its simplicity, its beauty, its
strong focus on user experience, or its friendly and engaged community, but
like it they do.Growing at over 30% a month has not been without challenges.
Some reliability problems among them. It helps to realize that Tumblr operates
at surprisingly huge scales: 500 million page views a day, a peak rate of ~40k
requests per second, ~3TB of new data to store a day, all running on 1000+
servers.One of the common patterns across successful startups is the perilous
chasm crossing from startup to wildly successful startup. Finding people,
evolving infrastructures, servicing old infrastructures, while handling huge
month over month increases in traffic, all with only four engineers, means you
have to make difficult choices about what to work on. This was Tumblr's
situation. Now with twenty engineers there's enough energy to work on issues

recallInstagram was profiled on HighScalabilityand they were also bought by
Facebook for a ton of money. A coincidence? You be the judge.Just what is

probably get a big thumbs up. To see why, please keep on reading...With over

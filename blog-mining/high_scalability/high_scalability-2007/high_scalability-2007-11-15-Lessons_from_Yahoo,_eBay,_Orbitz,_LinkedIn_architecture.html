<p>Introduction: Update 2:EBay's Randy Shoup spills the secrets of how to service hundreds of
millions of users and over two billion page views a day in ScalabilityBest
Practices: Lessons from eBayon InfoQ. The practices: Partition by Function,
Split Horizontally, Avoid Distributed Transactions, Decouple Functions
Asynchronously, Move Processing To Asynchronous Flows, Virtualize At All
Levels, Cache Appropriately.Update:eBay Serves 5 Billion API Calls Each Month.
Aren't we seeing more and more traffic driven by mashups composed on top of
open APIs? APIs are no longer a bolt on, they are your application.
Architecturally that argues for implementing your own application around the
same APIs developers and users employ.Who hasn't wondered how eBay does their
business? As one of the largest most loaded websites in the world, it can't be
easy. And the subtitle of the presentation hints at how creating such a
monster system requires true engineering: Striking a balance between site
stability, feature veloci</p><p>6 0.11142896 <a title="154-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-08-Learned_lessons_from_the_largest_player_%28Flickr%2C_YouTube%2C_Google%2C_etc%29.html">560 high scalability-2009-04-08-Learned lessons from the largest player (Flickr, YouTube, Google, etc)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm moving this from the forum section to the front page. Just FYI, any
registered user can Submit a Link to this blog. You don't have to use the
forums.In The Architectures You've Always Wondered About track at the Qcon
conference, Second Life, eBay, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Orbitz presented how they
dealt with different aspects of their applications, such as scalability. There
were quite a few lessons that I learned that day that I thought were worth
sharing.</p><p>2 0.73408455 <a title="154-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_eAccelerator_a_PHP_Accelerator.html">32 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: eAccelerator a PHP Accelerator</a></p>
<p>Introduction: eAcceleratoris a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic
content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in
their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely
eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution.
eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP
code by 1-10 times.</p><p>3 0.63479137 <a title="154-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-19-What_can_the_Amazing_Race_to_the_South_Pole_Teach_us_About_Startups%3F.html">1503 high scalability-2013-08-19-What can the Amazing Race to the South Pole Teach us About Startups?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a
quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled throughRace to
the End of the Earth, a fantastic exhibit at theRoyal BC Museumon the
1911-1912race to the South Polebetween Norwegian explorerRoald Amundsenand
British naval officerRobert Scott, I couldn't help but think of the two
radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to
see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in
software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.I
wish I could reproduce the experience ofwalking through the exhibit. Plaque
after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott's choices and then nod in
agreement with Amundsen's approach. The core conflict was straight out of any
ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet.
And Waterfall lost.As background here are some sources you may want to read to

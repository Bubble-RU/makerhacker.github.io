<p>Introduction: CloudCampis an interesting unconference where early adapters of Cloud
Computing technologies exchange ideas. With the rapid change occurring in the
industry, we need a place we can meet to share our experiences, challenges and
solutions. At CloudCamp, you are encouraged you to share your thoughts in
several open discussions, as we strive for the advancement of Cloud Computing.
End users, IT professionals and vendors are all encouraged to
participate.CloudCamp Silicon Valley 08is scheduled for Tuesday, September 30,
2008 from 06:00 PM - 10:00 PM in Sun Microsystems' EBC Briefing Center15
Network CircleMenlo Park, CA 94025CloudCamp follows an interactive, unscripted
unconference format. You can propose your own session or you can attend a
session proposed by someone else. Either way, you are encouraged to engage in
the discussion and “Vote with your feet”, which means … “find another session
if you don’t find the session helpful”. Pick and choose from the

<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with
our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting
monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously
how Netflix used Chaos Monkey, a tool to test failover handling by
continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been
added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a
problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is
handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this
approach in this very interesting post: The Netflix Simian Army.I know what
you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down
lately. Dmuino addressedthis potential embarrassment, putting all fears of
cloud inferiority to rest:Unfortunately we're not running 100% on the cloud
today. We're working on it, and we could use more help. The latest outage was

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg gave a talk on Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion-
Pitfalls and Lessons andone of the issuesthey had was that they:Did not
account for increased latency after moving to EC2. In the datacenter they had
submillisecond access between machines so it was possible to make a 1000 calls
to memache for one page load. Not so on EC2. Memcache access times increased
10x to a millisecond which made their old approach unusable. Fix was to batch
calls to memcache so a large number of gets are in one request.Dave Pacheco
had aninteresting questionabout batching requests and its impact on latency:I
was confused about the memcached problem after moving to the cloud. I
understand why network latency may have gone from submillisecond to
milliseconds, but how could you improve latency by batching requests?
Shouldn't that improve efficiency, not latency, at the possible expense of
latency (since some requests will wait on the client as they get batched)?

<p>Introduction: Adrian Singer has boiled down 7 years of experience to a set of 10 very useful
tips on how to bestoptimize NGINX and PHP-fpm for high traffic sites:Switch
from TCP to UNIX domain sockets. When communicating to processes on the same
machine UNIX sockets have better performance the TCP because there's less
copying and fewer context switches.Adjust Worker Processes. Set the
worker_processes in your nginx.conf file to the number of cores your machine
has and  increase the number of worker_connections.Setup upstream load
balancing. Multiple upstream backends on the same machine produce higher
throughout than a single one.Disable access log files. Log files on high
traffic sites involve a lot of I/O that has to be synchronized across all
threads. Can have a big impact.Enable GZip. Cache information about frequently
accessed files. Adjust client timeouts.Adjust output buffers./etc/sysctl.conf
tuning.Monitor. Continually monitor the number of open connections, free
memory and number of waiting</p><p>6 0.39033005 <a title="110-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-14-Ask_HS%3A_Design_and_Implementation_of_scalable_services%3F.html">1578 high scalability-2014-01-14-Ask HS: Design and Implementation of scalable services?</a></p>

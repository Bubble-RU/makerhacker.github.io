<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and
single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can
finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in
an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly
DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we
don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is
addingElastic IP AddressesandAvailability Zones.Elastic IP addresses are far
better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight withJessica
Albaand they are:breakStatic IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud
computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a
particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to
explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however,
Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures

<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the
DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that
will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains
mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web
server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server,
e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use
reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to
get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been
reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on
how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but
I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.The problem is that I'm
still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some
company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my questio</p><p>4 0.12078713 <a title="168-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-23-Working_With_Large_Data_Sets.html">907 high scalability-2010-09-23-Working With Large Data Sets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my blogpostWorking With Large Data Sets...For the past
18 months I've moved from working on the SMTP proxy to working on our other
systems, all of which make use of the data we collect from each connection.
It's a fair amount of data and it can be up to 2Kb in size for each
connection. Our servers receive approximately 1000 of these pieces of data per
second, which is fairly sustained due to our global distribution of customers.
If you compare that toTwitter's peak of 3,283 tweets per second (maximum of
140 characters), you can see it's not a small amount of data that we are
dealing with here.I recently set out to scientifically prove the benefits of
throttling, which is our technology for slowing down connections in order to
detect spambots, who are kind enough to disconnect quite quickly when they see
a slow connection. Due to the nature of the data we had, I needed to work with
a long range of data to show evidence that an IP that appeared on Spamhaus had

<p>Introduction: Update:A fun exploration of applied searching inHow to search for the word
"pen1s" in 185 emails every second. When indexOf doesn't cut it you just trie
harder.Has a drunken friend ever inspired you to create a first of its kind
internet service that is loved by millions, deemed subversive by thousands,
all while handling over 1.2 billion emails a year on onerickityold server?
That's how Paul Tyma came to build Mailinator.Mailinator is a free no-setup
web service for thwarting evil spammers by creating throw-away registration
email addresses. If you don't give web sites you real email address they can't
spam you. They spam Mailinator instead :-)I love design with a point-of-view
and Mailinator has a big giant harry one: performance first, second, and last.
Why? Because Mailinator is free and that allows Paul to showcase his different
perspective on design. While competitors buy big Iron to handle load, Paul
uses a big idea instead: pick the right problem and create a design to fit the</p><p>6 0.10735284 <a title="168-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-22-7_Secrets_to_Successfully_Scaling_with_Scalr_%28on_Amazon%29_by_Sebastian_Stadil.html">798 high scalability-2010-03-22-7 Secrets to Successfully Scaling with Scalr (on Amazon) by Sebastian Stadil</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers
podcastShow 15 - Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls. The
conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can
be processed by a WAF (Web Application Firewall), which inspects HTTP for
security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much
was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be
necessary, but I digress.Toterminate SSLmost shops run SSL connections into
Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for
developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of
the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.Load
balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very
efficiently in hardware. Efficiently enough that if you are willing to get rid
of the general purpose Linux boxes and use your big iron load balancers, your
server count can be decreased</p><p>4 0.62603492 <a title="168-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Product%3A_lighttpd.html">29 high scalability-2007-07-25-Product: lighttpd</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lighttpd(pronounced "lighty") is a web server which is designed to be secure,
fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-
critical environments. Its low memory footprint (compared to other web
servers), light CPU load and its speed goals make lighttpd suitable for
servers that are suffering load problems, or for serving static media
separately from dynamic content. lighttpd is free software / open source, and
is distributed under the BSD license. lighttpd runs on GNU/Linux and other
Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows.Load-balancing FastCGI, SCGI

Supporting tens of thousands of connections is clearly realistic with todays
hardware. Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing
architectures very easy and riskless, while still offering the possibility not

<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about
building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in
terms of scalability. Thepaperdescribes a new technology by the startup
company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction
of the cost of earlier possibilities.Complete Genomics is building the world's
largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey,
outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.By 2010,
their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30
petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.Do
you find this interesting and relevant to HighScalability.com?</p><p>2 0.84982276 <a title="168-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-10-Can_cloud_computing_smite_down_evil_zombie_botnet_armies%3F.html">349 high scalability-2008-07-10-Can cloud computing smite down evil zombie botnet armies?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something
calledSelf Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance(SCIT).Botnetsare created when
vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do
the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about
removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks
like adog chasing its tail). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the
availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a
great deal of sense once I thought about it.With SCIT you stop and restart VM
instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window
vulnerability)....breakThis short exposure window means worms and viri do not
have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack.
A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be
reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM
mechanisms becom</p><p>3 0.83428943 <a title="168-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Product%3A_Cacti.html">58 high scalability-2007-08-04-Product: Cacti</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cactiis a network statistics graphing tool designed as a frontend to RRDtool's
data storage and graphing functionality. It is intended to be intuitive and
easy to use, as well as robust and scalable. It is generally used to graph
time-series data like CPU load and bandwidth use.The frontend is written in
PHP; it can handle multiple users, each with their own graph sets, so it is
sometimes used by web hosting providers (especially dedicated server, virtual
private server, and colocation providers) to display bandwidth statistics for
their customers. It can be used to configure the data collection itself,
allowing certain setups to be monitored without any manual configuration of
RRDtool.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.82987016 <a title="168-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy%3A_Efficiently_Geo-referencing_IPs.html">168 high scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy: Efficiently Geo-referencing IPs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations. Jeremy Cole inOn
efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GISsuccinctly
explains the many uses for such a feature:Geo-referencing IPs is, in a
nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a
log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity
owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-
reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting
systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more
applications.This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit
of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-
rereferncing data, how to load data, and the performance of different
approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to
the subject.</p><p>5 0.82707489 <a title="168-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-01-Myth%3A_Eric_Brewer_on_Why_Banks_are_BASE_Not_ACID_-_Availability_Is_Revenue_.html">1450 high scalability-2013-05-01-Myth: Eric Brewer on Why Banks are BASE Not ACID - Availability Is Revenue </a></p>
<p>Introduction: InNoSQL: Past, Present, FutureEric Brewerhas a particularly fine section on
explaining the often hard to understand ideas ofBASE(Basically Available, Soft
State, Eventually Consistent),ACID(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,
Durability),CAP(Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a
pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in
banking.Myth: Money is important, so banksmustuse transactions to keep money
safe and consistent, right?Reality: Banking transactions are inconsistent,
particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a
partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over
Consistency.Why?1)Availability correlates with revenue and consistency
generally does not.2)Historically there was never an idea of perfect
communication so everything was partitioned.Your ATM transaction must go
through so Availability is more important than consistency. If the ATM is down
then you aren't making money.

<p>Introduction: Hi, I am   i  nterested in some exper  i  enced adv  i  ce for choosing switches for a colocated 2-t  i  er arch  i  tecture.  I have the hardware chosen for the webservers, app servers, and db servers, but need some adv  i  ce on the network sw  i  tch in between:      colocation port ->  firewa  l  l(load balancer) -> 2+ web servers (app servers)  -> gigabit sw  i  tch -> DB server(possib  l  y cluster for future expansion)     the quest  i  on is that I am just starting out, i wonder which rackmount g  i  gabit sw  i  tch to select for the private LAN between the app server -> DB servers.  Do I need managed for that?  Cisco switches are the best, but they are the most expensive...I am looking at poss  i  bly using Dell/Netgear gigab  i  t switches.     Thanks for any input</p><p>3 0.14689393 <a title="11-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-06-Economies_of_Non-Scale.html">340 high scalability-2008-06-06-Economies of Non-Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scalability forces us to think differently. What worked on a small scale doesn't always work on a large scale  -- and costs are no different. If 90% of our application is free of contention, and only 10% is spent on a shared resources, we will need to grow our compute resources by a factor of 100 to scale by a factor of 10! Another important thing to note is that 10x, in this case, is the limit of our ability to scale, even if more resources are added.     1. The cost of non-linearly scalable applications grows exponentially with the demand for more scale.   2. Non-linearly scalable applications have an absolute limit of scalability. According to Amdhal's Law, with 10% contention, the maximum scaling limit is 10. With 40% contention, our maximum scaling limit is 2.5 - no matter how many hardware resources we will throw at the problem.     This post discuss in further details how to measure the true cost of non linearly scalable systems and suggest a model for reducing that cost signifi</p><p>4 0.13370824 <a title="11-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-23-How_to_Scale_with_Ruby_on_Rails.html">389 high scalability-2008-09-23-How to Scale with Ruby on Rails</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By George Palmer of 3dogsbark.com. Covers:   * How you start out: shared hosting,  web server DB on same machine. Move two 2 machines. Minimal code changes.   * Scaling the database. Add read slaves on their own machines. Then master-master setup. Still minimal code changes.   * Scaling the web server. Load balance against multiple application servers. Application servers scale but the database doesn't.   * User clusters. Partition and allocate users to their own dedicated cluster. Requires substantial code changes.   * Caching. A large percentage of hits are read only. Use reverse proxy, memcached, and language specific cache.   * Elastic architectures. Based on Amazon EC2. Start and stop instances on demand. For global applications keep a cache on each continent, assign users to clusters by location, maintain app servers on each continent, use transaction replication software if you must replicate your site globally.</p><p>5 0.11206662 <a title="11-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-23-Which_Key_value_pair_database_to_be_used.html">578 high scalability-2009-04-23-Which Key value pair database to be used</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My Table has 2 columsn .Column1 is id,Column2 contains information  given by user about item in Column1 .User can give 3 types of information about item.I separate the opinion of single user by comma,and opinion of another user by ;.   Example-   23-34,us,56;78,in,78   I need to calculate opinions of all users very fast.My idea is to have index on key so the searching would be very fast.Currently i m using mysql .My problem is that maximum column size is below my requirement .If any overflow occurs i make new row with same id and insert data into new row.   Practically I would have around maximum 5-10 for each row.   I think if there is any database which removes this application code.   I just learn about key value pair database which is exactly i needed .   But which doesn't put constraint(i mean much better than RDMS on column size.   This application is not in production.</p><p>6 0.098500021 <a title="11-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-02-xkcd%3A_How_Standards_Proliferate%3A.html">1571 high scalability-2014-01-02-xkcd: How Standards Proliferate:</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it’s easy to forget about network-based application virtualization. But it’s the one virtualization technique you  shouldn’t  forget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad other solutions will be enabled.
   WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION VIRTUALIZATION?    
This term may not be familiar to you but that’s because since its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it’s always just been called “server virtualization”. After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the way) it was always referred to as  service virtualization  in  SOA  and XML circles. With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server virtualization solutions, it’s become impossible to just use the term “server virtualization” and “service virtualization” is just as ambiguous so it seems appropriate to giv</p><p>3 0.63204712 <a title="11-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Breakthrough_Web-Tier_Solutions_with_Record-Breaking_Performance.html">453 high scalability-2008-12-01-Breakthrough Web-Tier Solutions with Record-Breaking Performance</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We build web applications…and there are plenty of them around. Now, if we hit the jackpot and our application becomes very popular, traffic goes up, and our servers are brought down by the hordes of people coming to our website. What do we do in that situation?     Of course, I am not talking here about the kind of traffic Digg, Yahoo Buzz or other social media sites can bring to a website, which is temporary overnight traffic, or a website which uses cloud computing like Amazon EC2 service, MediaTemple Grid Service or Mosso Hosting Cloud service.     I am talking about traffic that consistently increases over time as the service achieves success. Google.com, Yahoo.com, Myspace.com, Facebook.com, Plentyoffish.com, Linkedin.com, Youtube.com and others are examples of services which have constant high traffic.     Knowing that users want speed from their applications, these services will always use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver that speed.

<p>Introduction: Too often software design patterns are overlooked by network and application delivery network architects but these patterns are often equally applicable to addressing a broad range of architectural challenges in the application delivery tier of the data center.

The “ High Scalability ” blog is fast becoming one of my favorite reads. Last week did not disappoint with a post  highlighting a set of scalability design patterns  that was, apparently, inspired by yet another High Scalability post on “ 6 Ways to Kill Your Servers: Learning to Scale the Hard Way. ”

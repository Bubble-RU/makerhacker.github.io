<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Michael Galpin inCache MoneyandCache Discussionslikes memcached for
it's expiry policy, complex graph data, process data, but says MySQL has many
advantages: SQL, Uniform Data Access, Write-through, Read-through,
Replication, Management, Cold starts, LRU eviction.Update:Dormando asksShould
you use memcached? Should you just shard mysql more?. The idea of caching is
the most important part of caching as it transports you beyond a simple CRUD
worldview. Plan for caching and sharding by properly abstracting data access
methods.Brace for change. Be ready to shard, be ready to cache. React and
change to what you push out which is actually popular, vs over planning and
wasting valuable time.Feedster's Franรงois Schiettecatte wondersifFotolog's 21

<p>Introduction: By George Palmer of 3dogsbark.com. Covers:* How you start out: shared hosting,
web server DB on same machine. Move two 2 machines. Minimal code changes.*
Scaling the database. Add read slaves on their own machines. Then master-
master setup. Still minimal code changes.* Scaling the web server. Load
balance against multiple application servers. Application servers scale but
the database doesn't.* User clusters. Partition and allocate users to their
own dedicated cluster. Requires substantial code changes.* Caching. A large
percentage of hits are read only. Use reverse proxy, memcached, and language
specific cache.* Elastic architectures. Based on Amazon EC2. Start and stop
instances on demand. For global applications keep a cache on each continent,
assign users to clusters by location, maintain app servers on each continent,
use transaction replication software if you must replicate your site globally.</p><p>5 0.09836147 <a title="149-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Designing_Web_Applications_for_Scalability.html">877 high scalability-2010-08-12-Designing Web Applications for Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I can't even count the number of times that I've heard this phrase: "don't
worry about scaling your web application, worry about visitor (or customer)
acquisition." My response to this is always that you don't need to choose one
or the other, you can do both! In this post, I'm going to go over some of the
strategies I've used to architect web applications for scalability, right from
the start of the design process, in such a way that I'm prepared to scale when
I need to, but not forced into doing so before its necessary. Easing the
transition from small scale to large scale can be made much easier by choosing
the right technologies and implementing the right coding patterns up front.You

<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a

<p>Introduction: Ehcacheis a pure Java cache with the following features: fast, simple, small
foot print, minimal dependencies, provides memory and disk stores for
scalability into gigabytes, scalable to hundreds of cachesis a pluggable cache
for Hibernate, tuned for high concurrent load on large multi-cpu servers,
provides LRU, LFU and FIFO cache eviction policies, and is production tested.
Ehcache is used byLinkedInto cache member profiles. The user guide says it's
possible to get at 2.5 times system speedup for persistent Object Relational
Caching, a 1000 times system speedup for Web Page Caching, and a 1.6 times
system speedup Web Page Fragment Caching.From the
website:breakIntroductionEhcache is a cache library. Before getting into
ehcache, it is worth stepping back and thinking about caching generally.About

UsersNeed to "grow up". The physical three tier architecture turns out to be
the root of all evil and shared nothing architectures brings simplicity and
light.In the commentsSimon Willisonmakes an insightful comment on why fine
grained caching works for personalized pages and proxy's don't:Great post, but
I have to disagree with you on the finely grained caching part. If you look at
big LAMP deployments such as Flickr, LiveJournal and Facebook the common
technology component that enables them to scale is memcached - a tool for
finely grained caching. That's not to say that they aren't doing shared-
nothing, it's just that memcached is critical for helping the database layer
scale. LiveJournal serves around 50% of its page views "permission controlled"
(friends only) so an HTTP proxy on the front end isn't the right solution -
but memcached reduces their database hits by 90%.</p><p>6 0.76577431 <a title="149-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy%3A_How_to_Manage_Sessions_Using_Memcached.html">436 high scalability-2008-11-02-Strategy: How to Manage Sessions Using Memcached</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Michael Nygard talks aboutTwo Ways To Boost Your Flagging Web Site. The idea
behind cache farms is to move memory devoted to the various caching layers
into one large farm of caches, as with memcached. The idea behind read pools
is to allocate your database read requests to a pool of dedicated read
servers, thus offloading the write server. Using a combination of the
strategies you aren't forced to scale up the database tier to scale your
website.</p><p>2 0.88418198 <a title="149-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-16-A_Super_Short_on_the_Youporn_Stack_-_300K_QPS_and_100_Million_Page_Views_Per_Day.html">1194 high scalability-2012-02-16-A Super Short on the Youporn Stack - 300K QPS and 100 Million Page Views Per Day</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly
speaking,</p><p>5 0.84542966 <a title="149-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-16-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_April_16%2C_2010.html">811 high scalability-2010-04-16-Hot Scalability Links for April 16, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scalability forces us to think differently. What worked on a small scale
doesn't always work on a large scale -- and costs are no different. If 90% of
our application is free of contention, and only 10% is spent on a shared
resources, we will need to grow our compute resources by a factor of 100 to
scale by a factor of 10! Another important thing to note is that 10x, in this
case, is the limit of our ability to scale, even if more resources are
added.1. The cost of non-linearly scalable applications grows exponentially
with the demand for more scale.2. Non-linearly scalable applications have an
absolute limit of scalability. According to Amdhal's Law, with 10% contention,
the maximum scaling limit is 10. With 40% contention, our maximum scaling
limit is 2.5 - no matter how many hardware resources we will throw at the
problem.This post discuss in further details how to measure the true cost of
non linearly scalable systems and suggest a model for reducing that cost
significantly.</p><p>4 0.26938856 <a title="44-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Flickr.html">41 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Flickr</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Why isn't Google's aggressive new database pricing strategy getting more pub?
That's whatBill Katz, instigator of theGAE Meetupand prize winningscience
fiction authoris wondering:It's surprising that the blogosphere hasn't picked
up the biggest difference in pricing:Google's datastore is less than a tenth
of the price of Amazon's SimpleDB while offering a better API.If money matters
to you then the burn rate under GAE could be convincingly lower. Let's compare
the numbers:breakGAE pricing:* $0.10 - $0.12 per CPU core-hour* $0.15 - $0.18
per GB-month of storage* $0.11 - $0.13 per GB outgoing bandwidth* $0.09 -
$0.11 per GB incoming bandwidthSimpleDB Pricing:* $0.14 per Amazon SimpleDB
Machine Hour consumed* Structured Data Storage - $1.50 per GB-month* $0.100
per GB - all data transfer in* $0.170 per GB - first 10 TB / month data

<p>Introduction: Now you can buy more cores on EC2 without adding more machines:The High-CPU
Medium Instance is billed at $0.20 (20 cents) per hour. It features 1.7 GB of
memory, 5 EC2 Compute Units (2 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units Each),
and 350 GB of instance storage, all on a 32-bit platform.The High-CPU Extra
Large Instance is billed at $0.80 (80 cents) per hour. It features 7 GB of
memory, 20 EC2 Compute Units (8 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units
each), and 1,690 GB of instance storage, all on a 64-bit platform.Diagonal

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: Web Analytics: An Hour A Day is the first book by an in-the-trenches
practitioner of web analytics. It provides a unique insider’s perspective of
the challenges and opportunities that web analytics presents to each person
who touches the Web in your organization. Rather than spamming you with
metrics and definitions, Web Analytics: An Hour A Day will enhance your
mindset and teach you how to fish for yourself.Avinash Kaushik is a expert in
web analytics and author of the top-rated blog Occam’s Razor
(http://www.kaushik.net/avinash). In this book, he goes beyond web analytics
concepts and definitions to provide a step-by-step guide to implementing a

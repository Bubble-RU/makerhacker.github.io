<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is adding   Elastic IP Addresses   and   Availability Zones  .     Elastic IP addresses are far better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight with   Jessica Alba   and they are:        Static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures by programmatica</p><p>3 0.087819099 <a title="114-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy%3A_Efficiently_Geo-referencing_IPs.html">168 high scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy: Efficiently Geo-referencing IPs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations.  Jeremy Cole in   On efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GIS   succinctly explains the many uses for such a feature:     Geo-referencing IPs is, in a nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more applications.       This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-rereferncing data, how to load data,  and the performance of different approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to the subject.</p><p>4 0.086723037 <a title="114-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-14-Product%3A_The_Spread_Toolkit.html">122 high scalability-2007-10-14-Product: The Spread Toolkit</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Complex applications coordinating work across a lot of machines often need a highly performing fault tolerant message layer. Though a blast to write, it's probably a better use of your time to use an off the shelf solution. And that's where  Spread  comes in. Flickr, for example, uses Spread to create real-time event feeds from their web server logs. What exactly is Spread?
   
 From the  Spread  website:
    Spread is an open source toolkit that provides a high performance messaging service that is resilient to faults across local and wide area networks. Spread functions as a unified message bus for distributed applications, and provides highly tuned application-level multicast, group communication, and point to point support. Spread services range from reliable messaging to fully ordered messages with delivery guarantees.  Spread can be used in many distributed applications that require high reliability, high performance, and robust communication among various subsets of members.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Yahoo! Launches World's Largest Hadoop Production Application . A 10,000 core Hadoop cluster produces data used in every Yahoo! Web search query. Raw disk is at 5 Petabytes. Their previous 1 petabyte database couldn't handle the load and couldn't grow larger.  Greg Linden  thinks the Google cluster has way over 133,000 machines.      From an InfoQ   interview   with project lead Doug Cutting, it appears   Hadoop  , an open source distributed computing platform, is making good progress towards their 1.0 release. They've successfully reached a 1000 node cluster size, improved file system integrity, and jacked performance by 20x in the last year.     How they are making progress could be a good model for anyone:           The speedup has been an aggregation of our work in the past few years, and has been accomplished mostly by trial-and-error. We get things running smoothly on a cluster of a given size, then double the size of the cluster and see what breaks.

<p>Introduction: Lustre速  is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system. It is designed, developed and maintained by Cluster File Systems, Inc.  The central goal is the development of a next-generation cluster file system which can serve clusters with 10,000's of nodes, provide petabytes of storage, and move 100's of GB/sec with state-of-the-art security and management infrastructure.  Lustre runs on many of the largest Linux clusters in the world, and is included by CFS's partners as a core component of their cluster offering (examples include HP StorageWorks SFS, and the Cray XT3 and XD1 supercomputers). Today's users have also demonstrated that Lustre scales down as well as it scales up, and runs in production on clusters as small as 4 and as large as 25,000 nodes.  The latest version of Lustre is always available from Cluster File Systems, Inc. Public Open Source releases of Lustre are available under the GNU General Public License. These releases are found here, and are used</p><p>3 0.6582045 <a title="114-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Product%3A_ISPMan_Centralized_ISP_Management_System_.html">228 high scalability-2008-01-28-Product: ISPMan Centralized ISP Management System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  FRESH Ports  and their website:    ISPman  is an ISP management software written in perl, using an LDAP backend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP.  It can be used to manage, DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration, cyrus mail boxes, proftpd etc.    
 
 ISPMan was written as a management tool for the network at 4unet where between 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is crazily growing. Managing these domains and their users was a little time consuming, and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these daemons fluently.  Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and users.  LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server can be scaled from 1 to n as required.  An LDAP entry called maildrop tells the SMTP server (postfix) where to deliver the mail.  The SMTP servers can be loadbalanced with one of many load balancing techniques.  The program is written with scalability and High availability in mind.  This may not be the right s</p><p>4 0.65323538 <a title="114-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-08-Product%3A_FAI_-_Fully_Automatic_Installation.html">272 high scalability-2008-03-08-Product: FAI - Fully Automatic Installation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From their website:    FAI  is an automated installation tool to install or deploy Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat, autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used for configuration management of a running system.  You can take one or more virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed, configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized management system for your Linux deployment.  
   
  FAI's target group are system administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a rendering farm,</p><p>5 0.61422521 <a title="114-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-12-Netflix%3A_Developing%2C_Deploying%2C_and_Supporting_Software_According_to_the_Way_of_the_Cloud.html">1155 high scalability-2011-12-12-Netflix: Developing, Deploying, and Supporting Software According to the Way of the Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At a  Cloud Computing Meetup , Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:  Keeping Movies Running Amid Thunderstorms . While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the cloud, issues with capacity planning,  thundering herds , latency problems, and  simian armageddon , I found myself most taken with how they handle  software deployment in the cloud .
 
I've worked on half a dozen or more build and deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant software deployments:  the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to completely run a new release while running the old release at the same time .
 
The process goes something like:

<p>Introduction: Wackamole  is an application that helps with making a cluster highly available. It manages a bunch of virtual IPs, that should be available to the outside world at all times. Wackamole ensures that a single machine within a cluster is listening on each virtual IP address that Wackamole manages.
 
If it discovers that particular machines within the cluster are not alive, it will almost immediately ensure that other machines acquire these public IPs. At no time will more than one machine listen on any virtual IP. Wackamole also works toward achieving a balanced distribution of number IPs on the machine within the cluster it manages.   There is no other software like Wackamole. Wackamole is quite unique in that it operates in a completely peer-to-peer mode within the cluster. Other products that provide the same high-availability guarantees use a "VIP" method.  Wackamole is an application that runs as root in a cluster to make it highly available. It uses the membership notifications prov</p><p>2 0.84186113 <a title="114-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-15-Scaling_Ambition_at_StackOverflow.html">777 high scalability-2010-02-15-Scaling Ambition at StackOverflow</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joel Spolsky and Jeff   Atwood are  raising VC money  for    StackOverflow.  This is interesting for three reasons: 1) Joel has always seemed like a keep it small and grow organically type of guy, so this is a big step in a different direction. 2) It means they think there's a very big market in the Q&A; space and they mean to capture as much as the market as possible. 3) Most importantly for this blog, Joel gives some good advice on when to stay fresh and local and when it's time to jump for the brass ring, scale up your ambition, and go for VC money. Please see  Joel's blog  post for the details, but here's when to go VC:
  
 There’s a land grab going on. 
 There is a provable concept that’s repeatable. 
 The business itself could benefit from the publicity. 
 The investor will add substantial value to the business. 
 The business can potentially have a big exit or become a large, publically traded company. 
 The founders are not in it for their own personal aggrandizement.

<p>Introduction: In the scalability is specialization department here is an interesting paper presented at  HotNets '13  on high performance networking:  Network Stack Specialization for Performance .
 
The idea is generalizing a service so it fits in the kernel comes at a high performance cost. So move TCP into user space.  The result is a web server with ~3.5x the throughput of Nginx "while experiencing low CPU utilization, linear scaling on multicore systems, and saturating current NIC hardware."
 
Here's a good description of the paper published  on Layer 9 :
  Traditionally, servers and OSes have been built to be general purpose. However now we have a high degree of specialization. In fact, in a big web service, you might have thousands of machines dedicated to one function. Therefore, there's scope for specialization. This paper looks at a specific opportunity in that space. Network stacks today are good for high throughput with large transfers, but not small files (which are common in web browsi</p><p>4 0.79137194 <a title="114-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-25-Strategy%3A_Rule_of_3_Admins_to_Save_Your_Sanity.html">830 high scalability-2010-05-25-Strategy: Rule of 3 Admins to Save Your Sanity</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The idea came up in this Hacker News  thread , commenting on a 37signals interview, that having three system administrators is the minimum optimal number of admins. Everyone wants to lower their costs by having each admin administer a lot of machines. The problem is when you have fewer than three admins you can never get a break from the constant corrosive pressure of always being on call. When every moment of your life you are dreading the next emergency, it eats at you. Having three admins solves that problem. With three admins you can:
  
 Go on a real vacation. The two remaining admins can switch off being on call. 
 Not be on call all the time. 
  
A larger shop will naturally have more admins so it's not as big an issue, but at smaller shops trying to minimize head count, carrying three admins (or people in those roles) might be something to consider.</p><p>5 0.78933483 <a title="114-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-16-The_VeriScale_Architecture_-_Elasticity_and_efficiency_for_private_clouds.html">706 high scalability-2009-09-16-The VeriScale Architecture - Elasticity and efficiency for private clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model, which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model, networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sunâ&euro;&trade;s VeriScale architecture provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun Microsystems has been developing open and modular infrastructure architectures for more than a decade. The features of these architectures, such as elasticity, ar</p><p>6 0.78079778 <a title="114-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-13-Plenty_of_Fish_Says_Scaling_for_Free_Doesn%27t_Pay.html">442 high scalability-2008-11-13-Plenty of Fish Says Scaling for Free Doesn't Pay</a></p>

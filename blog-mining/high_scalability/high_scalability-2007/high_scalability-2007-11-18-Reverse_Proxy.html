<p>Introduction: NetApp MetroCluster SoftwareCost-effective is an integrated high-availability
storage cluster and site failover capability.NetApp MetroCluster is an
integrated high-availability and disaster recovery solution that can reduce
system complexity and simplify management while ensuring greater return on
investment. MetroCluster uses clustered server technology to replicate data
synchronously between sites located miles apart, eliminating data loss in case
of a disruption. Simple and powerful recovery process minimizes downtime, with
little or no user action required.At one company I worked at they used the
NetApp snap mirror feature to replicate data across long distances to multiple
datacenters. They had a very fast backbone and it worked well. The issue with
NetApp is always one of cost, but if you can afford it, it's a good option.</p><p>3 0.077068403 <a title="159-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-12-Technology_behind_mediatemple_grid_service_.html">90 high scalability-2007-09-12-Technology behind mediatemple grid service </a></p>

<p>Introduction: A user named Apathyon how Reddit scales some of their features, shares some
advice he learned while working at Google and other major companies.To be
fair, I [Apathy] was working at Google at the time, and every job I held
between 1995 and 2005 involved at least one of the largest websites on the
planet. I didn't come up with any of these ideas, just watched other smart
people I worked with who knew what they were doing and found (or wrote) tools
that did the same things. But the theme is always the same:Cache everything
you can and store the rest in some sort of database (not necessarily
relational and not necessarily centralized).Cache everything that doesn't
change rapidly. Most of the time you don't have to hit the database for
anything other than checking whether the users' new message count has
transitioned from 0 to (1 or more).Cache everything--templates, user message
status, the front page components--and hit the database once a minute or so to
update the front page, forums, e</p><p>5 0.063193865 <a title="159-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-21-Thread_Pool_Engine_in_MS_CLR_4%2C_and_Work-Stealing_scheduling_algorithm.html">575 high scalability-2009-04-21-Thread Pool Engine in MS CLR 4, and Work-Stealing scheduling algorithm</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site
has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this
day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out
the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was
taking too much load.There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my
database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I
have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain
PHP/HTML coding is used.Technology:PHP -- 5.2MYSQL -- 5.0Apache --

<p>Introduction: You may have noticed something is a little a different when visiting
HighScalability today: We've Moved! HighScalability.com has switched hosting
services to Squarespace.com. House warming gifts are completely unnecessary.
Thanks for the thought though.It's been a long long long process. Importing a
largish Drupal site to Wordpress and then into Squarespace is a bit like
dental work without the happy juice, but the results are worth it. While the
site is missing a few features I think it looks nicer, feels faster, and I'm
betting it will be more scalable and more reliable. All good things.I'll
explain more about the move later in this post, but there's some admistrivia
that needs to be handled to make the move complete:If you have a user account
and have posted on HighScalability before then you have a user account, but
since I don't know your passwords I had to make new passwords up for you. So
pleasecontact me and I'll give you your password so you can login and change
it. Then you c</p><p>4 0.6609621 <a title="159-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-01-Guess_How_Many_Users_it_Takes_to_Kill_Your_Site%3F.html">614 high scalability-2009-06-01-Guess How Many Users it Takes to Kill Your Site?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Here's thefirst result. Good response time until 400 users. At 1,340
users the response time was 6 seconds. And at 2000 users the site was

reputation started at 1000 users. Cheers to the company that had the guts to
give this a try.That which doesn't kill your site makes it stronger. Or at
least that's the capacity planning strategy John Allspaw recommends (not
really, but I'm trying to make a point here) inThe Art of Capacity
Planning:Using production traffic to define your resources ceilings in a
controlled setting allows you to see firsthand what would happen when you run
out of capacity in a particular resource. Of course I'm not suggesting that
you run your site into the ground, but better to know what your real (not
simulated) loads are while you're watching, than find out the hard way. In
addition, a lot of unexpected systemic things can happen when load increases

<p>Introduction: BeforeWe started with a small site, a mess of open source, and a small team
that didn't know much about scaling.AfterWe ended with a large site, a medium
sized team, and an architecture that has scaled.We never stopped. We used a
roadmap and a compass, made weekly changes in direction, regularly shipped
code on Wednesday to handle the next weekend's capacity constraints, and
shipped new features the whole time.These are excerpts from the IMVU PDF
presentation of their architecture which can be viewed or
downloadedhere.IMVUis an online destination where adults and teens meet new
people in 3D. IMVU won the 2008 Virtual Worlds Innovation Award and was also

<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for
"CloudAPIportability," which implies a series of misconceptions.If we break
away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud
portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly
simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without
settling on a common CloudAPI.In this post i'll be covering five common
misconceptions people haveWRTto cloud portability.Cloud portability = Cloud
API portability. API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.The
main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in.Cloud
portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-
in.Cloud portability isn't for startups. Every startup that is expecting rapid
growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability
rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared
to do so.Cloud portability = Compromising on t</p><p>3 0.63428652 <a title="159-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-29-CTL_-_Distributed_Control_Dispatching_Framework_.html">433 high scalability-2008-10-29-CTL - Distributed Control Dispatching Framework </a></p>
<p>Introduction: CTLis aflexible distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to
break management processes into reusable control modules and execute them in
distributed fashion over the network.From their website:CTL is a flexible
distributed control dispatching framework that enables you to break management
processes into reusable control modules and execute them in distributed
fashion over the network.What does CTL do?CTL helps you leverage your current
scripts and tools to easily automate any kind of distributed systems
management or application provisioning task. Its good for simplifiying large-
scale scripting efforts or as another tool in your toolbox that helps you
speed through your daily mix of ad-hoc administration tasks.What are CTL's
features?CTL has many features, but the general highlights are:* Execute
sophisticated procedures in distributed environments - Aren't you tired of
writing and then endlessly modifying scripts that loop over nodes and invoke
remote actions? CTL d</p><p>4 0.63056016 <a title="159-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-28-Need_for_change_in_your_IT_infrastructure_.html">731 high scalability-2009-10-28-Need for change in your IT infrastructure </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Companies earnings outstripforecasts, consumer confidence is retuning and city
bonuses areback. What does this mean for business? Growth! After the recent
years of cost cutting in IT budgets, there is the sudden fear induced from
increased demand. Pre-existing trouble points in IT infrastructures that have
lain dormant will suddenly be exposed. Monthly reporting and real time
analytics will suffer as data grows. IT departments across the land will be
crying out "The engine canna take no more captain". What can be done?.entry-
bodyWhat we need is a scalable system that grows with the business. A system
that can handle sudden increases in data growth without falling over. There
are two core principles to a scalable system (1) Users experience constant QoS
as demand grows (2) System Architects can grow system capacity proportionally
with the available resources. In other words, if demand increases twofold, it
is "enough" to purchase twice the hardware.This is linear growth. Is it enough

<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use

<p>Introduction: Thisposton www.ilovebonnie.net documents some impressive system performance
improvements by the addition ofSquid Cache(a caching proxy) andAPC
Cache(opcode cache for PHP).Apache is able to deliver roughly 700% more
requests per second with Squid when serving 1KB and 100KB images.Server load
is reduced using Squid because the server does not have to create a bunch of
Apache processes to handle the requests.APC Cache took a system that could
barely handle 10-20 requests per second to handling 50-60 requests per second.
A 400% increase.APC allowed the load times to remain under 5 seconds even with
200 concurrent threads slamming on the server.These two caches are easy to
setup and install and allow you to get a lot more performance out of them.The
post has an in-depth discussion and a number of supporting charts. The primary
point is how simple it can be to improve performance and scalability by adding
caching.</p><p>3 0.1801735 <a title="74-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-Wikimedia_architecture.html">72 high scalability-2007-08-22-Wikimedia architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Save 25% on Hadoop Conference TicketsApache Hadoop is a hot technology getting
traction all over the enterprise and in the Web 2.0 world. Now, there's going
to be a conference dedicated to learning more about Hadoop. It'll be Friday,
October 2 at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City.Hadoop World, as it's being
called, will be the first Hadoop event on the east coast. Morning sessions
feature talks by Amazon, Cloudera, Facebook, IBM, and Yahoo! Then it breaks
out into three tracks: applications, development / administration, and
extensions / ecosystems. In addition to the conference itself, there will also
be 3 days of training prior to the event for those looking to go deeper. In
addition to general sessions speakers, presenters include Hadoop project
creator Doug Cutting, as well as experts on large-scale data from Intel,
Rackspace, Softplayer, eHarmony, Supermicro, Impetus, Booz Allen Hamilton,
Vertica, About.com, and other companies.Readers get a 25% discount if you

<p>Introduction: How do you plan to scale your system as you reach predictable milestones? This
topic came up in another venue and it reminded me about a great comment an
Anonymous wrote a while ago and I wanted to make sure that comment didn't get
lost.The Anonymous scaling plan was relatively simple and direct:My two cents
on what I'm using to start a website from scratch using a single server for
now. Later, I'll scale out horizontally when the need arises.Phase
1breakSingle Server, Dual Quad-Core 2.66, 8gb RAM, 500gb Disk Raid 10OS:
Fedora 8. You could go with pretty much any Linux though. I like Fedora 8 best
for servers.Proxy Cache: Varnish - it is way faster than Squid per my own
benchmarks. Squid chokes bigtime.Web Server: Lighttpd - faster than Apache 2
and easier to configure for me.Object Cache: Memcached. Very scalable.PHP
Cache: APC. Easy to configure and seems to work fine.Language: PHP 5 - no
bloated frameworks, waste of time for me. You spend too much time trying to

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJeff Sufrom Factual.What is Varnish?Varnishis an open
source, high performance http accelerator that sits in front of a web stack
and caches pages.  This caching layer is very configurable and can be used for
both static and dynamic content.One great thing about Varnish is that it can
improve the performance of your website without requiring any code changes.
If you haven't heard of Varnish (or have heard of it, but haven't used it),
please read on.  Adding Varnish to your stack can be completely noninvasive,
but if you tweak your stack to play along with some of varnish's more advanced
features, you'll be able to increase performance by orders of magnitude.Some
of the high profile companies using Varnish include: Twitter, Facebook, Heroku
and LinkedIn.Our Use CaseOne of Factual's first high profile projects was
Newsweek's "America's Best High Schools: The List". After realizing that we
had only a few weeks to increase our throughput by tenfold, we looked into a</p><p>4 0.62623936 <a title="74-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-27-Handle_700_Percent_More_Requests_Using_Squid_and_APC_Cache.html">662 high scalability-2009-07-27-Handle 700 Percent More Requests Using Squid and APC Cache</a></p>

<p>Introduction: nginx is a high performance smtp/pop/imap proxy that lets you do custom
authorization and lookups and is very scalable. (just add nodes)Nginx by
default is a reverse proxy and this is what it is doing here for pop/imap
connections. It is also an excellelent reverse proxy for web
servers.Advantage: You dont have to have a speacial database or ldap schema.
Just an url to do auth and lookup with.A url that may be accessed by a unix or
a tcp socket. Write your own auth handler - according to your own policy.For
example:A user called atif tries to login with the pass testxyz.You pass this
infomation to a URL such assocket:/var/tmp/xyz.sockorhttp://auth.corp.mailserv
er.net:someport/someurlThe auth server replies with either a FAILURE such
asAuth-Status: Invalid Login or passwordor with a success such asAuth-Status:

<p>Introduction: SummaryIn this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing
stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services
application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out
model.BioNati Shalom is the CTO and Founder ofGigaSpacesand responsible for
the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed
technology and architecture namely CORBA, Jini, J2EE, Grid and SOA. Nati is
the Head of the Israeli Grid consortium and an evangelist of Space Based
Architecture and Data Grid patterns. Blog:Gigaspaces BlogRead the rest of the

<p>Introduction: Varnishis a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is
targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take
full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered
by these operating systems.Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high
performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be
configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like
computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.Varnish is reported to
be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>3 0.82792425 <a title="74-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-03-Building_a_Data_Intensive_Web_Application_with_Cloudera%2C_Hadoop%2C_Hive%2C_Pig%2C_and_EC2.html">669 high scalability-2009-08-03-Building a Data Intensive Web Application with Cloudera, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, and EC2</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Comet is anactive distributed key-value storebuilt at the University of
Washington. The paper describing Comet is Comet: An active distributed key-
value store, there are also slides, and a MP3 of a presentation given atOSDI
'10. Here's a succinct overview of Comet:Today's cloud storage services, such
as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety
of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes,
fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility
first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption
keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage
service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their
data's behavior inside the storage service.I found this paper quite
interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-
value store, which turns it into what might called a key-code store. This is
something</p><p>6 0.6636008 <a title="74-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-31-Sponsored_Post%3A_aiCache%2C_Next_Big_Sound%2C_ElasticHosts%2C_Red_5_Studios%2C_Attribution_Modeling%2C_Logic_Monitor%2C_New_Relic%2C_AppDynamics%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1185 high scalability-2012-01-31-Sponsored Post: aiCache, Next Big Sound, ElasticHosts, Red 5 Studios, Attribution Modeling, Logic Monitor, New Relic, AppDynamics, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

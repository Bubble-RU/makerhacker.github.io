<p>Introduction: One of the world's leading technical institutes, the Tokyo Institute of
Technology (Tokyo Tech) created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of
the largest outside of the United States. Using Sun x64 servers and data
servers deployed in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective,
flexible supercomputer that meets the demands of compute- and data-intensive
applications. Built in just 35 days, the TSUBAME grid includes hundreds of
systems incorporating thousands of processor cores and terabytes of memory,
and delivers 47.38 trillion1 floating-point operations per second (TeraFLOPS)
of sustained LINPACK benchmark performance and 1.1 petabyte of storage to
users running common off-the-shelf applications. Based on the deployment
architecture, the grid is expected to reach 100 TeraFLOPS in the future. This

<p>Introduction: Scientists are doing it for themselves. Doing what? Databases. The idea is
that most databases are designed to meet the needs of businesses, not science,
so scientists are banding together atscidb.orgto create their own Domain
Specific Database, for science. The goal is to be able to handle datasets in
the 100PB range and larger.SciDB, Inc. is building an open source database
technology product designed specifically to satisfy the demands of data-
intensive scientific problems. With the advice of the world's leading
scientists across a variety of disciplines including astronomy, biology,
physics, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and climatology, our computer
scientists are currently designing and prototyping this technologyThe
scientists that are participating in our open source project believe that the
SciDB database -- when completed -- will dramatically impact their ability to
conduct their experiments faster and more efficiently and further improve the
quality of life on our pla</p><p>5 0.14558575 <a title="46-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Useful_Cloud_Computing_Blogs.html">445 high scalability-2008-11-14-Useful Cloud Computing Blogs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:Now that we have a new computing paradigm,
Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data
vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds?
Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space,
and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still
seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids
versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are
a number of issues driving this uncertainty.read more at:BigDataMatters.com</p><p>6 0.66175538 <a title="46-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-21-What_does_the_next_generation_data_center_look_like%3F.html">69 high scalability-2007-08-21-What does the next generation data center look like?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TheSun Grid Compute Utilityis a simple to use, simple to access data center-
on-demand. Sun Grid delivers enterprise computing power and resources over the
Internet, enabling developers, researchers, scientists and businesses to
optimize performance, speed time to results, and accelerate innovation without
investment in IT infrastructure. No matter the size of your business or the
size of your job -- there is no barrier to entry and exit. This is the future
of computing available today: IT as a service.</p><p>2 0.92693424 <a title="46-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-26-Golden_rule_of_web_caching.html">194 high scalability-2007-12-26-Golden rule of web caching</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sorry, the content for this post apparently did not make the transition from
the old HighScalability website, it's all messed up, but there's still a some
useful content...EVE Onlineis "The World's Largest Game Universe", a massively
multiplayer online game (MMO) made by CCP. EVE Online's Architecture is
unusual for a MMOG because it doesn't divide the player load among different
servers or shards. Instead, the same cluster handles the entire EVE universe.
It is an interesting to compare this with theArchitecture of the Second Life
Grid. How do they manage to scale?Information SourcesEVE Insider Dev BlogEVE

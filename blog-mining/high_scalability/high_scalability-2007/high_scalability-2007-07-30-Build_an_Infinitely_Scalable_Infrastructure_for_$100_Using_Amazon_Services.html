<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: Update 2: SummizeComputes Computing Resources for a Startup. Lots of nice
graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost
efficient for well used larger machines. Long term storage costs may eat your
saving away. And out of cloud bandwidth costs are high.Update:
viaProductionScale, a nice Digital Web article onhow to setup S3 to store
media filesand how Blue Origin was able to handle 3.5 million requests and 758
GBs in bandwidth in a single day for very little $$$. Also a Right Scale
article onNetwork performance within Amazon EC2 and to Amazon S3. 75MB/s
between EC2 instances, 10.2MB/s between EC2 and S3 for download, 6.9MB/s
upload.Now that Amazon's S3 (storage service) isout of betaand EC2 (elastic
compute cloud) has added newinstance types(the class of machine you can rent)
with more CPU and more RAM, I thought it would be interesting to take a look
out how their pricing stacks up.The quick conclusion:the more you scale the
more you save. A six node co</p><p>4 0.24262491 <a title="38-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-07-The_Canonical_Cloud_Architecture_.html">674 high scalability-2009-08-07-The Canonical Cloud Architecture </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Simone Brunozzi, technology evangelist for Amazon Web Services in Europe,
describes how Soocial.com was fully ported to Amazon web services.
----------------This period of the year I decided to dedicate some time to
better understand how our customers use AWS, therefore I spent some online
time with Stefan Fountain and the nice guys at Soocial.com, a "one address
book solution to contact management", and I would like to share with you some
details of their IT infrastructure, which now runs 100% on Amazon Web
Services!In the last few months, they've been working hard to cope with tens
of thousands of users and to get ready to easily scale to millions. To make
this possible, they decided to move ALL their architecture to Amazon Web
Services. Despite the fact that they were quite happy with their previous
hosting provider, Amazon proved to be the way to go.-----------------Read the

to sell your digital content as professionally printed products, like photo

API, too.Printcloud is the system that powers the print button. It exists in
the cloud only, growing when needed and becoming smaller if it can. The system
takes in print orders, magically transforms tough data into print-ready files

intended recipient.To preserve the environment, Peecho's philosophy is to

point private cloud. Dan Brown shows how step-by-step in How I Created My Own
Personal Cloud Using BitTorrent Sync, Owncloud, and Raspberry Pi. BitTorrent
Sync is used to copy large files around. Raspberry Pi is a cheap low power
always on device with BitTorrent Sync installed. Owncloud is an open source
cloud that provides a web interface for file access files from anywhere.This
is different. Funding astartup using Airbnb as a source of start-up capital.
It beats getting a part-time job and one of your guests might even be a
VC.This is not different. Old industries clawing and digging in, using the
tools of power to beat back competition. Steve Blank details a familiar story

<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.The future looks many,
big, complex, and adaptive:Many clouds.Many servers.Many operating
systems.Many languages.Many storage services.Many database services.Many
software services.Many adjunct human networks (like Mechanical Turk).Many fast
interconnects.Many CDNs.Many cache memory pools.Many application profiles
(simple request-response, live streaming, computationally complex, sensor
driven, memory intensive, storage intensive, monolithic, decomposable,
etc).Many legal jurisdictions. Don't want to perform a function on Patriot Act
"protected" systems then move the function elsewhere.Many SLAs.Many data
driven pricing policies that like airplane pricing algorithms will price
"seats" to maximize profit using multi-variate time sensitive pricing
models.Many competitive products. The need to defend your territory never

<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: Quotable Quotes:@ibogost: Disabling features
of SimCity due to ineffective central infrastructure is probably the most
realistic simulation of the modern city.antirez: The point is simply to show
how SSDs can't be considered, currently, as a bit slower version of memory.
Their performance characteristics are a lot more about, simply, "faster
disks".@jessenoller: I only use JavaScript so I can gain maximum scalability
across multiple cores. Also unicorns. Paint thinner gingerbread@liammclennan:
high-scalability ruby. Why bother?@scomma: Problem with BitCoin is not
scalability, not even usability. It's whether someone will crack the algorithm
and render BTC entirely useless.@webclimber: Amazing how often I find myself
explaining that scalability is not magical@mvmsan: Flash as Primary Storage -
Highest Cost, Lack of HA, scalability and management features #flash #SSD

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by BugSense Founder/CTO Jon Vlachogiannisand Head of
Infrastructure at BugSensePanagiotis Papadomitsos.There has been a lot of
speculation and assumptions around whetherPRISMexists and if it is cost
effective. I don't know whether it exists or not, but I can tell you if it
could be built.Short answer: It can.If you believe it would be impossible for
someone with access to a social "datapool" to find out more about you (if they
really want to track you down) in the tsunami of data, you need to think
again.Devices, apps and websites are transmitting data. Lots of data. The
questions are could the data compiled and searched and how costly would it be
to search for your targeted data. (hint: It is not $4.56 trillion).Let's
experiment and try to build PRISM by ourselves with a few
assumptions:Assumption 1: We have all the appropriate "data connectors" that
will provide us with data.Assumption 2: These connectors provide direct access
to social networks, emails, mobile t</p><p>6 0.98486519 <a title="38-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-22-Google_Architecture.html">448 high scalability-2008-11-22-Google Architecture</a></p>

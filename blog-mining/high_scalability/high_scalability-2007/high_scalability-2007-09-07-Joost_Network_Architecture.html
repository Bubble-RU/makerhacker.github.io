<p>Introduction: The first meeting of this Online Gaming High Scalability SIG will be on the
9th of July 2009 in central London, starting at 10 AM and finishing around
5PM.The main topic of this meeting will be potentials for using cloud and grid
technologies in online gaming systems. In addition to experience reports from
the community, we have invited some of the leading cloud experts in the UK to
discuss the benefits such as resource elasticity and challenges such as
storage and security that companies from other industries have experienced. We
will have a track for IT managers focused on business opportunities and issues
and a track for architects and developers more focused on implementation
issues.The event is free but up-front registration is required for capacity
planning, so please let us know in advance, if you are planning to attend by
completing the registration form on this pageTo propose a talk or for

<p>Introduction: The first meeting will take place on Wednesday March 26 at 6 p.m. in the IBM
Innovation Center (Waltham, MA). The first speaker will be Patrick Peralta of
Oracle! Patrick will be presenting:Orchestrating Messaging, Data Grid and
Database for Scalable Performance. Important Note:There will be pizza at this
meeting!The site is at: http://www.bostonsug.org/</p><p>4 0.081323259 <a title="83-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-18-Forum_sort_order.html">370 high scalability-2008-08-18-Forum sort order</a></p>
<p>Introduction: G'day,I noticed the default sort order for the forum is to show the posts with
the most replies first. That seems a bit odd for a forum. Would it not make
sense to show the posts with the most recently replies first?It is possible to
re-sort the forum threads that way by clicking on the "Last post" header
(twice). It would seem like a more sensible default.I've checked and I see the
same behaviour as both a registered (logged in) and anonymous user.Cheers

<p>Introduction: Hi,I was wondering if I could borrow the collective minds of you all to draw
up a list to the CDN's that you'd use/do use in the UK. If they're outside the
UK but have decent support then also include. The service must be cheap and
not require a huge setup fee, it's really only for a small time business; it
shares video & high-res pics so mass cheap storage is a must and wondered
whether you guys had any ideas, also costs?Mass storage isn't cheap in the UK
compared to the states, for example, unless I go colo but as I say, it's a
small setup but happens to require a fair bit of space. Would S3 be a good
starting point? What is the service like? I hear mixed reviews about it.Many
thanks,Jim</p><p>6 0.07170631 <a title="83-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-20-Paper%3A_Flux%3A_An_Adaptive_Partitioning_Operator_for_Continuous_Query_Systems.html">604 high scalability-2009-05-20-Paper: Flux: An Adaptive Partitioning Operator for Continuous Query Systems</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the past year, Intel issued a series of powerful chips under the new
Nehalem microarchitecture, with large numbers of cores and extensive memory
capacity. This new class of chips is is part of a bigger Intel initiative
referred to as Tera-Scale Computing. Cisco has released their Unified
Computing System (UCS) equipped with a unique extended memory and high speed
network within the box, which is specifically geared to take advantage of this
type of CPU architecture .This new class of hardware has the potential to
revolutionize the IT landscape as we know it.In  this post, I want to focus
primarily on the potential implications on application architecture, more

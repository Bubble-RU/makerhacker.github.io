<p>Introduction: How do we debug and profile a cloud full of processors and threads? It's a
problem more will be seeing as we code big scary programs that run on even
bigger scarier clouds. Logging gets you far, but sometimes finding the root
cause of problem requires delving deep into a program's execution. I don't
know about you, but setting up 200,000+ gdb instances doesn't sound all that
appealing. Tools like STAT (Stack Trace Analysis Tool) are being developed to
help with this huge task. STAT "gathers and merges stack traces from a
parallel application's processes." So STAT isn't a low level debugger, but it
will help you find the needle in a million haystacks.Abstract:Petascale
systems will present several new challenges to performance and correctness
tools. Such machines may contain millions of cores, requiring that tools use
scalable data structures and analysis algorithms to collect and to process
application data. In addition, at such scales, each tool itself will become a
large parallel app</p><p>3 0.075823799 <a title="197-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-29-How_to_Succeed_at_Capacity_Planning_Without_Really_Trying_%3A__An_Interview_with_Flickr%27s_John_Allspaw_on_His_New_Book.html">643 high scalability-2009-06-29-How to Succeed at Capacity Planning Without Really Trying :  An Interview with Flickr's John Allspaw on His New Book</a></p>

Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access

<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from
over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle
ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the greatMapReduce Versus Database War,
you would be correct.Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail
division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved
their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each
machine approach, to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just
couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that
works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability
potential.Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data
streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful
with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text
files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each
individual machine. Then came a</p><p>6 0.071158543 <a title="197-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-06-What_the_heck_are_you_actually_using_NoSQL_for%3F.html">954 high scalability-2010-12-06-What the heck are you actually using NoSQL for?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From theirwebsite:There are a number of times in which you find yourself
needing performance data. These can include benchmarking, monitoring a
system's general heath or trying to determine what your system was doing at
some time in the past. Sometimes you just want to know what the system is
doing right now. Depending on what you're doing, you often end up using
different tools, each designed to for that specific situation. Features
include:You are be able to run with non-integral sampling
intervals.Collectluses very little CPU. In fact it has been measured to use
<0.1% when run as a daemon using the default sampling interval of 60 seconds
for process and slab data and 10 seconds for everything else.Brief, verbose,
and plot formats are supported.You can report aggregated performance numbers
on many devices such as CPUs, Disks, interconnects such as Infiniband or
Quadrics, Networks or even Lustre file systems.Collectl will align its
sampling on integral second boundaries.Supports proce</p><p>3 0.75772619 <a title="197-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-25-Colmux_-_Finding_Memory_Leaks%2C_High_I-O_Wait_Times%2C_and_Hotness_on_3000_Node_Clusters.html">1104 high scalability-2011-08-25-Colmux - Finding Memory Leaks, High I-O Wait Times, and Hotness on 3000 Node Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Todd had originally posted an entry oncollectlhere atCollectl - Performance
Data Collector. Collectl collects real-time data from a large number of
subsystems like buddyinfo, cpu, disk, inodes, infiniband, lustre, memory,
network, nfs, processes, quadrics, slabs, sockets and tcp, all using one tool
and in one consistent format.Since then a lot has happened.  It's now part of
both Fedora and Debian distros, not to mention several others. There has also
been a pretty good summary written up byJoe Brockmeier. It's also pretty well
documented (I like to think) onsourceforge. There have also been a few blog
postings by Martin Bachon his blog.Anyhow, awhile back I released a new
version of collectl-utils and gave a complete face-lift to one of the
utilities, colmux, which is a collectl multiplexor.  This tool has the ability
to run collectl on multiple systems, which in turn send all their output back
to colmux.  Colmux then sorts the output on a user-specified column and

<p>Introduction: This guest post is written byJosh Fraser, co-founder and CEO ofTorbit. Torbit
creates tools for measuring, analyzing and optimizing web performance.  Did
you know that 5% of the pageviews on Walmart.com take over 20 seconds to load?
Walmart discovered this recently after adding real user measurement (RUM) to
analyze their web performance for every single visitor to their site. Walmart
used JavaScript to measure their median load time as well as key metrics like
their 95th percentile. While 20 seconds is a long time to wait for a website
to load,the Walmart storyis actually not that uncommon. Remember, this is the
worst 5% of their pageviews, not the typical experience.Walmart's median load
time was reported at around 4 seconds, meaning half of their visitors loaded
Walmart.com faster than 4 seconds and the other half took longer than 4
seconds to load. Using this knowledge, Walmart was prepared to act. By
reducing page load times by even one second, Walmart found that they would

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byJon Vlachogiannis. Jon is the founder and CTO
ofBugSense.BugSense, is an error-reporting and quality metrics service that
tracks thousand of apps every day. When mobile apps crash, BugSense helps
developers pinpoint and fix the problem. The startup delivers first-class
service to its customers, which include VMWare, Samsung, Skype and thousands
of independent app developers. Tracking more than 200M devices requires fast,
fault tolerant and cheap infrastructure.The last six months, we've decided to
use our BigData infrastructure, to provide the users with metrics about their
apps performance and stability and let them know how the errors affect their
user base and revenues.We knew that our solution should be scalable from day
one, because more than 4% of the smartphones out there, will start DDOSing us
with data.We wanted to be able to:Abstract the application logic and feed

<p>Introduction: Fromhttp://directory.fsf.org/project/collectd/:'collectd' is a small daemon
which collects system information every 10 seconds and writes the results in
an RRD-file. The statistics gathered include: CPU and memory usage, system
load, network latency (ping), network interface traffic, and system
temperatures (using lm-sensors), and disk usage. 'collectd' is not a script;
it is written in C for performance and portability. It stays in the memory so
there is no need to start up a heavy interpreter every time new values should
be logged.From the collectd website:Collectd gathers information about the
system it is running on and stores this information. The information can then
be used to do find current performance bottlenecks (i. e. performance
analysis) and predict future system load (i. e. capacity planning). Or if you
just want pretty graphs of your private server and are fed up with some
homegrown solution you're at the right place, too ;).While collectd can do a

<p>Introduction: You go through the expense of installing CDNs all over the globe to make sure
users always have a node close by and you notice something curious and
furious: clients still experience poor latencies. What's up with that? What do
you do to find the problem? If you are Google you build a tool (WhyHigh) to
figure out what's up. This paper is about the tool and the unexpected problem
ofhigh latencieson CDNs. The main problems they found: inefficient routing to
nearby nodes and packet queuing. But more useful is the architecture of
WhyHigh and how it goes about identifying bottle necks. And even more useful
is the general belief in creating sophisticated tools to understand and
improve your service. That's what professionals do. From the
abstract:Replicating content across a geographically distributed set of
servers and redirecting clients to the closest server in terms of latency has
emerged as a common paradigm for improving client performance. In this paper,
we analyze latencies measured</p><p>5 0.70842993 <a title="197-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-18-Disks_Ain%27t_Dead_Yet%3A_GraphChi_-_a_disk-based_large-scale_graph_computation.html">1285 high scalability-2012-07-18-Disks Ain't Dead Yet: GraphChi - a disk-based large-scale graph computation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GraphChiuses aParallel Sliding Windowsmethod which can: process a graph with
mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-
sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of
computation.The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on
just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar
toPregel, which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style
of MapReduce. Streaming graph updates are supported.About GraphChi, Carlos
Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,says:A Mac Mini running
GraphChi can analyze Twitter's social graph from 2010--which contains 40
million users and 1.2 billion connections--in 59 minutes. "The previous

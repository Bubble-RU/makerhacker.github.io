<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires

Technology Officer at Amazon.com where he is responsible for driving the
company’s technology vision, which is to continuously enhance the innovation
on behalf of Amazon’s customers at a global scale. Prior to joining Amazon, he
worked as a researcher at Cornell University where he was a principal
investigator in several research projects that target the scalability and
robustness of mission-critical enterprise computing systems. He is regarded as
one of the world's top experts on ultra-scalable systems and he uses his
weblog to educate the community about issues such as eventual consistency.

<p>Introduction: Update::Eucalyptus Goes Commercial with $5.5M Funding Round. This removes my
objection that it's an academic project only. Go team go!Rich Wolski,
professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
gave a spirited talk onEucalyptusto a large group of very interested
cloudsters at theEucalyptus Cloud Meetup. If Rich could teach computer science
at every school the state of the computer science industry would be
stratospheric. Rich is dynamic, smart, passionate, and visionary. It's that
vision that prompted him to create Eucalyptus in the first place. Rich and his
group are experts in grid and distributed computing, having a long and
glorious history in that space. When he saw cloud computing on the rise he
decided the best way to explore it was to implement what everyone accepted as
a real cloud, Amazon's API. In a remarkably short time they implement
Eucalyptus and have been improving it and tracking Amazon's changes ever
since.The question I had going into t</p><p>5 0.73002291 <a title="40-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-08-Under_Snowden%27s_Light_Software_Architecture_Choices_Become_Murky.html">1575 high scalability-2014-01-08-Under Snowden's Light Software Architecture Choices Become Murky</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adrian Cockcroft on the future ofCloud, Open Source, SaaS and the End of
Enterprise Computing:Most big enterprise companies are actively working on
their AWS rollout now. Most of them are also trying to get an in-house cloud
to work, with varying amounts of success, but even the best private clouds are
still years behind the feature set of public clouds, which is has a big impact
on the agility and speed of product developmentWhile theSnowden
revelationshave tattered the thin veil of trust secreting Big Brother from We
the People, they may also be driving a fascinating new tension in architecture
choices between Cloud Native (scale-out, IaaS), Amazon Native (rich service
dependencies), and Enterprise Native (raw hardware, scale-up).This tension
became evident in a recentHipChat interviewwhere HipChat, makers of an AWS
based SaaS chat product, were busy creating an on-premises version of their
product that could operate behind the firewall in enterprise datacenters. This

<p>Introduction: If you like the idea of exploiting market inconsistencies to lower your costs
then you will love thispaperand video from the Hot Cloud '12
conference:Exploiting Hardware Heterogeneity within the Same Instance Type of
Amazon EC2.The conclusion is interesting and is a source of good
guidance:Amazon EC2 uses diversified hardware to host the same type of
instance.  The hardware diversity results in performance variation.In general,
the variation between the fast instances and slow  instances can reach 40%. In
some applications, the variation can even approach up to 60%.  By selecting
fast instances within the same instance type,  Amazon EC2 users can acquire up
to 30% of cost saving, if the fast instances have a relatively low
probability.The abstract:Cloud computing providers might start with near-
homogeneous hardware environment. Over time, the homogeneous environment will
most likely evolve into heterogeneous one because of possible upgrades and
replacement of outdated hardware. In tur</p><p>4 0.80947751 <a title="40-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-27-Updating_distributed_web_applications.html">372 high scalability-2008-08-27-Updating distributed web applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,we've got a web application, which runs without the common standalone
application servers like tomcat or jboss, rather it runs with an embedded
jetty server. Now we are planing to run instances of this application on
multiple machines, with a load balancer serving the requests.The big question
is: is there a common scenario on how to update these applications? Lets think
of 10 instances on 10 machines (one instance per machine), where we want to
update each of these applications version. The brute force approach would be,
to stop all instances, update and then restart it. This is a lot of manual
work ;) Another problem is down-time: so someone must only shutdown one server
after another, but then there are multiple application versions around.Can
someone please provide us with a hint for this problem? Perhaps papers, tools
or something like that?Thanks a lot :)</p><p>5 0.79896879 <a title="40-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability_vs_Performance_vs_Availability_vs_Reliability.._Also_scale_up_vs_scale_out_%3F%3F%3F.html">224 high scalability-2008-01-27-Scalability vs Performance vs Availability vs Reliability..

<p>Introduction: Where do you draw the line between scalability vs Performance vs High
Availability vs Reliability?I guess at the end of the day, we all want to be
highly available, great performance and always reliable. So is it safe to say
that scalability is the answer ?Also when do you start to think scale out vs
scale up ?</p><p>6 0.79599857 <a title="40-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-05-10_Golden_Principles_For_Building_Successful_Mobile-Web_Applications.html">1277 high scalability-2012-07-05-10 Golden Principles For Building Successful Mobile-Web Applications</a></p>

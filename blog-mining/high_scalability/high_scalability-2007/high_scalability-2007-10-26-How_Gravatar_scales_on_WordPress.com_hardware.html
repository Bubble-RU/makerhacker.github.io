<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Barry Abrahamson, Chief Systems Wrangler at
Automattic, andNginx's Coufounder Andrew Alexeev.WordPress.com serves more
than 33 million sites attracting over 339 million people and 3.4 billion pages
each month. Since April 2008, WordPress.com has experienced about 4.4 times
growth in page views. WordPress.com VIP hosts many popular sites including
CNN's Political Ticker, NFL, Time Inc's The Page, People Magazine's Style
Watch, corporate blogs for Flickr and KROQ, and many more. Automattic operates
two thousand servers in twelve, globally distributed, data centers.
WordPress.com customer data is instantly replicated between different
locations to provide an extremely reliable and fast web experience for
hundreds of millions of visitors.ProblemWordPress.com, which began in 2005,
started on shared hosting, much like all of the WordPress.org sites. It was
soon moved to a single dedicated server and then to two servers. In late 2005,
WordPress.com opened to the public</p><p>3 0.10650495 <a title="133-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-01-Cheap_storage%3A_how_backblaze_takes_matters_in_hand.html">692 high scalability-2009-09-01-Cheap storage: how backblaze takes matters in hand</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know
everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this
case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help?
Here's Robert's plight:I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest
interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.It’s on
Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.Look at
who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind
WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of
FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the
“don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million
users on Facebook in about 10 days.What would you ask?</p><p>5 0.089592166 <a title="133-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-10-Useful_Corporate_Blogs_that_Talk_About_Scalability.html">408 high scalability-2008-10-10-Useful Corporate Blogs that Talk About Scalability</a></p>

consider a large system. It doesn't hurt that it's also a sexy story.Update

<p>Introduction: Jurriaan Persyn is a Lead Web Developer at Netlog, a social portal site that
gets 50 million unique visitors and 5+ billion page views per month. In this
paper Jurriaan goes into a lot of excellent nuts and bolts details about how
they used sharding to scale their system. If you are pondering sharding as a
solution to your scaling problems you'll want to read this paper. As the paper
is quite well organized there's no reason to write a summary, but I especially
liked this part from the conclusion:If you can do with simpler solutions
(better hardware, more hardware, server tweaking and tuning, vertical
partitioning, sql query optimization, ...) that require less development cost,
why invest lots of effort in sharding? On the other hand, when your visitor
statistics really start blowing through the roof, it is a good direction to
go. After all, it worked for us.</p><p>6 0.56425941 <a title="133-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-16-Handle_1_Billion_Events_Per_Day_Using_a_Memory_Grid.html">513 high scalability-2009-02-16-Handle 1 Billion Events Per Day Using a Memory Grid</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A recentInfoWorld articleclaims that "With Cisco expected to enter the blade
market and Sun expected to offer networking equipment, things could get

and decisions?Would you consider to build scalable web applications on the
Cisco Unified Computing System? Or would you consider to build a router out of
a server with the use of OpenSolaris and Project Crossbow as the article

infrastructure or are these just attempts to sale these systems?What do you
think?</p><p>3 0.42721379 <a title="133-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-19-Sponsored_Post%3A_Playfish%2C_Electronic_Arts%2C_Tagged%2C_Undertone%2C_Box.net%2C_Wiredrive%2C_Joyent%2C_DeviantART%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">922 high scalability-2010-10-19-Sponsored Post: Playfish, Electronic Arts, Tagged, Undertone, Box.net, Wiredrive, Joyent, DeviantART, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

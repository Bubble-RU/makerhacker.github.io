<p>Introduction: The 2008 MySQL Conference & Expo has now closed, but what is still open for viewing is all the MySQL scaling knowledge that was shared.   Planet MySQL   is a great source of the goings on:      Scaling out MySQL: Hardware today and tomorrow  by Jeremy Cole and Eric Bergen of Proven Scaling. In it are answered all the big questions of life: What about 64-bit? How many cores? How much memory? Shared storage? Finally we learn the secrets of true happiness.   Panel Video: Scaling MySQL? Up or Out? . Don't have time? Take a look at the  Diamond Note  excellent game day summary. Companies like MySQL, Sun, Flickr, Fotolog, Wikipedia, Facebook and YouTube share intel on how many web servers they have, how they handle failure, and how they scale.  Kevin Burton in  Scaling MySQL and Java in High Write Throughput Environments - How we built Spinn3r  shows how they crawl and index 500k posts per hour using MySQL and 40 servers.

<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!, maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life environments. And you</p><p>6 0.85788161 <a title="196-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-08-Partial_String_Matching.html">62 high scalability-2007-08-08-Partial String Matching</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When two titans of the early computing industry, Apple co-founder  Steve Wozniak  and Atari founder  Nolan Bushnell , had a chance to sit down for a chat at the  C2SV  conference last Friday, we learned how a little foresight and luck can decide futures.  
  Steve Wozniak's Success - Expandability       
 
 
Steve talked about how the Apple II was the primary source of revenue for Apple's first 10 years of life. The reason the Apple II could last so long was that it was expandable. It had  eight expansion slots  and the RAM was also expandable (starting at 4K). No computer at the time had this kind of flexibility or  expansion capabilities . Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs argued over keeping the Apple II open. Jobs wanted closed, Wozniak wanted open and fortunately Wozniak won.  In fact, the Apple II was completely open (those were the days). They published the complete specs before there was anything like a developer community. 
 
So even though the Apple III, Lisa, and the Macintosh al</p><p>3 0.6615721 <a title="196-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-13-A_Note_on_How_to_Create_Teasers_When_Posting_.html">210 high scalability-2008-01-13-A Note on How to Create Teasers When Posting </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I fully and enthusiastically encourage anyone who wants to share a relevant topic  to register and post. People have added a lot of good and useful content.  Don't be shy. It's been asked how a  teaser is created when posting so the full article doesn't display on the front page. A teaser is a paragraph interesting enough to convince readers to click on the "read more" link to get the full article.        Creating a teaser in Drupal is accomplished by inserting < ! -- break -- > on a separate line directly after the text you want to be the teaser. Only DO NOT include the spaces.  So your post looks like:   Teaser Content   < ! -- break -- > (no spaces in real life)   Rest of Content     It's a bit kludgey, but it works.</p><p>4 0.62480646 <a title="196-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-15-Outside.in_Scales_Up_with_Engine_Yard_and_moving_from_PHP_to_Ruby_on_Rails.html">417 high scalability-2008-10-15-Outside.in Scales Up with Engine Yard and moving from PHP to Ruby on Rails</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This article explains how   Outside.in  , the local social network and aggregator, scaled up its service and moved from PHP to Ruby on Rails (they moved maybe because Ruby code seemed to be more maintanable that PHP code?).

<p>Introduction: I currently use BerkeleyDB as an embedded database   http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/   a decision which was initially brought on by learning that Google used BerkeleyDB for their universal sign-on feature.     Lustre looks impressive, but their white paper shows speeds of 800 files created per second, as a good number.  However, BerkeleyDB on my mac mini does 200,000 row creations per second, and can be used as a distributed file system.     I'm having I/O scalability issues with BerkeleyDB on one machine, and about to implement their distributed replication feature (and go multi-machine), which in effect makes it work like a distributed file system, but with local access speeds.  That's why I was looking at Lustre.     The key feature difference between BerkeleyDB and Lustre is that BerkeleyDB has a complete copy of all the data on each computer, making it not a viable solution for massive sized database applications.  However, if you have < 1TB (ie, one disk) of total pos</p><p>6 0.62105405 <a title="196-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Paper%3A_Guide_to_Cost-effective_Database_Scale-Out_using_MySQL.html">17 high scalability-2007-07-16-Paper: Guide to Cost-effective Database Scale-Out using MySQL</a></p>

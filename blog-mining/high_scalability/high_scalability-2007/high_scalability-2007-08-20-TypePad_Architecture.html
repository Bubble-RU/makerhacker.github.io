<p>Introduction: What have bunch of applications which run on Debian servers, which processes
huge amount of data stored in a shared NFS drive.we have 3 applications
working as a pipeline, which process data stored in the NFS drive. The first
application processes the data and store the output in some folder in the NFS
drive, the second app in the pipeline process the data from the previous step
and so on.The data load to the pipeline is like 1 GBytes per minute. I think
the NFS drive is the bottleneck here.Would buying a specialized file server
improve the performance of data read write from the disk ?</p><p>4 0.12139256 <a title="68-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

our accounts belong to individual users, we also provide corporate email

<p>Introduction: I've been trying to find a high availability file storage solution without
success. I tried GlusterFS which looks very promising but experienced problems
with stability and don't want something I can't easily control and rely on.
Other solutions are too complicated or have a SPOF.So I'm thinking of the
following setup:Two NFS servers, a primary and a warm backup. The primary
server will be rsynced with the warm backup every minute or two. I can do it
so frequently as a PHP script will know which directories have changed
recently from a database and only rsync those. Both servers will be NFS
mounted on a cluster of web servers as /mnt/nfs-primary (sym linked as
/home/websites) and /mnt/nfs-backup.I'll then use Ucarp
(http://www.ucarp.org/project/ucarp) to monitor both NFS servers availability
every couple of seconds and when one goes down, the Ucarp up script will be
set to change the symbolic link on all web servers for the /home/websites dir
from /mnt/nfs-primary to /mnt/nfs-backupThe</p><p>6 0.10236641 <a title="68-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-Building_scalable_storage_into_application_-_Instead_of_MogileFS_OpenAFS_etc..html">229 high scalability-2008-01-29-Building scalable storage into application - Instead of MogileFS OpenAFS etc.</a></p>

Engineering, describes the architecture used by the popular game named Second

over years as users and features have been added.Second Lifeis a 3-D virtual
world created by its Residents. Virtual Worlds are expected to be more and
more popular on the internet so their architecture might be of interest.

<p>Introduction: Garry Tan, cofounder of Posterous, lists 12 lessons for scaling that apply to
more than just Rails.Use cloud storage for static files.Use HTTP Cache Control
to tell the browser what it can cache.Use Sphinx for text search.Use InnoDB
for more crash resistant and faster writes.Don't use textbook Rails
ActiveRecord objects. Use New Relic to find exactly what is slow in your
system.Use memcache later so you find your database bottlenecks now.Use
mongrel proctitle to find your slow queries. You are only as fast as your
slowest queries.Use asynchronous job queuing to do work in parallel.Use
monitoring so you'll know when your site went down and why.Learn by reading
the source code, fixing problems, and submitting them back to the
community.Use new plugins. Old plugins can't be trusted.Use new information.
Old information can't be trusted.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.86988658 <a title="68-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad_Architecture.html">68 high scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TypePad is considered the largest paid blogging service in the world. After
experience problems because of their meteoric growth, they eventually
transitioned to an architecture patterned after their sister company,

250mbps of traffic using multiple network pipes for 3TB of traffic a day. They
were growing by 10-20% each month. I was unable to find more recent
statistics.The ArchitectureOriginal Architecture:- Single server running
Linux, Apache, Postgres, Perl, mod_perl- Storage was NFS on a filer.A
Devastating Crash Caused a New Direction- A RAID controller failed and spewed
data across all RAID disks.- The database was corrupted and the backups were

<p>Introduction: Recently, I was reading Todd Hoff's write-up on FaceBook real time analytics
system. As usual, Todd did an excellent job in summarizing this video from
Engineering Manager at Facebook Alex Himel.Inthe first post, I'd like to
summarize the case study, and consider some things that weren't mentioned in
the summaries. This will lead to an architecture for building your own
Realtime Time Analytics for Big-Data that might be easier to implement, using
Facebook's experience as a starting point and guide as well as the experience
gathered through a recent work with few of GigaSpaces customers. Thesecond
postprovide a summary of that new approach as well as a pattern and a demo for
building your own Real Time Analytics system..ReferencesReal Time analytics

<p>Introduction: This paper is a great overview of different lightweight web servers. A lot of
websites use lightweight web servers to serve images and static content.
YouTube is one example:YouTube Architecture.breakSo if you need to improve
performance consider changing over a different web server for some types of
content.Overview:Recent years have enjoyed a florescence of interesting
implementations of Web servers, including lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel,
among others. These Web servers boast different combinations of performance,
ease of administration, portability, security, and related values. The
following engineering study surveys the field of lightweight Web servers to
help you find one likely to meet the technical requirements of your next
project."Lightweight" Web servers like lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel can
offer dramatic benefits for your projects. This article surveys the
possibilities and shows how they apply to you.Important dimensions for
evaluation of a Web server include:Per</p><p>5 0.81226075 <a title="68-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-25-How_do_you_explain_cloud_computing_to_your_grandma%3F.html">325 high scalability-2008-05-25-How do you explain cloud computing to your grandma?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Nice introductory New York Time's articleCloud Computing: So You

Amazon to meet a Facebook driven demand of 25,000 test drives an hour.Update:

the Players in the Industrypaints a very cool visual map of all the cloud
service players. It's a larger industry than you might think.Once upon a time
I worked at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch startup. Over a
delicious Christmas punch my grandma asked me what I did for a living that I
could afford such extravagantly inexpensive gifts. Always so subtle. I
explained I worked on an ATM switch. Mistake. She sniffed, said that's nice,
and asked me why the Automated Teller Machine ate her bank card that morning.
No matter how hard I tried I couldn't convince her I didn't work on bank ATMs.

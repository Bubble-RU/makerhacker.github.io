<p>Introduction: What have bunch of applications which run on Debian servers, which processes
huge amount of data stored in a shared NFS drive.we have 3 applications
working as a pipeline, which process data stored in the NFS drive. The first
application processes the data and store the output in some folder in the NFS
drive, the second app in the pipeline process the data from the previous step
and so on.The data load to the pipeline is like 1 GBytes per minute. I think
the NFS drive is the bottleneck here.Would buying a specialized file server

<p>Introduction: I've been trying to find a high availability file storage solution without
success. I tried GlusterFS which looks very promising but experienced problems
with stability and don't want something I can't easily control and rely on.
Other solutions are too complicated or have a SPOF.So I'm thinking of the
following setup:Two NFS servers, a primary and a warm backup. The primary
server will be rsynced with the warm backup every minute or two. I can do it
so frequently as a PHP script will know which directories have changed
recently from a database and only rsync those. Both servers will be NFS
mounted on a cluster of web servers as /mnt/nfs-primary (sym linked as
/home/websites) and /mnt/nfs-backup.I'll then use Ucarp
(http://www.ucarp.org/project/ucarp) to monitor both NFS servers availability
every couple of seconds and when one goes down, the Ucarp up script will be
set to change the symbolic link on all web servers for the /home/websites dir
from /mnt/nfs-primary to /mnt/nfs-backupThe</p><p>5 0.12851945 <a title="128-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-15-Isilon_Clustred_Storage_System.html">12 high scalability-2007-07-15-Isilon Clustred Storage System</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:GlusterFSis a clustered file-system capable of
scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over
Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64
server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).Cluster file systems are still
not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain
though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of
commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.GlusterFS
achieved35 GBps read throughput. The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was
performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband
interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with
multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB
block size. GlusterFS was configured with unify translator and round-robin
scheduler.The advantage</p><p>3 0.78562719 <a title="128-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-05-Beta_testers_wanted_for_ultra_high-scalability-performance_clustered_object_storage_system_designed_for_web_content_delivery.html">508 high scalability-2009-02-05-Beta testers wanted for ultra high-scalability-performance clustered object storage system designed for web content delivery</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There's a new clustered file system on the spindle:Kosmos File System (KFS).
Thanks to Rich Skrenta for turning me on to KFS and I think his blogpostsays
it all. KFS is an open source project written in C++ by search startupKosmix.
The team members have a goodpedigreeso there's a better than average chance
this software will be worth considering.After you stop trying to turn KFS into
"Kentucky Fried File System" in your mind, take a look at KFS' intriguing
feature set:breakIncremental scalability: New chunkserver nodes can be added
as storage needs increase; the system automatically adapts to the new
nodes.Availability: Replication is used to provide availability due to chunk
server failures. Typically, files are replicated 3-way.Per file degree of
replication: The degree of replication is configurable on a per file basis,
with a max. limit of 64.Re-replication: Whenever the degree of replication for
a file drops below the configured amount (such as, due to an extended

wanted to answer- which one of these tools will best solve my virtualized
datacenter headache? After initial analysis all the products could be
classified as tools that troubleshoot VM sprawl, but there was no universally
accepted term for them. The most descriptive term  that I found was Virtual
Resource Manager (VRM) from DynamicOps. As I delved deeper into their
workings, the distinction between VRMs and Private Clouds became blurred. What
are the differences?Read more

<p>Introduction: pNFS (parallel NFS) is the next generation of NFS and its main claim to fame
is that it's clustered, which "enables clients to directly access file data
spread over multiple storage servers in parallel. As a result, each client can
leverage the full aggregate bandwidth of a clustered storage service at the
granularity of an individual file." About pNFSStorageMojosays:pNFS is going to
commoditize parallel data access. In 5 years we won't know how we got along
without it. Something to watch.</p><p>3 0.83844662 <a title="128-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-07-Help_a_Scoble_out._What_should_Robert_ask_in_his_scalability_interview%3F.html">405 high scalability-2008-10-07-Help a Scoble out. What should Robert ask in his scalability interview?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know
everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this
case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help?
Here's Robert's plight:I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest
interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.It’s on
Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.Look at
who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind
WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of
FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the
“don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million
users on Facebook in about 10 days.What would you ask?</p><p>4 0.81172991 <a title="128-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-04-Hot_Links_for_2009-9-4_.html">694 high scalability-2009-09-04-Hot Links for 2009-9-4 </a></p>

<p>Introduction: If a large number of leaf node machines send requests to a central root node
then that root node can become overwhelmed:The CPU becomes a bottleneck, for
either processing requests or sending replies, because it can't possibly deal
with the flood of requests.The network interface becomes a bottleneck because
a wide fan-in causes TCP drops and retransmissions, which causes latency. Then
clients start retrying requests which quickly causes a spiral of death in an
undisciplined system.One solution to this problem is a strategy given by Dr.
Jeff Dean, Head of Google's School of Infrastructure Wizardry, in this
Stanford video presentation:Tree Distribution of Requests and
Responses.Instead of having a root node connected to leaves in a flat
topology, the idea is to create a tree of nodes. So a root node talks to a
number of parent nodes and the parent nodes talk to a number of leaf nodes.
Requests are pushed down the tree through the parents and only hit a subset of
the leaf nodes.With this</p><p>6 0.80100441 <a title="128-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-14-Who_Has_the_Most_Web_Servers%3F.html">599 high scalability-2009-05-14-Who Has the Most Web Servers?</a></p>

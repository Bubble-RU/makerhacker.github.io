<p>Introduction: If using a DB to store session(used by some app server, ex.. websphere), how
would an enterprise class site that is housed in 2 different data centers(that
are live/live) maintain the session between both data centers.The problem as I
see it is that since each data center has their own session database, if I was
to flip the users to only access Data Center 1(by changing the DNS records for
the site or some other Load balancing technique) then that would cause all
previous Data Center 2 users to lose their session. What would be some pure
hardware based solutions to this that are being used now? That way the
applications supporting the web site can be abstracted from this.As I see now,
a solution is to possibly have the session databases in both centers some how
replicate the data to each other. I just don't see the best way to even
accomplish this you are not even guraunteed that the session ID's will be
unique since it's 2 different Application Server tiers(again websphere). Not

<p>Introduction: In the post Using memcache might be free, but it's costing you money with
instance pricing! Use instance caches if possible made on the Google App
Engine group, Santiago Lema brings up an oldie but a goody of an idea that was
once used to improve performance, but now it's used to save money:Santiago's
GAE application went from about $9 to about $177 per month. Memcache is slow
enough that under higher loads extra instances are created by the scheduler to
handle the load.For static or semi-static data, a way around the cost of the
extra instances, is to keep a cache in the instance so requests can be served
out of local memory rather than going to memcache or the database. A simple
hashtable makes a good in-memory cache.This solution made his app affordable
again by reducing the number of instances back to 1 (sometimes 2).Where have
we seen this before?This is a variant of the old Sticky Session idea where web
sessions are stored in RAM in an application server and all further

<p>Introduction: This is a question asked on theycombinatorlist and there are some good
responses. I gave a quick response, but I particularly like neilk's knock out
of the park insightful answer:Read Cal Henderson's book. (I'd add in Theo's
book and Release It! too)The center of your design should be the data store,
not a process. You transition the data store from state to state, securely and
reliably, in small increments.Avoid globals and session state. The more "pure"
your function is, the easier it will be to cache or partition.Don't make your
data store too smart. Calculations and renderings should happen in a separate,
asynchronous process.The data store should be able to handle lots of
concurrent connections. Minimize locking. (Read about optimistic
locking).Protect your algorithm from the implementation of the data store,
with a helper class or module or whatever. But don't (DO NOT) try to build a
framework for any conceivable query. Just the ones your algorithm
needs.Viewing an application as</p><p>6 0.56843531 <a title="97-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark_for_keeping_data_in_browser_in_AJAX_projects.html">565 high scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark for keeping data in browser in AJAX projects</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have introduced pattern languages in my earlier post onThe Pattern Bible for
Distributed Computing.Achieving highest possible scalability is a complex
combination of many factors. This PLoP 2007paperpresents a pattern language
that can be used to make a system highly scalable.The Scalability Pattern

<p>Introduction: In Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation we learn some
shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):Average server utilization in many
data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an
idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.Surely that's just for
old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are
consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core
is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade.It's a VM
wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without
hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that
interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same
server.It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method
that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize
for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithms for
different work</p><p>3 0.96262634 <a title="97-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-06-Paper%3A_Memory_Barriers%3A_a_Hardware_View_for_Software_Hackers.html">1471 high scalability-2013-06-06-Paper: Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's not often you get so enthusiastic a recommendation for a paper as Sergio
Bossa gives Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers: If you only
want to read one piece about CPUs architecture, cache coherency and memory
barriers, make it this one.It is a clear and well written article. It even has
a quiz. What's it about?So what possessed CPU designers to cause them to
inﬂict memory barriers on poor unsuspecting SMP software designers?In short,
because reordering memory references allows much better performance, and so
memory barriers are needed to force ordering in things like synchronization
primitives whose correct operation depends on ordered memory
references.Getting a more detailed answer to this question requires a good
understanding of how CPU caches work, and especially what is required to make
caches really work well. The following sections:present the structure of a
cache,describe how cache-coherency protocols ensure that CPUs agree on the
value of each location</p><p>4 0.93536788 <a title="97-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-04-Alternative_Memcache_Usage%3A_A_Highly_Scalable%2C_Highly_Available%2C_In-Memory_Shard_Index.html">482 high scalability-2009-01-04-Alternative Memcache Usage: A Highly Scalable, Highly Available, In-Memory Shard Index</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While working with Memcache the other night, it dawned on me that it’s usage
as a distributed caching mechanism was really just one of many ways to use it.
That there are in fact many alternative usages that one could find for
Memcache if they could just realize what Memcache really is at its core – a
simple distributed hash-table – is an important point worthy of further
discussion.To be clear, when I say “simple”, by no means am I implying that
Memcache’s implementation is simple, just that the ideas behind it are such.
Think about that for a minute. What else could we use a simple distributed
hash-table for, besides caching? How about using it as an alternative to the
traditional shard lookup method we used in our Master Index Lookup scalability
strategy, discussed previously here.</p><p>5 0.91251069 <a title="97-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-17-Paper%3A_Consistent_Hashing_and_Random_Trees%3A_Distributed_Caching_Protocols_for_Relieving_Hot_Spots_on_the_World_Wide_Web.html">280 high scalability-2008-03-17-Paper: Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Consistent hashing is one of those ideas that really puts the science in
computer science and reminds us why all those really smart people spend years
slaving over algorithms. Consistent hashing is "a scheme that provides hash
table functionality in a way that the addition or removal of one slot does not
significantly change the mapping of keys to slots" and was originally a way of
distributing requests among a changing population of web servers. My first
reaction to the idea was "wow, that's really smart" and I sadly realized I
would never come up with something so elegant. I then immediately saw
applications for it everywhere. And consistent hashing is used everywhere:
distributed hash tables, overlay networks, P2P, IM, caching, and CDNs. Here's
the abstract from the original paper and after the abstract are some links to
a few very good articles with accessible explanations of consistent hashing
and its applications in the real world.breakAbstract:We describe a family of

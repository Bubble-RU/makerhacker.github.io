<p>Introduction: Pre-generating static files is an oldy but a goody, and as Thomas Brox RĂ¸st
says, it's probably an underused strategy today. At one time this was the
dominate technique for structuring a web site. Then the age of dynamic web
sites arrived and we spent all our time worrying how to make the database
faster and add more caching to recover the speed we had lost in the transition
from static to dynamic.Static files have the advantage of being very fast to
serve. Read from disk and display. Simple and fast. Especially when caching
proxies are used. The issue is how do you bulk generate the initial files, how
do you serve the files, and how do you keep the changed files up to date? This
is the process Thomas covers in his excellent articleServing static files with
Django and AWS - going fast on a budget", where he explains how he converted
600K thousand previously dynamic pages to static pages for his
siteEventseer.net, a service for tracking academic events.Eventseer.net was

<p>Introduction: Searching around the HS website I noticed that there are no articles regarding
db2, which has an express edition, free of charge and from what I know there
aren't any restrictions.Being a powerful database system I thought it could
make be an alternative to MySQL, PostgreSQL databases.Here is the IBM
statement:"DB2 Express Edition for Community (DB2 Express-C) is a no charge
data server for use in development and deployment. DB2 Express-C supports a
full range of APIs, drivers, and interfaces for application development
including PHP, C/C++, and .NET. In addition, DB2 Express-C V9 contains
advanced XML features. DB2 Express-C provides ISVs an ideal starting database
server for Web, enterprise, and eBusiness applications.This IBM Redbook
provides fundamentals of DB2 application development with DB2 Express-C. It
covers the DB2 Express-C installation and configuration for application
development and skills and techniques for building DB2 applications with XML,
PHP, C/C++, Java, and .NET.</p><p>5 0.11077148 <a title="84-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-28-Sponsored_Post%3A_Oracle%2C_Percona_Live%2C_AiCache%2C_ElasticHosts%2C_Red_5_Studios%2C_Logic_Monitor%2C_New_Relic%2C_AppDynamics%2C_CloudSigma%2C_ManageEngine%2C_Site24x7.html">1200 high scalability-2012-02-28-Sponsored Post: Oracle, Percona Live, AiCache, ElasticHosts, Red 5 Studios, Logic Monitor, New Relic, AppDynamics, CloudSigma, ManageEngine, Site24x7</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We are serving dynamic (PHP) websites and their assets
(JS/CSS/images/videos/binary downloads) via the same apache hosts. The static
files are only being used as origins for CDN services used to distribute those
files. Yet, in the current development-deploy pipeline, these files are
checked into the same version control repositories as the code is. This is
what we would like to change, for several reasons (decouple asset deployment
from development & developers, lessen size of code repositories, etc.)My idea
is to do the following: Set up a media server (cluster) which serves as an API
(REST e.g.). You can PUT files to it, and get back the URL the file is
available through from the public. In between input and output, the media
service deals with everything that's necessary to serve the files: Upload them
to the CDN, create the public URL, write the meta data to a (relational?)
database, assign a version number... This API can be used by a) the
application/website directly to provide C</p><p>3 0.5504756 <a title="84-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Yslow_to_speed_up_your_web_pages.html">47 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Yslow to speed up your web pages</a></p>

<p>Introduction: eAcceleratoris a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic
content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in
their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely
eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution.
eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP
code by 1-10 times.</p><p>6 0.5152114 <a title="84-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-25-Make_Your_Site_Run_10_Times_Faster.html">261 high scalability-2008-02-25-Make Your Site Run 10 Times Faster</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Awesome paper on how particular synchronization mechanisms scale on multi-core
architectures: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but
Were Afraid to Ask.The goal is to pick a locking approach that doesn't degrade
as the number of cores increase. Like everything else in life, that doesn't
appear to be generically possible:None of the nine locking schemes we consider
consistently outperforms any other one, on all target architectures or
workloads. Strictly speaking, to seek optimality, a lock algorithm should thus
be selected based on the hardware platform and the expected workload.
Abstract:This paper presents the most exhaustive study of synchronization to
date. We span multiple layers, from hardware cache-coherence protocols up to
high-level concurrent software. We do so on different types architectures,
from single-socket - uniform and nonuniform - to multi-socket - directory and
broadcastbased - many-cores. We draw a set of observations that, roughly
speaking,</p><p>3 0.48310381 <a title="84-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-25-Designing_applications_for_cloud_deployment.html">764 high scalability-2010-01-25-Designing applications for cloud deployment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: During the last two years, I was involved in several projects deployed on the
Amazon cloud. Being a relatively early adopter was a fantastic experience that
provided lots of opportunities to burn my fingers and learn from mistakes. It
also seriously challenged my view of scalable software architectures. I spoke
about key lessons learned at CloudCamp London last week - here is the summary
of that presentation.ďťżhttp://gojko.net/2010/01/25/designing-applications-for-

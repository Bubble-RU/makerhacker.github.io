<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>4 0.12279009 <a title="141-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-23-GoogleTalk_Architecture.html">21 high scalability-2007-07-23-GoogleTalk Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you scale an inbox that has multiple highly volatile feeds? That's a
problem faced by social networks like Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter. Follow a
few hundred event sources and it's hard to scalably order an inbox so that you
see a correct view as event sources continually publish new events.This can be
considered like aview materializationproblem in a database. In a database a
view is a virtual table defined by a query that can be accessed like a table.
Materialization refers to when the data behind the view is created. If a view
is a join on several tables and that join is performed when the view is
accessed, then performance will be slow. If the view is precomputed access to
the view will be fast, but more resources are used, especially considering
that the view may never be accessed.Your wall/inbox/stream is a view on all
the people/things you follow. If you never look at your inbox then
materializing the view in your inbox is a waste of resources, yet you'll be

<p>Introduction: My first post, please be gentle. I know it is long. You are all like doctors -
the more info, the better the diagnosis.-----------What is the best way to
store a list of all of your friends in the memcached cache (a simple boolean
saying “yes this user is your friend”, or “no”)? Think Robert Scoble (26,000+
“friends”) on Twitter.com. He views a list of ALL existing users, and in this
list, his friends are highlighted.I came up with 4 possible methods:--store in
memcache as an array, a list of all the "yes" friend ID's--store your friend
ID's as individual elements.--store as a hash of arrays based on last 3 digits
of friend's ID -- so have up to 1000 arrays for you.--comma-delimited string
of ID's as one elementI'm using the second one because I think it is faster to
update. The single array or hash of arrays feels like too much overhead
calculating and updating – and even just loading – to check for existence of a
friend.The key is FRIEND[small ID#]_[big ID#]. The value is 1.This way</p><p>5 0.57282507 <a title="141-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-17-Paper%3A_Feeding_Frenzy%3A_Selectively_Materializing_Users%E2%80%99_Event_Feeds.html">1175 high scalability-2012-01-17-Paper: Feeding Frenzy: Selectively Materializing Users’ Event Feeds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Im sure most are familiar with Facebooks 'news feed'. If not, the 'news feed'
basically lists recent activity of all of your friends.I dont see how you can
get this information efficiently from a DB:* Im assuming all user activity is
inserted in a "actions" table.* first get a list of all your friends* then
query the actions table to return recent activity where the activity belongs
to someone on your friends listThis can't be efficient especially considering
some people have 200+ friends.So what am I missing? How do you think Facebook
is implementing their "news feed".Im not asking for any specific details, just
a general point in the right direction, as I cant see how they are
implementing the 'news feed efficiently.Thanks.</p><p>2 0.87899238 <a title="141-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-20-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_20%2C_2012.html">1287 high scalability-2012-07-20-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 20, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update: Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was
wrong about what he meant. His real point:The meaning of the statement was
that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a
standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a
high priority task for them.At the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto, an audience
member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really
interesting:NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.The
idea being that NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance,
etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its
name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships.
With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to
implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed
usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it's not
about data.My</p><p>4 0.86656499 <a title="141-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_22%2C_2013.html">1411 high scalability-2013-02-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 22, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

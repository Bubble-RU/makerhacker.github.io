<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block , CTO at  RockThePost.com , a crowdfunding company, has  written a nice set of tips  for smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a small two person development team. 
 
Their service has a typical small scale structure:
  
 PHP's Zend Framework 2 
 Two m1.medium for web servers 
 ELB to split the load 
 master/slave MySQL database 
 Siege for load testing 
  
The very sensible tips that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: 
  
  Use PHP's APC feature . APC is opcode cache that is " really a requirement in order for a website to have a chance at performing well."  
  Put everything that's not a .php request on a CDN . Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused them to serve directly from S3. 
  Don't make connections to other servers in your PHP code . Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down processing.

<p>Introduction: From their website:    SystemImager  is software that makes the installation of Linux to masses of similar machines relatively easy. It makes software distribution, configuration, and operating system updates easy, and can also be used for content distribution.  SystemImager makes it easy to do automated installs (clones), software distribution, content or data distribution, configuration changes, and operating system updates to your network of Linux machines. You can even update from one Linux release version to another!  
   
  It can also be used to ensure safe production deployments. By saving your current production image before updating to your new production image, you have a highly reliable contingency mechanism. If the new production enviroment is found to be flawed, simply roll-back to the last production image with a simple update command!  Some typical environments include: Internet server farms, database server farms, high performance clusters, computer labs, and corporate</p><p>4 0.13602474 <a title="118-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-21-Tracking_usage_of_public_resources_-_throttling_accesses_per_hour.html">256 high scalability-2008-02-21-Tracking usage of public resources - throttling accesses per hour</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     We have an application that allows the user to define a publicly available resource with an ID. The ID can then be accessed via an HTTP call, passing the ID. While we're not a picture site, thinking of a resource like a picture may help understand what is going on.     We need to be able to stop access to the resource if it is accessed 'x' times in an hour, regardless of who is requesting it.     We see two options   - go to the database for each request to see if the # of returned in the last hour is within the limit.   - keep a counter in each of the application servers and sync the counters every few minutes or # of requests to determine if we've passed the limit. The sync point would be the database.     Going to the database (and updating it!) each time we get a request isn't very attractive.      We also have a load balanced farm of servers, so we know 'x' is going to have to be a soft limit if we count in the app serevrs. (We know there will be a period of time between s</p><p>5 0.13147098 <a title="118-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-01-Product%3A_Memcached.html">52 high scalability-2007-08-01-Product: Memcached</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Memcached  is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.  Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com, a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers. memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the databases on a memcache miss.</p><p>6 0.119086 <a title="118-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-01-HOW_CDN_works.html">198 high scalability-2008-01-01-HOW CDN works</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steffen Konerow, author of the    High Performance Blog   .  
 
Learning how to scale isn’t easy without any prior experience. Nowadays you have plenty of websites like  highscalability.com  to get some inspiration, but unfortunately there is no solution that fits all websites and needs. You still have to think on your own to find a concept that works for your requirements. So did I.
 
A few years ago, my bosses came to me and said “We’ve got a new project for you. It’s the relaunch of a website that has already 1 million users a month. You have to build the website and make sure we’ll be able to grow afterwards”. I was already an experienced coder, but not in these dimensions, so I had to start learning how to scale – the hard way.
 
The software behind the website was a PHP content management system, based on Smarty and MySQL. The first task was finding a proper hosting company who had the experience and would also manage the servers for us. After some researc</p><p>4 0.70053607 <a title="118-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-18-Code_deployment_tools.html">369 high scalability-2008-08-18-Code deployment tools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: G'day,     I'm building an application to manage WordPress PHP code on many servers. Our application will push down code updates to each server, as well as performing backups and testing.     I'm considering different methods of pushing updated code onto the individual servers. I'm considering something like Capistrano (I've no experience in Ruby though). I've also considered using subversion and then remotely calling svn commands via SSH.     Are there any other tools specifically for this purpose? The servers will have persistent data (the WordPress databases) so I don't want to re-image them every update. Plus, they will each have a different set of plugins / themes, so building many images would be too complex.     If there are any papers on code deployment, or other recommended reading, please point the links my way.     Likewise, if anyone has any suggestions, or would like more details, just let me know.     Cheers -   Callum  .</p><p>5 0.69968075 <a title="118-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-SSL_RPC_API_Scalability.html">620 high scalability-2009-06-05-SSL RPC API Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all!  So nice to start discussing cool things in this even cooler forum :)  I am having a problem .. which i believe is already solved but i would love someone confirming actual experience with the same topic.  We are building a client / server architecture, consisting of a web server part and many clients.  Transport will be provided as either XML-RPC / SOAP / JSON or all at once. All of the communication has to be encrypted and passed within SSL3.  We expect a high load when the application starts (> 2000 concurrent requests). Combine this with xml parsing for the rpc api, things really look ugly :) So it's a big mess :)  It will not be that much database bound behind the api - mostly files will be transferred from the server to the clients and simple api for control.  So it's pretty much a matter of 'what-to-do-with-ssl'.  I was thinking of hardware - NetApp or a similar application accelerator.  Can anyone give examples of a hardware piece that combines: Load balancer / SSL acce</p><p>6 0.68141156 <a title="118-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-12-Poppen.de_Architecture.html">808 high scalability-2010-04-12-Poppen.de Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As part of  Dr. Indranil Gupta 's  CS 525 Spring 2011 Advanced Distributed Systems  class, he has collected an incredible  list of resources on distributed systems . His  research group  is also doing some interesting work.
 
The  various topics  include: Before there Were Clouds, Cloud Computing, P2P Systems, Basic Distributed Computing Concepts, Sensor Networks, Overlays and DHTs, Cloud Programming, Cloud Scheduling, Key-Value Stores, Storage, Sensor Net Routing, Geo-Distribution, P2P Apps, In-network processing, Epidemics, Probabilistic Membership Protocols, Distributed Monitoring and  Management, Publish-Subscribe/CDNs, Measurement Studies, Old Wine: Stale or Vintage?, In Byzantium, Cloud Pricing, Other Industrial Systems, Structure of Networks, Completing the Circle, Green Clouds, Distributed Debugging, Flash!, The Middle or the End?, Availability-Aware Systems, Design Methodologies, Handling Stress, Sources of unreliability in networks, Handling Stress, Selfish algorithms, Securi</p><p>2 0.97042906 <a title="118-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">191 high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have an application with couple of web servers that uses MemcacheD. How can i synchronize concurrent put to the cache? The value of the entry  is list.     Atomic append operation could have been helpful, but unfortunately memcahe doesn't support atomic append.</p><p>3 0.97020566 <a title="118-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-06-Product%3A_ChironFS.html">143 high scalability-2007-11-06-Product: ChironFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across data centers,  then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What is  ChironFS  and how does it work?
 
Adapted from the ChironFS website:   The Chiron Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not FILESYSTEMS.  Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become a real nightmare!</p><p>4 0.96638823 <a title="118-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-03-100_Node_Hazelcast_cluster_on_Amazon_EC2.html">820 high scalability-2010-05-03-100 Node Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Deploying, running and monitoring application on a big cluster is a challenging task. Recently  Hazelcast  team deployed a demo application on Amazon EC2 platform to show how Hazelcast p2p cluster scales and screen recorded the entire process from deployment to monitoring.
 
Hazelcast is open source (Apache License), transactional, distributed caching solution for Java. It is a little more than a cache though as it provides distributed implementation of map, multimap, queue, topic, lock and executor service.Â 
 
Details of running 100 node Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2 can be  found here . Make sure to  watch the screencast !</p><p>5 0.94769669 <a title="118-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:   My recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid expiration headers) is employ a    reverse proxy    as mentioned in this article.   In the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.  It's trivial to implement for anyone interested...</p><p>6 0.94525981 <a title="118-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-27-Product%3A_Sequoia_Database_Clustering_Technology.html">102 high scalability-2007-09-27-Product: Sequoia Database Clustering Technology</a></p>

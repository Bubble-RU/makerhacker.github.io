<p>Introduction: This paper is a great overview of different lightweight web servers. A lot of websites  use lightweight web servers to serve images and static content. YouTube is one example:  YouTube Architecture .
   
So if you need to improve performance consider changing over a different web server for some types of content.
 
Overview:   Recent years have enjoyed a florescence of interesting implementations of Web servers, including lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel, among others.

<p>Introduction: How do you plan to scale your system as you reach predictable milestones? This topic came up in another venue and it reminded me about a great comment an Anonymous wrote a while ago and I wanted to make sure that comment didn't get lost.      The Anonymous scaling plan was relatively simple and direct:    My two cents on what I'm using to start a website from scratch using a single server for now. Later, I'll scale out horizontally when the need arises.   Phase 1            Single Server, Dual Quad-Core 2.66, 8gb RAM, 500gb Disk Raid 10   OS: Fedora 8. You could go with pretty much any Linux though. I like Fedora 8 best for servers.   Proxy Cache: Varnish - it is way faster than Squid per my own benchmarks. Squid chokes bigtime.   Web Server: Lighttpd - faster than Apache 2 and easier to configure for me.   Object Cache: Memcached. Very scalable.   PHP Cache: APC. Easy to configure and seems to work fine.   Language: PHP 5 - no bloated frameworks, waste of time for me.

<p>Introduction: Wikipedia and  Wikimedia  have some of the best, most complete real-world documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid, lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN,   how caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of configuration files. This is a really useful resource.

<p>Introduction: Perdition  is a fully featured POP3 and IMAP4 proxy server. It is able to handle both SSL and non-SSL connections and redirect users to a real-server based on a database lookup. Perdition supports modular based database access. ODBC, MySQL, PostgreSQL, GDBM, POSIX Regular Expression and NIS modules ship with the distribution. The API for modules is open allowing arbitrary modules to be written to allow access to any data store.  Perdition has many uses. Including, creating large mail systems where an end-user's mailbox may be stored on one of several hosts, integrating different mail systems together, migrating between different email infrastructures, and bridging plain-text, SSL and TLS services. It can also be used as part of a firewall. The use of perditon to scale mail services beyond a single box is discussed in high capacity email.</p><p>6 0.087972097 <a title="29-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-19-Strategy%3A_Three_Techniques_to_Survive_Traffic_Surges_by_Quickly_Scaling_Your_Site.html">1615 high scalability-2014-03-19-Strategy: Three Techniques to Survive Traffic Surges by Quickly Scaling Your Site</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 6 :  nginx_http_push_module . Turn nginx into a long-polling message queuing HTTP push server.
 
 Update 5 : In  Load Balancer Update  Barry describes how WordPress.com moved from Pound to Nginx and are now "regularly serving about 8-9k requests/second  and about 1.2Gbit/sec through a few Nginx instances and have plenty of room to grow!".   Update 4 :  Nginx better than Pound for load balancing.  Pound spikes at 80% CPU, Nginx uses 3% and is easier to understand and better documented.  Update 3 : igvita.com combines two cool tools together for better performance in  Nginx and Memcached, a 400% boost! .  Update 2 : Software Project on  Installing Nginx Web Server w/ PHP and SSL . Breaking away from mother Apache can be a scary proposition and this kind of getting started article really helps easy the separation.

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting tidbit from near the end of the Packet Pushers podcast  Show 15 – Saving the Web With Dinky Putt Putt Firewalls . The conversation was about how SSL connections need to terminate before they can be processed by a WAF ( Web Application Firewall ), which inspects HTTP for security problems like SQL injection and cross-site scripting exploits. Much was made that if programmers did their job better these appliances wouldn't be necessary, but I digress.
 
To  terminate SSL  most shops run SSL connections into Intel based Linux boxes running Apache. This setup is convenient for developers, but it's not optimized for SSL, so it's slow and costly. Much of the capacity of these servers are unnecessarily consumed processing SSL.
 
Load balancers on the other hand have crypto cards that terminate SSL very efficiently in hardware. Efficiently enough that if you are willing to get rid of the general purpose Linux boxes and use your big iron load balancers, your server count c</p><p>4 0.74507892 <a title="29-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-28-How_to_Get_DNS_Names_of_a_Web_Server.html">290 high scalability-2008-03-28-How to Get DNS Names of a Web Server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server, e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.     The problem is that I'm still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my qu</p><p>5 0.73936594 <a title="29-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Paper%3A_Lightweight_Web_servers.html">26 high scalability-2007-07-25-Paper: Lightweight Web servers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lighttpd  (pronounced "lighty") is a web server which is designed to be secure, fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-critical environments. Its low memory footprint (compared to other web servers), light CPU load and its speed goals make lighttpd suitable for servers that are suffering load problems, or for serving static media separately from dynamic content. lighttpd is free software / open source, and is distributed under the BSD license. lighttpd runs on GNU/Linux and other Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows.

<p>Introduction: One of the core assumption behind many of today’s databases is that disks are reliable. In other words, your data is “safe” if it is stored on a disk, and indeed most database solutions rely heavily on that assumption. Is it a valid assumption?

applications to provide functionality."Update: in an effort to help cross the
chasm of how start building a website using their grid OS, 3tera is offering
theirAssured Success Plan. The idea is to provide training, consulting, and
support so you can get started with some confidence you'll end up
succeeding.If you are starting or extending a website you have a problem: what
technologies should you use?Now there are more answers to that question than
ever. One new and refreshingly innovative answer is3tera's grid OS. In this
podcast interview with Bert Armijo from 3tera, we'll learn how 3tera wants to
change how you build websites.How? By transforming the physical into the
virtual and then allowing the virtual to be manipulated as if it were real.

<p>Introduction: The modern datacenter is evolving into the network centric datacenter model,
which is applied to both public and private cloud computing. In this model,
networking, platform, storage, and software infrastructure are provided as
services that scale up or down on demand. The network centric model allows the
datacenter to be viewed as a collection of automatically deployed and managed
application services that utilize underlying virtualized services. Providing
sufficient elasticity and scalability for the rapidly growing needs of the
datacenter requires these collections of automatically-managed services to
scale efficiently and with essentially no limits, letting services adapt
easily to changing requirements and workloads. Sun's VeriScale architecture
provides the architectural platform that can deliver these capabilities. Sun

<p>Introduction: Update:GIGAOM onrPath Burns EC2 Appliances in a Web Portal. rBuilder adds a
portal that lets users turn software into virtual appliances.rPathdemoed their
virtual appliance management system at Monday'sAWS Meetup. What they do is
help you build a generic virtual machine image deployable on Amazon, VMWare,
Xen and other targets. The idea is to build your software application
independent of the underlying operating system and deploy it in your own or
someone else's datacenter without worrying about all the details.To put their
service in context think of rPath as how you build, deploy, and upgrade images
and someone likeRight Scalehas how you can run and managed a cluster of
deployed images.breakTo build a Virtual Appliance you pull together all your
packages through their web interface or through a Python based "recipe"
system, select a VM target, and "cook" it all into a VM image you can
immediately deploy and run.To make this magic happen they use theConary

<p>Introduction: From their website:FAIis an automated installation tool to install or deploy
Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a
Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat,
autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used
for configuration management of a running system.You can take one or more
virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction
necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your
computers unattended with little effort involved. It's a centralized
management system for your Linux deployment.breakFAI's target group are system
administrators who have to install Linux onto one or even hundreds of
computers. It's not only a tool for doing a Cluster installation but a general
purpose installation tool. It can be used for installing a Beowulf cluster, a

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally
successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips
with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these
successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to
multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are
reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we
are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be
squashed.To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a
corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer
2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use
symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to
work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore
designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core
efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtaining</p><p>same-blog 2 0.84664917 <a title="42-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_GridLayer._Utility_computing_for_online_application.html">42 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: GridLayer.

<p>Introduction: TGLdelivers Virtual Private Datacenters and virtual private servers from grids
of commodity servers. Each TGL grid consists of a pool of HP servers connected
with a Gigabit backbone network and running 3Tera's AppLogic grid operating
system.With a Virtual Private Datacenter, you get complete control of your own
private grid. Using our visual interface, you set up and assemble disposable
virtual infrastructure, including firewalls, load balancers, web servers,
database servers, NAS boxes, etc. visually, by pointing and clicking. You can
build advanced clusters, deploy large and small applications, and save them as
templates that can be provisioned in minutes. You can even build your own
virtual servers and appliances.</p><p>3 0.81573582 <a title="42-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-06-GigaOm_Structure_08_Conference_on_June_25th_in_San_Francisco.html">341 high scalability-2008-06-06-GigaOm Structure 08 Conference on June 25th in San Francisco</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you just can't get enough high scalability talk you might want to take a
look GigaOm's Structure 08 conference. The slate of speakers looks
appropriately interesting and San Francisco is truly magical this time of
year. High Scalability readers even get a price break is you use the HIGHSCALE
discount code! I'll be on vacation so I won't see you there, but it looks like
a good time. For a nice change of pace consider visitingMoMAnext door. Here's
a blurb on the conference:A reminder to our readers about Structure 08,
GigaOm's upcomingconference dedicated to web infrastructure. In addition to
keynotesfrom leaders like Jim Crowe, chairman and CEO of Level 3Communications
and Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon, the event willfeature workshops from Google

<p>Introduction: Neil Conwayfrom Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk ata meetup today
in San Francisco on a new paper: Logic and Lattices for Distributed
Programming \- extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. The
description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the
paper:Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong
consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability.
Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of
strong consistency can be very challenging. In this talk, I'll discuss work
from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed
programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative
programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis
technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually
consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a
broader range of programs, drawin</p><p>5 0.75279421 <a title="42-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster_Lost_Lead_Because_of_a_Failure_to_Scale.html">153 high scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster Lost Lead Because of a Failure to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important. Jim Scheinman, former Bebo
and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to
scale as why they lost the social networking race:VB: Can you tell me a bit
about what you learned in your time at Friendster? JS:For me, it basically
came down to failed execution on the technology side -- we had millions of
Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log
in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in
to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling
us that if we didn't get our site working better soon, they'd be 'forced to
join' a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpace√¢&euro;≈öthe
rest is history. To be fair to Friendster's technology team at the time, they
were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites
simply hadn't had to deal with prior to Friendster. As is often the case, the

Jonathan Marks: It's actually a talk about how NOT to be creative. And what he
[John Cleese] describes is the way most international broadcasters operated
for most of their existence. They were content factories, slave to an
artificial transmission schedule. Because they didn't take time to be
creative, then ended up sounding like a tape machine. They were run by a
computer algorithm. Not a human soul. There was never room for a creative
pause. Routine was the solution. And that's creativities biggest enemy.40%

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAndy Gelfond, VP of Engineering for TripAdvisor. Andy
has been with TripAdvisor for six and a half years, wrote a lot of code in the
earlier days, and has been building and running a first class engineering and
operations team that is responsible for the worlds largest travel site.
There's an update for this article atAn Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run
On The Cloud? The Grand Experiment. For TripAdvisor, scalability is woven into
our organization on many levels - data center, software architecture,
development/deployment/operations, and, most importantly, within the culture
and organization. It is not enough to have a scalable data center, or a
scalable software architecture. The process of designing, coding, testing, and
deploying code also needs to be scalable. All of this starts with hiring and a
culture and an organization that values and supports a distributed, fast, and
effective development and operation of a complex and highly scalable consumer

outside china, that means latency and packetloss (and perhaps filtering) make
things difficult.The options I see are:1. Host you application in china, but
where? I haven't got a answer from any chinese ISP I contacted. On the other
hand I don't really want to host in china.2. Build your own CDN. Wikipedia
shows how it goes. Get a bunch of machines (but where? see point 1) put squid
on them, implement intelligent cache invalidation and you're set. But where
can I get machines in china? Where do I need them in china? There are soe big
isps with limited peering capability, so I'd need servers in every network.3.
Get professional CDN services. Akamai, ChinaCache, CDNetworks, etc etc.. They

<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novicexI am starting
a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality
possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).I have done some
research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I
have some basic knowledge on these.Following are my requirements1) My budget
is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).2)
I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first
2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And
more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)3)
90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.Based on the above,
could you please answer my following questions?1) Can I go with just a good
dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site
gets big? Or do you think its wise to start with a CDN service?2) Should I</p><p>3 0.67044902 <a title="165-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-05-Oprah_is_the_Real_Social_Network.html">267 high scalability-2008-03-05-Oprah is the Real Social Network</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and
there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of
the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet
tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are
Oprah...Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart
Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast"
where traffic peaked at 242Gbps. A variable bitrate scheme was used so
depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as
750Kbps.Dan Rayburn thinksThe big take away from this webcast is that it shows
proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those
who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions
and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.breakTo handle
more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P
streaming, or us</p><p>4 0.66140139 <a title="165-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-01-A_Scalability_checklist%3F.html">375 high scalability-2008-09-01-A Scalability checklist?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi everyone, I'm researching on Scalability for a college paper, and found
this site great, but it has too many tips, articles and the like, but I can't
see a hierarchical organization of subjects, I would need something like a
checklist of things or fields, or technologies to take into account when
assesing scalability.So far I've identified these:- Hardware scalability:-
scale out- scale up- CacheWhat types of cache are there? app-level, os-level,
network-level, I/O-level?- Load Balancing- DB ClusteringAm I missing something
important? (I'm sure I am)I don't expect you to give a lecture here, but maybe
point some things out, give me some useful links...Thanks!</p><p>5 0.65874726 <a title="165-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-11-How_Flickr_Handles_Moving_You_to_Another_Shard.html">120 high scalability-2007-10-11-How Flickr Handles Moving You to Another Shard</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Colin Charleshas cool picture showingFlickr's message tellinghim they'll need
about 15 minutes to move his 11,500 images to another shard. One, that's a lot
of pictures! Two, it just goes to show you don't have to make this stuff
complicated. Sure, it might be nice if their infrastructure could auto-balance
shards with no down time and no loss of performance, but do you really need to
go to all the extra complexity? The manual system works and though Colin would
probably like his service to have been up, I am sure his day will still be a
pleasant one.</p><p>6 0.64530069 <a title="165-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-26-Finding_an_excellent_LAMP_developer.html">193 high scalability-2007-12-26-Finding an excellent LAMP developer</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hello all,does anyone have experience in scaling a european website to
china?The main problem in china is the internet connectivity to websites
outside china, that means latency and packetloss (and perhaps filtering) make
things difficult.The options I see are:1. Host you application in china, but
where? I haven't got a answer from any chinese ISP I contacted. On the other
hand I don't really want to host in china.2. Build your own CDN. Wikipedia
shows how it goes. Get a bunch of machines (but where? see point 1) put squid
on them, implement intelligent cache invalidation and you're set. But where
can I get machines in china? Where do I need them in china? There are soe big
isps with limited peering capability, so I'd need servers in every network.3.
Get professional CDN services. Akamai, ChinaCache, CDNetworks, etc etc.. They
all provide services in china. The problem is: they are all very expensive.4.
Amazon EC2/S3 ? Is it worth thinking about this way? I am not sure, because
they on</p><p>4 0.79394823 <a title="165-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-04-Paper%3A_An_Analysis_of_Linux_Scalability_to_Many_Cores__.html">914 high scalability-2010-10-04-Paper: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: An Analysis of Linux Scalability to Many Cores, by a number of MIT
researchers, is a refreshingly practical paper on what it takes to scale Linux
and common applications like Exim, memcached, Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake,
Psearchy, and MapReduce to run on 48 core systems. A very timely paper given
moderately massive multicore systems are reportedly the near future of
computing.This paper must have taken a lot of work. They both tracked down
bottlenecks in a number of applications and the Linux kernel and they also
tried to fix them. Modestly speaking the authors said they made "modest"
changes to the kernel and applications, but there's nothing modest about what
they did. It's excellent work.After the next bit, which is the abstract, there
is a list of the problems they found and how they fixed them.The abstract:This
paper analyzes the scalability of seven system applications (Exim, memcached,
Apache, PostgreSQL, gmake, Psearchy, and MapReduce) running on Linux on a
48-core computer. Exce</p><p>5 0.73325098 <a title="165-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-08-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_8%2C_2013.html">1420 high scalability-2013-03-08-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 8, 2013</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey, it's HighScalability time: Quotable Quotes:@ibogost: Disabling features
of SimCity due to ineffective central infrastructure is probably the most
realistic simulation of the modern city.antirez: The point is simply to show
how SSDs can't be considered, currently, as a bit slower version of memory.
Their performance characteristics are a lot more about, simply, "faster
disks".@jessenoller: I only use JavaScript so I can gain maximum scalability
across multiple cores. Also unicorns. Paint thinner gingerbread@liammclennan:
high-scalability ruby. Why bother?@scomma: Problem with BitCoin is not
scalability, not even usability. It's whether someone will crack the algorithm
and render BTC entirely useless.@webclimber: Amazing how often I find myself
explaining that scalability is not magical@mvmsan: Flash as Primary Storage -
Highest Cost, Lack of HA, scalability and management features #flash #SSD
#CIO@pneuman42: Game servers are the *worst* scalability problem. Most
services start smal</p><p>6 0.73277092 <a title="165-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-19-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_19%2C_2013.html">1494 high scalability-2013-07-19-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 19, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TGLdelivers Virtual Private Datacenters and virtual private servers from grids
of commodity servers. Each TGL grid consists of a pool of HP servers connected
with a Gigabit backbone network and running 3Tera's AppLogic grid operating
system.With a Virtual Private Datacenter, you get complete control of your own
private grid. Using our visual interface, you set up and assemble disposable
virtual infrastructure, including firewalls, load balancers, web servers,
database servers, NAS boxes, etc. visually, by pointing and clicking. You can
build advanced clusters, deploy large and small applications, and save them as
templates that can be provisioned in minutes. You can even build your own
virtual servers and appliances.</p><p>3 0.20337914 <a title="126-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-12-Product%3A_rPath_-_Creating_and_Managing_Virtual_Appliances.html">245 high scalability-2008-02-12-Product: rPath - Creating and Managing Virtual Appliances</a></p>

help you build a generic virtual machine image deployable on Amazon, VMWare,
Xen and other targets. The idea is to build your software application
independent of the underlying operating system and deploy it in your own or
someone else's datacenter without worrying about all the details.To put their
service in context think of rPath as how you build, deploy, and upgrade images
and someone likeRight Scalehas how you can run and managed a cluster of
deployed images.breakTo build a Virtual Appliance you pull together all your
packages through their web interface or through a Python based "recipe"

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byRan Grushkowsky, Head of Technology at
ATMCash.Virtualization and cloud-based systems are very hype in the industry;
however, most financial companies stray from those solutions. At ATMCash,
we've approached virtualization not for the usual reason of scalability, but
for the usually missed value of security.In this article, I will introduce the
concept of security added value in the utilization of virtualization and why
people should consider deploying mini-clouds for those use-cases. How do
virtual machines help mitigate risk?I am sure most of you have heard of the
recenthacking in the financial sector. Financial companies are under constant
hacking attempts and security is of the utmost importance. One of the bigger
risks in system deployment is a breach in one of the stack components. Regular
system patches and maintenance fix known exploits and issues, however,
sometimes it may be too late and the component has already been breached. If

<p>Introduction: I first heard an enthusiastic endorsement ofSquarespacestreaming from the
ubiquitousLeo Laporteon one of his many Twit Live shows. Squarespace as afully
hosted, completely managed environment for creating and maintaining a website,
blog or portfoliowas of interest to me because they promise scalability and
this site doesn't have enough of that. But sadly, since they don't offer a
link preserving Drupal import our relationship was not meant to be.When a fine
reader of High Scalability, Brian Egge, (and all my readers are thrifty,
brave, and strong) asked me how Squarespace scaled I said I didn't know, but I
would try and find out. I emailed Squarespace a few questions and founder
Anthony Casalena and Director of Technical Operations Rolando Berrios were
kind enough to reply in some detail. The questions were both from Brian and
myself. Answers can be found below.Two things struck me most about
Squarespace's approach:They based their system on a memory grid, in this case

<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech hasdeveloped AdHoc, an advanced framework for sharing
geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the
resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective.The premise of
AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access
to his or her resources without an IT administrator's help, and with high
security level of any exposed data or applications assured.It takes 3 easy
steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization,
add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any
organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join
forces for more efficient results.AdHoc was initially created for a consortium
of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical
partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to
provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the

<p>Introduction: Update:VcubeV- an OpenVPN-based solution designed to build and operate a
multisourced infrastructure.True high availability requires a presence in
multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation
like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys
can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers. Cloud
computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling
the playing field. Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk
by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost, Mosso and other
providers.The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk
amongst the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy
Samovskiy in his Linux Journal article titledBuilding aMultisourced
Infrastructure Using OpenVPN.breakDmitriy's idea is to create a secure UDP
tunnel between different data centers over public internet links so your
application sees a flat virtual</p><p>6 0.7867043 <a title="126-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-14-Problem%3A_Mobbing_the_Least_Used_Resource_Error.html">275 high scalability-2008-03-14-Problem: Mobbing the Least Used Resource Error</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you just can't get enough high scalability talk you might want to take a
look GigaOm's Structure 08 conference. The slate of speakers looks
appropriately interesting and San Francisco is truly magical this time of
year. High Scalability readers even get a price break is you use the HIGHSCALE
discount code! I'll be on vacation so I won't see you there, but it looks like
a good time. For a nice change of pace consider visitingMoMAnext door. Here's
a blurb on the conference:A reminder to our readers about Structure 08,
GigaOm's upcomingconference dedicated to web infrastructure. In addition to
keynotesfrom leaders like Jim Crowe, chairman and CEO of Level 3Communications

<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important. Jim Scheinman, former Bebo
and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to
scale as why they lost the social networking race:VB: Can you tell me a bit
about what you learned in your time at Friendster? JS:For me, it basically
came down to failed execution on the technology side -- we had millions of
Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log
in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in
to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling
us that if we didn't get our site working better soon, they'd be 'forced to
join' a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpaceâ&euro;Śthe
rest is history. To be fair to Friendster's technology team at the time, they
were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites
simply hadn't had to deal with prior to Friendster. As is often the case, the

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally
successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips
with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these
successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to
multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are
reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we
are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be
squashed.To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a
corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer
2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use
symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to
work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore
designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core
efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtaining</p><p>4 0.94542521 <a title="126-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_September_9%2C_2011.html">1113 high scalability-2011-09-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For September 9, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The transport-level server load balancing architectures described inthe first
half of this articleare more than adequate for many Web sites, but more
complex and dynamic sites can't depend on them. Applications that rely on
cache or session data must be able to handle a sequence of requests from the
same client accurately and efficiently, without failing. In this follow up to
his introduction to server load balancing, Gregor Roth discusses various
application-level load balancing architectures, helping you decide which one
will best meet the business requirements of your Web site.The first half of
this articledescribes transport-level server load balancing solutions, such as
TCP/IP-based load balancers, and analyzes their benefits and disadvantages.
Load balancing on the TCP/IP level spreads incoming TCP connections over the
real servers in a server farm. It is sufficient in most cases, especially for

<p>Introduction: If you are looking for an excellent overview of general architecture
principles then take a look at Will Larson's Introduction to Architecting
Systems for Scale. Based on his experiences at Yahoo! and Digg, Will covers
key concepts in some depth. A quick gloss on the building blocks:Load
Balancing: Scalability & Redundancy.Horizontal scalability and redundancy are
usually achieved via load balancing, the spreading of requests across multiple
resources.Smart Clients.The client has a list of hosts and load balances
across that list of hosts. Upside is simple for programmers. Downside is it's
hard to update and change.Hardware Load Balancers.Targeted at larger
companies, this is dedicated load balancing hardware. Upside is performance.
Downside is cost and complexity.Software Load Balancers.The recommended
approach, it's  software that handles load balancing, health checks,
etc.Caching.Make better use of resources you already have. Precalculate
results for later use.

<p>Introduction: Update:Load Balancing in Amazon EC2 with HAProxy.Grig Gheorghiu writes a nice
poston HAProxy functionality and configuration: Emulating virtual servers,
Logging, SSL, Load balancing algorithms, Session persistence with cookies,
Server health checks, etc.Adapted From the website:HAProxyis a free, very fast
and reliable solution offering high availability, load balancing, and proxying
for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It is particularly suited for web sites
crawling under very high loads while needing persistence or Layer7 processing.
Supporting tens of thousands of connections is clearly realistic with todays
hardware. Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing
architectures very easy and riskless, while still offering the possibility not
to expose fragile web servers to the Net.Currently, two major versions are
supported :* version 1.1 - maintains critical sites online since 200 The most

<p>Introduction: Server farms achieve high scalability and high availability through server
load balancing, a technique that makes the server farm appear to clients as a
single server. In this two-part article, Gregor Roth explores server load
balancing architectures, with a focus on open source solutions. Part 1 covers
server load balancing basics and discusses the pros and cons of transport-
level server load balancing.The barrier to entry for many Internet companies
is low. Anyone with a good idea can develop a small application, purchase a
domain name, and set up a few PC-based servers to handle incoming traffic. The
initial investment is small, so the start-up risk is minimal. But a successful
low-cost infrastructure can become a serious problem quickly. A single server
that handles all the incoming requests may not have the capacity to handle
high traffic volumes once the business becomes popular. In such a situations

<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability
load balanced system using mod backhand andWackamole. The idea is you don't
need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of
the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-
based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read.
Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a
resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of

<p>Introduction: The idea came up in this Hacker Newsthread, commenting on a 37signals
interview, that having three system administrators is the minimum optimal
number of admins. Everyone wants to lower their costs by having each admin
administer a lot of machines. The problem is when you have fewer than three
admins you can never get a break from the constant corrosive pressure of
always being on call. When every moment of your life you are dreading the next
emergency, it eats at you. Having three admins solves that problem. With three
admins you can:Go on a real vacation. The two remaining admins can switch off
being on call.Not be on call all the time.A larger shop will naturally have
more admins so it's not as big an issue, but at smaller shops trying to
minimize head count, carrying three admins (or people in those roles) might be
something to consider.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.8254056 <a title="109-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-03-Save_on_a_Load_Balancer_By_Using_Client_Side_Load_Balancing.html">109 high scalability-2007-10-03-Save on a Load Balancer By Using Client Side Load Balancing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: InClient Side Load Balancing for Web 2.0 Applicationsauthor Lei Zhu suggests a
very interesting approach to load balancing: forget DNS round robbin, toss
your expensive load balancer, and make your client do the load balancing for
you. Your client maintains a list of possible servers and cycles through them.
All the details are explained in the article, but it's an intriguing idea,
especially for the budget conscious startup.</p><p>3 0.82477134 <a title="109-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-15-Scaling_Ambition_at_StackOverflow.html">777 high scalability-2010-02-15-Scaling Ambition at StackOverflow</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joel Spolsky and JeffAtwood areraising VC moneyforStackOverflow.This is
interesting for three reasons: 1) Joel has always seemed like a keep it small
and grow organically type of guy, so this is a big step in a different
direction. 2) It means they think there's a very big market in the Q&A; space
and they mean to capture as much as the market as possible. 3) Most
importantly for this blog, Joel gives some good advice on when to stay fresh
and local and when it's time to jump for the brass ring, scale up your
ambition, and go for VC money. Please seeJoel's blogpost for the details, but
here's when to go VC:There's a land grab going on.There is a provable concept
that's repeatable.The business itself could benefit from the publicity.The
investor will add substantial value to the business.The business can
potentially have a big exit or become a large, publically traded company.The
founders are not in it for their own personal aggrandizement.Joel thinks

<p>Introduction: Update 3:Always Refer to Your V1 As a Prototype. You really do have to plan to
throw one away.Update 2:Lessons Learned Scaling the Audiogalaxy Search Engine.
Things he should have done and fun things he couldn’t justify
doing.Update:Design details of Audiogalaxy.com’s high performance MySQL search
engine. At peak times, the search engine needed to handle 1500-2000 searches
every second against a MySQL database with about 200 million rows.Search was
one of most interesting problems at Audiogalaxy. It was one of the core
functions of the site, and somewhere between 50 to 70 million searches were
performed every day. At peak times, the search engine needed to handle
1500-2000 searches every second against a MySQL database with about 200

<p>Introduction: Drupal 7 is having a scalability makeover. Karoly Negyesi, Drupal Core Developer and Public Development Team Lead, explains the process in this video:  Drupal 7 APIs, scalability mindset . Karoly states the general theme of the changes as:  You give up some control and you get back scalability . An interesting comment on the politics of scalability?
 
Makeover may not be quite the right word though. A makeover implies a cosmetic change, looking better by changing the surface. Drupal's changes will go deeper than that, right to Drupal's core. It's a genuine and authentic change that will hopefully allow one of the Internet's most venerable Content Management Systems (CMSs) to compete with a constant stream of younger and sexier models.

<p>Introduction: Hi,         I am using drupal for my clients website, and was thinking is it possible to host all ( about 500) of them on the same server(maybe VPS or dedicated).       Here is the situation..... Each clients website has a database with about 50 tables each, all the databases are small in size about 2-5 MB .... and the websites are low traffic websites with say.. 50 hits/day on avg.... that means about 2000 queries/db/day ..... (avg 40 queries per hit)....         Wanted to know if it is possible to have so many databases about 500 on the same server?         what are the things that i should look into if i should make this happen?</p><p>4 0.14985812 <a title="169-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-17-Scalable_CMS%3F.html">95 high scalability-2007-09-17-Scalable CMS?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: the authors of drupal have paid considerable attention to performance and scalability. consequently even a default install running on modest hardware can easily handle the demands a small website.     if you are lucky, eventually the time comes when you need to service more users than your system can handle. at some point, you'll start looking at your hardware and network deployment.

<p>Introduction: One of the most important architectural decisions that must be done early on in a scalable web site project is  splitting the data flow into two streams : one that is user specific and one that is generic. If this is done properly, the system will be able to grow easily. On the other hand, if the data streams are not separated from the start, then the growth options will be severely limited. Trying to make such a web site scale will be just painting the corpse, and this change will cost a whole lot more when you need to introduce it later (and it is "when" in this case, not "if").</p><p>3 0.81809366 <a title="169-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-09-10_NoSQL_Systems_Reviewed.html">739 high scalability-2009-11-09-10 NoSQL Systems Reviewed</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jonathan Ellis  reviews in the  NoSQL Ecosystem  the origin of the NoSQL movement and 10 different NoSQL products and how their 1) support for multiple datacenters,  2) the ability to add new machines to a live cluster transparently to the your applications, 3) Data Model, 4) Query API, 5) Persistence Design. The 10 systems reviewed are: Cassandra, CouchDB, HBase, MongoDB, Neo4J, Redis, Riak, Scalaris, Tokyo Cabinet, Voldemort.
 
A very thorough and thoughtful article on the entire NoSQL space. It's clear from the article that NoSQL is not monolithic, there is a very wide variety of approaches to not being a relational database.

<p>Introduction: Where do you draw the line between scalability vs Performance vs High Availability vs Reliability?     I guess at the end of the day, we all want to be highly available, great performance and always reliable. So is it safe to say that scalability is the answer ?      Also when do you start to think scale out vs scale up ?</p><p>5 0.80313104 <a title="169-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-25-Application_Database_and_DAL_Architecture.html">222 high scalability-2008-01-25-Application Database and DAL Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups (this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day, let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>6 0.79846364 <a title="169-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-06-Scalability_for_Startups%3A_How_to_Grow_Up_without_Blowing_Up.html">404 high scalability-2008-10-06-Scalability for Startups: How to Grow Up without Blowing Up</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TheIsilon IQfamily of clustered storage systems was designed from the ground
up to meet the needs of data-intensive enterprises and high-performance
computing environments. By combining Isilon's OneFS® operating system software
with the latest advances in industry-standard hardware, Isilon delivers
modular, pay-as-you-grow, enterprise-class clustered storage systems. OneFS,
with TrueScale™ technology, powers the industry's first and only storage
system that enables linear or independent scaling of performance and capacity.
This new flexible and tunable system, featuring a robust suite of clustered
storage software applications, provides customers with an "out of the box"
solution that is fully optimized for the widest range of applications and
workflow needs.* Scales from 4 TB ti 1 PB* Throughput of up to 10 GB per

<p>Introduction: pNFS (parallel NFS) is the next generation of NFS and its main claim to fame
is that it's clustered, which "enables clients to directly access file data
spread over multiple storage servers in parallel. As a result, each client can
leverage the full aggregate bandwidth of a clustered storage service at the
granularity of an individual file." About pNFSStorageMojosays:pNFS is going to
commoditize parallel data access. In 5 years we won't know how we got along

<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:GlusterFSis a clustered file-system capable of
scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over
Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64
server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).Cluster file systems are still
not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain
though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of
commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.GlusterFS
achieved35 GBps read throughput. The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was
performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband
interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with
multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB
block size. GlusterFS was configured with unify translator and round-robin
scheduler.The advantage</p><p>6 0.11080444 <a title="20-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-10-Switch_your_databases_to_Flash_storage._Now._Or_you%27re_doing_it_wrong..html">1369 high scalability-2012-12-10-Switch your databases to Flash storage.

<p>Introduction: The Clustered Storage RevolutionIf the clustered file system, clustered
storage system, storage virtualization movement is new to you then this is a
good intro paper. It's a both vendor puff piece and informative, so it might
be worth your time.A Quick Hit of What's InsideClustered storage architectures

<p>Introduction: Google's Research Areas of Interest: Building scalable, robust cluster
applications.At Google we see distributed systems as a technology in its
infancy, with huge gaps in the supporting research  that represent some of the
most important problems in the space. Here are some examples:Resource
sharing,Balancing cost, performance, and reliability,Self-maintaining systems.

<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

<p>Introduction: This is a question everyone must struggle with when building out their
datacenter. Storage choices are always the ones I have the least confidence
in. David Marks in his blogYou Can Change It Later!asks the questionShould I
get a SAN to scale my site architecture?and answers no. A better solution is
to use commodity hardware, directly attach storage on servers, and partition
across servers to scale and for greater availability.David's reasoning is
interesting:A SAN creates a SPOF (single point of failure) that is dependent
on a vendor to fly and fix when there's a problem. This can lead to long down
times during this outage you have no access to your data at all.Using easily
available commodity hardware minimizes risks to your company, it's not just
about saving money. Zooming over to Fry's to buy emergency equipment provides
the kind of agility startups need in order to respond quickly to ever changing
situations.It's hard to beat the power and flexibility (backups, easy to add

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAli Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead atPlanForCloud. The
original article was publishedon their site. With 29 cloud price reductions I
thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change
compared to an articlewe published last year. The result is surprisingly
little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances havenot dropped
as fastas for other other instances types.Over the last year and a half,we
counted 29 price reductionsin cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute
Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct
effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is
that effect on the bottom line?Last year I wrote aboutcloud cost forecasts for
TripAdvisor and Pinterest.TripAdvisor was experimenting with AWSand attempted
to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of its live site,
andPinterest was growing massively on AWS. In the wake of the cloud providers'

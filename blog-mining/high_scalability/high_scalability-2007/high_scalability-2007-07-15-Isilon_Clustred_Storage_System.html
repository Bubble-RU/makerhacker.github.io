<p>Introduction: The Clustered Storage Revolution 
 
If the clustered file system, clustered storage system, storage virtualization movement is new to you then this is a good intro paper. It's a both vendor puff piece and informative, so it might be worth your time.
  A Quick Hit of What's Inside  
Clustered storage architectures have the ability to pull together two or more storage devices to behave as a single entity. Clustered storage can be broken down into three types:

 Namespace aggregation

<p>Introduction: pNFS (parallel NFS) is the next generation of NFS and its main claim to fame is that it's clustered, which "enables clients to directly access file data spread over multiple storage servers in parallel. As a result, each client can leverage the full aggregate bandwidth of a clustered storage service at the granularity of an individual file." About pNFS  StorageMojo  says:  pNFS is going to commoditize parallel data access. In 5 years we wonâ&euro;&trade;t know how we got along without it . Something to watch.</p><p>4 0.09152393 <a title="12-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-31-Squarespace_Architecture_-_A_Grid_Handles_Hundreds_of_Millions_of_Requests_a_Month_.html">691 high scalability-2009-08-31-Squarespace Architecture - A Grid Handles Hundreds of Millions of Requests a Month </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I first heard an enthusiastic endorsement of  Squarespace  streaming from the ubiquitous  Leo Laporte  on one of his many Twit Live shows. Squarespace as a  fully hosted, completely managed environment for creating and maintaining a website, blog or portfolio  was of interest to me because they promise scalability and this site doesn't have enough of that. But sadly, since they don't offer a link preserving Drupal import our relationship was not meant to be.  When a fine reader of High Scalability, Brian Egge,  (and all my readers are thrifty, brave, and strong) asked me how Squarespace scaled I said I didn't know, but I would try and find out. I emailed Squarespace a few questions and founder Anthony Casalena and Director of Technical Operations Rolando Berrios were kind enough to reply in some detail. The questions were both from Brian and myself. Answers can be found below.  Two things struck me most about Squarespace's approach:

<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:    GlusterFS  is a clustered file-system capable of scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64 server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).  Cluster file systems are still not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.   GlusterFS achieved  35 GBps read throughput . The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB block size.

<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show you how! They have   launched Wuala  , the social online storage service which scales as new nodes join the P2P network.     The goal of   Wua.la   is to provide distributed online storage that is:     large   scalable   reliable   secure     by harnessing the idle resources of participating computers.     This challenge is an old dream of computer science. In fact as   Andrew Tanenbaum   wrote in 1995:    "The design of a world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise for the reader"      After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system, Caleido is ready to unveil the resu</p><p>6 0.69944704 <a title="12-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-27-Video%3A_Storage_in_the_Cloud_at_Joyent.html">503 high scalability-2009-01-27-Video: Storage in the Cloud at Joyent</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It’s  called “east-west” networking, which when compared to its predecessor,  “north-south” networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane  winds and tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation  between the transformative shift this change in networking patterns has  on the data center with that of El Niño’s transformative power upon the  weather patterns across the globe.
  

    Traditionally,  data center networks have focused on North-South network traffic. The  assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly communicate with  servers at the core, rather than across the network to other clients. 


 But  server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual  appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical  infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with  workloads moving to different physical locations on the network as  virtual servers are migrated (in the case of data center networks) and  clients move</p><p>5 0.63805139 <a title="12-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-18-Save_up_to_30%25_by_Selecting_Better_Performing_Amazon_Instances.html">1343 high scalability-2012-10-18-Save up to 30% by Selecting Better Performing Amazon Instances</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you like the idea of exploiting market inconsistencies to lower your costs then you will love this  paper  and video from the Hot Cloud '12 conference:  Exploiting Hardware Heterogeneity within the Same Instance Type of Amazon EC2 .
 
The conclusion is interesting and is a source of good guidance:
  
 Amazon EC2 uses diversified hardware to host the same type of instance.   
 The hardware diversity results in performance variation.  
 In general, the variation between the fast instances and slow  instances can reach 40%. In some applications, the variation can even approach up to 60%.   
 By selecting fast instances within the same instance type,  Amazon EC2 users can acquire up to 30% of cost saving, if the fast instances have a relatively low probability. 
  
The abstract:
  

Cloud computing providers might start with near-homogeneous hardware environment. Over time, the homogeneous environment will most likely evolve into heterogeneous one because of possible upgrades and replac</p><p>6 0.61939526 <a title="12-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-26-Oculus_Causes_a_Rift%2C_but_the_Facebook_Deal_Will_Avoid_a_Scaling_Crisis_for_Virtual_Reality.html">1619 high scalability-2014-03-26-Oculus Causes a Rift, but the Facebook Deal Will Avoid a Scaling Crisis for Virtual Reality</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,     I am an owner of an large community website and currently we are having problems with our database architecture. We are using 2 database servers and spread tables across them to divide read/writes. We have about 90% reads and 10% writes. We use Memcached on all our webservers to cache as much as we can, traffic is load balanced between webservers. We have 2 extra servers ready to put to use!      We have looked into a couple of solution so far:   Continuent Uni/Cluster aka Sequoia -> Commercial version way too expensive and Java isn't as fast as it suppose to be.   MySQL Proxy -> We couldn't find any good example on how to create a master - master with failover scenario.   MySQL Clustering -> Seems to be not mature enough, had a lot of performance issues when we tried to go online with it.    MySQL DRDB HA -> Only good for failover, cannot be scaled!   MySQL Replication -> Well don't get me started ;)     So now I turn to you guys to help me out, I am with my hands in my hair a</p><p>3 0.11178466 <a title="4-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-08-Paper%3A_Understanding_and_Building_High_Availability-Load_Balanced_Clusters.html">117 high scalability-2007-10-08-Paper: Understanding and Building High Availability-Load Balanced Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability load balanced system using mod backhand and  Wackamole . The idea is you don't need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read. Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of effect of keep-alives on performance.</p><p>4 0.10889821 <a title="4-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-The_cost_of_High_Availability_%28HA%29_with_Oracle_.html">813 high scalability-2010-04-19-The cost of High Availability (HA) with Oracle </a></p>
<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000 or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.
 
This post focuses on a customer’s backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services and annual support?

What should Robert ask in his scalability interview?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the cool things about Mr. Scoble is he doesn't pretend to know everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help? Here's Robert's plight:     I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.  It’s on Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.  Look at who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the “don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million users on Facebook in about 10 days.

<p>Introduction: Sequoia  is a transparent middleware solution offering clustering, load balancing and failover services for any database. Sequoia is the continuation of the C-JDBC project. The database is distributed and replicated among several nodes and Sequoia balances the queries among these nodes. Sequoia handles node and network failures with transparent failover. It also provides support for hot recovery, online maintenance operations and online upgrades.
  Features in a nutshell    No modification of existing applications or databases.    Operational with any database providing a JDBC driver.    High availability provided by advanced RAIDb technology.    Transparent failover and recovery capabilities.    Performance scalability with unique load balancing and query result caching features.    Integrated JMX-based administration and monitoring.    100% Java implementation allowing portability across platforms with a JRE 1.4 or greater.    Open source licensed under Apache v2 license.

<p>Introduction: Surge  is a conference put on by OmniTI targeting practical Scalability matters. OmniTI specializes in helping people solve their scalability problems, as is only natural, as it was founded by Theo Schlossnagle, author of the canonical  Scalable Internet Architectures . 
 
Now that Surge 2011 is on the horizon, they've generously made available nearly all the  videos from the Surge 2010  conference.  A pattern hopefully every conference will follow (only don't wait a year please). We lose a lot of collective wisdom from events not being available online in a timely manner.
 
In truth, nearly  all the talks  are on topic and are worth watching, but here are a few that seem especially relevant:

<p>Introduction: The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges    Research and education in Parallel computing technologies is more important than ever. Here I present a perspective on the past contributions, current status, and future direction of the parallelism technologies.     While machine power will grow impressively, increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be driving force in computing in the foreseeable future. This ongoing shift toward parallel architectural paradigms is one of the greatest challenges for the microprocessor and software industries. In 2005, Justin Ratter, chief technology officer of Intel Corporation, said ‘We are at the cusp of a transition to multicore, multithreaded architectures, and we still have not demonstrated the ease of programming the move will require…’      Key points:       A Little history   Parallelism Challenges   Under the hood, Parallelism Challenges    Synchronization problems   CAS problems       The future of the parallelism</p><p>4 0.6098786 <a title="4-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-05-30-Strategy%3A_Get_Servers_for_Free_and_Make_Users_Happy_by_Turning_on_Compression.html">1254 high scalability-2012-05-30-Strategy: Get Servers for Free and Make Users Happy by Turning on Compression</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Edward Capriolo has a really interesting article on his dramatic performance expanding experience of   turning on compression for Cassandra   .   The idea: 
  
  Enabling compression shrunk 71GB of data down to  31GB, which caused more data to fit in RAM, which reduced disk IO to nearly nothing.  
  Compression means more data can be stored, which is like buying more machines without having to spend more money.  
  Compression means serving more data out of RAM, which means clients are happier because of the performance improvements.  
  The cost is higher CPU usage to perform the encrypt/decrypt. But disk IO is orders of magnitude slower than decompression and most servers have CPU to burn.  
  
 Edward's article is well written, has the specifics on how to turn on compression for Cassandra, pretty graphs, and lots more details.</p><p>5 0.60196185 <a title="4-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-23-Economies_of_Scale_in_the_Datacenter%3A_Gmail_is_100x_Cheaper_to_Run_than_Your_Own_Server.html">1310 high scalability-2012-08-23-Economies of Scale in the Datacenter: Gmail is 100x Cheaper to Run than Your Own Server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle , infrastructure guru and SVP at Google, made a  really interesting statement  about the economics of scale in the datacenter:
  

Weâ&euro;&trade;ve shown that when you run a large application in the datacenter, like Gmail, you can, compared to a small organization running their own email server, you can save nearly a factor of 100 in terms of compute and energy, when you run it at scale.

  
My first thought was shock at the magnitude of the difference. 100x is a chasm crosser. Then I thought about Gmail, it's horizontally scalable using technologies that are following Moore's Law (storage and compute), latency requirements are lax, a commodity network is sufficient, and it can be highly automated so management costs scale slower than users. After that it's a simple matter of software :-) Oh, and developing a market where it's "cheaper to run a large thing than a small thing."</p><p>6 0.57872885 <a title="4-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-03-Development_of_highly_scalable_web_site.html">296 high scalability-2008-04-03-Development of highly scalable web site</a></p>

</p><p>4 When I finally brought my distracted mind around to consider the scalability of the single page webs site I was building, I became a bit concerned. [sent-10, score-0.476]
</p><p>5 Many of the strategies that are typically used to achieve scalability don't seem to apply in single page land. [sent-11, score-0.205]
</p><p>6 Plus: a lot of state is maintained in the client. [sent-14, score-0.184]
</p><p>7 And my shopping cart must outlast my browser session so its still there when I return. [sent-21, score-0.427]
</p><p>8 I would be heart broken if my carefully crafted Amazon cart disappeared every time Firefox went away. [sent-22, score-0.276]
</p><p>9 Yet a lot of state is kept on the client side and that's a better thing. [sent-24, score-0.29]
</p><p>10 The client can do a lot of the work which saves making calls to the server. [sent-26, score-0.188]
</p><p>11 The lack of a proper link structure means your site can't be spidered, which means it can't be searched. [sent-29, score-0.175]
</p><p>12 One useful scalability strategy is to offload search to something like Google's Custom Search Engine, not for the ad revenue (because there's little), but because it means I don't have to devote any resources to searching. [sent-30, score-0.458]
</p><p>13 The common response to the previously mentioned search engine optimization (SEO) problems are to make a shadow text site or insert hidden divs. [sent-33, score-0.241]
</p><p>14 RPC is used to slurp up data from the server and these requests must go back to the originating domain. [sent-37, score-0.176]
</p><p>15 This counters one common strategy of using a CDN and/or multiple host names for serving content so you can trick your browser into starting multiple simultaneous connections to different hosts when loading page content. [sent-38, score-0.402]
</p><p>16 Using RPC to serve content seems to lose this advantage. [sent-40, score-0.179]

</p><p>18 Unsure: When using a caching proxy like Squid, a major scalability strategy, is my cacheable content effectively cached when using RPC? [sent-48, score-0.336]
</p><p>19 This converts your client into a big mashup, even if all the parts you are mashing are your own. [sent-51, score-0.18]

<p>Introduction: Robert Stewart shared this useful Ajax related scalability strategy:     We avoided XMLHttpRequests for individual keystrokes, choosing to go back to the server only when a field lost focus. Google can afford all the servers to handle the load for that, but we didn't want to.      Do you have a scalability strategy to share?

<p>Introduction: Find out with Builtwith.com. It scans a site and guesses how the site is built. I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows,  PHP, Adsense, RSS, CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which AJAX library is used. Though it's kind of cool to see which sites use PHP and other technologies.</p><p>5 0.12825456 <a title="124-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish_Architecture.html">638 high scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 5 :  PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews And 32 Billion Images A Month     Update 4 :  Jeff Atwood  costs out Markus' scale up approach against a scale out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive scale up works better for his needs.   Update 3 :  POF now has 200 million images  and serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS RamSan to handle the load. Also upgraded to a core database machine with 512 GB of RAM, 32 CPU’s, SQLServer  2008 and Windows 2008.   Update 2 : This seems to be a  POF Peer1 love fest infomercial . It's pretty content free, but the production values are high. Lots of quirky sounds and fish swimming on the screen.  Update : by Facebook standards Read/WriteWeb says POF is worth a cool  one billion dollars .

<p>Introduction: In the article  The  Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us , a lot of interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5  second procedure; capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem; memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10 minutes; videos, ar</p><p>3 0.74367124 <a title="124-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-08-Mollom_Architecture_-_Killing_Over_373_Million_Spams_at_100_Requests_Per_Second.html">985 high scalability-2011-02-08-Mollom Architecture - Killing Over 373 Million Spams at 100 Requests Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mollom  is one of those cool SaaS companies every developer dreams of creating when they wrack their brains looking for a viable software-as-a-service startup. Mollom profitably runs a useful service— spam filtering —with a small group of geographically distributed developers. Mollom helps protect nearly 40,000 websites from spam, including  one of mine , which is where I first learned about Mollom. In a desperate attempt to stop spam on a Drupal site, where every other form of CAPTCHA had failed miserably, I installed Mollom in about 10 minutes and it immediately started working. That's the out of the box experience I was looking for.
 
From the time Mollom opened its digital inspection system they've rejected over 373 million spams and in the process they've learned that a stunning 90% of all messages are spam. This spam torrent is handled by only two geographically distributed machines that handle 100 requests/ second, each running a Java application server and Cassandra. So few res</p><p>4 0.72720522 <a title="124-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-26-17_Techniques_Used_to_Scale_Turntable.fm_and_Labmeeting_to_Millions_of_Users.html">1124 high scalability-2011-09-26-17 Techniques Used to Scale Turntable.fm and Labmeeting to Millions of Users</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  How to launch in a month and scale to a million users ,  Joseph Perla , Former VP of Technology and founding team of Turntable.fm, shares techniques he used to build and quickly scale his startups. The post is very well written and a must read. Here are the essentials:
  
  Keep it simple.  Build API's before making the website or mobile apps. Keep interfaces small and single-purpose.  
  Get it right.  Build in automated tests from the start. Create function tests, module level tests, and full integration tests. Run tests on every commit. No new code written while bugs exist. 
  Don't hide power.  Use  Pebbles  to write bug-free Javascript, a library to create complicated AJAX interactions by writing 0 javascript by adding a few extra HTML tags to code. 
  Use procedure arguments to provide flexibility in an interface.  Pass functions instead of parameters to support complicated scenarios. For example, a filter function return a boolean. 
  Leave it to the client.  Keep the server</p><p>5 0.72667307 <a title="124-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-When_things_aren%27t_scalable.html">232 high scalability-2008-01-29-When things aren't scalable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK,     I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll ask here.     Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application" that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server" when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.     The normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let</p><p>6 0.7252304 <a title="124-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-09-FaceStat%27s_Rousing_Tale_of_Scaling_Woe_and_Wisdom_Won.html">344 high scalability-2008-06-09-FaceStat's Rousing Tale of Scaling Woe and Wisdom Won</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've been using GWT for an application and I get the same feeling using it that I first got using html. I've always sucked at building UIs. Starting with programming HP terminals, moving on to the Apple Lisa, then X Windows, and Microsoft Windows, I just never had IT, whatever IT is. On the Beauty and the Geek scale my interfaces are definitely horned-rimmed and pocket protector friendly. Html helped free me from all that to just build stuff that worked, but didn't have to look all that great. Expectations were pretty low and I eagerly fulfilled them. With Ajax expectations have risen again and I find myself once more easily identifiable as a styless geek. Using GWT I have some hopes I can suck a little less.     In working with GWT I was so focussed on its tasty easily digestible Ajaxy goodness, I didn't stop to think about the topic of this site: scalability. When I finally brought my distracted mind around to consider the scalability of the single page webs site I was building, I be</p><p>2 0.90914577 <a title="124-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_9%2C_2012.html">1206 high scalability-2012-03-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 9, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Teams from  Princeton  and CMU are  working together  to solve one of the most difficult problems in the repertoire: scalable geo-distributed data stores. Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple datacenter database functionality for some time, but there's still a general lack of available systems that work for complex data scenarios.
 
The ideas in this paper-- Don’t Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-Area Storage with COPS --are different. It's not another eventually consistent system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally consistent system that achieves  ALPS  system properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL, etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete successfully), Low-latency (operations complete quickly (single digit milliseconds)), Partition-tolerant (operates with a partition), and Scalable (just a</p><p>4 0.88673294 <a title="124-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-20-Packet_Pushers%3A_How_to_Build_a_Low_Cost_Data_Center.html">1027 high scalability-2011-04-20-Packet Pushers: How to Build a Low Cost Data Center</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers  Show 41  episode was to reveal and ruminate over the horrors of a successful  attack on RSA , which puts the whole world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost datacenter.
 
Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal:
 
 
  
 Look at Arista and Juniper.  
 Juniper           
 
 Has a range of stackable switches, which includes some 10 gig. 
 If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric. Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.

<p>Introduction: AWStatsis a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web,
streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works
as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log
contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be
able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files
from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log
format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of
other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.</p><p>3 0.14453994 <a title="35-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-30-How_Rackspace_Now_Uses_MapReduce_and_Hadoop_to_Query_Terabytes_of_Data.html">233 high scalability-2008-01-30-How Rackspace Now Uses MapReduce and Hadoop to Query Terabytes of Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from
over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle
ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the greatMapReduce Versus Database War,
you would be correct.Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail
division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved
their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each
machine approach, to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just
couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that
works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability
potential.Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data
streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful
with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text
files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each
individual machine. Then came a</p><p>4 0.14116751 <a title="35-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_Web_Log_Storming.html">37 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: Web Log Storming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Web Log Stormingis an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows.
The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any
other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down
to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and
how it fits into your desired scenario.Web Log Storming does far more than
just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with
interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of
activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.In
other words, analyze your web logs like never before!It's easy to track
sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to
each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and
keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the
top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed. You
can learn</p><p>5 0.12401681 <a title="35-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-21-Processing_100_Million_Pixels_a_Day_-_Small_Amounts_of_Contention_Cause_Big_Problems_at_Scale.html">1390 high scalability-2013-01-21-Processing 100 Million Pixels a Day - Small Amounts of Contention Cause Big Problems at Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byGordon Worley, a Software Engineer atKorrelate, where
they correlate (see what they did there) online purchases to offline
purchases.Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every
server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not
making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come
online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were
originally told to expect. I wouldn't say we panicked, but the office was
certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks
both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the
added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.At
Korrelate, we deploytracking pixels, also known beacons or web bugs, that our
partners use to send us information about their users. These tiny web objects

reports that include both text information (tables) and charts. View the
WebLog Expert sample report to get the general idea of the variety of
information about your site's usage it can provide.WebLog Expert can analyze
logs of Apache and IIS web servers. It can even read GZ and ZIP compressed
logs so you won't need to unpack them manually.The log analyzer features
intuitive interface. Built-in wizards will help you quickly and easily create
a profile for your site and analyze it.</p><p>5 0.83281142 <a title="35-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-21-Processing_100_Million_Pixels_a_Day_-_Small_Amounts_of_Contention_Cause_Big_Problems_at_Scale.html">1390 high scalability-2013-01-21-Processing 100 Million Pixels a Day - Small Amounts of Contention Cause Big Problems at Scale</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Nobody came up with an example of a website powered by a Websphere product
(which has a community edition) and backed up by a DB2 database.I guess you
all know about usopen.org so here's the story:breakWhile the re-emergence of
35-year-old Andre Agassi and the continued dominance of wunderkind Maria
Sharapova have highlighted the on-court headlines at this year's U.S. Open
Tennis Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., IBM is hoping its new Power5
chip-based IT support for USOpen.org can make news among those more interested
in .NET than tennis nets.Big Blue has partnered with the U.S. Tennis
Association and the U.S. Open -- the most prestigious tennis tournament in the
U.S. -- since 1992. Together, they launched USOpen.org in 1995 so racket heads
could follow the matches online.The iSeries' role this year is in powering a
Web-based end-user application called "Point Tracker," a graphics tool using
autonomic technology that recreates the trajectory of every shot. On-court

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting
system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by
advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide
guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see
how!Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed
in a format calledAlexandrian form which draws on constructs used by
Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:The pattern
nameThe problem the pattern is trying to solveContextSolutionExamplesDesign
rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why
experts use itPatterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context,
and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new
context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next
‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied. A pattern language is a structured
collection of such patterns that build o</p><p>4 0.73963362 <a title="35-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-11-05-A_Yes_for_a_NoSQL_Taxonomy.html">737 high scalability-2009-11-05-A Yes for a NoSQL Taxonomy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: NorthScale's Steven Yen in his highly entertaining NoSQL is a Horseless
Carriage presentation has come up with a NoSQL taxonomy that thankfully
focuses a little more on what NoSQL is, thanwhat it
isn't:key‐value‐cachememcached, repcached, coherence, infinispan, eXtreme
scale, jboss cache, velocity, terracoqa key‐value‐storekeyspace, flare,
schema‐free, RAMCloudeventually‐consistent key‐value‐storedynamo, voldemort,

Shoaldocument store CouchDB, Mongo, Jackrabbit, XML Databases, ThruDB,
CloudKit, Perservere, Riak Basho, Scalariswide columnar storeBigTable, Hbase,

asks. He answers:  the most approachable API with enough power will win.

<p>Introduction: Forrester released their new wave report:  The Forrester Waveâ&bdquo;˘: Elastic
Caching Platforms, Q2 2010where they listed GigaSpaces, IBM, Oracle, and
Terracotta as leading vendors in the field. In this post I'd like to take some
time to explain what some of these terms mean, and why they're important to
you. I'll start with a definition of Elastic Data Grid (Elastic Caching), how
it is different then other caching and NoSQL alternatives, and more
importantly -- I'll illustrate how it works through some real code
examples.You can read the full storyhere.</p><p>6 0.72454464 <a title="35-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-14-Scaling_an_image_upload_service.html">319 high scalability-2008-05-14-Scaling an image upload service</a></p>

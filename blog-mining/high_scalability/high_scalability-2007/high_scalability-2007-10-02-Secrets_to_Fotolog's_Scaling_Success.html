both my favoritebirdand the web's leading photo sharing site. Flickr has an
amazing challenge, they must handle a vast sea of ever expanding new content,
ever increasing legions of users, and a constant stream of new features, all
while providing excellent performance. How do they do it?Site:

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is
Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on
Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G
available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding
performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've

<p>Introduction: Tim Brayhas a wonderfulinterview with Casey Forbes, creator of Ravelry, a Ruby
on Rails site supporting a 400,000+ strong community of dedicated knitters and
crocheters.Casey and his small team have done great things with Ravelry. It is
a very focused site that provides a lot of value for users. And users
absolutely adore the site. That's obvious from their enthusiastic comments and
rocket fast adoption of Ravelry.Ten years ago a site like Ravelry would have
been a multi-million dollar operation. Today Casey is the sole engineer for
Ravelry and to run it takes only a few people. He was able to code it in 4
months working nights and weekends. Take a look down below of all the
technologies used to make Ravelry and you'll see how it is constructed almost
completely from free of the shelf software that Casey has stitched together
into a complete system. There's an amazing amount of leverage in today's
ecosystem when you combine all the quality tools, languages, storage,

<p>Introduction: How do you keep a system small enough, while still being successful, that a
simple scale-up strategy becomes the preferred architecture?StackOverflow, for
example, could stick with a tool chain they were comfortable with because they
had a natural brake on how fast they could grow: there are only so many
programmers in the world. If this doesn't work for you, here's another natural
braking strategy to consider:charge for your service.Paul Houlesummarized this
nicely as:avoid scaling problems by building a service that's profitable at a
small scale.This interesting point, one I hadn't properly considered before,
was brought up by Maciej Ceglowski, co-founder ofPinboard.in, in an interview
with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur on their theirnet@nightshow.Pinboard is a
lean, mean, pay for bookmarking machine, a timely replacement for the nearly
departed Delicious. And as a self professed anti-social bookmarking site, it
emphasizes speed over socializing.

<p>Introduction: The fascination over Instagram continues and fortunately we have several new
streams of information to feed the insanity. So consider this article an
update toThe Instagram Architecture Facebook Bought For A Cool Billion
Dollars, based primarily onScaling Instagram, a slide deck for an AirBnB tech
talk given by Instagram co-founder, Mike Krieger. Several other information
sources, listed at the bottom of the article, were also used.Unfortunately we
just have a slide deck, so the connective tissue of the talk is missing, but
it's still very interesting, in the same spirit of wisdom presentations we
often see after developers come up for air after spending significant time
spent in the trenches.If you expect to dive deep into the technological
details and find a billion reasons why Instagram was acquired, you will be
disappointed. That magic can be found in the emotional investment in the
relationship between all of the users and the product, not in the bits about
how they bytes are mana</p><p>5 0.78424531 <a title="106-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish_Architecture.html">638 high scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 17:Are Wireless Road Trains the Cure for Traffic Congestion?BY ADDY
DUGDALE.The concept of road trains--up to eight vehicles zooming down the road
together--has long been considered a faster, safer, and greener way of
traveling long distances by carUpdate 16:The first electric vehicle in the
countrypowered completely by ultracapacitors. The minibus can be fully
recharged in fifteen minutes, unlike battery vehicles, which typically takes
hours to recharge.Update 15:How to Make UAVs Fully Autonomous. The Sense-and-
Avoid system uses a four-megapixel camera on a pan tilt to detect obstacles
from the ground. It puts red boxes around planes and birds, and blue boxes
around movement that it determines is not an obstacle (e.g., dust on the
lens).Update 14:ATNMBL is a concept vehiclefor 2040 that represents the end of
driving and an alternative approach to car design. Upon entering ATNMBL, you
are presented with a simple question: "Where can I take you?" There is no

<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300
thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially
experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems
and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each
day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly
visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a
very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale
meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?Site:

<p>Introduction: This topic has been ripped directly from Lambda the Ultimate'sWhat will
programming look like in 2020? post. They are having a lively discussion and
if you are interested in flexing your holiday thought muscles we might have a
good discussion too.Eight years is a difficult prediction horizon. It's too
short to simply project out current trends and it's too long to discount
potential technological breakthroughs coming to market. There's the
challenge.Some of my lousy predictions: Programmers Will Form Guilds Around
New Gamified Training HubsThe Web Will Become More Closed Before it Becomes
More OpenNot Everyone Will Become a ProgrammerFocus Will Shift to Creating
Bigger People Instead of Chasing Big IdeasProgrammers Will Form Guilds Around

doing: "You are no longer IO-bound, you're CPU bound, like you're supposed to
be."@maxtaco: Garbage collection solves a minuscule %age of bugs, that are
non-critical (memleaks? big deal!) and easy to find and fix. At a HUGE
expense.@merv: #cassandra12 @eddie_satterly describing $1M savings in first

<p>Introduction: At least in the articles on Plenty of Fish and Slashdot it was mentioned that
one can achieve higher performance by creating read-only and write-only
databases where possible.I have read the comments and tried unsuccessfully to
find more information on the net about this. I still do not understand the
concept. Can someone explain it in more detail, as well as recommend resources
for further investigation? (Are there books written specifically about this
technique?) I think it is a very important issue, because databases are
oftentimes the bottleneck.</p><p>3 0.1482897 <a title="150-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-02-Friends_for_Sale_Architecture_-_A_300_Million_Page_View-Month_Facebook_RoR_App.html">313 high scalability-2008-05-02-Friends for Sale Architecture - A 300 Million Page View-Month Facebook RoR App</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Jake inDoes Django really scale better than Rails?thinks apps like FFS
shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.In a short three months Friends for
Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook
application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300
million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails, two part
time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard
architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful
people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byDave HaglerSystems Architect at AOL.The AOL homepages
receive more than8 million visitors per day.  That's more daily viewers than
Good Morning America or the Today Show on television.  Over a billion page
views are served each month.  AOL.com has been a major internet destination
since 1996, and still has a strong following of loyal users.The architecture
for AOL.com is in it's 5th generation.  It has essentially been rebuilt from
scratch 5 times over two decades.  The current architecture was designed 6
years ago.  Pieces have been upgraded and new components have been added along
the way, but the overall design remains largely intact.  The code, tools,
development and deployment processes are highly tuned over 6 years of
continual improvement, making the AOL.com architecture battle tested and very
stable.The engineering team is made up of developers, testers, and operations
andtotals around 25 people.  The majority are in Dulles, Virginia with a

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Steffen Konerow, author of theHigh Performance
Blog.Learning how to scale isn't easy without any prior experience. Nowadays
you have plenty of websites likehighscalability.comto get some inspiration,
but unfortunately there is no solution that fits all websites and needs. You
still have to think on your own to find a concept that works for your
requirements. So did I.A few years ago, my bosses came to me and said "We've
got a new project for you. It's the relaunch of a website that has already 1
million users a month. You have to build the website and make sure we'll be
able to grow afterwards". I was already an experienced coder, but not in these
dimensions, so I had to start learning how to scale - the hard way.The
software behind the website was a PHP content management system, based on
Smarty and MySQL. The first task was finding a proper hosting company who had
the experience and would also manage the servers for us. After some research
we found one, told t</p><p>5 0.82297707 <a title="150-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-03-5_Rockin%27_Tips_for_Scaling_PHP_to_30%2C000_Concurrent_Users_Per_Server.html">1486 high scalability-2013-07-03-5 Rockin' Tips for Scaling PHP to 30,000 Concurrent Users Per Server</a></p>

that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: Use PHP's APC feature.
APC is opcode cache that is "really a requirement in order for a website to
have a chance at performing well."Put everything that's not a .php request on
a CDN. Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on
S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused
them to serve directly from S3.Don't make connections to other servers in your
PHP code. Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down
processing. Use the APC key/value store for data storage and Varnish for

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

<p>Introduction: Update: Benjamin Black said he was the source of the quote and also said I was
wrong about what he meant. His real point:The meaning of the statement was
that NoSQL systems (really the various map-reduce systems) are lacking a
standard model for describing and querying and that developing one should be a
high priority task for them.At the A NoSQL Evening in Palo Alto, an audience
member, sorry, I couldn't tell who, said something I found really
interesting:NoSQL took away the relational model and gave nothing back.The
idea being that NoSQL has focussed on ease of use, scalability, performance,
etc, but it has lost the idea of how data relates to other data. True to its
name, the relational model is very good at capturing a managing relationships.
With NoSQL all relationships have been pushed back onto the poor programmer to
implement in code rather than the database managing it. We've sacrificed
usability. NoSQL is about concurrency, latency, and scalability, but it's not
about data.My</p><p>3 0.98043644 <a title="150-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-10-Saying_Yes_to_NoSQL%3B_Going_Steady_with_Cassandra_at_Digg.html">793 high scalability-2010-03-10-Saying Yes to NoSQL; Going Steady with Cassandra at Digg</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The last six months have been exciting for Digg's engineering team. We're
working on a soup-to-nuts rewrite. Not only are we rewriting all our
application code, but we're also rolling out a new client and server
architecture. And if that doesn't sound like a big enough challenge, we're
replacing most of our infrastructure components and moving away from
LAMP.Perhaps our most significant infrastructure change is abandoning MySQL in
favor of a NoSQL alternative. To someone like me who's been building systems
almost exclusively on relational databases for almost 20 years, this feels
like a bold move.What's Wrong with MySQL?Our primary motivation for moving
away from MySQL is the increasing difficulty of building a high performance,
write intensive, application on a data set that is growing quickly, with no
end in sight. This growth has forced us into horizontal and vertical
partitioning strategies that have eliminated most of the value of a relational
database, while still incurring all t</p><p>4 0.97630507 <a title="150-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-05-Easier_Production_Releases_.html">173 high scalability-2007-12-05-Easier Production Releases </a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been a part of some late night release procedures and they’re never fun.
You’ve got QA, Dev, IT and a handful of managers sitting in their jammies in a
group IM (or worse, a conference call) from 2:00 AM until way too early in the
morning. Everyone’s grumpy and sleepy, causing the release to be more
difficult and take longer. Sometimes the dreaded “rollback!” is yelled. All
this because you’re running a high profile website that needs to be accessible
24/7, and 2:00 AM - 5:00 AM downtime is better than daytime downtime.If you're
a site that doesn't have 10s of thousands to drop on a real http load
balancer, use this strategy to release software during business hours with no
downtime using apache's mod_proxy_balancer....</p><p>5 0.97494495 <a title="150-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-08-1dbase_vs._many_and_cloud_hosting_vs._dedicated_server%28s%29%3F.html">675 high scalability-2009-08-08-1dbase vs. many and cloud hosting vs. dedicated server(s)?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Me and my partner are making a blueprint for an online webshop service. The
purpose of this project is to make webshops available for small company's/
individuals automatically just by creating an account with us. Our webapp can
be used to add products/pages/... to the store and we'll handle secure
checkout by paypal.Our app should be scalable and manageable. Because we also
want to offer free webshops, the amount of webshops could be +10.000 within a
few years. We are building on the Zend framework and are using mysql for
database.From the start we want to build our application for optimal and easy
scalability in the future, to avoid a lot changes to our app/database in the
future.Now our questions are:Should we use?:* one database for all shops (or
limited to X shops );* one database for each new shop (each having products,
orders... tables);I think both approaches have PRO/CONS. What do you think ?
Does anyone has experience with this kind of structure ?PRO:one database:

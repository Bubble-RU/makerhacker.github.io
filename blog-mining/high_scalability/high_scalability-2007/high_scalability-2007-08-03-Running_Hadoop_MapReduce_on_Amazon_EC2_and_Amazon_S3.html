<p>Introduction: Dr. Daniel Abadi, author of theDBMS Musings blog and Cofounder ofHadapt, which
offers a product improving Hadoop performance by 50x on relational data, is
now taking his talents to graph data in Hadoop's tremendous inefficiency on
graph data management (and how to avoid it), which shares the secrets of
getting Hadoop to perform 1000x better on graph data.TL;DR:Analysing graph
data is at the heart ofimportant data mining problems.Hadoop is the tool of
choice for many of these problems.Hadoop style MapReduce works best on
KeyValue processing, not graph processing, and can be well over a factor of
1000 less efficient than it needs to be.Hadoop inefficiency has consequences
in real world. Inefficiencies on graph data problems like improving power
utilization, minimizing carbon emissions, and improving product designs, leads
to a lot value being left on the table in the form of negative environmental
consequences, increased server costs, increased data center space, and
increased energy cos</p><p>3 0.13124798 <a title="56-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-17-Product%3A_Hadoop.html">601 high scalability-2009-05-17-Product: Hadoop</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many people in the Apache Hadoop community have asked Yahoo! to publish the
version of Apache Hadoop they test and deploy across their large Hadoop
clusters. As a service to the Hadoop community, Yahoo is releasing the Yahoo!
Distribution of Hadoop -- a source code distribution that is based entirely on
code found in the Apache Hadoop project.This source distribution includes code
patches that they have added to improve the stability and performance of their
clusters. In all cases, these patches have already been contributed back to
Apache, but they may not yet be available in an Apache release of Hadoop.Read

<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's
discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon
organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable
systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the
ACM Queue article have also been included.Amazon grew from a tiny online
bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering
new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden

<p>Introduction: At Monday'sCloud Computing Meetup,Paco Nathangave an excellentGetting Started
on Hadooptalk (slides). I found one of Paco's strategies particularly
interesting: consider when a service starts charging in cost calculations.
Depending on your use case it may be cheaper to go with a more expensive
service that charges only for work accomplished rather than charging for both
work + startup time.The example is comparing the cost of running Hadoop on AWS
yourself versus using Amazon's prepackaged Hadoop service,Elastic
MapReduce(EMR). The thought may have gone through your mind as it did mine
that it doesn't necessarily make sense to use Amazon's Hadoop service. Why pay
a premium for EMR when Hadoop will run directly on AWS?One reason is that
Amazon has made significant changes to Hadoop to make it run more efficiently
and easily on AWS. The other more surprising reason is cost.When starting a
500 node Hadoop cluster, for example, you have to wait for all the nodes to
start and join the clus</p><p>3 0.6481548 <a title="56-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-15-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_15%2C_2012.html">1265 high scalability-2012-06-15-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 15, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop
cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-
System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job
on your Hadoop cluster. You willnotneed to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks
are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local
machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other
platforms running bash and Java.Fire-Up Your Hadoop ClusterI choose
theCloudera distribution of Hadoopwhich is still 100% Apache licensed, but has
some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released byDoug
Cutting, who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also
startedLucene, which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have
good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see,
is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.I am going to use

<p>Introduction: Excellent article on using Hadoop in Amazon's services environment to solve
real problems for very little money. It's excellent because it shows how the
stack works together and it actually seems like something a real human could
do.</p><p>2 1.0 <a title="56-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark_for_keeping_data_in_browser_in_AJAX_projects.html">565 high scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark for keeping data in browser in AJAX projects</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>4 0.99886572 <a title="56-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-25-Google%3A_Introduction_to_Distributed_System_Design.html">223 high scalability-2008-01-25-Google: Introduction to Distributed System Design</a></p>

lectures: Introduction, MapReduce, Distributed File Systems, Clustering
Algorithms, and Graph Algorithms.Advanced website design depends on deep
distributed system design knowledge. Where do you get this knowledge? Try
Google. They have a a wholeCode for Educatorsprogram with tutorials and

<p>Introduction: Isn't the secret to fast, scalable websites tocache everything? Caching, if
not thesecret sauceof many a website, is it at least a popular condiment. But
not so fast says Peter Zaitsev inBeyond great cache hit ratio. The point Peter
makes is that we read about websites likeAmazonandFacebook that can literally
make hundreds of calls to satisfy a user request. Even if you have an awesome
cache hit ratio, pages can still be slow because making and processing all
those requests takes time. The solution is toremove requests all together. You
do this bycaching larger blocksso you have to make fewer requests. The post
has a lot of good advice worth reading: 1) Make non cacheable blocks as small
as possible, 2) Maximize amount of uses of the cache item, 3) Control
invalidation, 4) Multi-Get.</p><p>6 0.99529332 <a title="56-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:A very nice JavaWorld podcast interview withGoogle engineer Max Ross on
Hibernate Shards. Max defines Hibernate Shards (horizontal partitioning), how
it works (pretty well), virtual shards (don't ask), what they need to do in
the future (query, replication, operational tools), and how it relates to
Google AppEngine (not much).To scale you are supposed to partition your data.
Sounds good, but how do you do it? When you actually sit down to work out all
the details it's not that easy. Hibernate Shards to the rescue! Hibernate
shards is: an extension to the core Hibernate product that adds facilities for
horizontal partitioning. If you know the core Hibernate API you know the
shards API. No learning curve at all. Here is what a few members of the core
group had to say about the Hibernate Shards open source project. Although
there are some limitations, from the sound of it they are doing useful stuff
in the right way and it's very much worth looking at, especially if you use

<p>Introduction: Let me begin by saying that I have used and continue to use various ORM
frameworks such as hibernate, ibatis, propel and activerecord in applications
and websites that have a user base ranging from a couple hundred to 500k
users. Especially for projects that have to be up and running in a short
duration of time, ORM frameworks significantly reduce the effort required to
manipulate and persist OOP objects by providing time saving facilities such as
automatically generated model objects, integrated unit testing, secure
variable substitution, etc. Hibernate even supports horizontal data
partitioning via Hibernate Shards.However, the lay of the land is
significantly different in the rarefied space occupied by applications needing
to support millions of users. Profiling an application at this level and
paying particular attention to the operations needed to move data to and from
the database, it becomes evident that a significant portion of the operations
are API related, whereby the ORM fr</p><p>5 0.16381845 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles_with_Sharding_-_What_can_we_learn_from_the_Foursquare_Incident%3F.html">920 high scalability-2010-10-15-Troubles with Sharding - What can we learn from the Foursquare Incident?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: I've been interested in sharding concepts since first hearing the term "shard"
a few years back. My interest had been piqued earlier, the first time I read
about Google's original approach to distributed search. It was described as a
hashtable-like system in which independent physical machines play the role of
the buckets. More recently, I needed the capacity and performance of a Sharded
system, but did not find helpful libraries or toolkits which would assist with
the configuration for my language of preference these days, which is Python.
And, since I had a few weeks on my hands, I decided I would begin the work of
creating these tools.The result of my initial work the Pyshards project, a
still-incomplete python and MySQL based horizontal partitioning and sharding
toolkit. HighScalability.com readers will already know that horizontal
partitioning is a data segmenting pattern in which distinct groups of physical
row-based datasets are distributed across multiple partitions. When the

<p>Introduction: In a recent project, I utilized RoR's cookie-based session storage to shard
geographically distinct user groups. My technique for doing so was unique and,
although it was a premature optimization, it is none-the-less an idea worth
exploring.</p><p>5 0.64421445 <a title="24-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-28-How_to_Organize_a_Database_Table%E2%80%99s_Keys_for_Scalability.html">476 high scalability-2008-12-28-How to Organize a Database Table’s Keys for Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data
is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large
singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you
have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each
individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all
shards.There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys
across a shard cluster. Each has its pro’s and con’s and the one chosen should
be specific to the problems you’re trying to solve.</p><p>6 0.57253253 <a title="24-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-20-Alternate_strategy_for_database_sharding.html">546 high scalability-2009-03-20-Alternate strategy for database sharding</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Find out with Builtwith.com. It scans a site and guesses how the site is
built. I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows, PHP, Adsense, RSS,
CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have
guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which
AJAX library is used. Though it's kind of cool to see which sites use PHP and
other technologies.</p><p>2 0.79005468 <a title="24-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-15-Wolfram%7CAlpha_Architecture.html">600 high scalability-2009-05-15-Wolfram|Alpha Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and
there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of
the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet
tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are
Oprah...Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart
Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast"
where traffic peaked at 242Gbps. A variable bitrate scheme was used so
depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as
750Kbps.Dan Rayburn thinksThe big take away from this webcast is that it shows
proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those
who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions
and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.breakTo handle
more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P
streaming, or us</p><p>same-blog 4 0.72913766 <a title="24-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Product%3A__Hibernate_Shards.html">24 high scalability-2007-07-24-Product:  Hibernate Shards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from
scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.Hibernate Shards
is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by
adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.Hibernate
Shardskey features:Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards
allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love:
SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use
Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards.Flexible sharding
strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of
the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific
logic.Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going
to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one
of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your

<p>Introduction: Update 6:CARS = Cost Aware Runtimes and Services by William Louth.Update
5:Damn You Google, Damn You Yahoo! Why D'Ya Do This to Us? Free accounts on a
cloud platform are a constant drain of money.Update 4:Caching becomes even
more important inCPU based billing environments. Avoiding the CPU means saving
money.Update 3:An interesting simple example of this idea showed up on the
Google AppEngine list. With one paging algorithm and one use of AJAX the
yearly cost of the site was $1000. By changing those algorithms the site went
under quota and became free again. This will make life a lot more interesting
for developers.Update 2:Business Model Influencing Software Architectureby

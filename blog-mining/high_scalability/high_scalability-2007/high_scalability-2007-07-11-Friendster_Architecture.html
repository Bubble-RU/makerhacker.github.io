<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important.  Jim Scheinman,  former Bebo and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to scale as why they lost the social networking race:   VB  : Can you tell me a bit about what you learned in your time at Friendster? 
 
     JS  :  For me, it basically came down to failed execution on the technology side — we had millions of Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling us that if we didn’t get our site working better soon, they’d be ‘forced to join’ a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpace…the rest is history. To be fair to Friendster’s technology team at the time, they were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites simply hadn’t had to deal with prior to Friendster.

<p>Introduction: The fascination over Instagram continues and fortunately we have several new streams of information to feed the insanity. So consider this article an update to   The Instagram Architecture Facebook Bought For A Cool Billion Dollars   , based primarily on    Scaling Instagram   , a slide deck for an AirBnB tech talk given by Instagram co-founder, Mike Krieger. Several other information sources, listed at the bottom of the article, were also used.    Unfortunately we just have a slide deck, so the connective tissue of the talk is missing, but it’s still very interesting, in the same spirit of wisdom presentations we often see after developers come up for air after spending significant time spent in the trenches.     If you expect to dive deep into the technological details and find a billion reasons why Instagram was acquired, you will be disappointed. That magic can be found in the emotional investment in the relationship between all of the users and the product, not in the bits about h</p><p>4 0.65204036 <a title="6-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-24-Building_a_Scalable_Architecture_for_Web_Apps.html">392 high scalability-2008-09-24-Building a Scalable Architecture for Web Apps</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By Bhavin Turakhia CEO, Directi. Covers:   * Why scalability is important. Viral marketing can result in instant success. With RSS/Ajax/SOA number of requests grow exponentially with user base. Goal is to build a web 2.0 app that can server millions of users with zero downtime.   * Introduction to the variables. Scalability, performance, responsiveness, availability, downtime impact, cost, maintenance effort.   * Introduction to the factors. Platform selection, hardware, application design, database architecture, deployment architecture, storage architecture, abuse prevention, monitoring mechanisms, etc.   * Building our own scalable architecture in incremental steps: vertical scaling, vertical partitioning, horizontal scaling, horizontal partitioning, etc. First buy bigger. Then deploy each service on a separate node. Then increase the number of nudes and load balance. Deal with session management. Remove single points of failure. Use a shared nothing cluster.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Jamie Hall, Co-founder & CTO of  MocoSpace , describing the architecture for their mobile social network. This is a timely architecture to learn from as it combines several hot trends: it is very large, mobile, and social. What they think is especially cool about their system is: how it optimizes for device/browser fragmentation on the mobile Web; their multi-tiered,  read/write, local/distributed caching system; selecting PostgreSQL over MySQL as a relational DB that can scale.
 
MocoSpace is a mobile social network, with 12 million members and 3 billion page views a month, which makes it one of the most highly trafficked mobile Websites in the US. Members access the site mainly from their mobile phone Web browser, ranging from high end smartphones to lower end devices, as well as the Web. Activities on the site include customizing profiles, chat, instant messaging, music, sharing photos & videos, games, eCards and blogs. The monetization strategy is focused on</p><p>6 0.62623012 <a title="6-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr_Architecture.html">152 high scalability-2007-11-13-Flickr Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,      I saw an year ago that Netapp sold netcache to blu-coat, my site is a heavy NetCache user and we cached 83% of our site. We tested with Blue-coat and F5 WA and we are not getting same performce as NetCache.      Any of you guys have the same issue? or somebody knows another product can handle much traffic?     Thanks   Rodrigo</p><p>2 0.9006058 <a title="6-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce_With_Ruby_Using_Hadoop.html">968 high scalability-2011-01-04-Map-Reduce With Ruby Using Hadoop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A demonstration, with repeatable steps, of how to quickly fire-up a Hadoop cluster on Amazon EC2, load data onto the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File-System), write map-reduce scripts in Ruby and use them to run a map-reduce job on your Hadoop cluster. You will  not  need to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other platforms running bash and Java.
  

  

 Fire-Up Your Hadoop Cluster 

I choose the  Cloudera distribution of Hadoop  which is still 100% Apache licensed, but has some additional benefits. One of these benefits is that it is released by  Doug Cutting , who started Hadoop and drove it’s development at Yahoo! He also started  Lucene , which is another of my favourite Apache Projects, so I have good faith that he knows what he is doing. Another benefit, as you will see, is that it is simple to fire-up a Hadoop cluster.

<p>Introduction: Companies earnings outstrip  forecasts , consumer confidence is retuning and city bonuses are  back . What does this mean for business? Growth! After the recent years of cost cutting in IT budgets, there is the sudden fear induced from increased demand. Pre-existing trouble points in IT infrastructures that have lain dormant will suddenly be exposed. Monthly reporting and real time analytics will suffer as data grows. IT departments across the land will be crying out “The engine canna take no more captain”. What can be done?

  
     What we need is a scalable system that grows with the business. A system that can handle sudden increases in data growth without falling over. There are two core principles to a scalable system (1) Users experience constant QoS as demand grows (2) System Architects can grow system capacity proportionally with the available resources. In other words, if demand increases twofold, it is “enough” to purchase twice the hardware.
 
This is linear growth. Is it e</p><p>4 0.89655674 <a title="6-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-17-Five_Misconceptions_on_Cloud_Portability.html">1144 high scalability-2011-11-17-Five Misconceptions on Cloud Portability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for "Cloud  API  portability," which implies a series of misconceptions.
 
If we break away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without settling on a common Cloud  API. 
 
In this post i'll be covering five common misconceptions people have  WRT  to cloud portability.
  
  Cloud portability = Cloud API portability . API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.  
  The main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in .Cloud portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-in.  
  Cloud portability isnâ&euro;&trade;t for startups . Every startup that is expecting rapid growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared to do so.</p><p>5 0.89244252 <a title="6-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-07-10_Core_Architecture_Pattern_Variations_for_Achieving_Scalability.html">1138 high scalability-2011-11-07-10 Core Architecture Pattern Variations for Achieving Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Srinath Perera has put together a  strong list of architecture patterns  based on three meta patterns:  distribution, caching, and asynchronous processing. He contends these three are the primal patterns and the following patterns are but different combinations:
  
  LB (Load Balancers) + Shared nothing Units . Units that do not share anything with each other fronted with a load balancer that routes incoming messages to a unit based on some criteria. 
  LB + Stateless Nodes + Scalable Storage . Several stateless nodes talking to a scalable storage, and a load balancer distributes load among the nodes. 
  Peer to Peer Architectures (Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Content Addressable Networks (CAN)) . Algorithm for scaling up logarithmically. 
  Distributed Queues . Queue implementation (FIFO delivery) implemented as a network service. 
  Publish/Subscribe Paradigm . Network publish subscribe brokers that route messages to each other.

<p>Introduction: If you code in PHP have you ever wondered about moving to Facebook's  HipHop JIT Virtual Machine for PHP ? With HipHop Facebook achieved over a 9x increase in web request throughput and over a 5x reduction in memory consumption compared to Zend PHP 5.2 engine + APC.
 
But will HipHop really work for you? Is it really drop-in compatible? Is it really as fast as they say?
 
To answer questions like this nothing beats a good experience report and here's a great one:  Adventures in Configuring and Running Facebook's HipHopVM (hhvm) JIT Compiler for PHP  by Yermo Lamers.
 
Yermo selected PHP to implement a number of content web sites. He took an interesting approach, he created a forms, views, validation, and business logic description language to remove the drudgery of creating the same code over and over again for each page. Having done this in Perl I think it's a great a approach. The problem is it can be slow.

<p>Introduction: This is what  Mike Peters says he can do : make your site run 10 times faster. His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40 IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50 concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively handling 500 concurrent connections per second with CPU at 8% and no degradation in performance."  Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:
   Database write access (read is cheaper)    Database read access    PHP, ASP, JSP and any other server side scripting    Client side JavaScript    Multiple/Fat Images, scripts or css files from different domains on your page    Slow keep-alive client connections, clogging your available sockets   Mike's solutions:      Switch all database writes to offline processing    Minimize number of database read access to the bare minimum. No more than two queries per page.

<p>Introduction: ThemBid provides a market where people needing work done broadcast their request and accept bids from people competing for the job. Unlike many of the sites profiled at HighScalability, ThemBid is not in the popular press as often as Paris Hilton. It's not a media darling or a giant of the industry. But what I like is they have a strategy, a point-of-view for building websites and were gracious enough to share very detailed instructions on how to go about building a website. They even delve into actual installation details of the various software packages they use.  Anyone can benefit by taking a look at their work.

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block , CTO at  RockThePost.com , a crowdfunding company, has  written a nice set of tips  for smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a small two person development team. 
 
Their service has a typical small scale structure:
  
 PHP's Zend Framework 2 
 Two m1.medium for web servers 
 ELB to split the load 
 master/slave MySQL database 
 Siege for load testing 
  
The very sensible tips that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: 
  
  Use PHP's APC feature . APC is opcode cache that is " really a requirement in order for a website to have a chance at performing well."  
  Put everything that's not a .php request on a CDN . Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused them to serve directly from S3. 
  Don't make connections to other servers in your PHP code . Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down processing. Use the APC k</p><p>6 0.58188492 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-16-What_tech_is_used_to_build_your_favorite_site%3F.html">66 high scalability-2007-08-16-What tech is used to build your favorite site?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: eAccelerator  is a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution. eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.</p><p>2 0.63687909 <a title="32-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-19-What_can_the_Amazing_Race_to_the_South_Pole_Teach_us_About_Startups%3F.html">1503 high scalability-2013-08-19-What can the Amazing Race to the South Pole Teach us About Startups?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled through  Race to the End of the Earth , a fantastic exhibit at the  Royal BC Museum  on the 1911-1912  race to the South Pole  between Norwegian explorer  Roald Amundsen  and British naval officer  Robert Scott , I couldn’t help but think of the two radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.
  I wish I could reproduce the experience of  walking through the exhibit . Plaque after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott’s choices and then nod in agreement with Amundsen’s approach. The core conflict was straight out of any ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet. And Waterfall lost.

<p>Introduction: I'm moving this from the forum section to the front page. Just FYI, any registered user can Submit a Link to this blog. You don't have to use the forums.       In The Architectures You've Always Wondered About track at the Qcon conference, Second Life, eBay, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Orbitz presented how they dealt with different aspects of their applications, such as scalability. There were quite a few lessons that I learned that day that I thought were worth sharing.</p><p>4 0.47483975 <a title="32-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-11-FTP_Sanity%3A_Redundancy%2C_archiving%2C_consolidation..html">208 high scalability-2008-01-11-FTP Sanity: Redundancy, archiving, consolidation.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Easy FTP redundancy and consolidation with the Open Source project Generic-FTP. Works with probably any Linux FTP Server (ProFTPD only one tested). Get rid of some single points of failure. A very easy to set up solution using scripts written in PHP.

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.    We're basically using a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget). Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.    I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>6 0.46919933 <a title="32-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>

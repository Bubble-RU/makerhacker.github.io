<p>Introduction: Hi,I am an owner of an large community website and currently we are having
problems with our database architecture. We are using 2 database servers and
spread tables across them to divide read/writes. We have about 90% reads and

traffic is load balanced between webservers. We have 2 extra servers ready to
put to use!We have looked into a couple of solution so far:Continuent
Uni/Cluster aka Sequoia -> Commercial version way too expensive and Java isn't
as fast as it suppose to be.MySQL Proxy -> We couldn't find any good example
on how to create a master - master with failover scenario.MySQL Clustering ->
Seems to be not mature enough, had a lot of performance issues when we tried
to go online with it.MySQL DRDB HA -> Only good for failover, cannot be

<p>Introduction: Matt, from the ever excellentMySQL Performance Blog, decided to run a test
using a simple scenario drawn from his client experience in the gaming space.
The scenario: read a row based on a primary key, update the row, write it to
disk, and use the row to lookup another row. Matt ran three different tests
explained in a series of three different articles:MySQL and MySQL + Memcached,
Memcached Only, andTokyo Tyrant.The lovingly compiled details along with many
cool graphs are in the articles, but in general the lessons learned are:When
memcached hasenough memory(so records being accessed are in RAM), memcached +
MySQL can provide a10x performance boostover MySQL alone. When the RAM is too
small and hot records, those being accessed a lot, aren't in RAM, or perhaps
applications are doing a sequential scan of a table and the entire table isn't
cached, then memcached won't be the big bang improvement you may be hoping
for.When the database is removed and memcached serves both reads and writ</p><p>3 0.6750747 <a title="86-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-10-Mysql_scalability_and_failover....html">302 high scalability-2008-04-10-Mysql scalability and failover...</a></p>

(http://royal.pingdom.com/royalfiles/0702_infrastructure_matrix.pdf) and I saw
that no sites are using Postgresql, and then I searched through
highscalability.com and saw very few mentions of postgresql. Are there any

<p>Introduction: I've recently started working with a large company who is looking to take one
of their heavily utilized applications and move it to Amazon Web Services. I'm
not looking to start a debate on the merits of EC2, the decision to move to
aws is already made (and is a much better decision than paying a vendor
millions to host it).I've done my reasearch and I'm comfortable with creating
this environment with one exception, scaling MySQL. I havent done much work
with MySQL, i'm more of an Oracle guy up to now. I'm struggling to determine a
way to scale MySQL on the fly in a way so that replication works, the server
takes its proper place in line for master candidacy, and the apache servers
become aware of it.So this is really three questions:1. What are some proven
methods of load balancing the read traffic going from apache to MySQL.2. How
do I let the load balancing mechanism know when I scale up / down a new Mysql
Server?3. How to alert the master of the new server and initiate replication</p><p>6 0.63074517 <a title="86-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Blog%3A_MySQL_Performance_Blog_-_Everything_about_MySQL_Performance._.html">15 high scalability-2007-07-16-Blog: MySQL Performance Blog - Everything about MySQL Performance. </a></p>

Some of the features it offers are:Document-orientedScalable, decentralized

Python, HTTP open source and NoSQLPluggable backendsEventing

traversed.Map/Reduce. Functions are executed on the data node. One interesting
difference is that a list keys are required to specify which values are

<p>Introduction: Jesper Soderlund not only put together a few interesting scalability patterns,
he also came up with a few interesting scalability lessons:Lesson #1. Put
Smarty compile and template caches on an active-active DRBD cluster with high
load and your servers will DIE!Lesson #2. Don't use out-of-the-box
configurations.Lesson #3. Single points of contention will eventually become a
bottleneck.Lesson #4. Plan in advance. Lesson #5. Offload your databases as
much as possible.Lesson #6. File systems matter and can run out of space /
inodes.For more details and explanations see the original post.</p><p>3 0.90264803 <a title="86-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-12-If_Your_System_was_a_Symphony_it_Might_Sound_Like_This....html">1422 high scalability-2013-03-12-If Your System was a Symphony it Might Sound Like This...</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I am in no way a music expert, but when I listen toSymphony No. 4byCharles
Ives, I imagine it's what a complex software/hardware system might sound like
if we could hear its inner workings. Ives uses a lot of riotously competing
rhythms in this work. It can sound discordant, yet the effect is deeply
layered and eventually harmonious, just like the systems we use, create, and
become part of.I was pointed to this piece by someone who said there were two
conductors. I'd never heard of such a thing! So I was intrigued. The first
version of the performance sounds and looks great, but it unfortunately does
not use two conductors. The second version uses two conductors, but is
unfortunately just a snippet.It's strikingly odd to see two conductors, but I
imagine different parts of our systems using different conductors too, running
at different rhythms, sometimes slow, sometimes fast, sometimes there are
outbursts, sometimes in vicious conflict. Yet conceptually it all stills seems
to hang tog</p><p>same-blog 4 0.89561826 <a title="86-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-09-Clustering_Solution.html">86 high scalability-2007-09-09-Clustering Solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I'minterested in peoples thoughts on the best choice for a database
clustering solution.I have a database that is mostly varchars and numbers that
doesn't store any binary data at all. It's used at about 70% read and 30%
writes - though we're using memcached at the moment so it's not really hit
that hard.We're currently using mysql with m/cluster, but are interested in a
new solution. Possible candidate so far are unicluster (which doesn't seem
mature yet.) or DRBD.Had anyone had a similar experience and can make any
suggestions?Thanks</p><p>5 0.83675659 <a title="86-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-19-Alternatives_to_Google_App_Engine.html">423 high scalability-2008-10-19-Alternatives to Google App Engine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One particularly interesting EC2 third party provider is GigaSpaces with their
XAP platform that provides in memory transactions backed up to a database. The
in memory transactions appear to scale linearly across machines thus providing
a distributed in-memory datastore that gets backed up to persistent storage.</p><p>6 0.83331656 <a title="86-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-30-NoCAP_%E2%80%93_Part_III_%E2%80%93_GigaSpaces_clustering_explained...html">950 high scalability-2010-11-30-NoCAP – Part III – GigaSpaces clustering explained..</a></p>

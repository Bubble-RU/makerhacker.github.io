<p>Introduction: Facebook made quite a splash when they released theirnative iOS app, not
because of their app per se, but because of their conclusion that theirbiggest
mistake was betting on HTML5, so they had to go native.As you might imagine
this was a bit like telling a Great White Shark that its bark is worse than
its bite.  Acommon refrainwas Facebook simply had made a bad HTML5 site, not
that HTML5 itself is bad, as plenty of other vendors have made slick well
performing mobile sites.An interesting and relevant conversation given the
rising butt kickery of mobile. But we were lacking details. Now we aren't. If
you were wondering just why Facebook ditched HTML5, Tobie Langel inPerf
Feedback - What's slowing down Mobile Facebook, lists out the reasons:Tooling
/ Developer APIs. Most importantly, the lack of tooling to track down memory
problems. Scrolling performance.Scrolling must be fast and smooth and full
featured. It's not.GPU.A clunky API and black box approach make it an
unreliable accelerat</p><p>3 0.056028701 <a title="93-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-20-Dependency_Injection_and_AOP_frameworks_for_.NET_.html">685 high scalability-2009-08-20-Dependency Injection and AOP frameworks for .NET </a></p>
<p>Introduction: We're looking to implement a framework to do Dependency Injection and AOP for
a new solution we're working on. It will likely get hit pretty hard, so we'd
like to chose a framework that's proven to scale well, and operates well under
pressure.Right now, we're looking closely at Spring.NET, Castle Project's
Windsor framework, and Unity. Does anyone have any feedback on implementing
any of these in large, high traffic environments?</p><p>4 0.051523905 <a title="93-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-25-Google%3A_Introduction_to_Distributed_System_Design.html">223 high scalability-2008-01-25-Google: Introduction to Distributed System Design</a></p>

Justin.tv about their architecture, which is pretty exciting given their
leadership role in live broadcasting. They get 30 million uniques a month, can
handle 1 million simultaneous broadcasts and hope to grow another magnitude in
the near future. That must take some doing.Here's your opportunity, especially
if you think my questions suck, to ask your own sucky questions :-) What would

<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers Show 41 episode was to reveal and
ruminate over the horrors of a successfulattack on RSA, which puts the whole
world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there
was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost
datacenter.Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile
back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by
summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal: Look at
Arista and Juniper. JuniperHas a range of stackable switches, which includes
some 10 gig.If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on
their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric
solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric.
Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.
Thinks Juniper would make a good deal in order to get a few reference sites
for QFX.Arista Networks</p><p>3 0.38927898 <a title="93-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-05-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Memcached_and_Relations.html">1399 high scalability-2013-02-05-Ask HighScalability: Memcached and Relations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi everybodyI'm wondering what you would do: I develop a webapp using Grails,
Memcached and Mysql as persistence. Now, I have following domain classes
(simplified):Product: Can be in one categoryCategory: Can have nested
children, and have multiple products.I need to access all product objects by
id which led me to the idea to store all products in one big Memcached-entry
with a key: PRODUCTMAP and as value, all product attributes as array, like:
[productId1: [title: 'title'], productId2: [title: 'title']]If I browse to
category 4, I simply get my map categoryMap with value [cateoryId:
[productId1, productId2]]I also can list all products of a certain category by
providing that id. The bad thing about this is that I always have to put back
everything if I modify a single product.Who can give advice how to realize
that?Any help will be appreciated!

may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our
manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so
I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?Applicant: I
drive a 2008 Subaru.Agency: That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent
you.Applicant: That's OK. Any car will do.Agency: No, we can only take on
clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way.
There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take
a chance.Applicant: I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been

<p>Introduction: In my lastpost, I outlined considerations that need to be taken into account
when choosing between a centralized and federated security model. So, how do
we implement the chosen model?Based on a real-world case study, I will outline
a Kerberos architecture that enables cutting-edge collaborative research

<p>Introduction: SmugMug's CEO & Chief Geek Don MacAskill smugly (hard to resist) gushes over
finally finding, after a long and arduous quest, their "best bang-for-the-buck
storage array." It's theDell MD300. His in-depth explanation of why he prefers
the MD3000 should help anyone with their own painful storage deliberations.
His key points are:breakThe price is right; DAS via SAS, 15 spindles at 15K
rpm each, 512MB of mirrored battery-backed write cache; You can disable read
caching; You can disable read-ahead prefetching; The stripe sizes are
configurable up to 512KB; The controller ignores host-based flush commands by
default; They support an ‘Enhanced JBOD’ mode.His reasoning for the
desirability each option is astute and he even gives you the configuration
options for carrying out the configuration. This is not your average CEO.Don
also speculates that a three tier system using flash (system RAM + flash
storage + RAID disks) is a possible future direction. Unfortunately, flash may
not be the dream</p><p>5 0.34735823 <a title="93-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-10-Paper%3A_Consensus_Protocols%3A_Paxos___.html">529 high scalability-2009-03-10-Paper: Consensus Protocols: Paxos   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Barbara Liskov's Turing Award, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance.Henry
Robinson has created an excellent series of articles on consensus protocols.
We already covered his2 Phase Commitarticle and he also has a3 Phase
Commitarticle showing how to handle 2PC under single node failures.But that is
not enough! 3PC works well under node failures, but fails for network
failures. So another consensus mechanism is needed that handles both network
and node failures. And that'sPaxos.Paxos correctly handles both types of
failures, but it does this by becoming inaccessible if too many components
fail. This is the "liveness" property of protocols. Paxos waits until the
faults are fixed. Read queries can be handled, but updates will be blocked
until the protocol thinks it can make forward progress.The liveness of Paxos
is primarily dependent on network stability. In a distributed heterogeneous
environment you are at risk of losing the ability to make updates. Users hate
that.breakSo when compani</p><p>6 0.29014596 <a title="93-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-07-clusteradmin.blogspot.com_-_blog_about_building_and_administering_clusters.html">243 high scalability-2008-02-07-clusteradmin.blogspot.com - blog about building and administering clusters</a></p>

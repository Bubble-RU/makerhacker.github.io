<p>Introduction: All APIs are different.

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100 using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that would otherwise take an eternity to make,  a pile of money to create, and an unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of services. The battle for the future is on.

<p>Introduction: All APIs are different. At its core, an API provides direct access deep into a web service (lower case - a service that is provided on the web) and turns it into a Web Service (upper case) that people can use as a building block. What makes it an API is the infrastructure that sits in front of it, attracts developers to use it, secures it from misuse and provides the metrics and management needed to turn an internal web service into a Web Service managed through an effective distribution channel, and providing strategic and/or financial benefit.  While each API is different, the infrastructure I have described is consistent across virtually all of them, so it is neither economical nor effective to reinvent the wheel for each API someone wants to release. It is similar to the concept of an adserver - all websites have different content and fucntionality, but the concept of selecting and serving an ad, tracking it, and targeting it is pretty consistent across sites; as a result, there ar</p><p>2 0.69740272 <a title="55-lsi-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon_Architecture.html">96 high scalability-2007-09-18-Amazon Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a wonderfully informative Amazon update based on Joachim Rohde's discovery of an interview with Amazon's CTO. You'll learn about how Amazon organizes their teams around services, the CAP theorem of building scalable systems, how they deploy software, and a lot more. Many new additions from the ACM Queue article have also been included.   Amazon grew from a tiny online bookstore to one of the largest stores on earth. They did it while pioneering new and interesting ways to rate, review, and recommend products. Greg Linden shared is version of Amazon's birth pangs in a series of blog articles

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100 using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that would otherwise take an eternity to make,  a pile of money to create, and an unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of services. The battle for the future is on.

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive</p><p>5 0.64694339 <a title="55-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-17-Some_Services_are_More_Equal_than_Others.html">944 high scalability-2010-11-17-Some Services are More Equal than Others</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Remember  when the iPhone launched? Remember the complaints about the device not  maintaining calls well? Was it really the hardware? Or was it the  service provider network, overwhelmed by not just the call volume but  millions of hyper-customers experimenting with their new toy? Look – a  video! Look a video  and a call.  Hey, I’m on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and streaming audio at the same time I’m making a call! How awesome is that?
 
Meanwhile,  there’s an entire army of operators at a service provider’s NOC who are  stalking through the data center with scissors because it’s the only  way to stop the madness.
 
Service providers, probably better  than any other, understand “services”. For longer than the enterprise  has been talking about them, service providers have been implementing  them. They’ve got their own set of standards and reference architectures  and even language to describe them, but in a nutshell that’s what a  service provider does: offers services.

<p>Introduction: All APIs are different. At its core, an API provides direct access deep into a web service (lower case - a service that is provided on the web) and turns it into a Web Service (upper case) that people can use as a building block. What makes it an API is the infrastructure that sits in front of it, attracts developers to use it, secures it from misuse and provides the metrics and management needed to turn an internal web service into a Web Service managed through an effective distribution channel, and providing strategic and/or financial benefit.  While each API is different, the infrastructure I have described is consistent across virtually all of them, so it is neither economical nor effective to reinvent the wheel for each API someone wants to release. It is similar to the concept of an adserver - all websites have different content and fucntionality, but the concept of selecting and serving an ad, tracking it, and targeting it is pretty consistent across sites; as a result, there ar</p><p>2 0.84299725 <a title="55-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-23-Paper%3A_Don%E2%80%99t_Settle_for_Eventual%3A_Scalable_Causal_Consistency_for_Wide-Area_Storage_with_COPS.html">1146 high scalability-2011-11-23-Paper: Don’t Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-Area Storage with COPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Teams from  Princeton  and CMU are  working together  to solve one of the most difficult problems in the repertoire: scalable geo-distributed data stores. Major companies like Google and Facebook have been working on multiple datacenter database functionality for some time, but there's still a general lack of available systems that work for complex data scenarios.
 
The ideas in this paper-- Don’t Settle for Eventual: Scalable Causal Consistency for Wide-Area Storage with COPS --are different. It's not another eventually consistent system, or a traditional transaction oriented system, or a replication based system, or a system that punts on the issue. It's something new, a causally consistent system that achieves  ALPS  system properties. Move over CAP, NoSQL, etc, we have another acronym: ALPS - Available (operations always complete successfully), Low-latency (operations complete quickly (single digit milliseconds)), Partition-tolerant (operates with a partition), and Scalable (just a</p><p>3 0.81992882 <a title="55-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-09-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_9%2C_2012.html">1206 high scalability-2012-03-09-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 9, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the great  MapReduce Versus Database War , you would be correct.   Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each machine approach,  to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability potential.
 
Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each individual machine.

<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers  Show 41  episode was to reveal and ruminate over the horrors of a successful  attack on RSA , which puts the whole world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost datacenter.
 
Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal:
 
 
  
 Look at Arista and Juniper.  
 Juniper           
 
 Has a range of stackable switches, which includes some 10 gig. 
 If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric. Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.

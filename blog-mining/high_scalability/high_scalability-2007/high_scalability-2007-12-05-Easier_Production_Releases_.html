<p>Introduction: At a  Cloud Computing Meetup , Siddharth "Sid" Anand of Netflix, backed by a merry band of Netflixians, gave an interesting talk:  Keeping Movies Running Amid Thunderstorms . While the talk gave a good overview of their move to the cloud, issues with capacity planning,  thundering herds , latency problems, and  simian armageddon , I found myself most taken with how they handle  software deployment in the cloud .
 
I've worked on half a dozen or more build and deployment systems, some small, some quite large, but never for a large organization like Netflix in the cloud. The cloud has this amazing capability that has never existed before that enables a novel approach to fault-tolerant software deployments:  the ability to spin up huge numbers of instances to completely run a new release while running the old release at the same time .
 
The process goes something like:

<p>Introduction: It’s hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications stemming from this, we use AIDA.
 
 AIDA  (Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant) is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git, TeamCity and JIRA.
 
In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous integration.
 
We’ll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we’ll discuss AIDA’s major contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.
  Git flow  
The Badoo Team uses Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in JIRA and a description of the problem.

<p>Introduction: Kim Nash in an  interview with Jonathan Heiliger , Facebook VP of technical operations, provides some juicy details on how Facebook handles operations. Operations is one of those departments everyone runs differently as it is usually an  ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny  situation. With 2,000 databases, 25 terabytes of cache, 90 million active users, and 10,000 servers you know Facebook has some serious operational issues. What are some of Facebook's secrets to better operations?

A permanent operations group was created to isolate problems and revert problem software components back to previously known good states. The ability of a separate team to handle rollbacks speaks to a great deal of standardization and advanced tool building.    Distribute Team Across Time Zones .

<p>Introduction: We've long known one of the virtues of the cloud is, through the magic of services and automation, that systems can be shut or tuned down when not in use. What may be surprising is how much money can be saved. 
 
This aspect of cloudiness got a lot of pub at  AWS re:Invent  and is being rebranded under the term  Cost-Aware Architecture . An  interesting example  was given by Ryan Park, Pinterest’s technical operations lead:
  
 20% of their systems are shutdown after hours in response to traffic loads 
 Reserved instances are used for standard traffic  
 On-demand and spot instances are used to handle the elastic load throughout the day. When more servers are needed for an auto-scaled service,  spot requests are opened and on-demand instances are started at the same time. Most services are targeted to run at about 50% on-demand and 50% spot. 
 Watchdog processes continually check what's running. More instances are launched when needed and terminated when not needed. If spot prices spik</p><p>6 0.075236619 <a title="173-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Books%3A_Web_2.0_Architectures_and_Cloud_Application_Architectures.html">539 high scalability-2009-03-16-Books: Web 2.0 Architectures and Cloud Application Architectures</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A man had a dream. His dream was to blend a bunch of RSS/Atom/RDF feeds into a single feed. The man is Beau Lebens of  Feedville  and like most dreamers he was a little short on coin. So he took refuge in the home of a cheap hosting provider and Beau realized his dream, creating  FEEDblendr . But FEEDblendr chewed up so much CPU creating blended feeds that the cheap hosting provider ordered Beau to find another home. Where was Beau to go? He eventually found a new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of affordable CPU cycles.

<p>Introduction: Lukas Biewald shares a fascinating  slam by slam recount  of how his  FaceStat  (upload your picture and be judged by the masses) site was battered by a link on Yahoo's main page that caused an almost instantaneous 650,000 page view jump on their site. Yahoo spends considerable effort making sure its own properties can handle the truly massive flow from the main page. Turning the  Great Eye  of the Internet towards an unsuspecting newborn site must be quite the diaper ready experience. Theo Schlossnagle eerily prophesized about such events in  The Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture : massive, unexpected and sudden traffic spikes will become more common as a fickle internet seeks ever for new entertainments (my summary). Exactly FaceStat's situation.   This is also one of our first exposures to an application written on Merb, a popular Ruby on Rails competitor.

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.    We're basically using a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget). Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.    I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>2 0.99183834 <a title="173-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-26-Performance_-_When_do_I_start_worrying%3F.html">549 high scalability-2009-03-26-Performance - When do I start worrying?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common problem of the application designers is to predict when they need to start worrying about the Architectural/System improvements on their application. Do I need to add more resources? If yes, then how long before I am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the application that will become critical over time.</p><p>3 0.99077427 <a title="173-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-16-Just-In-Time_Scalability%3A_Agile_Methods_to_Support_Massive_Growth_%28IMVU_case_study%29.html">493 high scalability-2009-01-16-Just-In-Time Scalability: Agile Methods to Support Massive Growth (IMVU case study)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Before      We started with a small site, a mess of open source, and a small team that didn't know much about scaling.          After      We ended with a large site, a medium sized team, and an architecture that has scaled.         We never stopped. We used a roadmap and a compass, made weekly changes in direction, regularly shipped code on Wednesday to handle the next weekend's capacity constraints, and shipped new features the whole time.

<p>Introduction: In case you are interested here's the info:     INFOSCALE 2009: The 4th International ICST Conference on Scalable Information Systems. 10-12 June 2009, Hong Kong, China.     In the last few years, we have seen the proliferation of the use of heterogeneous distributed systems, ranging from simple Networks of Workstations, to highly complex grid computing environments. Such computational paradigms have been preferred due to their reduced costs and inherent scalability, which pose many challenges to scalable systems and applications in terms of information access, storage and retrieval.     Grid computing, P2P technology, data and knowledge bases, distributed information retrieval technology and networking technology should all converge to address the scalability concern. Furthermore, with the advent of emerging computing architectures - e.g. SMTs, GPUs, Multicores. - the importance of designing techniques explicitly targeting these systems is becoming more and more important.

<p>Introduction: The last six months have been exciting for Digg's engineering team. We're working on a soup-to-nuts rewrite. Not only are we rewriting all our application code, but we're also rolling out a new client and server architecture. And if that doesn't sound like a big enough challenge, we're replacing most of our infrastructure components and moving away from LAMP.
 
Perhaps our most significant infrastructure change is abandoning MySQL in favor of a NoSQL alternative. To someone like me who's been building systems almost exclusively on relational databases for almost 20 years, this feels like a bold move.
  What's Wrong with MySQL?  
Our primary motivation for moving away from MySQL is the increasing difficulty of building a high performance, write intensive, application on a data set that is growing quickly, with no end in sight. This growth has forced us into horizontal and vertical partitioning strategies that have eliminated most of the value of a relational database, while still incurr</p><p>6 0.98103094 <a title="173-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC_for_web-DB_servers.html">226 high scalability-2008-01-28-DR-BC for web-DB servers</a></p>

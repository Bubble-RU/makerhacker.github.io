<p>Introduction: Michael Stonebraker sure knows how to stir up a storm. Unlike for others, that
doesn't make him a troll in my mind, he'sway too accomplishedin the field to
be that, but he does have a bit of Barnum & Bailey in him, which serves to get
the discussion flowing, and that's a good thing. A lot of previously hidden
wisdom and passion unlocks, which we'll try to capture here.This disturbance
in the force is over OldSQL vs NoSQL vsNewSQL. Warning, these are not crisp
categories, there's leakage all over the place, watch your step:OldSQL
(Oracle, MySQL, etc) refers to what some want to term as legacy relational
database like MySQL, that don't scale out horizontally with aplomb.NoSQL
(CouchDB, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB, Riak, Neo4j, etc) refers to, well,
a collection of technologies that aren't OldSQL, these often are designed to
scale out horizontally, aren't on ACID, and use schemaless non-relational
datamodels.NewSQL  (Xeround, Clustrix, NimbusDB, GenieDB, ScaleBase, VoltDB)
are databa</p><p>5 0.12228525 <a title="134-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-13-What%27s_your_scalability_plan%3F.html">248 high scalability-2008-02-13-What's your scalability plan?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you plan to scale your system as you reach predictable milestones? This
topic came up in another venue and it reminded me about a great comment an
Anonymous wrote a while ago and I wanted to make sure that comment didn't get
lost.The Anonymous scaling plan was relatively simple and direct:My two cents
on what I'm using to start a website from scratch using a single server for
now. Later, I'll scale out horizontally when the need arises.Phase
1breakSingle Server, Dual Quad-Core 2.66, 8gb RAM, 500gb Disk Raid 10OS:
Fedora 8. You could go with pretty much any Linux though. I like Fedora 8 best
for servers.Proxy Cache: Varnish - it is way faster than Squid per my own
benchmarks. Squid chokes bigtime.Web Server: Lighttpd - faster than Apache 2
and easier to configure for me.Object Cache: Memcached. Very scalable.PHP
Cache: APC. Easy to configure and seems to work fine.Language: PHP 5 - no
bloated frameworks, waste of time for me. You spend too much time trying to

<p>Introduction: ProfessorDavid Malangives a very good lecture on scalability for dynamic
websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a
great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching
style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible
explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal
scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load
balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high
availability.Watch it onAcademic EarthThis is one lecture in a series of 13
lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to: build dynamic
websites with Ajax and with Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP); set up
domain names with DNS; structure pages with XHTML and CSS how to program in
JavaScript and PHP; configure Apacheand MySQL; design and query databases with
SQL; use Ajax with both XML andJSON;  build mashups.For thelecture notesgo to

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block, CTO atRockThePost.com, a crowdfunding company, haswritten a
nice set of tipsfor smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a
small two person development team. Their service has a typical small scale

that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: Use PHP's APC feature.
APC is opcode cache that is "really a requirement in order for a website to
have a chance at performing well."Put everything that's not a .php request on
a CDN. Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on
S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused
them to serve directly from S3.Don't make connections to other servers in your
PHP code. Making connections to other servers blocks the server and slows down
processing. Use the APC key/value store for data storage and Varnish for

<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a

<p>Introduction: Hello highscalability world. I just discovered this site yesterday in a search
for a scalability resource and was very pleased to find such useful
information. I have some questions regarding distributed caching that I was
hoping the scalability intelligentsia trafficking this forum could answer. I
apologize for my lack of technical knowledge; I'm hoping this site will
increase said knowledge! Feel free to answer all or as much as you want. Thank
you in advance for your responses and thank you for a great resource!1.) What
are the standard benchmarks used to measure the performance of memcached or
mySQL/memcached working together (from web 2.0 companies etc)?2.) The little
research I've conducted on this site suggests that most web 2.0 companies use
a combination of mySQL and a hacked memcached (and potentially sharding). Does
anyone know if any of these companies use an enterprise vendor for their
distributed caching layer? (At this point in time I've only heard of Jive

<p>Introduction: Wikipedia andWikimediahave some of the best, most complete real-world
documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas
Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an
overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid,
lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN, how
caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how
they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle
load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of
configuration files. This is a really useful resource.Related

<p>Introduction: Snoozeis an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual
machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly to other VM
management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it
allows to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources.
Particularly, once installed and configured users can submit and control the
life-cycle of a large number of VMs. However, contrary to existing frameworks
for scalability and fault tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and
healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it
performs distributed VM management and is designed to be energy efficient.
Therefore, it implements features to monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU,
memory, network Rx, network Tx) demands, detect and resolve overload/underload
situations, perform dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and
finally power management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a
generic scheduler</p><p>5 0.58725035 <a title="134-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff_to_Watch_from_Google_IO_2011.html">1055 high scalability-2011-06-08-Stuff to Watch from Google IO 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With theGoogle IO Developer Conferencecompleted there aredozens and dozensof
information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty
free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos
available so quickly after the conference. Let's say you don't want to watch
all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen
scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:App
Engine Backends by Justin Haugh, Greg Darke. One of this biggest complaints
about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new
Backend node.Scaling App Engine Applicationsby Justin Haugh, Guido van Rossum.
Two parts: how App Engine scales internally and how you as a programmer make
it scale using the tools. Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000
queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good
discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides when to spawn
instances;</p><p>6 0.58526146 <a title="134-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-04-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_February_4%2C_2010.html">771 high scalability-2010-02-04-Hot Scalability Links for February 4, 2010</a></p>

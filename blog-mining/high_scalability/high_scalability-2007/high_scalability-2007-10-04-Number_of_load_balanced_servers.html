<p>Introduction: Hi,     We have an application that allows the user to define a publicly available resource with an ID. The ID can then be accessed via an HTTP call, passing the ID. While we're not a picture site, thinking of a resource like a picture may help understand what is going on.     We need to be able to stop access to the resource if it is accessed 'x' times in an hour, regardless of who is requesting it.     We see two options   - go to the database for each request to see if the # of returned in the last hour is within the limit.   - keep a counter in each of the application servers and sync the counters every few minutes or # of requests to determine if we've passed the limit. The sync point would be the database.     Going to the database (and updating it!) each time we get a request isn't very attractive.      We also have a load balanced farm of servers, so we know 'x' is going to have to be a soft limit if we count in the app serevrs. (We know there will be a period of time between s</p><p>5 0.13210085 <a title="111-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-06-Guinness_Book_of_World_Records_Anyone%3F.html">593 high scalability-2009-05-06-Guinness Book of World Records Anyone?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi all!  So nice to start discussing cool things in this even cooler forum :)  I am having a problem .. which i believe is already solved but i would love someone confirming actual experience with the same topic.  We are building a client / server architecture, consisting of a web server part and many clients.  Transport will be provided as either XML-RPC / SOAP / JSON or all at once. All of the communication has to be encrypted and passed within SSL3.  We expect a high load when the application starts (> 2000 concurrent requests). Combine this with xml parsing for the rpc api, things really look ugly :) So it's a big mess :)  It will not be that much database bound behind the api - mostly files will be transferred from the server to the clients and simple api for control.  So it's pretty much a matter of 'what-to-do-with-ssl'.  I was thinking of hardware - NetApp or a similar application accelerator.  Can anyone give examples of a hardware piece that combines: Load balancer / SSL acce</p><p>4 0.68179965 <a title="111-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-09-High_Load_on_production_Webservers_after_Sourcecode_sync.html">118 high scalability-2007-10-09-High Load on production Webservers after Sourcecode sync</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi everybody :)     We have a bunch of webservers (about 14 at th  i  s time) running Apache. As app  l  ication framework we're using PHP with the APC Cache insta  l  led to improve performance. For load ba  l  ancing we're using a Big F5 system with dynamic ratio (SNMP driven)     To sync new/updated sourcecode we're using subversion to "automaticly" update these servers w  i  th our latest software relases. After updating the new source to these production servers the load of the mashines is ra  i  sing to hell.     While updating the servers, they are sti  l  l in "production", serving webpages to the users. Otherwise the process of updating wou  l  d take ages. Most of the time we're only updating in the morning hours while less users are online, because of the above issue.     My guess is, that the load is raising that h  i  gh, because APC needs to recompile a bunch of new f  i  les each time. Before and while compi  l  ing the performance simply is "bad".     My goal would be t</p><p>5 0.67689025 <a title="111-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-03-Save_on_a_Load_Balancer_By_Using_Client_Side_Load_Balancing.html">109 high scalability-2007-10-03-Save on a Load Balancer By Using Client Side Load Balancing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In   Client Side Load Balancing for Web 2.0 Applications   author Lei Zhu suggests a very interesting approach to load balancing: forget DNS round robbin, toss your expensive load balancer, and make your client do the load balancing for you. Your client maintains a list of possible servers and cycles through them. All the details are explained in the article, but it's an intriguing idea, especially for the budget conscious startup.</p><p>6 0.67555332 <a title="111-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy%3A_Terminate_SSL_Connections_in_Hardware_and_Reduce_Server_Count_by_40%25.html">878 high scalability-2010-08-12-Strategy: Terminate SSL Connections in Hardware and Reduce Server Count by 40%</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The Google Operating System blog has an   interesting post   on Google's scale based on an updated version of Google's paper about MapReduce.      The input data for some of the MapReduce jobs run in September 2007 was 403,152 TB (terabytes), the average number of machines allocated for a MapReduce job was 394, while the average completion time was 6 minutes and a half. The paper mentions that Google's indexing system processes more than 20 TB of raw data.               Niall Kennedy calculates that the average MapReduce job runs across a $1 million hardware infrastructure, assuming that Google still uses the same cluster configurations from 2004: two 2 GHz Intel Xeon processors with Hyper-Threading enabled, 4 GB of memory, two 160 GB IDE hard drives and a gigabit Ethernet link.       Greg Linden notices that Google's infrastructure is an important competitive advantage. "Anyone at Google can process terabytes of data.

<p>Introduction: Hi, I aminterested in some experienced advice for choosing switches for a
colocated 2-tier architecture. I have the hardware chosen for the webservers,
app servers, and db servers, but need some advice on the network switch in
between:colocation port -> firewall(load balancer) -> 2+ web servers (app
servers) -> gigabit switch -> DB server(possibly cluster for future
expansion)the question is that I am just starting out, i wonder which
rackmount gigabit switch to select for the private LAN between the app server
-> DB servers. Do I need managed for that? Cisco switches are the best, but
they are the most expensive...I am looking at possibly using Dell/Netgear
gigabit switches.Thanks for any input</p><p>3 0.10606158 <a title="99-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-12-05-5_Ways_to_Make_Cloud_Failure_Not_an_Option.html">1367 high scalability-2012-12-05-5 Ways to Make Cloud Failure Not an Option</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With cloud SLAs generally being worth what you don't pay for them, what can
you do to protect yourself? Sean Hull inAirBNB didn't have to fail  has some
solid advice on how to deal with outages:Use Redundancy. Make database and
webserver tiers redundant using multi-az or alternately read-replicas. Have a
browsing only mode. Give users a read-only version of your site. Users may not
even notice failures as they will only see problems when they need to perform
a write operation.Web Applications need Feature Flags. Build in the ability to
turn off and on major parts of your site and flip the switch when problems
arise.Consider Netflix's Simian. By randomly causing outages in your
application you can continually test your failover and redundancy
infrastructure.Use multiple clouds. Use Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Clouds
as a way of surviving outages in any one particular cloud.None of these are
easy and it's worth considering that your application may not need them at
all.

<p>Introduction: Snabb Switch \- a toolkit for solving novel problems in networking. If you are
building a new packet-processing network appliance then you can use Snabb
Switch to get the job done more quickly.Here's a great impassioned overview
from erichocean:Or, you could just avoid the OS
altogether:https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitchOur current engineering
target is 1 million writes/sec and > 10 million reads/sec on top of an
architecture similar to that, on a single box, to our fully transactional,
MVCC database (write do not block reads, and vice versa) that runs in the same
process (a la SQLite), which we've also merged with our application code and
our caching tier, so we're down to--literally--a single process for what would
have been at least three separate tiers in a traditional setup.The result is
that we had to move to measuring request latency in microseconds exclusively.
The architecture (without additional application-specific processing) supports

<p>Introduction: By Bhavin Turakhia CEO, Directi. Covers:* Why scalability is important. Viral
marketing can result in instant success. With RSS/Ajax/SOA number of requests
grow exponentially with user base. Goal is to build a web 2.0 app that can
server millions of users with zero downtime.* Introduction to the variables.
Scalability, performance, responsiveness, availability, downtime impact, cost,
maintenance effort.* Introduction to the factors. Platform selection,
hardware, application design, database architecture, deployment architecture,
storage architecture, abuse prevention, monitoring mechanisms, etc.* Building
our own scalable architecture in incremental steps: vertical scaling, vertical
partitioning, horizontal scaling, horizontal partitioning, etc. First buy
bigger. Then deploy each service on a separate node. Then increase the number
of nudes and load balance. Deal with session management. Remove single points
of failure. Use a shared nothing cluster. Choice of master-slave multi-master</p><p>6 0.55237645 <a title="99-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com.html">177 high scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com</a></p>

<p>Introduction: SummaryIn this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing
stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services
application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out
model.BioNati Shalom is the CTO and Founder ofGigaSpacesand responsible for
the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed
technology and architecture namely CORBA, Jini, J2EE, Grid and SOA. Nati is

<p>Introduction: The Third International Conference on Scalable Information Systems will focus
on a wide array of scalability issues and investigate new approaches to tackle
problems arising from the ever-growing size and complexity of information of
all kinds.Looking at theirtechnical programa lot of interesting topics will be
covered. I see sensor networks, a subject I'm really interested in, has a
number of sessions. That's unusual. And it's in Italy!</p><p>4 0.78701997 <a title="99-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-11-FTP_Sanity%3A_Redundancy%2C_archiving%2C_consolidation..html">208 high scalability-2008-01-11-FTP Sanity: Redundancy, archiving, consolidation.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Easy FTP redundancy and consolidation with the Open Source project Generic-
FTP. Works with probably any Linux FTP Server (ProFTPD only one tested). Get
rid of some single points of failure. A very easy to set up solution using
scripts written in PHP. Tested thoroughly in a production environment.</p><p>5 0.78227842 <a title="99-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-28-Job_queue_and_search_engine.html">332 high scalability-2008-05-28-Job queue and search engine</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,I want to implement a search engine with lucene.To be scalable, I would
like to execute search jobs asynchronously (with a job queuing system).But i
don't know if it is a good design... Why ?Search results can be large ! (eg:
100+ pages with 25 documents per page)With asynchronous sytem, I need to store
results for each search job.I can set a short expiration time (~5 min) for
each search result, but it's still large.What do you think about it ?Which
design would you use for that ?ThanksMat</p><p>6 0.77689314 <a title="99-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-20-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_20%2C_2012.html">1287 high scalability-2012-07-20-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 20, 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Colin Scott, a Berkeley researcher, updated Jeff Dean's famousNumbers Everyone
Should Knowwith hisLatency Numbers Every Programmer Should Knowinteractive
graphic. The interactive aspect is cool because it has a slider that let's you
see numbers back from as early as 1990 to the far far future of 2020. Colin
explained hismotivation for updating the numbers:The other day, a friend
mentioned a latency number to me, and I realized that it was an order of
magnitude smaller than what I had memorized from Jeff's talk. The problem, of
course, is that hardware performance increases exponentially! After some
digging, I actually found that the numbers Jeff quotes are over a decade
oldSince numbers without interpretation are simply data, take a look atGoogle

<p>Introduction: For everything given something seems to be taken. Caching is a great
scalability solution, but caching alsocomes with problems.Shardingis a great
scalability solution, but as Foursquare recently revealed in apost-mortemabout
their 17 hours of downtime, sharding also has problems. MongoDB, the database
Foursquare uses, also contributed theirpost-mortemof what went wrong too.Now
that everyone has shared and resharded, what can we learn to help us skip
these mistakes and quickly move on to a different set of mistakes?First, like
forFacebook, huge props to Foursquare and MongoDB for being upfront and honest
about their problems. This helps everyone get better and is a sign we work in
a pretty cool industry.Second, overall, the fault didn't flow from evil hearts
or gross negligence. As usual the cause was more mundane: a key system, that
could be a little more robust, combined with a very popular application built
by a small group of people, under immense pressure, trying to get a lot of

<p>Introduction: Aaron Kimball of Cloudera gives a wonderful 23 minute presentation
titledCloudera Hadoop Training: Thinking at Scale Clouderawhich talks about
"common challenges and general best practices for scaling with your data." As
a company Cloudera offers "enterprise-level support to users of Apache
Hadoop." Part of that offering is a really useful series oftutorial videos on
the Hadoop ecosystem.Like TV lawyer Perry Mason (or is it Harmon Rabb?), Aaron
gradually builds his case. He opens with the problem of storing lots of data.
Then a blistering cross examination of the problem of building distributed
systems to analyze that data sets up a powerful closing argument. With so much
testimony behind him, on closing Aaron really brings it home with why shared
nothing systems like map-reduce are the right solution on how to query lots of
data. They jury loved it.Here's the videoThinking at Scale. And here's a
summary of some of the lessons learned from the talk:Lessons LearnedWe can

<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture
forPoppen.de, a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be
careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they
manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new,
using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached,
RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.What is Poppen.de?Poppen.de (NSFW) is
the top dating website in Germany, and while it may be a small site compared
to giants like Flickr or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to
learn from if you are starting to get some scaling problems.The Stats2.000.000

<p>Introduction: Skype's 220 millions users lost service for a stunning two days. The primary
cause for Skype's nightmare (can you imagine the beeper storm that went off?)
was a massive global roll-out of aWindow's patchtriggering the simultaneous
reboot of millions of machines across the globe. The secondary cause was a bug
in Skype's software that prevented "self-healing" in the face of such attacks.
The flood of log-in requests and a lack of "peer-to-peer resources" melted
their system.breakWho's fault is it? Is Skype to blame? Is Microsoft to blame?
Or is the peer-to-peer model itself fundamentally flawed in some way?Let's be
real, how could Skype possibly test booting 220 million servers over a random
configuration of resources? Answer: they can't. Yes, it's Skype's
responsibility, but they are in a bit of a pickle on this one.The boot
scenario is one of the most basic and one of the most difficult scalability
scenarios to plan for and test. You can't simulate the viciousness of real-

<p>Introduction: If you've wondered why I haven't been posting lately it's because I've been on
an amazingBeach's motorcycle tourof theAlps(and,and,and,and,and,and,and,and).
My wife (Linda) and I rode two-up on a BMW 1200 GS through the alps in
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, and Lichtenstein.The trip was
more beautiful than I ever imagined. We rode challenging mountain pass after
mountain pass, froze in the rain, baked in the heat, woke up on excellent
Italian coffee, ate slice after slice of tasty apple strudel, drank dazzling
local wines, smelled the fresh cut grass as the Swiss en masse cut hay for the
winter feeding of their dairy cows, rode the amazing Munich train system,
listened as cow bells tinkled like wind chimes throughout small valleys, drank
water from a pure alpine spring on a blisteringly hot hike, watched local
German folk dancers represent their regions, and had fun in the company of
fellow riders. Magical.They say you'll ride more twists and turns on this trip

<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers Show 41 episode was to reveal and
ruminate over the horrors of a successfulattack on RSA, which puts the whole
world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there
was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost
datacenter.Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile
back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by
summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal: Look at
Arista and Juniper. JuniperHas a range of stackable switches, which includes
some 10 gig.If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on
their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric
solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric.
Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.
Thinks Juniper would make a good deal in order to get a few reference sites
for QFX.Arista Networks</p><p>5 0.71158105 <a title="120-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-23-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_23%2C_2013.html">1506 high scalability-2013-08-23-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 23, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Well, not exactly Fishin', I'll be on vacation starting today and I'll be back
late November. I won't be posting anything new, so we'll all have a break.
Disappointing, I know, but fear not, I will be posting some oldies for your
re-enjoyment.And If you've ever wanted to write an article for
HighScalability, this would be a great time :-) I especially need help on
writingStuff the Internet Says on Scalabilityas I will be reading the
Interwebs on a much reduced schedule. Shock! Horror! So if the spirit moves
you, please write something.My connectivity in Italy will probably be good, so
I will check in and approve articles on a regular basis. Ciao...</p><p>2 0.93208003 <a title="120-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-30-Gone_Fishin%27.html">1128 high scalability-2011-09-30-Gone Fishin'</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Colin Charleshas cool picture showingFlickr's message tellinghim they'll need
about 15 minutes to move his 11,500 images to another shard. One, that's a lot
of pictures! Two, it just goes to show you don't have to make this stuff
complicated. Sure, it might be nice if their infrastructure could auto-balance
shards with no down time and no loss of performance, but do you really need to
go to all the extra complexity? The manual system works and though Colin would
probably like his service to have been up, I am sure his day will still be a
pleasant one.</p><p>4 0.88503253 <a title="120-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-23-Gone_Fishin%27_2014.html">1653 high scalability-2014-05-23-Gone Fishin' 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With cloud SLAs generally being worth what you don't pay for them, what can
you do to protect yourself? Sean Hull inAirBNB didn't have to fail  has some
solid advice on how to deal with outages:Use Redundancy. Make database and
webserver tiers redundant using multi-az or alternately read-replicas. Have a
browsing only mode. Give users a read-only version of your site. Users may not
even notice failures as they will only see problems when they need to perform
a write operation.Web Applications need Feature Flags. Build in the ability to
turn off and on major parts of your site and flip the switch when problems
arise.Consider Netflix's Simian. By randomly causing outages in your
application you can continually test your failover and redundancy
infrastructure.Use multiple clouds. Use Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Clouds
as a way of surviving outages in any one particular cloud.None of these are
easy and it's worth considering that your application may not need them at
all.

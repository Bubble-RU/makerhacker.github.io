<p>Introduction: This is whatMike Peters says he can do: make your site run 10 times faster.
His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40
IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50
concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively
handling 500 concurrent connections per second with CPU at 8% and no
degradation in performance."Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:Database
write access (read is cheaper)Database read accessPHP, ASP, JSP and any other
server side scriptingClient side JavaScriptMultiple/Fat Images, scripts or css
files from different domains on your pageSlow keep-alive client connections,
clogging your available socketsMike's solutions:breakSwitch all database
writes to offline processingMinimize number of database read access to the
bare minimum. No more than two queries per page.Denormalize your database and

<p>Introduction: Performance is critical to the success of any web site, and yet today's web
applications push browsers to their limits with increasing amounts of rich
content and heavy use of Ajax. In his new bookEven Faster Web Sites:
Performance Best Practices for Web Developers, Steve Souders, web performance
evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable
techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.Souders' previous
book, the bestsellingHigh Performance Web Sites, shocked the web development
world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on
the client side. In Even Faster Web Sites, Souders and eight expert
contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your
site's performance in three critical categories:JavaScript- Get advice for

<p>Introduction: Many people in the Apache Hadoop community have asked Yahoo! to publish the
version of Apache Hadoop they test and deploy across their large Hadoop
clusters. As a service to the Hadoop community, Yahoo is releasing the Yahoo!
Distribution of Hadoop -- a source code distribution that is based entirely on
code found in the Apache Hadoop project.This source distribution includes code
patches that they have added to improve the stability and performance of their
clusters. In all cases, these patches have already been contributed back to
Apache, but they may not yet be available in an Apache release of Hadoop.Read

<p>Introduction: The Exceptional Performance group at Yahoo! has identified 14 best practices
for making web pages faster. These best practices have proven to reduce
response times of Yahoo! properties by 25-50%. They focus on the front-end,
for example, why it's bad to use "@import" for including stylesheets and why
ETags disable browser caching.This google tech talk features these best
practices and demonstrate YSlow.Relevant links:14 Rules for Exceptional Web

code run faster and optimising the response time. But that only scales up to a
point. To really take our web sites to the next level, we need to look at the

<p>Introduction: Update: How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences. Shows how to
analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and
how to resolve them.80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the
frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically
rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what
I mean. Steve Souders, author ofHigh Performance WebsitesandYslow, hasten more

<p>Introduction: I've largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the "NoSQL vs.
Relational" conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about
currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to
build in, I'd like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint.
In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I've inadvertently given myself
plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches,
and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say
with a fair amount of certainty, that I've found a good compromise. You can

<p>Introduction: Scoblethe Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video
channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that
have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things
you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off
the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.For a strategy hit
he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about
when makingFeedBlendr:One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services
you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up
and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up
and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He
told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in
designing their architecture.</p><p>4 0.71461296 <a title="47-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-11-Yahoo_Live%27s_Scaling_Problems_Prove%3A_Release_Early_and_Often_-_Just_Don%27t_Screw_Up.html">244 high scalability-2008-02-11-Yahoo Live's Scaling Problems Prove: Release Early and Often - Just Don't Screw Up</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Tech Crunch chomped down on some initial scaling problems with Yahoo's new
live video streaming serviceYahoo Live. After a bit of chewing on Yahoo's old
bones, TC spat out:If Yahoo cant scale something like this (no matter how much
they claim it’s an experiment, it’s still a live service), it shows how far
the once brightest star of the online world has fallen.This kind of thinking
kills innovation. When there's no room for a few hiccups or a little failure
you have to cover your ass so completely nothing new will ever see the light
of day.breakI thought we were supposed to beagile. We are supposed to release
early and often. Not every 'i' has to be dotted and not every last router has
to be installed before we take the first step of a grand new journey.Get it
out there. Let users help you make it better. Listen to customers, make
changes, push the new code out, listen some more, and fix problems as they
come up. Following this process we'll make something the customer wants and
needs</p><p>5 0.6776371 <a title="47-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-22-Why_not_Cache_from_Intersystems%3F.html">164 high scalability-2007-11-22-Why not Cache from Intersystems?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have some experience with a very large OLTP system that is 7+ TB in size and
performs very well for 30K+ concurrent users. It is built using Intersystems
Cache based on the very old but very scalable MUMPS platform. Why don't I see
more discussions about archiectures such as these in this forum? I am curious
why this platform scales so much better then the typical RDBMS.</p><p>6 0.66235471 <a title="47-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-14-When_all_the_Program%27s_a_Graph_-_Prismatic%27s_Plumbing_Library.html">1406 high scalability-2013-02-14-When all the Program's a Graph - Prismatic's Plumbing Library</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail
system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded
architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each
with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies
(Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers . The benefit of this
approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA loadbalancing on the
perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move
accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users).
Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has
MySQL support. What we also liked about this approach was that it had no
dependency on a distributed or networked filesystem, so less chance of
corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches
capacity, we just off load users to a less used server. If any server goes
offline, it only affects the fraction of users</p><p>3 0.22845024 <a title="80-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling_IMAP_and_POP3.html">81 high scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling IMAP and POP3</a></p>

<p>Introduction: You know your product is doing well when most of yourearly blog postsdeal with
the status of the waiting list of hundreds of thousands of users eagerly
waiting to download your product. That's the enviable positionMailbox, a free
mobile email management app, found themselves early in their release cycle.
Hasn't email been done already? Apparently not. Mailbox scaled to one million
users in a paltry six weeks with a team ofabout 14 people. As of April they
were delivering over100 million messages per day.How did they do it? Mailbox
engineering lead,Sean Beausoleil, gave an informative interview on
readwrite.comon how Mailbox planned to scale... Gather signals early. A pre-
release launch video helped generate interest, but it also allowed them to
gauge early interest before even releasing. From the overwhelming response
they knew they would need to have to scale and scale quickly. Have something
unique. The average person might not think a mailbox app would be a fertile
product space.

<p>Introduction: hi,the website i work for is looking to build a email system that can handle a
fair few emails (up to a hundred thousand a day).These comprise emails like
registration emails, newsletters, lots of user triggered emails and overnight
emails.At present we queue them in SQL and feed them into an smtp server on
one of our web servers when the queue drops below a certain level.this has
caused our mail system to crash as well as hammer our DB server (shared!!!).We
have got an architecture of what we want to build but thought there might be
something we could buy off the shelf that allowed us to keep templated emails,
lists of recipients, schedule sends etc and report on it. We can't find
anythingWhat do big websites like amazon etc use or people a little smaller
but who still send loads of mail (flickr, ebuyer, or other ecommerce
sites)Cheerstarqs</p><p>5 0.62774223 <a title="80-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Marton Trencseni has collected a wonderful list of different papers on
distributed systems. He's organized them into the following sections: The
Google Papers, Distributed Filesystems, Non-relational Distributed Databases,
The Lamport Papers, and Implementation Issues. Many old favorites on the list
and some that are likely new to you. My new favorite is "Frangipani: A
Scalable Distributed File System." How can you not love "Frangipani" as a
word?</p><p>same-blog 2 0.71095634 <a title="80-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Product%3A_Perdition_Mail_Retrieval_Proxy.html">80 high scalability-2007-09-06-Product: Perdition Mail Retrieval Proxy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perditionis a fully featured POP3 and IMAP4 proxy server. It is able to handle
both SSL and non-SSL connections and redirect users to a real-server based on
a database lookup. Perdition supports modular based database access. ODBC,
MySQL, PostgreSQL, GDBM, POSIX Regular Expression and NIS modules ship with
the distribution. The API for modules is open allowing arbitrary modules to be
written to allow access to any data store.Perdition has many uses. Including,
creating large mail systems where an end-user's mailbox may be stored on one
of several hosts, integrating different mail systems together, migrating
between different email infrastructures, and bridging plain-text, SSL and TLS
services. It can also be used as part of a firewall. The use of perditon to
scale mail services beyond a single box is discussed in high capacity email.</p><p>3 0.67854583 <a title="80-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-04-Wide_Fast_SATA%3A_the_Recipe_for_Hot_Performance.html">1511 high scalability-2013-09-04-Wide Fast SATA: the Recipe for Hot Performance</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.This blog post will tell you exactly how to build
a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-
terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays,
actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.You need to
know:Which SSDs workWhich chassis workHow to configure your RAID cardsIntel's
SATA solutions - combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell
R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized
database likeAerospike, enables high throughput and low latency.In a wide
configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can
cost-effectively serve at high throughput with 16T at $2.50 per GB with the
s3700, or $1.25 with the s3500. Other SSD offerings - from Crucial (Micron)

<p>Introduction: One important high availability principle is concurrency control.  The idea is
to allow only that much traffic through to your system which your system can
handle successfully.  For example: if your system is certified to handle a
concurrency of 100 then the 101st request should either timeout, be asked to
try later  or wait until one of the previous 100 requests finish.  The 101st
request should not be allowed to negatively impact the experience of the other
100 users.  Only the 101st request should be impacted.Read more here...</p><p>5 0.60606492 <a title="80-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-06-7_Not_So_Sexy_Tips_for_Saving_Money_On_Amazon.html">1452 high scalability-2013-05-06-7 Not So Sexy Tips for Saving Money On Amazon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Harish Ganesan CTO of8KMiles has a very helpful blog, Cloud, Big Data and
Mobile, where he shows a nice analytical bent which leads to a lot of
practical advice and cost saving tips:Use SQS Batch Requests to reduce the
number of requests hitting SQS which saves costs. Sending 10 messages in a
single batch request which in the example save $30/month.Use SQS Long Polling
to reduce extra polling requests, cutting down empty receives, which in the
example saves ~$600 in empty receive leakage costs.Choose the right search
technology choice to save costs in AWS by matching your activity pattern to
the technology. For a small application with constant load or a heavily
utilized search tier or seasonal loads Amazon Cloud Search looks like the cost
efficient play. Use Amazon CloudFront Price Class to minimize costs by
selecting the right Price Class for your audience to potentially reduce
delivery costs by excluding Amazon CloudFront's more expensive edge
locations.Optimize ElastiCache Cluster</p><p>6 0.60264766 <a title="80-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-06-Super_Bowl_Advertisers_Ready_for_the_Traffic%3F_Nope..It%27s_Lights_Out..html">1401 high scalability-2013-02-06-Super Bowl Advertisers Ready for the Traffic?

<p>Introduction: Update:as of the end of Q2 2011,Akamai had 95,811servers deployed
globally.Akamai is the CDN to the stars. It claims to deliver between 15 and
30 percent of all Web traffic, with major customers like Facebook, Twitter,
Apple, and the US military. Traditionally quite secretive, we get a peek
behind the curtain in this paper: The Akamai Network: A Platform for High-
Performance Internet Applications by Erik Nygren, Ramesh Sitaraman, and
Jennifer Sun. Abstract:Comprising more than 61,000 servers located across
nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers
hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of
enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet
applications. In this paper, we give an overview of the components and
capabilities of this large-scale distributed computing platform, and offer
some insight into its architecture, design principles, operation, and
management.

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

questions are:1. How does CDN sync data with web servers for video/images? If
I have a user to upload a video to my site, will it get stored directly in CDN
or it comes to my webserver first and then sync-ed with cache server?2. How to
have only the dynamic video/image delivered through CDN while the rest is

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: Hi,In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread
pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is
tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal
variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user
id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the
code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to
pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought isclass ReferenceIdGenerator
{public static setReferenceId(String login) {threadLocal.set(login +
System.currentMillis());}public static String getReferenceId() {return
threadLocal.get();}private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =new
ThreadLocal();}class MySevlet {void service(.....) {HttpSession session =
request.getSession(false);String userId =
session.get("userId");ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId);try
{doSomething();}finally {ReferenceIdGenerator.remove();}}This method is also</p><p>6 0.87272894 <a title="39-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed_content_system_with_bandwidth_balancing.html">605 high scalability-2009-05-22-Distributed content system with bandwidth balancing</a></p>

MonthUpdate:Startup - ASP.NETMVC, Cloud Scale & Deploymentshows an interesting
alternative approach for a Windows stack using ServerPath/GoGrid for a
dedicated database machine, elastic VMs for the front end, and a free load
balancer.Stack Overflowis a much loved programmer question and answer site
written by two guys nobody has ever heard of before. Well, not exactly. The
site was created by top programmer and blog starsJeff AtwoodandJoel Spolsky.
In that sense Stack Overflow is like a celebrity owned restaurant, only it
should be around for a while. Joel estimates 1/3 of all the programmers in the
world have used the site so they must be serving up something good.I fell in
deep like with Stack Overflow for purely selfish reasons, it helped me solve a
few difficult problems that were jabbing my eyes out with pain. I also

<p>Introduction: A lot has happened since my first article on the Stack Overflow Architecture.
Contrary to the theme of that last article, which lavished attention on Stack
Overflow's dedication to a scale-up strategy, Stack Overflow has both grown up
and out in the last few years.Stack Overflow has grown up by more then
doubling in size to over 16 million users and multiplying its number of page
views nearly 6 times to 95 million page views a month.  Stack Overflow has
grown out by expanding into theStack Exchange Network, which includes Stack
Overflow, Server Fault, and Super User for a grand total of 43 different
sites. That's a lot of fruitful multiplying going on.What hasn't changed is
Stack Overflow's openness about what they are doing. And that's what prompted
this update. A recent series of posts talks a lot about how they've been
handling their growth: Stack Exchange's Architecture in Bullet Points, Stack
Overflow's New York Data Center, Designing For Scalability of Management and
Fault Tolera</p><p>5 0.13073376 <a title="162-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Many_updates_against_MySQL.html">366 high scalability-2008-08-17-Many updates against MySQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello! My first post here, so be patient please. I am developing site where I
have lots of static content. But on many pages I have query to update count of
views. I would say this is may cause lots of problems and was interested in
another solution like storing these counts somewhere else. As my knowledge is
bit limited in this way, I am asking you. I can say I understand PHP(OOP ofc)
and MySQL. Nowadays I am getting into servers.Other question I have is:I read
about making lots of things static.(in Flickr Architecture) and am interested
how they do static sites? Lets say they make photo page static? And rebuild
when tagg or comment is added? I am bit interested in it as I want to learn
Smarty better(newbie) and serving content.Moreover, how about PHP? I have read
many books about PHP theoretically but would love to see some RL example of
using objects and exceptions(mainly this as I don't completely understand it)
to learn some good programming habits. So if you can help me with some</p><p>6 0.12735426 <a title="162-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-12-Technology_behind_mediatemple_grid_service_.html">90 high scalability-2007-09-12-Technology behind mediatemple grid service </a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a
firm schema. I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the
overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding. The data is
essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song. This
lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and
Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together. This will be in
a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by
artist album or song. By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song
I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by. The problem is
that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to
shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what
are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it? Should I go
with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table? Perhaps it might be
best</p><p>same-blog 3 0.37982228 <a title="162-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-20-what_is_j2ee_stack.html">162 high scalability-2007-11-20-what is j2ee stack</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability
load balanced system using mod backhand andWackamole. The idea is you don't
need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of
the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-
based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read.
Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a
resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of

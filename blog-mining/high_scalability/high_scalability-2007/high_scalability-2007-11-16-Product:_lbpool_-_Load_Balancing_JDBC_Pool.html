<p>Introduction: People sometimes wonder why Oracle isn't mentioned on this site more. Maybe it
will now asMichael Nygard reportsOracle 11g now does read/write splitting with
theirActive Data Guardproduct. Average replication latency was 1 second and
it's accomplished with standard Oracle JDBC drivers. They see a 250% increase
in transactions per service for read-write service. And a 110% improvement in
tps for read-only service was found. You see a change in hardware architecture
with the new setup. They now recommend using a primary and multiple standby
servers, a single controller per server, and a single set of disks in RAID1.
Previously the recommendation was to have a primary and secondary server with
two controllers per server and a set of mirrored disks per controller. The
changes increase performance, availability, and hardware utilization. They
also have a useful looking best practices document for High Availability
calledMaximum Availability Architecture (MAA).</p><p>4 0.12552378 <a title="157-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-27-Product%3A_Sequoia_Database_Clustering_Technology.html">102 high scalability-2007-09-27-Product: Sequoia Database Clustering Technology</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability
load balanced system using mod backhand andWackamole. The idea is you don't
need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of
the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-
based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read.
Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a
resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of
effect of keep-alives on performance.</p><p>3 0.71929324 <a title="157-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-22-Server_load_balancing_architectures%2C_Part_1%3A_Transport-level_load_balancing.html">426 high scalability-2008-10-22-Server load balancing architectures, Part 1: Transport-level load balancing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Server farms achieve high scalability and high availability through server
load balancing, a technique that makes the server farm appear to clients as a
single server. In this two-part article, Gregor Roth explores server load
balancing architectures, with a focus on open source solutions. Part 1 covers
server load balancing basics and discusses the pros and cons of transport-
level server load balancing.The barrier to entry for many Internet companies
is low. Anyone with a good idea can develop a small application, purchase a
domain name, and set up a few PC-based servers to handle incoming traffic. The
initial investment is small, so the start-up risk is minimal. But a successful
low-cost infrastructure can become a serious problem quickly. A single server
that handles all the incoming requests may not have the capacity to handle
high traffic volumes once the business becomes popular. In such a situations
companies often start to scale up: they upgrade the existing infrastructure by</p><p>4 0.71836913 <a title="157-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-10-Shard_servers_--_go_big_or_small%3F.html">383 high scalability-2008-09-10-Shard servers -- go big or small?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello everyone,I'm designing a website/widget that my business partner and I
expect to serve millions of hits daily. As such we must shard our database
(and we're designing with shards in mind right from the beginning). However,
the one thing I haven't been able to figure out from Googling is the best
hardware to go with for shards. I'm using exclusively InnoDB tables.We'll
(eventually) be running 3 groups of database servers:a) Session servers for
php sessions. These will have a very high write volume.b) ID servers. These
will match a couple primary indices (such as user ID) to a given shard. These
will have an intense read load, plus a moderate amount of writes.c) Shard
servers. These will hold the bulk of the data. These will have a high read
load and a lowish write load.Group A is done as a database instead of using
memcached so users aren't logged out if a memcached server goes down. As the
write load is high, a pair of high performance master-master servers seems
obvious. What's</p><p>5 0.71781492 <a title="157-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-Wikimedia_architecture.html">72 high scalability-2007-08-22-Wikimedia architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From the website:Thelbpool projectprovides a load balancing JDBC driver for
use with DB connection pools. It wraps a normal JDBC driver providing
reconnect semantics in the event of additional hardware availability, partial
system failure, or uneven load distribution. It also evenly distributes all
new connections among slave DB servers in a given pool. Each time connect() is
called it will attempt to use the best server with the least system load.The
biggest scalability issue with large applications that are mostly READ bound
is the number of transactions per second that the disks in your cluster can
handle. You can generally solve this in two ways.1. Buy bigger and faster
disks with expensive RAID controllers.2. Buy CHEAP hardware on CHEAP disks but
lots of machines.We prefer the cheap hardware approach and lbpool allows you
to do this.Even if you *did* manage to use cheap hardware most load balancing
hardware is expensive, requires a redundant balancer (if it were to fail), and

<p>Introduction: How is it possible that a wooden Shinto shrine built in the 7th century is
still standing? The answer depends on how you answer this philosophical head
scratcher: With nearly every cell in your body continually being replaced, are
you still the same person?The Ise Grand Shrine has been in continuous
existence for over 1300 years because every twenty years an exact replica has
been rebuilt on an adjacent footprint. The former temple is then
dismantled.Now that's resilience. If you want something to last make it a
living part of a culture. It's not so much the building that is remade, what
is rebuilt and passed down from generation to generation is the meme that the
shrine is important and worth preserving. The rest is an unfolding of that
imperative.You can see echoes of this same process in Open Source projects
like Linux and the libraries and frameworks that get themselves reconstructed
in each new environment.The patterns of recurrence in software are the result
of Darwinian selectio</p><p>3 0.87816477 <a title="157-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-06-09-Paper%3A_Propagation_Networks%3A_A_Flexible_and_Expressive_Substrate_for_Computation_.html">839 high scalability-2010-06-09-Paper: Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alexey Radul in his fascinating 174 page dissertation Propagation Networks: A
Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation, offers to help us break
free of the tyranny of linear time by arranging computation as a network of
autonomous but interconnected machines.  We can do this byorganizing
computation as a network of interconnected machines of some kind, each of
which is free to run when it pleases, propagating  information around the
network as proves possible. The consequence of this freedom is that the
structure of the aggregate does not impose an order of time.The abstract from
his thesis is:In this dissertation I propose a shift in the foundations of
computation. Modern programming systems are not expressive enough. The
traditional image of a single computer that has global effects on a large
memory is too restrictive. The propagation paradigm replaces this with
computing by networks of local, independent, stateless machines interconnected
with stateful storage cells. In so</p><p>4 0.86384302 <a title="157-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-18-Robert_Scoble%27s_Rules_for_Successfully_Scaling_Startups.html">352 high scalability-2008-07-18-Robert Scoble's Rules for Successfully Scaling Startups</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignantFriendFeed threadcommiserating PodTech's
unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup.
Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with
them:Have a story.Have everyone on board with that story.If anyone goes off of
that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.Make sure
people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues
should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get
fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.Work ONLY for a leader who
will make the tough decisions.Build a place where excellence is expected,
allowed, and is enabled.Fire idiots quickly.If your engineering team can't
give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only
things that are measured ever get improved.When your stars aren't listened to
the company is in trouble.Getting rid of the CEO, even if it's all his fault,

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ali Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead at
PlanForCloud.com.  I read a recent blog post about TripAdvisor's experiment
with AWS where they attempted to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a
replica of their live site. There was also an interesting blog post on
Pinterest's massive growth on AWS. These blogs highlighted exactly the types
of questions we're interested in, mainly:How much would it cost to deploy
System X on Cloud Y? e.g. how much would it cost to host TripAdvisor on the
AWS US-East cloud?Would it be cheaper to use deployment option X or Y? e.g.
would it be cheaper to use reserved instances, different types of instances,
different cloud providers...What happens to costs when the system grows? e.g.
Pinterest has around 410TB of data on S3, what if that keeps growing at a rate
of 25% every month, like it has been in the last 10 months?I created a couple
of deployments in PlanForCloud to explore these questions and the results are

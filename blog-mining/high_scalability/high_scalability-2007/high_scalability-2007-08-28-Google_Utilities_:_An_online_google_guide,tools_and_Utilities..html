<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Nicholas CarrA former executive editor of the Harvard Business
Review, Nicholas Carr writes and speaks on technology, business, and culture.
His provocative 2004 book Does IT Matter? set off a worldwide debate about the
role of computers in business.The Big Switch – Rewiring the World, From Edison
to GoogleCarr's core insight is that the development of the computer and the
Internet remarkably parallels that of the last radically disruptive
technology, electricity. He traces the rapid morphing of electrification from
an in-house competitive advantage to a ubiquitous utility, and how the
business advantage rapidly shifted from the innovators and early adopters to

<p>Introduction: I'm not sure how many people who follow this have even tried collectl but I
wanted to let you all know that I just released a set of utilities called
strangely enough collectl-utils, which you can get athttp://collectl-
utils.sourceforge.net. One web-based utility called colplot gives you the
ability to very easily plot data from multiple systems in a way that makes
correlating them over time very easy.Another utility called colmux lets you
look at multiple systems in real time. In fact if you go the page that
describes it in more detail you'll see a photo which shows the CPU loads on
192 systems one a second, one set of data/line! in fact the display so wide it
takes 3 large monitors side-by-side to see it all and even though you can't
actually read the displays you can easily see which systems are loaded and
which aren't.Anyhow give it a look and let me know what you think.-mark</p><p>4 0.12103223 <a title="75-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-16-Google%2B_Infrastructure_Update_-_the_JavaScript_Story.html">1143 high scalability-2011-11-16-Google+ Infrastructure Update - the JavaScript Story</a></p>

JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround we glimpsed inside Google's
technology stack for building Google+. Mark Knichel, an engineer on the
Google+ infrastructure team, has helped us look alittle deeper on how
Javascript is handled in Google+.  Here's a quick look:They loveClosure for
its library, templates, compiler, and strict type checking. Compilation is now
required for good performance. I've wondered if GWT will be killed off as have
other Google properties, but I've been told GWT is being used heavily inside
Google, so thankfully that probably won't happen.Closure templatesare used
both Java and JavaScript to render pages server-side and in the browser. Just-
in-time JavaScript. Code is split into modules so the minimum amount of
JavaScript is loaded asynchronously in the background as necessary. Navigation

<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his
picture), in I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything,
reveals the stack used for building Google+:Our stack is pretty standard fare
for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and
JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-
source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and
template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to
maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on
hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates
server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the
JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make
it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on
stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily
most people don't run int</p><p>5 0.74399161 <a title="75-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-29-The_Three_Ages_of_Google_-_Batch%2C_Warehouse%2C_Instant.html">1107 high scalability-2011-08-29-The Three Ages of Google - Batch, Warehouse, Instant</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The world has changed. And some things that should not have been forgotten,
were lost. I found these words from the Lord of the Rings echoing in my head
as I listened to a fascinating presentation by Luiz Andre Barroso,
Distinguished Engineer at Google, concerning Google's legendary past, golden
present, and apocryphal future. His talk, Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering
the Teenage Decade, was given at theFederated Computing Research Conference.
Luiz clearly knows his stuff and was early at Google, so he has a deep and
penetrating perspective on the technology. There's much to learn from, think
about, and build.Lord of the Rings applies at two levels. At the change level,
Middle Earth went throughthree ages. While listening to Luiz talk, it seems so
has Google: Batch (indexes calculated every month), Warehouse (the datacenter
is the computer), and Instant (make it all real-time). At the "what was
forgot" level, in the Instant Age section of the talk,  a common theme was the

fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-
critical environments. Its low memory footprint (compared to other web
servers), light CPU load and its speed goals make lighttpd suitable for
servers that are suffering load problems, or for serving static media
separately from dynamic content. lighttpd is free software / open source, and
is distributed under the BSD license. lighttpd runs on GNU/Linux and other

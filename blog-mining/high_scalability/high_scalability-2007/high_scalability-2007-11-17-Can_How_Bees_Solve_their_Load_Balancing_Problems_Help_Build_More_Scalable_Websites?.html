<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure on this beautiful morning:  Group Decision
Making in Honey Bee Swarms. In distributed computing systems nodes reach
aquorum when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum
logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:
A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act
and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow
the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether
they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating
the swarm's move to this site.Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.
Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being
a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.Fire! Fire!
Brent Chapman shows how to put that IT fire out in Incident Command for IT:

<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>4 0.072659828 <a title="158-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-16-Building_Super_Scalable_Systems%3A_Blade_Runner_Meets_Autonomic_Computing_in_the_Ambient_Cloud.html">750 high scalability-2009-12-16-Building Super Scalable Systems: Blade Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I first heard an enthusiastic endorsement ofSquarespacestreaming from the
ubiquitousLeo Laporteon one of his many Twit Live shows. Squarespace as afully
hosted, completely managed environment for creating and maintaining a website,
blog or portfoliowas of interest to me because they promise scalability and
this site doesn't have enough of that. But sadly, since they don't offer a
link preserving Drupal import our relationship was not meant to be.When a fine
reader of High Scalability, Brian Egge, (and all my readers are thrifty,
brave, and strong) asked me how Squarespace scaled I said I didn't know, but I
would try and find out. I emailed Squarespace a few questions and founder
Anthony Casalena and Director of Technical Operations Rolando Berrios were
kind enough to reply in some detail. The questions were both from Brian and
myself. Answers can be found below.Two things struck me most about
Squarespace's approach:They based their system on a memory grid, in this case

<p>Introduction: Pud off*ckedcomany.com (FC) fame, a favorite site of the dot bomb era, and a
site I absolutely loved until my company became featured, has given us a look
at his backend: Why Must You Laugh At My Back End. For those whose don't
remember FC's history, TechCrunch published afitting eulogy:[FC] first went
live in 2000, chronicling failing and troubled companies in its unique and
abrasive style after the dot com bust. Within a year it had a massive audience
and was getting serious mainstream press attention. As the startup economy
became better in 2004, much of the attention the site received went away. But
a large and loyal audience remains at the site, coming back day after day for
its unique slant on the news. At its peak, FC had 4 million unique monthly
visitors.Delightfully, FC was not a real-names kind of site. Hard witty
cynicism ruled and not a single cat picture was in sight. It was a blast of
fun when all around was the enclosing dark.So when I saw Pud's post I was

Cooperation at Flickr. Insightful talk. Some highlights: Change is good if you
can build tools and culture to lower the risk of change. Operations and
developers need to become of one mind and respect each other. An automated
infrastructure is the one tool you need most. Common source control. One step
build. One step deploy. Don't be a pussy, deploy. Always ship trunk. Feature
flags - don't branch code, make features runtime configurable in code. Dark
launch - release data paths early without UI component. Shared metrics.
Adaptive feedback to prioritize important features. IRC for communication for
human context. Best solutions occur when dev and op work together and trust
each other. Trust is earned by helping each other solve their problems. Look
at what new features imply for operations, what can go wrong, and how to
recover. Provide knobs and levers to help operations. Devs should have access

email addresses. If you don't give web sites you real email address they can't
spam you. They spam Mailinator instead :-)I love design with a point-of-view
and Mailinator has a big giant harry one: performance first, second, and last.
Why? Because Mailinator is free and that allows Paul to showcase his different
perspective on design. While competitors buy big Iron to handle load, Paul
uses a big idea instead: pick the right problem and create a design to fit the</p><p>6 0.72515494 <a title="158-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-09-FaceStat%27s_Rousing_Tale_of_Scaling_Woe_and_Wisdom_Won.html">344 high scalability-2008-06-09-FaceStat's Rousing Tale of Scaling Woe and Wisdom Won</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting and still relevant research paper by Jim Gray, Prashant
Shenoy at Microsoft Research that examines the rules of thumb for the design
of data storage systems. It looks at storage, processing, and networking
costs, ratios, and trends with a particular focus on performance and
price/performance.Jim Gray has an updated presentation on this interesting
topic:Long Term Storage Trends and You. Robin Harris has a great post that
reflects on the Rules of Thumb whitepaper on his StorageMojo blog:Architecting
the Internet Data Center - Parts I-IV.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.80969346 <a title="158-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-17-Can_How_Bees_Solve_their_Load_Balancing_Problems_Help_Build_More_Scalable_Websites%3F.html">158 high scalability-2007-11-17-Can How Bees Solve their Load Balancing Problems Help Build More Scalable Websites?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bees have a similar problem to website servers: how to do a lot of work with
limited resources in an ever changing environment. Usually lessons from
biology are hard to apply to computer problems. Nature throws hardware at
problems. Billions and billions of cells cooperate at different levels of
organizations to find food, fight lions, and make sure your DNA is passed
on.Nature's software is "simple," but her hardware rocks. We do the opposite.
For us hardware is in short supply so we use limited hardware and leverage
"smart" software to work around our inability to throw hardware at problems.
But we might be able to borrow some load balancing techniques from bees. What
do bees do that we can learn from?Bees do a dance to indicate the quality and
location of a nectar source. When a bee finds a better source they do a better
dance and resources shift to the new location. This approach may seem
inefficient, but it turns out to be "optimal for the unpredictable nectar
world." Craig Tovey</p><p>3 0.7935605 <a title="158-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-30-The_AOL_XMPP_scalability_challenge.html">234 high scalability-2008-01-30-The AOL XMPP scalability challenge</a></p>

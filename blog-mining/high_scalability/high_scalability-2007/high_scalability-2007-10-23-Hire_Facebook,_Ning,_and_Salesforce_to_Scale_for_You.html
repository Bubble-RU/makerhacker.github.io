<p>Introduction: Update: Facebook pulls a Microsoft and embraces and extends by opening their platform to other social sites like Bebo. Very smart and unexpected. More info at  Facebook to let other sites access platform code .      This month's regular Facebook   Meetup   was held at Google and the topic of the day was   OpenSocial  . For those of you with real lives, OpenSocial "provides a common set of APIs for social applications across multiple websites." Over 200 excited people, hoping to do very exciting things, and dreaming of making an exciting pile of money, watched an OpenSocial presentation put on by a couple of appropriately knowledgeable evangelists. I could feel my social graph being more successfully monetized with each passing minute.      Normally the meetings are much smaller, but Google puts on a very nice spread, so I think people may have showed up to dine :-) Or they could have showed up to learn why and how they should code to the new uber social API.

<p>Introduction: Facebook has been teasing us. While many of their recent  acquisitions  have been surprising, shocking is the only word adequately describing Facebook's  5 day whirlwind acquisition  of   Oculus  , immersive virtual reality visionaries, for a now paltry sounding $2 billion.
   The    backlash    is a pandemic, jumping across    social networks    with the speed only a meme powered by the directly unaffected can generate.  
   For more than 30 years VR has been the dream burning in the heart of every science fiction fan. Now that this future might finally be here, Facebook’s ownage makes it seem like a wonderful and hopeful timeline has been choked off, killing the Metaverse before it even had a chance to begin.  
  For the many who voted for an open future with their  Kickstarter dollars , there’s a deep and personal sense of betrayal, despite Facebook’s promise to leave Oculus alone. The intensity of the reaction is because Oculus matters to people.

<p>Introduction: Aditya Agarwal, Director of Engineering at Facebook, gave an excellent  Scale at Facebook  talk that covers their architecture, but the talk is really more about how to scale an organization by preserving the best parts of its culture. The key take home of the talk is: 
  

You can get the code right, you can get the products right, but you need to get the culture right first. If you don't get the culture right then your company won't scale.

  
This leads into the four meta secrets of scaling at Facebook:
  
 Scaling takes Iteration 
 Don't Over Design 
 Choose the right tool for the job, but realize that your choice comes with overhead. 
 Get the culture right. Move Fast - break things. Huge Impact - small teams. Be bold - innovate. 
      Some Background    
  Facebook is big : 400 million active users; users spend an average of 20 minutes a day; 5 billion pieces of content (status updates, comments, likes, photo uploads, video uploads, chat messages, inbox messages, group events, f</p><p>5 0.80131525 <a title="129-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-20-75%25_Chance_of_Scale_-_Leveraging_the_New_Scaleogenic_Environment_for_Growth.html">976 high scalability-2011-01-20-75% Chance of Scale - Leveraging the New Scaleogenic Environment for Growth</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "I'll never need to scale so why bother? We aren't Twitter or Facebook or Google after all." This is the most common email I get, a question in the form of a thinly disguised rationalization for not having to worry about scaling. And in these days of giant transformer-like machines they are probably right. But what if there are  Barry Bonds  enhancing type forces at work that argue for the chances of your needing to scale being higher than you think?
 
And if that happens, how will you cross the scalability chasm? Will you want to completely change your architecture or evolve it from a tool-chain that was meant to scale from the start? Architecturally, that's the question you have to answer. Today's tool-chains are making it possible to grow a system from small to large without needing to implement complete architectural phase changes at various scale inflection points, but that's a different topic. We're trying to think about why you may actually need to scale, that is the question.</p><p>6 0.80026716 <a title="129-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-23-Facebook_Secrets_of_Web_Performance.html">1444 high scalability-2013-04-23-Facebook Secrets of Web Performance</a></p>

  Group Decision Making in Honey Bee Swarms . In distributed computing systems nodes reach a  quorum  when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:   A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating the swarm's move to this site.  Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.   Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO of  Parallel Universe , a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time applications. 
 
A little over a month ago, we open-sourced a new in-memory data grid called  Galaxy . An in-memory data grid, or IMDG, is a clustered data storage and processing middleware that uses RAM as the authoritative and primary storage, and distributes data over a cluster for purposes of data and processing scalability and high-availability. A common feature of IMDGs is co-location of code and data, meaning that application code runs on all cluster nodes, each instance processing those data items residing in the local node's RAM.
 
While quite a few commercial and open-source IMDGs are available (like Terracotta, Gigaspaces, Oracle Coherence, GemFire, Websphere eXtreme Scale, Infinispan and Hazelcast), Galaxy has adopted a completely different architecture from all other IMDGs, to service some usage scenarios ill-fitted to the othe</p><p>same-blog 3 0.94511759 <a title="129-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-23-Hire_Facebook%2C_Ning%2C_and_Salesforce_to_Scale_for_You.html">129 high scalability-2007-10-23-Hire Facebook, Ning, and Salesforce to Scale for You</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the premier scaling strategies is always: get someone else to do the work for you.  But unlike Huckleberry Finn in  Tom Sawyer , you won't have to trick anyone into whitewashing a fence for you. Times have changed. Companies like  Ning ,  Facebook , and  Salesforce  are more than happy to help. Their price: lock-in.   Previously you had few options when building a "real" website. You needed to do everything yourself. Infrastructure and application were all yours. Then companies stepped in by commoditizing parts of the infrastructure, but the application was still yours. The next step is full on Borg take no prisoners assimilation where the infrastructure and application are built as one collective. What you have to decide as someone faced with building a scalable website is if these new options are worth the price.
 
Feeding this explosion of choice is one of the new strategy games on the intertubes: the Internet Platform Game.

<p>Introduction: From their website:   Condor  is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial or parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user upon completion.  While providing functionality similar to that of a more traditional batch queueing system, Condor's novel architecture allows it to succeed in areas where traditional scheduling systems fail. Condor can be used to manage a cluster of dedicated compute nodes (such as a "Beowulf" cluster). In addition, unique mechanisms enable Condor to effectively harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop workstations. For instance, Condor can be configured to only use desktop machines where the keyboard</p><p>5 0.9195044 <a title="129-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-09-10-Russ%E2%80%99_10_Ingredient_Recipe_for_Making_1_Million_TPS_on_%245K_Hardware.html">1319 high scalability-2012-09-10-Russ’ 10 Ingredient Recipe for Making 1 Million TPS on $5K Hardware</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My name is  Russell Sullivan , I am the author of AlchemyDB: a highly flexible NoSQL/SQL/DocumentStore/GraphDB-datastore built on top of redis. I have spent the last several years trying to find a way to sanely house multiple datastore-genres under one roof while (almost paradoxically) pushing performance to its limits.    I recently joined the NoSQL company    Aerospike    (formerly Citrusleaf) with the goal of incrementally grafting AlchemyDB’s flexible data-modeling capabilities onto Aerospike’s high-velocity horizontally-scalable key-value data-fabric. We recently completed a peak-performance    TPS optimization project   : starting at 200K TPS, pushing to the recent community edition launch at 500K TPS, and finally arriving at our 2012 goal:    1M TPS on $5K hardware   .    Getting to one million over-the-wire client-server database-requests per-second on a single machine costing $5K is a balance between trimming overhead on many axes and using a shared nothing architecture to   i</p><p>6 0.91328013 <a title="129-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-02-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_2%2C_2010.html">851 high scalability-2010-07-02-Hot Scalability Links for July 2, 2010</a></p>

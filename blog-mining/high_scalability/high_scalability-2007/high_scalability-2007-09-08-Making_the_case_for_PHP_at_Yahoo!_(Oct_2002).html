<p>Introduction: The article describes the basic architecture of a connection-oriented NIO-based java server.

<p>Introduction: eAccelerator  is a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them in their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost completely eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their execution. eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.</p><p>4 0.11232872 <a title="85-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-12-09-Site_Moves_from_PHP_to_Facebook%27s_HipHop%2C_Now_Pages_Load_in_.6_Seconds_Instead_of_Five.html">1561 high scalability-2013-12-09-Site Moves from PHP to Facebook's HipHop, Now Pages Load in .6 Seconds Instead of Five</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you code in PHP have you ever wondered about moving to Facebook's  HipHop JIT Virtual Machine for PHP ? With HipHop Facebook achieved over a 9x increase in web request throughput and over a 5x reduction in memory consumption compared to Zend PHP 5.2 engine + APC.
 
But will HipHop really work for you? Is it really drop-in compatible? Is it really as fast as they say?
 
To answer questions like this nothing beats a good experience report and here's a great one:  Adventures in Configuring and Running Facebook's HipHopVM (hhvm) JIT Compiler for PHP  by Yermo Lamers.
 
Yermo selected PHP to implement a number of content web sites. He took an interesting approach, he created a forms, views, validation, and business logic description language to remove the drudgery of creating the same code over and over again for each page. Having done this in Perl I think it's a great a approach. The problem is it can be slow.

<p>Introduction: This Sun BluePrint article describes the storage architecture of the Tokyo Institute of Technology TSUBAME grid. The Tokyo Institute of Technology is of the world's leading technical institutes, and recently created the fastest supercomputer in Asia, and one of the largest supercomputers outside of the United States. By deploying Sun Fire x64 servers and data servers in a grid architecture, Tokyo Tech built a cost-effective and flexible supercomputer consisting of hundreds of systems, thousands of processors, terabytes of memory and a petabyte of storage that supports users running common off-the-shelf applications. This is the second of a three-article series. It describes the steps to install and configuring the Lustre file system within the storage architecture.</p><p>6 0.10161039 <a title="85-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-DB2_Express-C.html">320 high scalability-2008-05-17-DB2 Express-C</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update :   Speed up Apache - how I went from F to A in YSlow .  Good example of using YSlow to speed up a website with solid code examples.  Every layer in the multi-layer cake that is your website contributes to how long a page takes to display.  YSlow , from Yahoo, is a cool tool for discovering how the ingredients of your site's top layer contribute to performance.
 
YSlow analyzes web pages and tells you why they're slow based on the rules for high performance web sites. YSlow is a Firefox add-on integrated with the popular Firebug web development tool.   YSlow gives you:

<p>Introduction: Professor  David Malan  gives a very good lecture on scalability for dynamic websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high availability.

This is one lecture in a series of 13 lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to:  build dynamic websites  with  Ajax  and with  Linux ,  Apache ,  MySQL , and  PHP  ( LAMP ); set up  domain names  with  DNS ;  structure pages  with  XHTML  and  CSS  how to  program  in  JavaScript  and  PHP ;  configure Apache and  MySQL ; design and  query databases  with  SQL ; use  Ajax  with both  XML  and JSON ;</p><p>4 0.86818671 <a title="85-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-05-Paper%3A_MillWheel%3A_Fault-Tolerant_Stream_Processing_at_Internet_Scale.html">1512 high scalability-2013-09-05-Paper: MillWheel: Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ever wonder what powers Google's world spirit sensing  Zeitgeist service ? No, it's not a homunculus of  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel  sitting in each browser. It's actually a stream processing (think streaming MapReduce on steroids) system called MillWheel, described in this very well written paper:  MillWheel: Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale . MillWheel isn't just used for Zeitgeist at Google, it's also used for streaming joins for a variety of Ads customers, generalized anomaly-detection service, and network switch and cluster health monitoring.
 
Abstract:
  MillWheel is a framework for building low-latency data-processing applications that is widely used at Google. Users specify a directed computation graph and application code for individual nodes, and the system manages persistent state and the continuous ﬂow of records, all within the envelope of the framework’s fault-tolerance guarantees.

 


This paper describes MillWheel’s programming model as well as it</p><p>5 0.86809963 <a title="85-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-16-ThePort__Network__Architecture.html">682 high scalability-2009-08-16-ThePort  Network  Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: ThePort Network's Director of Engineering, TJ Muehleman was kind of enough to share some of the architectural details for their white label social media system. It currently runs about 50 social networks varying in size from less than 1000 members to more than 300,000 members, all on a Microsoft stack. In addition to their social networking platform, they offer Javascript APIs and web service APIs (both REST and SOAP) which account for a significant percentage of overall system usage.  ThePort is an excellent example of a real world in-the-trenches product offering real value to customers.  One of the most interesting problems they have to solve is multi-tenancy. How do you provide good performance, complete customization, support, develop new features, and provide individual search indexes for each customer? It's not an easy problem to solve.  How did they solve their problems and build a successful system?

<p>Introduction: Not sure if this is the right place to post this but here goes anyway.We are
looking to hire an outside firm to help with development of a scalable and
potentially high-traffic web site. We are not looking for an individual but
rather a firm with enough well rounded expertise to help us with various
aspects of this.Basic requirements:LAMP stack or other open source
solutionVery proficient in cross-browser web developmentFlex/AIR development
for RIAJava/C/C++ proficiencyExpertise with Comet and push server
technologyExperience with development of high-traffic web sitesUse of Amazon
Web Services infrastructure a plusIf anyone knows of consulting firms that can
take on such a project, I would appreciate your feedback.TIA</p><p>5 0.12764029 <a title="90-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-SSL_RPC_API_Scalability.html">620 high scalability-2009-06-05-SSL RPC API Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all!So nice to start discussing cool things in this even cooler forum :)I
am having a problem .. which i believe is already solved but i would love
someone confirming actual experience with the same topic.We are building a
client / server architecture, consisting of a web server part and many
clients.Transport will be provided as either XML-RPC / SOAP / JSON or all at
once.All of the communication has to be encrypted and passed within SSL3.We
expect a high load when the application starts (> 2000 concurrent
requests).Combine this with xml parsing for the rpc api, things really look
ugly :)So it's a big mess :)It will not be that much database bound behind the
api - mostly files will be transferred from the server to the clients and
simple api for control.So it's pretty much a matter of 'what-to-do-with-ssl'.I
was thinking of hardware - NetApp or a similar application accelerator.Can
anyone give examples of a hardware piece that combines: Load balancer / SSL
accelerator?I have also b</p><p>6 0.12735426 <a title="90-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-20-what_is_j2ee_stack.html">162 high scalability-2007-11-20-what is j2ee stack</a></p>

Computing technologies exchange ideas. With the rapid change occurring in the
industry, we need a place we can meet to share our experiences, challenges and
solutions. At CloudCamp, you are encouraged you to share your thoughts in
several open discussions, as we strive for the advancement of Cloud Computing.
End users, IT professionals and vendors are all encouraged to

<p>Introduction: With a new Planet of the Apes coming out, this may be a touchy subject with
our new overlords, but Netflix is using a whole lot more trouble injecting
monkeys to test and iteratively harden their systems. We learned previously
how Netflix used Chaos Monkey, a tool to test failover handling by
continuously failing EC2 nodes. That was just a start. More monkeys have been
added to the barrel. Node failure is just one problem in a system. Imagine a
problem and you can imagine creating a monkey to test if your system is
handling that problem properly. Yury Izrailevsky talks about just this
approach in this very interesting post: The Netflix Simian Army.I know what
you are thinking, if monkeys are so great then why has Netflix been down
lately. Dmuino addressedthis potential embarrassment, putting all fears of
cloud inferiority to rest:Unfortunately we're not running 100% on the cloud
today. We're working on it, and we could use more help. The latest outage was

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Edberg gave a talk on Scaling Reddit from 1 Million to 1 Billion-
Pitfalls and Lessons andone of the issuesthey had was that they:Did not
account for increased latency after moving to EC2. In the datacenter they had
submillisecond access between machines so it was possible to make a 1000 calls
to memache for one page load. Not so on EC2. Memcache access times increased
10x to a millisecond which made their old approach unusable. Fix was to batch
calls to memcache so a large number of gets are in one request.Dave Pacheco
had aninteresting questionabout batching requests and its impact on latency:I
was confused about the memcached problem after moving to the cloud. I
understand why network latency may have gone from submillisecond to
milliseconds, but how could you improve latency by batching requests?
Shouldn't that improve efficiency, not latency, at the possible expense of
latency (since some requests will wait on the client as they get batched)?
Jeremy cleared it up by saying:</p><p>5 0.25180712 <a title="90-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-14-Ask_HS%3A_Design_and_Implementation_of_scalable_services%3F.html">1578 high scalability-2014-01-14-Ask HS: Design and Implementation of scalable services?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We have written agents deployed/distributed across the network. Agents sends
data every 15 Secs may be even 5 secs. Working on a service/system to which
all agent can post data/tuples with marginal payload. Upto 5% drop rate is
acceptable. Ultimately the data will be segregated and stored into DBMS System
(currently we are using MSQL).Question(s) I am looking for answer1.
Client/Server Communication: Agent(s) can post data. Status of sending data is
not that important. But there is a remote where Agent(s) to be notified if the
server side system generates an event based on the data sent.- Lot of advices
from internet suggests using Message Bus (ActiveMQ) for async communication.
Multicast and UDP are the alternatives.2. Persistence: After some evaluation
data to be stored in DBMS System.- End of processing data is an aggregated
record for which MySql looks scalable. But on the volume of data is
exponential. Considering HBase as an option.Looking if there are any

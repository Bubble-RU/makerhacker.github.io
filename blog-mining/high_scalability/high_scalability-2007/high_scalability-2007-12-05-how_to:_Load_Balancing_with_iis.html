<p>Introduction: Hello all,  I'm working on a web site that might totally flop or it might explode to be the next facebook/flickr/digg/etc. Since I really don't know how popular the site will be I don't want to spend a ton of money on the hardware/hosting right away but I want to be able to scale it easily if it does grow rapidly. With this in mind, what would be the best approach to launch the site?  Thanks, Dan</p><p>3 0.18810976 <a title="175-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-01-Statistics_Logging_Scalability.html">105 high scalability-2007-10-01-Statistics Logging Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My company is developing a centralized web platform to service our clients.  We currently use about 3Mb/s on our uplink at our ISP serving web pages for about 100 clients.  We'd like to offer them statistics that mean something to their businesses and have been contemplating writing our own statistics code to handle the task.     All statistics would be gathered at the page view level and we're implementing a HttpModule in ASP.Net 2.0 to handle the gather of the data.  That said, I'm curious to hear comments on writing this data (~500 bytes of log data/page request).  We need to write this data somewhere and then build a process to aggregate the data into a warehouse application used in our reporting system.  Google Analytics is out of the question because we do not want our hosting infrastructure dependant upon a remote server.  Web Trends et al. are too expensive for our clients.     I'm thinking of a couple of options.   1) Writing log data directly to a SQL Server 2000 db and havin</p><p>4 0.1830737 <a title="175-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-10-1_Master%2C_N_Slaves.html">178 high scalability-2007-12-10-1 Master, N Slaves</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello all,     Reading the site you can note that "1 Master for writes, N Slaves for reads" scheme is used offen.     How is this implemented? Who decides where writes and reads go? Something in application level or specific database proxies, like Slony-I?

<p>Introduction: OK,     I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll ask here.     Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application" that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server" when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.     The normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let</p><p>4 0.6865012 <a title="175-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A site I'm working with has an I/O bottleneck.     They're using a static server to deliver all of the pictures/video content/zip downloads ecetera but now that the bandwith out of that server is approaching 50Mbit/second the latency on serving small files has increased to become unacceptable.     I'm curious how other people have dealt with this situation.     Seperating into two different servers would require a significant change to the sites architecutre (because the premise is that all uploads go into one server, all subdirectorie are created in one directory, etc.) and may not really solve the problem.</p><p>6 0.66272712 <a title="175-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-15-starting_small_with_growth_in_mind.html">632 high scalability-2009-06-15-starting small with growth in mind</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in terms of scalability. The  paper  describes a new technology by the startup company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction of the cost of earlier possibilities.  Complete Genomics is building the worldâ&euro;&trade;s largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey, outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.  By 2010, their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30 petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.

<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something called   Self Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance   (SCIT).  Botnets  are created when vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks like a  dog chasing its tail ). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a great deal of sense once I thought about it.  With SCIT you stop and restart VM instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window vulnerability)....
   
 This short exposure window means worms and viri do not have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack. A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM</p><p>4 0.37331489 <a title="175-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-01-Myth%3A_Eric_Brewer_on_Why_Banks_are_BASE_Not_ACID_-_Availability_Is_Revenue_.html">1450 high scalability-2013-05-01-Myth: Eric Brewer on Why Banks are BASE Not ACID - Availability Is Revenue </a></p>
<p>Introduction: In   NoSQL: Past, Present, Future    Eric Brewer  has a particularly fine section on explaining the often hard to understand ideas of   BASE   (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent),   ACID   (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability),   CAP   (Consistency Availability, Partition Tolerance), in terms of a pernicious long standing myth about the sanctity of consistency in banking.
    Myth   : Money is important, so banks   must   use transactions to keep money safe and consistent, right? 
    Reality   : Banking transactions are inconsistent, particularly for ATMs. ATMs are designed to have a normal case behaviour and a partition mode behaviour. In partition mode Availability is chosen over Consistency. 
   Why?   1)  Availability correlates with revenue and consistency generally does not.  2)  Historically there was never an idea of perfect communication so everything was partitioned.
   Your ATM transaction must go through so Availability is more important than</p><p>5 0.36597562 <a title="175-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Product%3A_Cacti.html">58 high scalability-2007-08-04-Product: Cacti</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cacti  is a network statistics graphing tool designed as a frontend to RRDtool's data storage and graphing functionality. It is intended to be intuitive and easy to use, as well as robust and scalable. It is generally used to graph time-series data like CPU load and bandwidth use.  The frontend is written in PHP; it can handle multiple users, each with their own graph sets, so it is sometimes used by web hosting providers (especially dedicated server, virtual private server, and colocation providers) to display bandwidth statistics for their customers. It can be used to configure the data collection itself, allowing certain setups to be monitored without any manual configuration of RRDtool.</p><p>6 0.3456282 <a title="175-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy%3A_Efficiently_Geo-referencing_IPs.html">168 high scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy: Efficiently Geo-referencing IPs</a></p>

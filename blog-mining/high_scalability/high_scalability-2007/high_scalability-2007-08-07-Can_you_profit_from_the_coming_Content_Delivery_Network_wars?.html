traffic over last year; medium size customers are seeing 48% traffic growth,
small sized customer are seeing 73.3% traffic growth.More traffic != More

<p>Introduction: Limelight says 95% of Mobile Video Views Take Place in First 90 Days and 88.8
percent of views take place in the first 30 days.Since a lot of people are
working with video, which is expensive to store and serve, the implication:
there's little need to keep your video close to the user or on a CDN after 30
days.</p><p>5 0.15325603 <a title="60-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-18-Paper%3A_The_Akamai_Network_-_61%2C000_servers%2C_1%2C000__networks%2C_70_countries_.html">1100 high scalability-2011-08-18-Paper: The Akamai Network - 61,000 servers, 1,000  networks, 70 countries </a></p>

nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide, the Akamai platform delivers
hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily, helping thousands of
enterprises boost the performance and reliability of their Internet

<p>Introduction: All,I'm just new to this and have a basic understanding how CDN works? My
questions are:1. How does CDN sync data with web servers for video/images? If
I have a user to upload a video to my site, will it get stored directly in CDN
or it comes to my webserver first and then sync-ed with cache server?2. How to
have only the dynamic video/image delivered through CDN while the rest is
served by a webserver?3. How sync happens and who pays for the bandwidth for
sync?I'd appreciate if someone could explain this.Regards,Janakan Rajendran</p><p>5 0.80647641 <a title="60-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting_and_CDN_for_startup_video_sharing_site.html">181 high scalability-2007-12-11-Hosting and CDN for startup video sharing site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novicexI am starting
a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality
possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).I have done some
research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I
have some basic knowledge on these.Following are my requirements1) My budget
is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).2)
I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first
2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And
more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)3)
90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.Based on the above,
could you please answer my following questions?1) Can I go with just a good
dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site
gets big? Or do you think its wise to start with a CDN service?2) Should I</p><p>6 0.74162257 <a title="60-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy%3A_Put_Mobile_Video_Into_Cold_Storage_After_30_Days.html">1201 high scalability-2012-02-29-Strategy: Put Mobile Video Into Cold Storage After 30 Days</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Playing like the big boys may be getting cheaper. The big boys, likeYouTube,
farm the serving of their most popular videos to a third party CDN. A lot of
people were surprised YouTube didn't serve all their content themselves, but
it makes sense. It allows them to keep up with demand without a large hit for
infrastructure build out, much like leasing computers instead of buying
them.breakThe problem has been CDNs are expensive. Om Malik reports inAkamai &
the CDN Price Warsthat may be changing. CDN service could be becoming
affordable enough that you might consider using them as part of your scaling
strategy.Akamai, once the clear leader in the CDN field, is facing strong
competition from the likes of Limelight Networks, Level 3, Internap,
CDNetworks, Panther Express and EdgeCast Networks.Thiscommoditizationmay be
bad for their stock prices, but it's good for website builders looking for new
scaling strategies. EdgeCast, for example, passes on the cost savings when
when their bandwidth</p><p>2 0.82688713 <a title="60-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-16-Product%3A_Func_-_Fedora_Unified_Network_Controller.html">385 high scalability-2008-09-16-Product: Func - Fedora Unified Network Controller</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Funcis used to manage a large network using bash or Python scripts. It targets
easy and simple remote scripting and one-off tasks over SSH by creating a
secure (SSL certifications) XMLRPC API for communication. Any kind of
application can be written on top of it. Other configuration management tools
specialize in mass configuration. They say here's what the machine should look
like and keep it that way. Func allows you to program your cluster. If you've
ever tried to securely remote script a gang of machines using SSH keys you
know what a total nightmare that can be.Some example commands:Using the
command line:func "*.example.org" call yumcmd updateUsing the Pthon API:import
func.overlord.client as fcclient = fc.Client("*.example.org;*.example.com")cli
ent.yumcmd.update()client.service.start("acme-server")print
client.hardware.info()Func may certainly overlap in functionality with other
tools like Puppet and cfengine, but as programmers we always need more than
one way to do it and def</p><p>3 0.80992854 <a title="60-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson_from_Airbnb%3A_Give_Yourself_Permission_to_Experiment_with_Non-scalable_Changes.html">1458 high scalability-2013-05-15-Lesson from Airbnb: Give Yourself Permission to Experiment with Non-scalable Changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are stuck drowning in too much data and too many options and are
dazzled by all the possibilities of code, here's a helpful bit of advice from
Airbnb's rags to richesorigin story:it's okay to do things that don't scale. A
corollary is the idea of paying attention to and learning from what your users
are actually doing and let that lead you without out that annoying voice in
your head second guessing you, yelling but that will never scale! Worry about
building something good, then worry about making it scale.In Airbnb's case
they noticed people weren't booking rooms because the pictures sucked. So they
flew to New York and shot some beautiful images. This is a very non-scalable
and non-technical solution. Yet it was the turning point for Airbnb and
sparked their climb out of the "trough of sorrow." Previously they had been
limited by the Silicon Valley idea that every feature had to be scalable. Not
every solution can be found behind a computer screen.For the full story please

<p>Introduction: Kevin Clark, director of IT operations for Lucasfilm, discusses how their data
center works:* Linux-based platform, SUSE (looking to change), and a lot of
proprietary open source applications for content creation.* 4,500-processor
render farm in the datacenter. Workstations are used off hours.* Developed
their own proprietary scheduler to schedule their 5,500 available processors.*
Render nodes, the blade racks (from Verari), run dual-core dual Opteron chips
with 32GB of memory on board, but are expanding those to quad-core. Are an AMD
shop.* 400TB of storage online for production.* Every night they write out
10-20TB of new data on a render. A project will use up to a hundred-plus
terabytes of storage.* Incremental backups are a challenge because the data
changes up to 50 percent over a week.* NetApps used for storage. They like the
global namespace in the virtual file system.* Foundry Networks architecture

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Frederic Faure (architect at Ysance), you can follow
him on twitter.Urbandiveis an immersive view service launched by theFrench
YellowPageswhich allows you to travel in cities in France thanks to a 360°
view. Urbandive focuses on providing high definition pictures and accurate
professional and social content. One of the biggest jobs was to enable a fast
scalable architecture, because it was really difficult to forecast the traffic
load at production time. Traffic load may be influenced if the service
receives attention from users as a result of advertising.Below you will find a
summary of the goals we achieve by using a Ruby scheduler built on top
ofPuppetonAWSto create a complete infrastructure.Workflow & XTR-LucidOur
scalability combo is : a home-made Ruby scheduler (XTR-Lucid) to deal with AWS
APIs + the Puppet Master to install services and configure EC2 instances and
keep them up-to-date during all the production time. This leads to full
automation.Here is</p><p>6 0.73937023 <a title="60-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-02-How_Will_DIDO_Wireless_Networking_Change_Everything%3F.html">1091 high scalability-2011-08-02-How Will DIDO Wireless Networking Change Everything?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scale-Out is incrementally adding servers as needed to scale rather than
buying larger servers. Here's the MySQL idea of what ascale-out architecture
lookslike:ThisMySQL articlelists 5 problems to avoid when scaling out:Don't
Think Synchronously. Introduce asynchronous communication, parallelization,
and strategies to deal with approximate or slightly outdated data.Don't Think
Vertically.  Scaling by bigger machines won't work. Plan on horizontal scaling
and asynchronous architectures form the start which make it easy to add
capacity on demand.Don't Mix Transactions with Business
Intelligence.Transactions and analytics are inherently different. Separate out
different types of data onto different databases.Avoid Mixing Hot and Cold
Data.Static and fast changing data are inherently different. Separate out
different types of data onto different databases.Don't Forget the Power of
Memory.  Make data accessible in RAM by smartly partitioning data across
servers.More information atScale-Out</p><p>4 0.12454572 <a title="142-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-19-Tailrank_Architecture_-_Learn_How_to_Track_Memes_Across_the_Entire_Blogosphere.html">160 high scalability-2007-11-19-Tailrank Architecture - Learn How to Track Memes Across the Entire Blogosphere</a></p>

Tailrank finds the internet's hottest channels by indexing over 24M weblogs
and feeds per hour. That's 52TB of raw blog content (no, not sewage) a month
and requires continuously processing 160Mbits of IO. How do they do that?This
is an email interview with Kevin Burton, founder and CEO of Tailrank.com.
Kevin was kind enough to take the time to explain how they scale to index the
entire blogosphere.SitesTailrank- We track the hottest news in the

mean several things. Most developers are primarily concerned with are response
time and scalability. Response TimeIs the time taken by web application to
process request and return response. Applications should respond to requests
(response time) within acceptable duration. If application is taking beyond
the acceptable time, it is said to be non-performing or degraded.

<p>Introduction: Jeremy Zawodny, while performing data alchemy in the dungeons of Craigslist,
stored1,250,000,000 Key/Value Pairs in Redis on a 32GB Machine.Data sorting
world record: 1 terabyte, 1 minute. The system has 52 computer nodes, each
node is a commodity server with two quad-core processors, 24 gigabytes (GB)
memory and sixteen 500 GB disks. It's not just hardware though, they also
built a software that utilized all their CPU and RAM.Tweets of Gold:wm: I am
really getting the sense that none of you yokels waxing profound about
scalability actually has anything factual to sayjoestump: I think you can do
things to *mitigate* pain points up front. You don't need to over-engineer,
but it's not hard to look forward.danielcrenna: I love it when I check in

<p>Introduction: There are so many architectural ideas swirling in the bit wind these days. Two
of the biggest battles are cloud vs. bare metal and RAM vs. disk vs. SSD.
37signals has published two solid articles that are counter hype cycle in
their message:Technologists who grew up when RAM cost $1,000 per megabyte can
have a hard time dealing with the luxury of RAM being virtually free.The
progress of technology is throwing an ever greater number of optimizations
into the "premature evil" bucket never to be seen again.37signals made quite a
stir with their money shot of the864GB of RAM they bought for a mere $12Kas
part of their caching layer for Basecamp. That's a lot of memory for not a lot
of money. There's nothing like actually seeing it in the flesh to bring the
point home. Does that makeMemory Based Architecturesa little more
appealing?37signals then followed up with another provocative article:Three
years later, Mr. Moore is still letting us punt on database sharding. The gist
is scaling up is</p><p>4 0.70604622 <a title="142-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-13-Is_premature_scalation_a_real_disease%3F.html">185 high scalability-2007-12-13-Is premature scalation a real disease?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3: InfoQ'sBig Architecture Up Front - A Case of Premature
Scalaculation?twines several different threads on the topic together into a
fine noose.Update 2: Kevin says thebiggest problems he sees with startups is
they need to scaletheir backend (no, the other one).Update: My bad.It's hard
to sell scalabilityso just forget it.The premise ofStartups and The Problem Of
Premature ScalaculationandDonâ&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Martis that
you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before
you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful
enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied
life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites
siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its
best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?If I ever believed this I
certainly don't believe it anymore. The world has changed, even since

<p>Introduction: Jeremiah Peschka with a great a set ofNotes on Scalability, just in case you
do reach your wildest expectations of success:Build it to Break. Plan for the
fact that everything you make is going to break. Design in layers that are
independent and redundant.Everything is a Feature. Your application is a set
of features created by a series of conscious choices made by considering
trade-offs. Scale Out, Not Up. Purchasing more hardware is easier than coding
and managing horizontal resources. Buy More Storage. Large numbers of smaller,
faster drives have more IOPS than fewer, larger drives.You're Going to Do It
Wrong. Be prepared to iterate on your ideas. You will make mistakes.  Be
prepared to re-write code and to quickly move on to the next idea.Please read

<p>Introduction: My favorite kind of histories are those told from an insider's perspective.
The story of Richard the Lionheart is full of great battles and dynastic
intrigue. The story of one of his soldiers, not so much. Yet the soldiers'
story, as someone who has experienced the real consequences of decisions made
and actions taken, is more revealing.We get such a history in Chat Wars, a
wonderful article written by David Auerbach, who in 1998 worked at Microsoft
on MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft's instant messaging app (for a related
story see The Rise and Fall of AIM, the Breakthrough AOL Never Wanted).It's as
if Herodotus visited Microsoft and wrote down his experiences. It has that
same sort of conversational tone, insightful on-the-ground observations, and
facts no outsider might ever believe.Much of the article is a play-by-play
account of the cat and mouse game David plays changing Messenger to track
AOL's Instant Messenger protocol changes. AOL repeatedly tried to make it so

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byAli Khajeh-Hosseini, Technical Lead atPlanForCloud. The
original article was publishedon their site. With 29 cloud price reductions I
thought it would be interesting to see how the bottom line would change
compared to an articlewe published last year. The result is surprisingly
little for TripAdvisor because prices for On Demand instances havenot dropped
as fastas for other other instances types.Over the last year and a half,we
counted 29 price reductionsin cloud services provided by AWS, Google Compute
Engine, Windows Azure, and Rackspace Cloud. Price reductions have a direct
effect on cloud users, but given the usual tiny reductions, how significant is
that effect on the bottom line?Last year I wrote aboutcloud cost forecasts for
TripAdvisor and Pinterest.TripAdvisor was experimenting with AWSand attempted
to process 700K HTTP requests per minute on a replica of its live site,
andPinterest was growing massively on AWS. In the wake of the cloud providers'

<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

<p>Introduction: The folks atEvernote were kind enough to write up an overview of their
architecture in a post titled Architectural Digest. Dave Engberg describes
their approach to networking, sharding, user storage, search, and some other
custom services.Evernote is a cool application, partially realizingVannevar
Bush's amazing visionof a memex. Wikipedia describes Evernote's features
succinctly: Evernote is a suite of software and services designed for
notetaking and archiving. A "note" can be a piece of formattable text, a full
webpage or webpage excerpt, a photograph, a voice memo, or a handwritten "ink"
note. Notes can also have file attachments. Notes can then be sorted into
folders, tagged, annotated, edited, given comments, and searched. Evernote
supports a number of operating system platforms (including Android, Mac OS X,
iOS, Microsoft Windows and WebOS), and also offers online synchronization and
backup services.Key here is that Evernote stores a lot of data, that must be
searched, and synce</p><p>5 0.93858093 <a title="142-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-28-Strategy%3A_Solve_Only_80_Percent_of_the_Problem.html">689 high scalability-2009-08-28-Strategy: Solve Only 80 Percent of the Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Solve only 80% of a problem. That's usually good enough and you'll not only
get done faster, you'll actually have a chance of getting done at all.This
strategy is given by Amix inHOW TWITTER (AND FACEBOOK) SOLVE PROBLEMS
PARTIALLY. The idea is solving 100% of a complex problem can be so hard and so
expensive that you'll end up wasting all your bullets on a problem that could
have been satisfactoraly solved in a much simpler way.The example given is for
Twitter's real-time search. Real-time search almost by definition is focussed
on recent events. So in the design should you be able to search historically
back from the beginning of time or should you just be able to search for
recent time periods? A complete historical search is the 100% solution. The
recent data only search is the 80% solution. Which should you choose?breakThe
100% solution is dramatically more difficult to solve. It requires searching
disk in real-time which is a killer. So it makes more sense to work on the 80%

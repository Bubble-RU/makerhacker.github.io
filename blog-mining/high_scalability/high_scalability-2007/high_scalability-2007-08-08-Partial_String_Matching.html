<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all shards.     There are a few different ways we can accomplish uniqueness of row keys across a shard cluster. Each has its pro’s and con’s and the one chosen should be specific to the problems you’re trying to solve.</p><p>3 0.13947389 <a title="62-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-11-At_Scale_Even_Little_Wins_Pay_Off_Big_-_Google_and_Facebook_Examples.html">1404 high scalability-2013-02-11-At Scale Even Little Wins Pay Off Big - Google and Facebook Examples</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There's a popular line of thought that says don't waste time on optimization because developing features is more important than saving money. True, you can always add resources, but at some point, especially in a more mature part of a product lifecycle: performance equals $$$.   Two great examples of this evolution come from Facebook and Google. The upshot is that when you spend time and money on optimizing your tool chain you can get huge wins in performance, control, and costs. Certainly, don’t bother if you are just starting, but at some point you may want to switch to big development efforts in improving efficiency.

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've accumulated quite a rag tag collection of personal systems scattered wide across a galaxy of different servers. For the past month I've been on a quest to rationalize this conglomeration by moving everything to a managed service of one kind or another. The goal: lift a load of worry from my mind. I like to do my own stuff my self so I learn something and have control. Control always comes with headaches and it was time for a little aspirin. As part of the process GAE came in handy as a host for a few Twitter related scripts I couldn't manage to run  anywhere else. I recoded my simple little scripts into Python/GAE and learned a lot in the process.       In the move I exported HighScalability from a VPS and imported it into a shared hosting service. I could never quite configure Apache and MySQL well enough that they wouldn't spike memory periodically and crash the VPS. And since a memory crash did not automatically restarted it was unacceptable. I also wrote a scrip</p><p>5 0.11165792 <a title="62-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-07-Using_ThreadLocal_to_pass_context_information_around_in_web_applications.html">115 high scalability-2007-10-07-Using ThreadLocal to pass context information around in web applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,     In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought is   class ReferenceIdGenerator {   public static setReferenceId(String login) {      threadLocal.set(login + System.currentMillis());   }     public static String getReferenceId() {     return threadLocal.get();   }   private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =       new ThreadLocal();       }     class MySevlet {     void service(.....) {       HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);      String userId = session.get("userId");          ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId</p><p>6 0.10485667 <a title="62-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL_clustering_strategies_and_comparisions.html">196 high scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL clustering strategies and comparisions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!, maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life environments. And you</p><p>3 0.78605187 <a title="62-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL_clustering_strategies_and_comparisions.html">196 high scalability-2007-12-30-MySQL clustering strategies and comparisions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What will the version of the Internet that follows us to the stars look like? Yes, people are really thinking seriously about this sort of thing. Specifically the  InterPlanetary Networking Special Interest Group  (IPNSIG).
 
 
 
 Ansible-like  faster-than-light communication it isn't. There's no magical warp drive. Nor is a network of telepaths acting as a 'verse spanning telegraph system.
 
It's more mundane than that. And in many ways more interesting as it's sort of like the old Internet on steroids, the one that was based on on UUCP and dial-up connections, but over vastly longer distances and with much  longer delays :
  

The Interplanetary Internet (based on IPN, also called InterPlaNet) is a conceived computer network in space, consisting of a set of network nodes which can communicate with each other.[1][2] Communication would be greatly delayed by the great interplanetary distances, so the IPN needs a new set of protocols and technology that are tolerant to large delays and</p><p>5 0.40289727 <a title="62-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala_-_P2P_Online_Storage_Cloud.html">368 high scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala - P2P Online Storage Cloud</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you design a reliable distributed file system when the expected availability of the individual nodes are only ~1/5? That is the case for P2P systems. Dominik Grolimund, the founder of a Swiss startup Caleido will show you how! They have   launched Wuala  , the social online storage service which scales as new nodes join the P2P network.     The goal of   Wua.la   is to provide distributed online storage that is:     large   scalable   reliable   secure     by harnessing the idle resources of participating computers.     This challenge is an old dream of computer science. In fact as   Andrew Tanenbaum   wrote in 1995:    "The design of a world-wide, fully transparent distributed filesystem fot simultaneous use by millions of mobile and frequently disconnected users is left as an exercise for the reader"      After three years of research and development at at ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology on a distributed storage system, Caleido is ready to unveil the resu</p><p>6 0.32612997 <a title="62-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-02-Distributed_Hashing_Algorithms_by_Example%3A_Consistent_Hashing.html">892 high scalability-2010-09-02-Distributed Hashing Algorithms by Example: Consistent Hashing</a></p>

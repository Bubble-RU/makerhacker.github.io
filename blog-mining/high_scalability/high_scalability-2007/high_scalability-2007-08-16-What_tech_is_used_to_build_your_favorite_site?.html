<p>Introduction: Drupal 7 is having a scalability makeover. Karoly Negyesi, Drupal Core Developer and Public Development Team Lead, explains the process in this video:  Drupal 7 APIs, scalability mindset . Karoly states the general theme of the changes as:  You give up some control and you get back scalability . An interesting comment on the politics of scalability?
 
Makeover may not be quite the right word though. A makeover implies a cosmetic change, looking better by changing the surface. Drupal's changes will go deeper than that, right to Drupal's core. It's a genuine and authentic change that will hopefully allow one of the Internet's most venerable Content Management Systems (CMSs) to compete with a constant stream of younger and sexier models.
 
Drupal is based on an older LAMP stack approach where PHP modules are scooped up and merged together each time a request is made to Drupal. Drupal's most intriguing idea is how it is built, expands, and changes by  weaving together a single system  out</p><p>3 0.16756842 <a title="66-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-06-Start_Here.html">1 high scalability-2007-07-06-Start Here</a></p>

To help you build successful scalable websites.
 
This site tries to bring together all the lore, art, science, practice, and experience of building scalable websites into one place so you can learn how to build your website with confidence.
 
When it becomes clear you must grow your website or die, most people have no idea where to start. It's not a skill you learn in school or pick up from a magazine article on a plane flight home. No, building scalable systems is a body o</p><p>4 0.1418083 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-24-Great_Introductory_Video_on_Scalability_from_Harvard_Computer_Science.html">948 high scalability-2010-11-24-Great Introductory Video on Scalability from Harvard Computer Science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Professor  David Malan  gives a very good lecture on scalability for dynamic websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high availability.

This is one lecture in a series of 13 lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to:  build dynamic websites  with  Ajax  and with  Linux ,  Apache ,  MySQL , and  PHP  ( LAMP ); set up  domain names  with  DNS ;  structure pages  with  XHTML  and  CSS  how to  program  in  JavaScript  and  PHP ;  configure Apache and  MySQL ; design and  query databases  with  SQL ; use  Ajax  with both  XML  and JSON ;</p><p>5 0.13862205 <a title="66-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark_for_keeping_data_in_browser_in_AJAX_projects.html">565 high scalability-2009-04-13-Benchmark for keeping data in browser in AJAX projects</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,  I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was taking too much load.  There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain PHP/HTML coding is used.

I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows,  PHP, Adsense, RSS, CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which AJAX library is used. Though it's kind of cool to see which sites use PHP and other technologies.</p><p>2 0.70599604 <a title="66-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-15-Wolfram%7CAlpha_Architecture.html">600 high scalability-2009-05-15-Wolfram|Alpha Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Making the world's knowledge computable  
  Today's Wolfram|Alpha is the first step in an ambitious, long-term project to make all systematic knowledge immediately computable by anyone.  You enter your question or calculation, and Wolfram|Alpha uses its built-in algorithms and growing collection of data to compute the answer. 
  Answer Engine vs Search Engine  
 When  Wolfram|Alpha  launches later today, it will be  one of the most computationally intensive websites on the internet . The  Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine  is an "answer engine" that is able to produce answers to various questions such as
  
 What is the GDP of France? 
 
 Weather is Springfield when David Ortiz was born

<p>Introduction: A lot of new internet TV station startups are in the wind these days and there's a question about how they can scale their broadcasts. Today's state of the art shows you can't yet mimic the reach of broadcast TV with internet tech. But as Oprah proves, you can still capture a lot of eyeballs, if you are Oprah...     Oprah drew a stunning 500,000 simultaneous viewers for an Eckhart Tolle webcast. Move Networks and Limelight Networks hosted the "broadcast" where traffic peaked at 242Gbps.  A variable bitrate scheme was used so depending on their connection, a viewer could have seen 150Kbps or as high as 750Kbps.     Dan Rayburn thinks   The big take away from this webcast is that it shows proof that the Internet is not built to handle TV like distribution and those who think that live TV shows will be broadcast on the Internet with millions and millions of people watching, it's just not going to happen.        To handle more users comments suggested capping the bitrate at 300K, using P2P</p><p>4 0.60162836 <a title="66-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-24-Product%3A__Hibernate_Shards.html">24 high scalability-2007-07-24-Product:  Hibernate Shards</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you want to adopt a shard architecture, but don't want to start from scratch, you may want to consider Hibernate's sharding system.
 
Hibernate Shards is a framework that is designed to encapsulate and minimize this complexity by adding support for horizontal partitioning to Hibernate Core.   Hibernate Shards  key features:
  
  Standard Hibernate programming model - Hibernate Shards allows you to continue using the Hibernate APIs you know and love: SessionFactory, Session, Criteria, Query. If you already know how to use Hibernate, you already know how to use Hibernate Shards. 
  Flexible sharding strategies - Distribute data across your shards any way you want. Use one of the default strategies we provide or plug in your own application-specific logic. 
  Support for virtual shards - Think your sharding strategy is never going to change? Think again. Adding new shards and redistributing your data is one of the toughest operational challenges you will face once you've deployed your</p><p>5 0.55822814 <a title="66-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-06-Cloud_Programming_Directly_Feeds_Cost_Allocation_Back_into_Software_Design.html">527 high scalability-2009-03-06-Cloud Programming Directly Feeds Cost Allocation Back into Software Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 6 :  CARS = Cost Aware Runtimes and Services  by William Louth.  Update 5 :  Damn You Google, Damn You Yahoo! Why D'Ya Do This to Us?  Free accounts on a cloud platform are a constant drain of money.  Update 4:  Caching becomes even more important in  CPU based billing environments . Avoiding the CPU means saving money.  Update 3:  An interesting simple example of this idea showed up on the Google AppEngine list. With one paging algorithm and one use of AJAX the yearly cost of the site was $1000. By changing those algorithms the site went under quota and became free again. This will make life a lot more interesting for developers.  Update 2:   Business Model Influencing Software Architecture  by Brandon Watson.  The profitability of your project could disappear overnight on account of code behaving badly .  Update:  Amazon adds  Elastic Block Store  at $0.10 per 1 million I/O requests. Now I need some cost minimization storage algorithms!

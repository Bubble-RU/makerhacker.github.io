</p><p>8 We started having a lot of requests to license our crawler and we shipped that in the form of Spinn3r about 8 months ago. [sent-18, score-0.25]
</p><p>9 Spinn3r is self contained crawler for companies that want to index the full blogosphere and consumer generated media. [sent-19, score-0.43]
</p><p>10 We've spent a lot of time in building out a distributed system that can scale and handle failure. [sent-28, score-0.209]
</p><p>11 It works VERY well for crawlers in that slower machines just fetch work at a slower rate while more modern machines (or better tuned machines) request work at a higher rate. [sent-31, score-0.448]
</p><p>12 We index 24M weblogs and feeds per hour and process content at about 160-200Mbps. [sent-37, score-0.38]

The template is definitely too long, but it's more just a series of questions to jog people's memories and then they can answer whatever they think is important.     What I want to ask is if you can think of any things to add/delete/change in the template? What do you want to know about the systems people are building?

<p>Introduction: Update:  Jake in  Does Django really scale better than Rails?  thinks apps like FFS shouldn't need so much hardware to scale.  In a short three months Friends for Sale (think Hot-or-Not with a market economy) grew to become a top 10 Facebook application handling 200 gorgeous requests per second and a stunning 300 million page views a month. They did all this using Ruby on Rails,  two part time developers, a cluster of a dozen machines, and a fairly standard architecture. How did Friends for Sale scale to sell all those beautiful people? And how much do you think your friends are worth on the open market?

The template was originally created with web services in mind, not cloud providers, but I think it still works in an odd sort of way.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Presentation: Second Life’s Architecture .  Ian Wilkes, VP of Systems Engineering, describes the architecture used by the popular game named Second Life. Ian presents how the architecture was at its debut and how it evolved over years as users and features have been added.    Second Life  is a 3-D virtual world created by its Residents. Virtual Worlds are expected to be more and more popular on the internet so their architecture might be of interest. Especially important is the appearance of open virtual worlds or metaverses.  What happens when video games meet Web 2.0? What happens is the  metaverse  .

<p>Introduction: At the heart of every software adventure exists a journey in service of a quest. Melodramatic much? Sorry, but while wandering dazzled through  Race to the End of the Earth , a fantastic exhibit at the  Royal BC Museum  on the 1911-1912  race to the South Pole  between Norwegian explorer  Roald Amundsen  and British naval officer  Robert Scott , I couldn’t help but think of the two radically different approaches each team took to the race and it shocked me to see that some of the same principles that lead to success or failure in software development also seem to lead to success or failure in exploration.
  I wish I could reproduce the experience of  walking through the exhibit . Plaque after plaque I remember wondering out loud at Scott’s choices and then nod in agreement with Amundsen’s approach. The core conflict was straight out of any ancient Agile (Amundsen) vs Waterfall (Scott) thread you can find on Usenet. And Waterfall lost.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Alberto Lopez Toledo, PHD, CTO of Pixable, and Julio Viera, VP of Engineering at Pixable. 
 
   Pixable  aggregates photos from across your different social networks and finds the best ones so you never miss an important moment. That means currently processing the metadata of more than 20 million new photos per day: crawling, analyzing, ranking, and sorting them along with the other 5+ billion that are already stored in our database. Making sense of all that data has challenges, but two in particular rise above the rest:
  
 How to access millions of photos per day from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other services in the most efficient manner. 
 How to process, organize, index, and store all the meta-data related to those photos. 
  
Sure, Pixable’s infrastructure is changing continuously, but there are some things that we have learned over the last year. As a result, we have been able to build a scalable infrastructure that takes advantage of today’s tools,</p><p>3 0.92522949 <a title="160-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-16-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_16%2C_2012.html">1210 high scalability-2012-03-16-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 16, 2012</a></p>
<p>Introduction: HighScalability is What We Do:
  
  454,400 : Number of Amazon servers;  45PB : Facebook Data Warehouse, grows exponentially;  5 Atoms : Ultimate limit of thermodynamics;  YouTube : 4 billion views/day, 60 hours of video uploaded every minute, revenue doubled in 2010  
 Quotable quotes:                       
 
  @adrianco : Walmart labs run large single region Cassandra clusters with Intel SSDs and have been in production for two years. Working well for them.  
  @mybellemac : Scalability is a mother. #pinterest 
  @fakesigi :  Thanks for the correction. I saw cloud computing, scalability and my brain turned off.  
  @BVA100 : I disagree with "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". We ought to be forward thinkers, concerned with leading indicators and scalability.

<p>Introduction: Ever feel like the blogosphere is 500 million channels with nothing on?  Tailrank finds the internet's hottest channels by indexing over 24M weblogs and feeds per hour. That's 52TB of raw blog content (no, not sewage) a month and requires continuously processing 160Mbits of IO. How do they do that?
 
This is an email interview with Kevin Burton,  founder and CEO of Tailrank.com. Kevin was kind enough to take the time to explain how they scale to index the entire blogosphere.
  Sites     Tailrank  - We track the hottest news in the blogosphere!     Spinn3r  - A blog spider you can specialize with your own behavior instead of creating your own.     Kevin Burton's Blog  - his blog is an indexing mix of politics and technical talk. Both are always interesting.

<p>Introduction: I'm only here for the HighScalability:
  
  762 billion : objects stored on S3;  $1B/Quarter : Google spend on servers;  100 Petabytes : Storage for Facebook's photos and videos. 
 Quotable Quotes:
 
  @knorth2 : #IPO filing says #Facebook is "dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure" 
  @debuggist : Scalability trumps politics. 
  @cagedether : Hype of #Hadoop is driving pressure on people to keep everything 
  @nanreh : My MongoDB t shirt has never helped me get laid. This is typical with #nosql databases. 
  @lusis : I kenna do it, Capt'n. IO is pegged, disk is saturated…I lost 3 good young men when the cache blew up! 
  Kenton Varda : Jeff Dean puts his pants on one leg at a time, but if he had more than two legs, you'd see that his approach is actually O(log n)

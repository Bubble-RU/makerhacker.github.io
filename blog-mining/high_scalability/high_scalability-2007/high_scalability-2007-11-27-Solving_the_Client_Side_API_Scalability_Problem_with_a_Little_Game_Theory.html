<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal

<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: Ten million players a day and over fifty million players a month interact
socially with friends usingPlayfishgames on social platforms like The
Facebook, MySpace, and the iPhone. Playfish was an early innovator in the
fastest growing segment of the game industry:social gaming, which is the love
child between casual gaming and social networking. Playfish was also an early
adopter of the Amazon cloud, running their system entirely on 100s of cloud
servers. Playfish finds itself at the nexus of some hot trends (which may by
why EA bought them for$300 millionand they think a$1 billion gameis possible):
building games on social networks, build applications in the cloud, mobile
gaming, leveraging data driven design to continuously evolve and improve
systems, agile development and deployment, andselling virtual goodas a
business model.How can a small company make all this happen? To explain the

<p>Introduction: One of the most popular and effective scalability strategies is to impose
limits (GAE Quotas,Fotolog,Facebook) as a means of protecting a website
against service destroyingtraffic spikes. Twitter will reportedlylimit the
number followersto 2,000 in order to thwart follow spam. This may also allow
Twitter to make some bank bygoing freemiumand charging for adding more
followers.Agree or disagree with Twitter's strategies, the more interesting
aspect for me is how do you introduce new policies into an already established
ecosystem?One approach is the big bang. Introduce all changes at once and let
everyone adjust. If users don't like it they can move on. The hope is,
however, most users won't be impacted by the changes and that those who are
will understand it's all for the greater good of their beloved service.
Casualties are assumed, but the damage will probably be minor.Now in Twitter's
case the people with the most followers tend to be opinion leaderswho shape

<p>Introduction: Om proposes one solution to theTwitter Problemis tolimit followersto three
square meals a day. The reasonable idea being that lower limits should mean
fewer scaling problems. And as a kicker raising those limits is a good way to
raise much needed revenue.Scoble thinks users shouldconsume without limitand
will drive to another buffet if all-you-can-eat privileges are revoked. The
reasonable idea being that if an internet service can't solve internet scale
problems then there's not much use for it.Dave sayscomp power users a top
floor suiteand shower them with free passes to the buffet. Let the good times
roll! The reasonable idea being that power users help create popular
restaurants, er, services in the first place and limiting them starves users
and starved users won't come back.So, should web services like Twitter be a
buffet, a fixed eight course fine dining experience, a small plate restaurant,
a family style joint, or a vending machine? Or something else entirely?In a

<p>Introduction: Can anyone convincingly explain why properties sporting traffic statistics
that may seem in-line with with the capabilities of a single big-iron machine
need so many machines in their architecture?This is a common reaction to
architecture profiles on High Scalability: I could do all that on a few
machines so they must be doing something really stupid. Lo and behold this
same reaction also occurred to the articleThe Architecture Twitter Uses to
Deal with 150M Active Users. On Hacker Newspapsosouid voiced what a lot of
people may have been thinking:I really question the current trend of creating
big, complex, fragile architectures to "be able to scale". These numbers are a
great example of why, the entire thing could run on a single server, in a very
straight forward setup. When you are creating a cluster for scalability, and
it has less CPU, RAM and IO than a single server, what are you gaining? They
are only doing 6k writes a second for crying out loud.This is a surprisingly
hard react</p><p>6 0.78263223 <a title="166-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-11-Ten_Lessons_from_GitHub%E2%80%99s_First_Year_in_2008.html">1515 high scalability-2013-09-11-Ten Lessons from GitHub’s First Year in 2008</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something
calledSelf Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance(SCIT).Botnetsare created when
vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do
the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about
removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks
like adog chasing its tail). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the
availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a
great deal of sense once I thought about it.With SCIT you stop and restart VM
instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window
vulnerability)....breakThis short exposure window means worms and viri do not
have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack.
A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be
reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM
mechanisms becom</p><p>2 0.89500111 <a title="166-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-06-Paper%3A_Scaling_Genome_Sequencing_-_Complete_Genomics_Technology_Overview.html">403 high scalability-2008-10-06-Paper: Scaling Genome Sequencing - Complete Genomics Technology Overview</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about
building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in
terms of scalability. Thepaperdescribes a new technology by the startup
company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction
of the cost of earlier possibilities.Complete Genomics is building the world's
largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey,
outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.By 2010,
their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30
petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.Do
you find this interesting and relevant to HighScalability.com?</p><p>3 0.87624043 <a title="166-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Product%3A_Cacti.html">58 high scalability-2007-08-04-Product: Cacti</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cactiis a network statistics graphing tool designed as a frontend to RRDtool's
data storage and graphing functionality. It is intended to be intuitive and
easy to use, as well as robust and scalable. It is generally used to graph
time-series data like CPU load and bandwidth use.The frontend is written in
PHP; it can handle multiple users, each with their own graph sets, so it is
sometimes used by web hosting providers (especially dedicated server, virtual
private server, and colocation providers) to display bandwidth statistics for
their customers. It can be used to configure the data collection itself,
allowing certain setups to be monitored without any manual configuration of
RRDtool.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.86778259 <a title="166-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-27-Solving_the_Client_Side_API_Scalability_Problem_with_a_Little_Game_Theory.html">166 high scalability-2007-11-27-Solving the Client Side API Scalability Problem with a Little Game Theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now that the internet has become defined as a mashup over a collection of
service APIs, we have a little problem: for clients using APIs is a lot like
drinking beer through a straw. You never get as much beer as you want and you
get a headache after. But what if I've been a good boy and deserve a bigger
straw? Maybe we can use game theory to model trust relationships over a life
time of interactions over many different services and then give more
capabilities/beer to those who have earned them?breakLet's say Twitter limits
me to downloading only 20 tweets at a time through their API. But I want more.
I may even want to do something so radical as download all my tweets. Of
course Twitter can't let everyone do that. They would be swamped serving all
this traffic and service would be denied. So Twitter does that rational thing
and limits API access as a means of self protection. As does Google,
Yahoo,Skynet, and everyone else.But when I hit the API limit I think, but hey
it's Todd here, w</p><p>5 0.8636744 <a title="166-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy%3A_Efficiently_Geo-referencing_IPs.html">168 high scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy: Efficiently Geo-referencing IPs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations. Jeremy Cole inOn
efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GISsuccinctly
explains the many uses for such a feature:Geo-referencing IPs is, in a
nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a
log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity
owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-
reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting
systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more
applications.This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit
of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-
rereferncing data, how to load data, and the performance of different
approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to
the subject.</p><p>6 0.86043149 <a title="166-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-01-Myth%3A_Eric_Brewer_on_Why_Banks_are_BASE_Not_ACID_-_Availability_Is_Revenue_.html">1450 high scalability-2013-05-01-Myth: Eric Brewer on Why Banks are BASE Not ACID - Availability Is Revenue </a></p>

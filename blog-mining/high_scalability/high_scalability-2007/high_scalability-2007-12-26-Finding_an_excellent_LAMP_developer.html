<p>Introduction: Robert Johnson, a director of engineering at Facebook, celebrated Facebook's
monumental achievement of reaching 500 million users by sharing thescaling
principles that helped reach that milestone. In case you weren't suitably
impressed by the 500 million user number, Robert ratchets up the numbers game
with these impressive figures:1 million users per engineer500 million active
users100 billion hits per day50 billion photos2 trillion objects cached, with
hundreds of millions of requests per second130TB of logs every dayHow did
Facebook get to this point?People Matter Most. It's people who build and run
systems. The best tools for scaling are an engineering and operations teams
that can handle anything.Scale Horizontally. Handling exponentially growing
traffic requires spreading load arbitrarily across many machines. Using
different databases for tables like accounts and profiles only doubles
capacity. This approach hurts efficiency, but efficiency is a separate effort
from scaling, eff</p><p>6 0.066447504 <a title="193-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-17-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_17%2C_2013.html">1460 high scalability-2013-05-17-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 17, 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Imagine if you will that car rental agencies rented cars like programmers are
hired at many software companies...Agency: So sorry you had to wait in the
reception area for an hour. Nobody knew you were coming to today. I finally
found 8 people to interview before we can rent you a car. If we like you you
may have to come in for another round of interviews tomorrow because our
manager isn't in today. I didn't have a chance to read your application, so
I'll just start with a question. What car do you drive today?Applicant: I
drive a 2008 Subaru.Agency: That's a shame. We don't have a Subaru to rent
you.Applicant: That's OK. Any car will do.Agency: No, we can only take on
clients who know how to drive the cars we stock. We find it's safer that way.
There are so many little differences between cars, we just don't want to take
a chance.Applicant: I have a drivers license. I know how to drive. I've been
driving all kinds of cars for 15 years, I am sure I can adapt. Agency: We

<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers Show 41 episode was to reveal and
ruminate over the horrors of a successfulattack on RSA, which puts the whole
world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there
was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost
datacenter.Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile
back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by
summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal: Look at
Arista and Juniper. JuniperHas a range of stackable switches, which includes
some 10 gig.If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on
their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric
solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric.
Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.
Thinks Juniper would make a good deal in order to get a few reference sites

by Avinash Agrawal on the black art of capacity planning:How to get started
with sizing and capacity planning, assuming we don't know the software
behavior and its completely new product to deal with?Gil Tene, Vice President
of Technology and CTO & Co-Founder, wrote a very understandable and useful
answer that is worth highlighting:Start with requirements. I see way too many
"capacity planning" exercises that go off spending weeks measuring some
irrelevant metrics about a system (like how many widgets per hour can this
thing do) without knowing what they actually need it to do.There are two key
sets of metrics to state here: the "how much" set and the "how bad" set:In the
"How Much" part, you need to establish, based on expected business needs,

per second) that you expect to interact with at the peak time of normal
operations, and</p><p>6 0.75393593 <a title="193-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-07-Five_Ways_to_Stop_Framework_Fixation_from_Crashing_Your_Scaling_Strategy.html">347 high scalability-2008-07-07-Five Ways to Stop Framework Fixation from Crashing Your Scaling Strategy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi...I have this idea to start a really great and scalable website, and I am
building it! So far I'm doing everything myself - coding, networking,
architecture planning, everything. I haven't even gotten into the legal
aspects yet.......It would be MUCH easier if I had a technical person to
handle that end of the operation. I'm a good coder, but like Bill Gates at
Harvard for Math, I'm not the very best. I'd like to FIND that very best
person available, to handle the technical aspects. For worse or better, I
don't presently know somebody who fits this bill.I've posted a bazillion ads
on Craig's List, with no really qualified responses. I've put out feelers
among my own network, same result. Not sure what else I can do. Shoestring
budget, so it's sweat equity in the beginning. That can actually be a plus, as
it forces people to focus.Any ideas about what else I can do, to attract the
right person?ThanksJason</p><p>2 0.73481727 <a title="193-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-02-Hypertable_is_a_New_BigTable_Clone_that_Runs_on_HDFS_or_KFS.html">647 high scalability-2009-07-02-Hypertable is a New BigTable Clone that Runs on HDFS or KFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 3: Presentation from theNoSQL conference:slides,video 1,video 2.Update
2: The folks at Hypertable would like you to know that Hypertable is now
officiallysponsored by Baidu, China's Leading Search Engine.As a sponsor of
Hypertable, Baidu has committed an industrious team of engineers, numerous
servers, and support resources to improve the quality and development of the
open source technology.Update: InfoQ interview onHypertable Lead Discusses
Hadoop and Distributed Databases. Hypertable differs from HBase in that it is
a higher performance implementation of Bigtable.Skrentabloggives the heads up
onHypertable,Zvents'open-source BigTable clone. It's written in C++ and can
run on top of either HDFS or KFS. Performance looks encouraging at28M rows of

fascinates me.David DeWitt writes in the Database Column that MapReduce is a
major step backwards:A giant step backward in the programming paradigm for

it uses brute force instead of indexingNot novel at all -- it represents a

<p>Introduction: This is aguest repost bySriram Devadas, Engineer at Vistaprint, Web platform
group. A fun and well written analogy of how to scale web applications using a
familiar coffee shop as an example. No coffee was harmed during the making of
this post.I own a small coffee shop.My expense is proportional to resources100
square feet of built up area with utilities, 1 barista, 1 cup coffee maker.My
shop's capacityServes 1 customer at a time, takes 3 minutes to brew a cup of
coffee, a total of 5 minutes to serve a customer.Since my barista works
without breaks and the German made coffee maker never breaks down,my shop's
maximum throughput = 12 customers per hour. Web serverCustomers walk away
during peak hours. We only serve one customer at a time. There is no space to
wait.I upgrade shop. My new setup is better!ExpensesSame area and utilities, 3
baristas, 2 cup coffee maker, 2 chairsCapacity3 minutes to brew 2 cups of
coffee, ~7 minutes to serve 3 concurrent customers, 2 additional customers can</p><p>5 0.60384136 <a title="193-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff_the_Internet_Says_on_Scalability_For_November_12th%2C_2010.html">940 high scalability-2010-11-12-Stuff the Internet Says on Scalability For November 12th, 2010</a></p>

just 100 servers to work together for the first time is so ridiculously

Yahoo's CTOThe Economics of the Cloud: Dissecting a Must-Read White Paperby
Bernard Golden. I love the depiction of the unseen and unfelt forces that
nevertheless organize everything around them: After a brief introduction, the
authors lay out a central thesis: despite initial concerns about shortcomings
in new technology offerings, "historically, underlying economics have a much
stronger impact on the direction and speed of disruptions, as technological
challenges are resolved or overcome through the rapid innovation we've grown

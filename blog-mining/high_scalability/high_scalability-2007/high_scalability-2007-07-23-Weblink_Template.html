<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create
a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll
have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own
forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each
group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to
start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups
(this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that
having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that
some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day,
let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active
though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate
which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if
having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>3 0.20552124 <a title="22-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-04-Streaming_Video_on_Amazon_EC2%3F.html">239 high scalability-2008-02-04-Streaming Video on Amazon EC2?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: AnAmazon EC2 Flash Video Streamingsolution has been announced by Wowza Media.
What do you think about the future of similar solutions? Is Amazon EC2 and S3
ready for video streaming?I have found threads on their forums related to the
performance, scalability and high availability of the hosted streaming
solution. How would you make it scalable? Is it really cheaper than
traditional hosting?Looking forward to your thoughts!</p><p>4 0.17602141 <a title="22-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-25-Who_can_answer_or_analyze_the_image_store_and_visit_solution_about_alibaba.com%3FThanks.html">132 high scalability-2007-10-25-Who can answer or analyze the image store and visit solution about alibaba.com?Thanks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Art of DistributedPart 1: Rethinking about distributed computing modelsI 'm
getting a lot of questions lately about the distributed computing, especially
distributed computing model, and MapReduce, such as: What is MapReduce? Can
MapReduce fit in all situations? How we can compares it with other
technologies such as Grid Computing? And what is the best solution to our
situation? So I decide to write about the distributed computing article in two
parts. First one about the distributed computing model and what is the
difference between them. In the second part I will discuss the reliability,
and distributed storage systems.Download the article in PDF format.Download
the article in MS Word format.I wait for your comments, and questions, and I
will answer it in part two.</p><p>6 0.11339395 <a title="22-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-Machine_VM_%2B_Cloud_API_-_Rewriting_the_Cloud_from_Scratch.html">923 high scalability-2010-10-21-Machine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting the Cloud from Scratch</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Guys,At one of my jobs I have to administer a CISCO ACE (application control
engine) hardware load-balancer.I don't particularly love this beast, but it's
very very powerful.There appears to be little real-world info out there, so it
could be interesting writing an article on that.But I don't have other HW LB's
to compare it to and I don't want to rehash the product page.What would
interest you in a 'product review' of a loadbalancer?No replies means it's not
an interesting topic, so no article then ;-)</p><p>4 0.5354473 <a title="22-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-16-Reducing_Your_Website%27s_Bandwidth_Usage_-_how_to.html">494 high scalability-2009-01-16-Reducing Your Website's Bandwidth Usage - how to</a></p>

you bandwidth usage and refers specifically on high trafficked websites for
which bandwidth is more costly than for an average website.This is his

today.I won't be posting new content, so we'll all have a break.
Disappointing, I know.If you've ever wanted to write an article for
HighScalability this would be a great time :-) I'd be very interested in your
experiences with containers vs VMs if you have some thoughts on the subject.So
if the spirit moves you, please write something.See you on down the road...</p><p>6 0.53169024 <a title="22-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-25-Who_can_answer_or_analyze_the_image_store_and_visit_solution_about_alibaba.com%3FThanks.html">132 high scalability-2007-10-25-Who can answer or analyze the image store and visit solution about alibaba.com?Thanks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to store millions of images?
Currently images are stored in a MS SQL database which performance wise isn't
ideal. We'd like to migrate the images over to a file system structure but I'd
assume we don't just want to dump millions of images into a single directory.
Besides having to contend with naming collisions, the windows filesystem might
not perform optimally with that many files.I'm assuming one approach may be to
assign each user a unique CSLID, create a folder based on the CSLID and then
place one users files in that particular folder. Even so, this could result in
hundreds of thousands of folders. Whats the best organizational
scheme/heirachy for doing this?</p><p>4 0.3841022 <a title="22-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-04-IPS-IDS_for_heavy_content_site.html">238 high scalability-2008-02-04-IPS-IDS for heavy content site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All,My site would have heavy content (video/pictures). I'm looking for an
efficient IPS/IDS solution which would not introduce much of latency. I'm more
familiar with Cisco ASA and also familiar with Juniper, Foundry and others. I
also came across snort but haven't used it before. I'm more of looking for an
appliance (for the ease of configuration,support etc...)Could any one share
their thoughts on performane of IPS/IDS from this vendors?Thanks!Janakan

<p>Introduction: Ricky HoinScalable System Design Patternshas created a great list of
scalability patterns along with very well done explanatory graphics. A summary
of the patterns are:Load Balancer- a dispatcher determines which worker
instance will handle a request based on different policies.Scatter and Gather-
a dispatcher multicasts requests to all workers in a pool. Each worker will
compute a local result and send it back to the dispatcher, who will
consolidate them into a single response and then send back to the
client.Result Cache- a dispatcher will first lookup if the request has been
made before and try to find the previous result to return, in order to save
the actual execution.Shared Space- all workers monitors information from the
shared space and contributes partial knowledge back to the blackboard. The
information is continuously enriched until a solution is reached.Pipe and
Filter- all workers connected by pipes across which data flows.MapReduce-
targets batch jobs where disk I/O is th</p><p>6 0.30722678 <a title="22-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-29-One_Story_of_Life_as_Told_Through_Queues.html">1556 high scalability-2013-11-29-One Story of Life as Told Through Queues</a></p>

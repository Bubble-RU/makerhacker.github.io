<p>Introduction: GigaSpaces launched   OpenSpaces.org  , a community web site for developers who wish to utilize and contribute to the open source   OpenSpaces development framework  .     OpenSpaces extends the Spring Framework for enterprise Java development, and leverages the   GigaSpaces eXtreme Application Platform   (XAP) for data caching, messaging and as the container for application business logic.  It is designed for building highly-available, scale-out applications in distributed environments, such as SOA, cloud computing, grids and commodity servers.  OpenSpaces is widely used in a variety of industries, including financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing and retail -- and across the web in e-commerce, Web 2.0 applications such as social networking sites, search and more.         OpenSpaces.org already lists more than two dozen   projects   submitted by the developer community, including GigaSpaces customers, partners and employees.

<p>Introduction: Summary    In this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out model.          Bio    Nati Shalom is the CTO and Founder of   GigaSpaces   and responsible for the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed technology and architecture namely CORBA, Jini, J2EE, Grid and SOA. Nati is the Head of the Israeli Grid consortium and an evangelist of Space Based Architecture and Data Grid patterns.

<p>Introduction: How do you layer a programmable Internet of smart things on top of the web? That's the question addressed byÂ  Dominique Guinard Â in his ambitious dissertation:Â  A Web of Things Application Architecture - Integrating the Real-World Â ( slides ). With the continuedÂ siloing of content, perhaps we can keep our things open and talking to each other?
 
In the architecture things are modeled using REST, they will be findable via search, they will be social via a social access controller, and they will be mashupable. Here's great graphical overview of the entire system:

  Abstract:   

A central concern in the area of pervasive computing has been the integration of digital artifactsts with the physical world and vice-versa. Recent developments in the field of embedded devices have led to smart things increasingly populating our daily life. We define smart things as digitally enhanced physical objectsts and devices that have communication capabilities. Application domains are for i</p><p>4 0.6797871 <a title="180-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-26-Web_2.0_Killed_the_Middleware_Star.html">1087 high scalability-2011-07-26-Web 2.0 Killed the Middleware Star</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It started out innocently enough with a simple question, “What exactly *is* the model for PaaS services scalability? If based on HTTP/REST API integration, fairly easy. If native middleware… input?” You’ll forgive the odd phrasing – Twitter’s limitations sometimes make conversations of this nature … interesting. 
   
 
 

The discussion culminated in what appeared to be the sentiment that middleware was mostly obsolete with respect to PaaS.

      THE OLD WAY    

Very briefly for those of you who are more infrastructure / network minded than application architecture fluent, let’s review the traditional middleware-based application architecture.


Generally speaking, middleware – a.k.a. JMS, MQ Series and most recently, ESB – is leveraged as means to enable a publish-subscribe model of sharing data. Basically, it’s an integration pattern, but no one really likes to admit that because of the connotations associated with the evil word “integration” in the enterprise. But that’s what it’s</p><p>5 0.64732307 <a title="180-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_Symfony_a_Web_Framework.html">31 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: Symfony a Web Framework</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.     Nicholas Carr    A former executive editor of the Harvard Business Review, Nicholas Carr writes and speaks on technology, business, and culture. His provocative 2004 book Does IT Matter? set off a worldwide debate about the role of computers in business.    The Big Switch – Rewiring the World, From Edison to Google    Carr's core insight is that the development of the computer and the Internet remarkably parallels that of the last radically disruptive technology, electricity. He traces the rapid morphing of electrification from an in-house competitive advantage to a ubiquitous utility, and how the business advantage rapidly shifted from the innovators and early adop</p><p>4 0.83261651 <a title="180-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA%3A_Badoo%E2%80%99s_journey_into_Continuous_Integration.html">1531 high scalability-2013-10-13-AIDA: Badoo’s journey into Continuous Integration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s hardly news to anyone that product development and testing involve a lot of boring routine work, which can lead to human error. To avoid complications stemming from this, we use AIDA.
 
 AIDA  (Automated Interactive Deploy Assistant) is a utility that automatically performs many of the processes in Git, TeamCity and JIRA.
 
In this post, we focus on how through using AIDA we were able to automate multiple workflows and create a scheme of continuous integration.
 
We’ll start by looking at the version control system (VCS) we use here at Badoo, specifically how Git is used to automate creation of release branches, and their subsequent merging. Then we’ll discuss AIDA’s major contribution to both JIRA integration and TeamCity.
  Git flow  
The Badoo Team uses Git as a version control system. Our model ensures each task is developed and tested in a separate branch. The branch name consists of the ticket number in JIRA and a description of the problem.

<p>Introduction: Loved those mainframe days – you only needed one, but then came along the AS400’s and soon you had ten – but wait, you needed client server and SOA, oh sh%# – now I have ten thousand servers and I need to consolidate server and datacenter operations!
 
 Is Cloud Computing going to follow the same path? 
 
As a technology strategist I have the benefit of frequently speaking with other CIO’s on the topic of Cloud Computing. Often those discussions are in context to how they can leverage SpringCM’ s easy, fast and affordable cloud Enterprise Content Management (ECM) services. But those conversations are done in context to the overall strategy and reality that the modern CIO will use a combination of cloud offerings to solve business problems today. Some of those services will be internally provided (Private Cloud), and many more will be outside the traditional corporate domain, also known as Public Cloud services.
 
 What options do I have?

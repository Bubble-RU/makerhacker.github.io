<p>Introduction: Hi all, aI run a site that after a complete redesign have gotten a lot more
traffic. The site provides free flash games, so the biggest traffic share goes
to serving flash files (from about 100K and up to several megabytes in size
each.)I currently host the entire site on a hosting provider that have no
traffic limits. But since they are very cheap (yet have served me very well
all the time with at least 99,9% uptime), I don't trust them in allowing me to
continue consuming more and more bandwidth. I just guess I'm going to reach
some internal limit they have on day, so I'm looking into moving all the flash
content over to a content delivery network of some sort.Some recent traffic

<p>Introduction: Hello all,I'm working on a web site that might totally flop or it might
explode to be the next facebook/flickr/digg/etc. Since I really don't know how
popular the site will be I don't want to spend a ton of money on the
hardware/hosting right away but I want to be able to scale it easily if it
does grow rapidly. With this in mind, what would be the best approach to
launch the site?Thanks,Dan</p><p>6 0.098521605 <a title="61-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-14-Newbie_in_scalability_design_issues.html">121 high scalability-2007-10-14-Newbie in scalability design issues</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site
has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this
day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out
the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was
taking too much load.There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my
database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I
have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain
PHP/HTML coding is used.Technology:PHP -- 5.2MYSQL -- 5.0Apache --

<p>Introduction: I am in the design phase of getting a website up and running that will have
scalability as a main concern. I am looking for opinions on architecture and
the like for this endeavor.The site has a few unique characteristics that make
scalability difficult. Users will all have a pretty large amount of data that
other users will be able to search. The site will be entirely based around
search. The catch is that other users will be searching always with a
stipulation of 'n' miles from me. I imagine that fact will kill the
possibility of query caching for most searches.I have extensive experience
with PHP and MYSQL, some experience with ASP.NET/C#, some experience with perl
but can learn anything fast. The site will start out on a single server but I
want to be 100% certain that I architect the code and databases such that
scaling will be simple.What language should I code the site in? What DB would
you use: Postgres, MYSQL, MSSQL, BerkelyDB? Should we shard the database by
location? by user</p><p>6 0.62174547 <a title="61-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-15-starting_small_with_growth_in_mind.html">632 high scalability-2009-06-15-starting small with growth in mind</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO ofPlaytomic. Playtomic is a game
analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games
played by approximately 20 million people daily.Here's a good summary quote by
Ben Lowry on Hacker News:Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday
700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is
integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just
yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people
operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated
a whole bunch of them very cheaply.Playtomic began with an almost exclusively
Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being
replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire
platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then
spread to second dedicated, then the API server was offloaded to a VPS
provider and 4 - 6 fairl</p><p>3 0.74407822 <a title="61-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-09-Paper%3A_Container-based_Operating_System_Virtualization%3A_A_Scalable%2C_High-performance_Alternative_to_Hypervisors.html">147 high scalability-2007-11-09-Paper: Container-based Operating System Virtualization: A Scalable, High-performance Alternative to Hypervisors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One stumbling block of the the great march towards virtualization is the
relatively poor performance of resource hungry applications like databases. We
are told to develop and test using VMs, but deploy without them. Which kind of
sucks IMHO. Maybe better virtualization technology can remove this split. This
paper talks about a different approach to virtualization called "container-
based" virtualization that can reportedly double the performance of
traditional hypervisor systems like Xen. It does this by trading isolation for
efficiency. Rather than maintaining complete isolation between VMs the
container approach shares resources between VMs and thus gives higher
performance while still guaranteeing strong fault, resource, and security
isolation. It's yet another battle in computing's endless war of creating and
destroying abstraction layers. I learned a lot from from this paper because of
how it compared and contrasted traditional hypervisor and container based
virtualization strate</p><p>4 0.71431923 <a title="61-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-08-DNS-Record_TTL_on_worst_case_scenarios.html">270 high scalability-2008-03-08-DNS-Record TTL on worst case scenarios</a></p>
<p>Introduction: i didnt find a nearly good solution for this problem yet:imagine, you're
responsible for a small CDN network (static images), with two different
datacenter. the balancing for the two DC is done with a anycast nameservice (a
nameserver in every DC, user gets on nearest location). so, one of the
scenario is that one of the datacenters goes down completly. you can do a
monitoring on the nameserver and only route to the dc which is still alive, no
problem. But what about the TTL from the DNS-Records? Tiny TTLs like 2 min.
are often ignored by several ISP (e.g. AOL). so, the client doesn't get the IP
from the other Datacenter. what could be a solution in this scenario?</p><p>5 0.6868701 <a title="61-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-19-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_March_19%2C_2010.html">797 high scalability-2010-03-19-Hot Scalability Links for March 19, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Changelog Episode 0.1.8 - NoSQL Smackdown!This podcast was recorded at
SXSW and features some energetic trash talking by: Stu Hood from Cassandra,
Jan Lehnardt from CouchDB, Wynn Netherland from The Changelog, subbing for
MongoDB, Werner Vogels CTO at Amazon. It's fun hearing these guys step out of
their sober advocacy roles and let loose a little with why they are great and
the other products suck, hard.Algorithmic Graph Theory. It's FREE!A GNU-FDL

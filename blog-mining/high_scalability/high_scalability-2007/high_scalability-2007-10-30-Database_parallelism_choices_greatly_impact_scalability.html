<p>Introduction: The most common complaint against NoSQL is that if you know how to write good
SQL queries then SQL works fine. If SQL is slow you can always tune it and
make it faster. A great example of this incremental improvement process was
written up by StackExchange's Sam Saffron, in A day in the life of a slow page
at Stack Overflow, where he shows through profiling and SQL tuning it was
possible to reduce page load times from 630ms to 40ms for some pages and for
other pages the improvement was 100x.Sam provides a lot of wonderful detail of
his tuning process, how it works, the thought process, the tools used, and the
tradeoffs involved. Here's a short summary of the steps:Using theirmini-
profiler it was shown that abadge detail pagewas taking 630.3 ms to load,
298.1 ms of that was spent on SQL queries, and then the tool listed the SQL
queries for the page and how long each took.From the historical logs, which
are stored inHAProxy on a month-by-month basis, Sam was able to determine this

<p>Introduction: It's hard to be a relational database lately. After years of faithful service
everywhere you look the world is turning against you:Recently at theNoSQL
conference150 revolutionaries met with their new anti-RDBMS arms suppliers.
And you know what happens when revolutionaries are motivated, educated,
funded, and well armed.The revolution has gone mainstream when Computerworld
writesNo to SQL? Anti-database movement gains steam. It's not just whispers
anymore, it's everywhere.And perennial revolutionary Michael Stonebraker runs
from blog to blog shouting theThe End of a DBMS Era (Might be Upon Us).
Relational vendors are selling legacy software, are 50x slower than other
alternatives, and that can not stand.The Greek Chorus onHacker Newssings of
anger and lies.Certainly some say stick with the past. It's your fault, you
aren't doing it right, give us another chance and all will be as it ever was.

was King.But i</p><p>5 0.090248853 <a title="137-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me_Architecture_-_Synchronicity_Kills.html">431 high scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me Architecture - Synchronicity Kills</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What's cool about starting a new project is you finally have a chance to do it
right. You of course eventually mess everything up in your own way, but for
that one moment the world has a perfect order, a rightness that feels
satisfying and good. Arne Claassen, the CTO of notify.me, a brand new real
time notification delivery service, is in this honeymoon period now.Arne has
been gracious enough to share with us his philosophy of how to build a
notification service. I think you'll find it fascinating because Arne goes
into a lot of useful detail about how his system works.His main design
philosophy is to minimize the bottlenecks that form around synchronous access,
that is whensome resource is requested and the requestor ties up more
resources, waiting for a response. If the requested resource can't be
delivered in a timely manner, more and more requests pile up until the server
can't accept any new ones. Nobody gets what they want and you have an outage.

your business - reports are out of date, your batch processing window is
nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database
consolidation - remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database
environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware,
OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are

<p>Introduction: It is widely recognized that MySQL is the most popular database software in
the world. Since its inception in 1995, there have been 11 million product
installations around the world in a wide variety of markets. There are more
installations of MySQL in use today than any other database architecture. From
startup companies hoping to be the next Web2.0 poster child to large global
enterprises, the MySQL database architecture has proven to be flexible,
extendable, scalable, and more than capable of filling high-capacity database
roles in very different venues.</p><p>5 0.6174221 <a title="137-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-17-Blog%3A_Adding_Simplicity_by_Dan_Pritchett.html">94 high scalability-2007-09-17-Blog: Adding Simplicity by Dan Pritchett</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you turn Big Data into fast, useful, and interesting visualizations?
UsingRand technology calledNanocubes. The visualizations are stunning and
amazingly reactive. Almost as interesting as the technologies behind
them.David Smith wrote agreat articleexplaining the technology and showing a
demo by Simon Urbanek of a visualization that uses 32Tb of Twitter data. It
runs smoothly and interactively on a single machine with 16Gb of RAM.  For
more information and demos go tonanocubes.net.David Smith sums it up
nicely:Despite the massive number of data points and the beauty and complexity
of the real-time data visualization, it runs impressively quickly. The
underlying data structure is based on Nanocubes, a fast datastructure for in-
memory data cubes. The basic idea is that nanocubes aggregate data
hierarchically, so that as you zoom in and out of the interactive application,
one pixel on the screen is mapped to just one data point, aggregated from the
many that sit "behind" that pixe</p><p>2 0.83507746 <a title="137-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-25-Enterprise_Architecture_Conference_by_-_John_Zachman._Johannesburg_%2825th_March%29_%2C_Cape_Town_%2827Th_March%29__Dubai_%2823rd_March%29.html">521 high scalability-2009-02-25-Enterprise Architecture Conference by - John Zachman.

<p>Introduction: I was looking at the pingdom infrastructure matrix
(http://royal.pingdom.com/royalfiles/0702_infrastructure_matrix.pdf) and I saw
that no sites are using Postgresql, and then I searched through
highscalability.com and saw very few mentions of postgresql. Are there any
examples of high-traffic sites that use postgresql? Does anyone have any
experience with it? I'm having trouble finding good, recent studies of
postgres (and postgres compared w/ mysql) online.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.79582894 <a title="137-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Database_parallelism_choices_greatly_impact_scalability.html">137 high scalability-2007-10-30-Database parallelism choices greatly impact scalability</a></p>

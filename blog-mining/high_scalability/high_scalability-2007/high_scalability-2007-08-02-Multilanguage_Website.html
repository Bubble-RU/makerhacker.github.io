<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site
has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this
day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out
the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was
taking too much load.There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my
database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I
have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain
PHP/HTML coding is used.Technology:PHP -- 5.2MYSQL -- 5.0Apache --

<p>Introduction: Yes, I just got through watching the Superbowl so chips and salsa are on my
mind and in my stomach. In recreational eating more chips requires downing
more salsa. With mulitcore chips it turns out as cores go up salsa goes down,
salsa obviously being a metaphor for speed.Sandia National Laboratories found
in their simulations:a significant increase in speed going from two to four
multicores, but an insignificant increase from four to eight multicores.
Exceeding eight multicores causes a decrease in speed. Sixteen multicores
perform barely as well as two, and after that, a steep decline is registered
as more cores are added. The problem is the lack of memory bandwidth as well
as contention between processors over the memory bus available to each
processor.The implication for those following a diagonal scaling strategy is
to work like heck to make your system fit within eight multicores. After that
you'll need to consider some sort of partitioning strategy. What's interesting
is the rese</p><p>2 0.8115567 <a title="54-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-01-The_Mullet_Cloud_Selection_Pattern.html">1624 high scalability-2014-04-01-The Mullet Cloud Selection Pattern</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In a recentthread on Hacker News one of the commenters mentioned that they use
Digital Ocean for personal stuff, but use AWS for business.This DO for
personal and AWS for business split has become popular enough that we can now
give it a name: the Mullet Cloud Selection Pattern - business on the front and
party on the back.Providers like DO are cheap and the lightweight composable
container model has an aesthetic appeal to developers. Even though it seems
like much of the VM infrastructure has to be reinvented for containers, the
industry often follows the lead of developer preference.The mullet is dead.
Long live the mullet! Developers are ever restless, always eager to move onto
something new.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.803864 <a title="54-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-02-Multilanguage_Website.html">54 high scalability-2007-08-02-Multilanguage Website</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dr. Daniel Abadi, author of theDBMS Musings blog and Cofounder ofHadapt, which
offers a product improving Hadoop performance by 50x on relational data, is
now taking his talents to graph data in Hadoop's tremendous inefficiency on
graph data management (and how to avoid it), which shares the secrets of
getting Hadoop to perform 1000x better on graph data.TL;DR:Analysing graph
data is at the heart ofimportant data mining problems.Hadoop is the tool of
choice for many of these problems.Hadoop style MapReduce works best on
KeyValue processing, not graph processing, and can be well over a factor of
1000 less efficient than it needs to be.Hadoop inefficiency has consequences
in real world. Inefficiencies on graph data problems like improving power
utilization, minimizing carbon emissions, and improving product designs, leads
to a lot value being left on the table in the form of negative environmental

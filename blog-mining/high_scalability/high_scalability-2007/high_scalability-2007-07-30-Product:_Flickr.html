<p>Introduction: Hi,     I was wondering if anyone has found any information on how to architect a system to support high availability file uploads. My scenario: I have an Apache server proxying requests to a bunch of Tomcat Java application servers. When I need to upgrade my site, I stop and upgrade each of the Tomcat servers one at a time. This seems to work well as Apache automatically routes subsequent requests for the stopped app server to the remaining app servers that are up. The problem is that if a user is uploading a file when the app server is stopped, the upload fails and the user has to upload the file again. This is problematic as uploading files is an integral feature of the site and it's frustrating for the users to have to restart  their uploads every time I upgrade the site (which I want to be able to do frequently).     Has anyone seen any information on how this can be done or have ideas on how this can be architected? I imagine sites like Flickr must have a solution to this problem</p><p>6 0.12383696 <a title="41-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-25-The_Cloud_and_The_Consumer%3A_The_Impact_on_Bandwidth_and_Broadband.html">1105 high scalability-2011-08-25-The Cloud and The Consumer: The Impact on Bandwidth and Broadband</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novice   x   I am starting a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).      I have done some research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I have some basic knowledge on these.     Following are my requirements     1) My budget is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).   2) I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first 2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)   3) 90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.     Based on the above, could you please answer my following questions?       1) Can I go with just a good dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site gets big? Or do you think its wise</p><p>6 0.50266713 <a title="41-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-06-Apple_iCloud%3A_Syncing_and_Distributed_Storage_Over_Streaming_and_Centralized_Storage.html">1053 high scalability-2011-06-06-Apple iCloud: Syncing and Distributed Storage Over Streaming and Centralized Storage</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The need for IT consolidation is most evident in two types of organizations. In the first group, IT grew organically with business over the decades, and survived changes of strategy, management, staff and vendor orientation. The second group of businesses capital groups are characterized by rapid growth through acquisitions (followed by attempts to integrate radically different IT environments). In both groups, their IT infrastructures have typically been pieced together over the past 20 (or more) years.ďťż

A  quick search that showed only a few previous instances of it being used. Has anyone else seen Scaling Engineer as a job title before?      It's a great idea. Scaling is certainly a worthy specialty of it's own. Why there's a difficult lingo, obscure tools, endlessly subtle concepts, a massive body of knowledge to master, and many competing religious factions. All a good start.

<p>Introduction: When designing data storage solutions for High Performance Computing (HPC) environments, IT architects strive to balance complex and often conflicting requirements. The need to manage a skyrocketing amount of data, along with the goals of controlling cost and immediate data availability, can make it difficult to meet HPC application demands within the constraints of today's IT budgets. To help customers address an almost bewildering set of architectural challenges, Sun has developed the Sun Storage and Archive Solution for HPC, a reference architecture that can be easily customized to meet specific application goals and business requirements.     This article is intended for IT managers and storage architects familiar with HPC applications and data requirements in the organization. It assumes that the audience has a technical background and some familiarity with issues surrounding the task of configuring systems and storage.</p><p>3 0.15414295 <a title="69-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-25-Is_your_cloud_as_scalable_as_you_think_it_is%3F.html">395 high scalability-2008-09-25-Is your cloud as scalable as you think it is?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An unstated assumption is that clouds are scalable. But are they? Stick thousands upon thousands of machines together and there are a lot of potential bottlenecks just waiting to choke off your scalability supply. And if the cloud is scalable what are the chances that your application is really linearly scalable? At 10 machines all may be well. Even at 50 machines the seas look calm. But at 100, 200, or 500 machines all hell might break loose. How do you know?     You know through real life testing. These kinds of tests are brutally hard and complicated. who wants to do all the incredibly precise and difficult work of producing cloud scalability tests?   GridDynamics   has stepped up to the challenge and has just released their   Cloud Performance Reports  .       The report is quite detailed so I'll just cover what I found most interesting. GridDynamics in this report test three configurations:           GridGain  running a Monte-Carlo simulation on EC2 .

<p>Introduction: Much of the focus of high performance computing (HPC) has centered on CPU performance. However, as computing requirements grow, HPC clusters are demanding higher rates of aggregate data throughput. Today's clusters feature larger numbers of nodes with increased compute speeds. The higher clock rates and operations per clock cycle create increased demand for local data on each node. In addition, InfiniBand and other high-speed, low-latency interconnects increase the data throughput available to each node.     Traditional shared file systems such as NFS have not been able to scale to meet this growing demand for data throughput on HPC clusters. Scalable cluster file systems that can provide parallel data access to hundreds of nodes and petabytes of storage are needed to provide the high data throughput required by large HPC applications, including manufacturing, electronic design, and research.     This paper describes an implementation of the Sun Lustre file system as a scalable storage</p><p>5 0.14493486 <a title="69-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization_and_Cloud_Computing_is_Changing_the_Network_to_East-West_Routing.html">1157 high scalability-2011-12-14-Virtualization and Cloud Computing is Changing the Network to East-West Routing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s  called “east-west” networking, which when compared to its predecessor,  “north-south” networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane  winds and tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation  between the transformative shift this change in networking patterns has  on the data center with that of El Niño’s transformative power upon the  weather patterns across the globe.
  

    Traditionally,  data center networks have focused on North-South network traffic. The  assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly communicate with  servers at the core, rather than across the network to other clients. 


 But  server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual  appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical  infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with  workloads moving to different physical locations on the network as  virtual servers are migrated (in the case of data center networks) and  clients move</p><p>6 0.13640118 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-What_is_Network-based_Application_Virtualization_and_Why_Do_You_Need_It%3F.html">924 high scalability-2010-10-21-What is Network-based Application Virtualization and Why Do You Need It?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Summary    In this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out model.

<p>Introduction: GridGain   was kind enough to present at the September 17th instance of  the   Silicon Valley Cloud Computing Group  . I've been curious about GridGain so I was glad to see them there. In short GridGain is:   an open source computational grid framework that enables Java developers to improve general performance of processing intensive applications by splitting and parallelizing the workload  . GridGain can also be thought of as a set of middleware primitives for building applications. GridGain's peer group of competitors includes GigaSpaces, Terracotta, Coherence, and Hadoop.     The speaker for GridGain was the President and Founder, Nikita Ivanov. He has a very pleasant down-to-earth way about him that contrasts nicely with a field given to religious discussions of complex taxomic definitions. Nikita first talked about cloud computing in general. He feels Java is the perfect gateway for cloud computing. Which is good because   GridGain only works with Java  .

<p>Introduction: Can you really create an infinitely scalable infrastructure for less than $100
using Amazon's storage, grid, and queuing services platform? It appears so, at
least for the right application. Amazon beams a spot light on the future
battle of the roll-your-own versus the connect-the-dots approach to building
next generation websites using core external services. Their argument is
strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that
would otherwise take an eternity to make, a pile of money to create, and an
unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook
recently leap frogged Amazon's vision with an even more comprehensive set of
services. The battle for the future is on.Site:

<p>Introduction: The Google Operating System blog has aninteresting poston Google's scale based
on an updated version of Google's paper about MapReduce.The input data for
some of the MapReduce jobs run in September 2007 was 403,152 TB (terabytes),
the average number of machines allocated for a MapReduce job was 394, while
the average completion time was 6 minutes and a half. The paper mentions that
Google's indexing system processes more than 20 TB of raw data.breakNiall
Kennedy calculates that the average MapReduce job runs across a $1 million
hardware infrastructure, assuming that Google still uses the same cluster
configurations from 2004: two 2 GHz Intel Xeon processors with Hyper-Threading
enabled, 4 GB of memory, two 160 GB IDE hard drives and a gigabit Ethernet
link.Greg Linden notices that Google's infrastructure is an important
competitive advantage. "Anyone at Google can process terabytes of data. And
they can get their results back in about 10 minutes, so they can iterate on it

structure for approximating membership in a set. A Bloom join conserves
network bandwith by exchanging cheaper, more plentiful local CPU utilization

for CPU time in voodoo units like "compute units" and "core hours." Geva Perry
takes on the quest of figuring out what these mean in real life.breakI
attended Sebastian Stadil'sAWS Training CampSaturday and during the class
Sebastian brought up a wonderfully counter-intuitive idea:CPU (EC2) costs a
lot less than storage (S3, SDB) so you should systematically move as much work
as you can to the CPU. This is said to be theClient-Cloud Paradigm. It
leverages the well pummeled trend that CPU power follows Moore's Law while
storage followsThe Great Plains' Law(flat). And what sane computing

<p>Introduction: Mather Corgan, president of HotPads,gave a great talkon how HotPads uses AWS
to run their real estate search engine. I loved the presentation for a few
reasons:It gives real costs on on their servers, how many servers they have,
what they are used for, and exactly how they use S2, EBS, CloudFront and other
AWS services. This is great information for anybody trying to architect a
system and wondering where to run it.HotPads is a "real" application. It's a
small company and at 4.5 million page-views/month it's large but not super
large. It has custom server side components like indexing engines, image
processing, and background database update engines for syncing new real estate
data. And it also stores a lot of images and has low latency requirements.This
a really good example mix of where many companies are or would like to be with
their applications.Their total costs are about $11K/month, which is about what
they were paying at their previous provider. I found this is a little

<p>Introduction: Update 2: SummizeComputes Computing Resources for a Startup. Lots of nice
graphs showing Amazon is hard to beat for small machines and become less cost
efficient for well used larger machines. Long term storage costs may eat your
saving away. And out of cloud bandwidth costs are high.Update:
viaProductionScale, a nice Digital Web article onhow to setup S3 to store
media filesand how Blue Origin was able to handle 3.5 million requests and 758
GBs in bandwidth in a single day for very little $$$. Also a Right Scale
article onNetwork performance within Amazon EC2 and to Amazon S3. 75MB/s
between EC2 instances, 10.2MB/s between EC2 and S3 for download, 6.9MB/s

compute cloud) has added newinstance types(the class of machine you can rent)
with more CPU and more RAM, I thought it would be interesting to take a look
out how their pricing stacks up.The quick conclusion:the more you scale the
more you save. A six node co</p><p>2 0.95862794 <a title="195-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-02-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_2%2C_2010.html">851 high scalability-2010-07-02-Hot Scalability Links for July 2, 2010</a></p>

really nice and practical tutorial of how to use CloudFront as your
CDN.breakUpdate 8:Akamai’s Services Become Affordable for Anyone! Blazing Web
Site Performance by Distribution Cloud.Distribution Cloud starts at $150 per

Eberhard: The gene does not lead, it follows.@waldojaquith: To an ant, gravity
is nothing, but surface tension is a powerful force. When you change scale,
you play by different rules.Nicholas Christakis: The spread of germs is the
price we pay for the spread of ideas. We assemble ourselves into networks to
facilitate the flow information but we pay a price, the spread of
disease.James Mickens: When you debug a distributed system or an OS kernel,
you do it Texas-style. You gather some mean, stoic people, people who have
seen things die, and you get some primitive tools, like a compass and a
rucksack and a stick that's pointed on one end, and you walk into the
wilderness and you look for trouble.Joe McMahon: The average small startup in

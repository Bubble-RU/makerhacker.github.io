<p>Introduction: The Google Operating System blog has aninteresting poston Google's scale based
on an updated version of Google's paper about MapReduce.The input data for
some of the MapReduce jobs run in September 2007 was 403,152 TB (terabytes),
the average number of machines allocated for a MapReduce job was 394, while
the average completion time was 6 minutes and a half. The paper mentions that
Google's indexing system processes more than 20 TB of raw data.breakNiall
Kennedy calculates that the average MapReduce job runs across a $1 million
hardware infrastructure, assuming that Google still uses the same cluster
configurations from 2004: two 2 GHz Intel Xeon processors with Hyper-Threading
enabled, 4 GB of memory, two 160 GB IDE hard drives and a gigabit Ethernet
link.Greg Linden notices that Google's infrastructure is an important
competitive advantage. "Anyone at Google can process terabytes of data. And
they can get their results back in about 10 minutes, so they can iterate on it

<p>Introduction: Update 3:A Comparison of Approaches to Large-Scale Data Analysis: MapReduce
vs. DBMS Benchmarks.Although the process to load data into and tune the
execution of parallel DBMSs took much longer than the MR system, the observed
performance of these DBMSs was strikingly better.Update 2:H-Store: A Next
Generation OLTP DBMSis the project implementing the ideas in this paper:The
goal of the H-Store project is to investigate how these architectural and
application shifts affect the performance of OLTP databases, and to study what
performance benefits would be possible with a complete redesign of OLTP
systems in light of these trends. Our early results show that a simple
prototype built from scratch using modern assumptions can outperform current
commercial DBMS offerings by around a factor of 80 on OLTP workloads.Update:

<p>Introduction: When you have a large population of servers you have both the opportunity and
the incentive to perform interesting studies. Authors from Google and the
University of California in Optimizing Google's Warehouse Scale Computers: The
NUMA Experience conducted such a study, taking a look at how jobs run on
clusters of machines using a NUMA architecture. Since NUMA is common on server
class machines it's a topic of general interest for those looking to maximize
machine utilization across clusters.Some of the results are surprising:The
methodology of how to attribute such fine performance variations to NUMA
effects within such a complex system is perhaps more interesting than the
results themselves. Well worth reading just for that story.The performance
swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on
Intel Westmere for Web-search frontend. Memory locality is not always King.
Because of the interaction between NUMA and cache sharing/contention it turns
out differe</p><p>4 0.64710212 <a title="164-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-10-When_optimizing_-_don%27t_forget_the_Java_Virtual_Machine_%28JVM%29_.html">701 high scalability-2009-09-10-When optimizing - don't forget the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently, I was working on a project that was coming to a close. It was
related to optimizing a database using a Java based in-memory cache to reduce
the load. The application had to process up to a million objects per day and
was characterized by its heavy use of memory and the high number of read,
write and update operations. These operations were found to be the most
costly, which meant that optimization efforts were concentrated here.The
project had already achieved impressive performance increases, but one
question remained unanswered - would changing the JVM increase
performance?Read more at:http://bigdatamatters.com/bigdatamatters/2009/08/jvm-

<p>Introduction: InZen And The Art Of Scaling - A Koan And Epigram Approach,Russell
Sullivanoffered an interesting conjecture: there are 20 classic bottlenecks.
This sounds suspiciously like the idea that there only20 basic story plots.
And depending on how you chunkify things, it may be true, but in practice we
all know bottlenecks come in infinite flavors, all tasting of sour and ash.One
dayAurelien Broszniowskifrom Terracotta emailed me his list of bottlenecks, we
cc'ed Russell in on the conversation, he gave me his list, I have a list, and
here's the resulting stone soup.Russell said this is his "I wish I knew when I
was younger" list and I think that's an enriching way to look at it. The more
experience you have, the more different types of projects you tackle, the more
lessons you'll be able add to a list like this. So when you read this list,
and when you make your own, you are stepping through years of accumulated
experience and more than a little frustration, but in each there is a story

<p>Introduction: I have some experience with a very large OLTP system that is 7+ TB in size and
performs very well for 30K+ concurrent users. It is built using Intersystems
Cache based on the very old but very scalable MUMPS platform. Why don't I see
more discussions about archiectures such as these in this forum? I am curious
why this platform scales so much better then the typical RDBMS.</p><p>2 0.85537452 <a title="164-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-05-Pairing_NoSQL_and_Relational_Data_Storage%3A_MySQL_with_MongoDB.html">872 high scalability-2010-08-05-Pairing NoSQL and Relational Data Storage: MySQL with MongoDB</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've largely steered clear of publicly commenting on the "NoSQL vs.
Relational" conflict. Keeping in mind that this argument is more about
currently available solutions and the features their developers have chosen to
build in, I'd like to dig into this and provide a decidedly neutral viewpoint.
In fact, by erring on the side of caution, I've inadvertently given myself
plenty of time to consider the pros and cons of both data storage approaches,
and although my mind was initially swaying toward the NoSQL camp, I can say
with a fair amount of certainty, that I've found a good compromise. You can
read the full storehere.</p><p>3 0.8122288 <a title="164-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-16-Mogulus_Doesn%27t_Own_a_Single_Server_and_has_%241.2_million_in_funding%2C_15%2C000_People_Creating_Channels.html">156 high scalability-2007-11-16-Mogulus Doesn't Own a Single Server and has $1.2 million in funding, 15,000 People Creating Channels</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scoblethe Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video
channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that
have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things
you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off
the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.For a strategy hit
he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about
when makingFeedBlendr:One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services
you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up
and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up
and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He
told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in
designing their architecture.</p><p>4 0.80021554 <a title="164-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-14-When_all_the_Program%27s_a_Graph_-_Prismatic%27s_Plumbing_Library.html">1406 high scalability-2013-02-14-When all the Program's a Graph - Prismatic's Plumbing Library</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all
programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.Then you may observe after
coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form
of interacting patterns of flows.Then you may think hey, a program isn't only
useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and
that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over
data and flow over other flows.That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making
available in the Graph extension to their plumbing package (code examples),
which is described in an excellent post:Graph: Abstractions for Structured
Computation.You may remember Prismatic from previous profile we did on
HighScalability: Prismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning On Social
Networks To Figure Out What You Should Read On The Web. We learned how
Prismatic, an interest driven content suggestion service, builds programs in
terms of graph stuff</p><p>5 0.79510975 <a title="164-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Yslow_to_speed_up_your_web_pages.html">47 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Yslow to speed up your web pages</a></p>

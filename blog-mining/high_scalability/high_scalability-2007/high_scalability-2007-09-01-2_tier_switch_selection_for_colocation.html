<p>Introduction: TGLdelivers Virtual Private Datacenters and virtual private servers from grids
of commodity servers. Each TGL grid consists of a pool of HP servers connected
with a Gigabit backbone network and running 3Tera's AppLogic grid operating
system.With a Virtual Private Datacenter, you get complete control of your own
private grid. Using our visual interface, you set up and assemble disposable
virtual infrastructure, including firewalls, load balancers, web servers,
database servers, NAS boxes, etc. visually, by pointing and clicking. You can
build advanced clusters, deploy large and small applications, and save them as
templates that can be provisioned in minutes. You can even build your own
virtual servers and appliances.</p><p>6 0.12630856 <a title="78-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-13-How_is_Berkely_DB_fare_against_other_Key-Value_Database.html">704 high scalability-2009-09-13-How is Berkely DB fare against other Key-Value Database</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We
are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple
(any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would
be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally
there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database
server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that
particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and
how you resolved it?Thanks,Scott</p><p>4 0.62694812 <a title="78-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-13-How_is_Berkely_DB_fare_against_other_Key-Value_Database.html">704 high scalability-2009-09-13-How is Berkely DB fare against other Key-Value Database</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi all!So nice to start discussing cool things in this even cooler forum :)I
am having a problem .. which i believe is already solved but i would love
someone confirming actual experience with the same topic.We are building a
client / server architecture, consisting of a web server part and many
clients.Transport will be provided as either XML-RPC / SOAP / JSON or all at
once.All of the communication has to be encrypted and passed within SSL3.We
expect a high load when the application starts (> 2000 concurrent
requests).Combine this with xml parsing for the rpc api, things really look
ugly :)So it's a big mess :)It will not be that much database bound behind the
api - mostly files will be transferred from the server to the clients and
simple api for control.So it's pretty much a matter of 'what-to-do-with-ssl'.I
was thinking of hardware - NetApp or a similar application accelerator.Can
anyone give examples of a hardware piece that combines: Load balancer / SSL
accelerator?I have also b</p><p>6 0.57132787 <a title="78-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com.html">177 high scalability-2007-12-08-thesimsonstage.ea.com</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Inspired by axkcd comic,Peter Norvig,Director of Research at Google and all
around interesting and nice guy, has created an above par code kata involving
a regex program that demonstrates the core inner loop of many successful
systems profiled on HighScalability.The original code is atxkcd 1313: Regex
Golf, which comes up with an algorithm to find a short regex that matches the
winners and not the losers from two arbitrary lists. The Python code is
readable, the process is TDDish, and the problem, which sounds simple, but
soon explodes into regex weirdness, as does most regex code. If you find
regular expressions confusing you'll definitely benefit from Peter's
deliberate strategy for finding a regex.The post demonstrating the iterated
improvement of the program is atxkcd 1313: Regex Golf (Part 2: Infinite
Problems). As with most first solutions it wasn't optimal. To improve the
program Peter recommends the following steps: Profiling: Figure out where the
program spends its time. Speed</p><p>2 0.8141458 <a title="78-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-13-Design_Preparations_for_Scaling.html">91 high scalability-2007-09-13-Design Preparations for Scaling</a></p>

What Can You Do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Google made a right move by adding web-speed to the search engine ranking.
With this change site latency does't just impact the user experience but it
will determine where you will be placed in google search results.This move
could be a real game changer as it bring site latency and scalability to the
front stage. Sites will not only compete on content but on thier performance.
It is now clear that site performance have much more direct impact on our
business (as appose to indirect impact resulted in user expereince) then ever
before.In this post i try to provide some architecture guide line on how to
control and improve site latency under scale based on a discussion with a
leading eCommerce site the Netherland.See detailed story  here</p><p>4 0.78435326 <a title="78-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-07-Six_Lessons_Learned_Deploying_a_Large-scale_Infrastructure_in_Amazon_EC2_.html">559 high scalability-2009-04-07-Six Lessons Learned Deploying a Large-scale Infrastructure in Amazon EC2 </a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread
pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is
tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal
variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user
id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the
code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to
pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought isclass ReferenceIdGenerator
{public static setReferenceId(String login) {threadLocal.set(login +
System.currentMillis());}public static String getReferenceId() {return
threadLocal.get();}private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =new
ThreadLocal();}class MySevlet {void service(.....) {HttpSession session =
request.getSession(false);String userId =
session.get("userId");ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId);try
{doSomething();}finally {ReferenceIdGenerator.remove();}}This method is also</p><p>6 0.77280289 <a title="78-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-15-Sun_Customer_Ready_HPC_Cluster%3A_Reference_Configurations_with_Sun_Fire_X2200_M2_and_X2100_M2_Servers.html">418 high scalability-2008-10-15-Sun Customer Ready HPC Cluster: Reference Configurations with Sun Fire X2200 M2 and X2100 M2 Servers</a></p>

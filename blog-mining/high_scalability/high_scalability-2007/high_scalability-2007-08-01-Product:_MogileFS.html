Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of

replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not

is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other

<p>Introduction: This is the third guest post (part 1,part 2) of a series by Greg Lindahl, CTO
of blekko, the spam free search engine. Previously, Greg was Founder and
Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was the architect of the
InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build tightly-coupled
supercomputing clusters.blekko's home-grown NoSQL database was designed from
the start to support a web-scale search engine, with 1,000s of servers and
petabytes of disk. Data replication is a very important part of keeping the
database up and serving queries. Like many NoSQL database authors, we decided
to keep R=3 copies of each piece of data in the database, and not use RAID to
improve reliability. The key goal we were shooting for was a database which
degrades gracefully when there are many small failures over time, without
needing human intervention.Why don't we like RAID for big NoSQL databases?Most
big storage systems use RAID levels like 3, 4, 5, or 10 to improve
reliability. A conservativ</p><p>4 0.13020517 <a title="53-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-06-10-The_10_Deadly_Sins_Against_Scalability.html">1473 high scalability-2013-06-10-The 10 Deadly Sins Against Scalability</a></p>

earlier 5 Things That are Toxic to Scalability, make for a numerologically
satisfying 10 sins again scalability:Slow Disk I/O - RAID 5- Multi-tenant EBS.
Use RAID 10, it provides  good protection along with good read and write
performance. The design of RAID 5 means poor performance and long repair times
on failure. On AWS consider Provisioned IOPS as a way around IO
bottlenecks.Using the database for Queuing.The database may seem like the
perfect place to keep work queues, but under load locking and scanning
overhead kills performance. Use specialized products like RabbitMQ and SQS to
remove this bottleneck.Using Database for full-text searching.Search seems
like another perfect database feature. At scale search doesn't perform well.

<p>Introduction: Pomegranateis a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular
storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at
increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support
applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high
concurrency, high throughput, and low latency. Their tests seem to indicate it
works:We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well
for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observedlinearly
increased more than100,000aggregate read and write requests served per second
(RPS). Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V
store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system
API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use.
Every application could use it out of the box.The features of Pomegranate
are:It handles billions of small files efficiently, even in one directory;It
provide separate and</p><p>5 0.65183103 <a title="53-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-28-Kosmos_File_System_%28KFS%29_is_a_New_High_End_Google_File_System_Option.html">103 high scalability-2007-09-28-Kosmos File System (KFS) is a New High End Google File System Option</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There's a new clustered file system on the spindle:Kosmos File System (KFS).
Thanks to Rich Skrenta for turning me on to KFS and I think his blogpostsays
it all. KFS is an open source project written in C++ by search startupKosmix.
The team members have a goodpedigreeso there's a better than average chance
this software will be worth considering.After you stop trying to turn KFS into
"Kentucky Fried File System" in your mind, take a look at KFS' intriguing
feature set:breakIncremental scalability: New chunkserver nodes can be added
as storage needs increase; the system automatically adapts to the new
nodes.Availability: Replication is used to provide availability due to chunk
server failures. Typically, files are replicated 3-way.Per file degree of
replication: The degree of replication is configurable on a per file basis,
with a max. limit of 64.Re-replication: Whenever the degree of replication for
a file drops below the configured amount (such as, due to an extended

<p>Introduction: Sequoiais a transparent middleware solution offering clustering, load
balancing and failover services for any database. Sequoia is the continuation
of the C-JDBC project. The database is distributed and replicated among
several nodes and Sequoia balances the queries among these nodes. Sequoia
handles node and network failures with transparent failover. It also provides
support for hot recovery, online maintenance operations and online
upgrades.Features in a nutshellNo modification of existing applications or
databases.Operational with any database providing a JDBC driver.High
availability provided by advanced RAIDb technology.Transparent failover and
recovery capabilities.Performance scalability with unique load balancing and
query result caching features.Integrated JMX-based administration and
monitoring.100% Java implementation allowing portability across platforms with
a JRE 1.4 or greater.Open source licensed under Apache v2 license.Professional
support, training and consulting pro</p><p>5 0.78043544 <a title="53-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-01-Podcast_about_Facebook%27s_Cassandra_Project_and_the_New_Wave_of_Distributed_Databases.html">646 high scalability-2009-07-01-Podcast about Facebook's Cassandra Project and the New Wave of Distributed Databases</a></p>

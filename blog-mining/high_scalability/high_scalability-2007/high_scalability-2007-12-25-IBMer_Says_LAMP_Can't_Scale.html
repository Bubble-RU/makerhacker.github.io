<p>Introduction: This was the first architecture profile on HighScalability. IMHO LiveJournal
was really the start of the openness on how to build stuff at scale, setting
the whole industry off with an excellent role model. They wrote about their
architecture, they open sourced their tools, they showed that success wasn't
based on keeping secrets, and they set forth principles still followed by our
rather amazing industry. No other industry is so open and cooperative, with
their eyes cast so far forward, intent on building cool stuff. When all around
seems dark it would be good to keep this little bit of light in mind...A
fascinating and detailed story of how LiveJournal evolved their system to
scale. LiveJournal was an early player in the free blog service race and faced
issues from quickly adding a large number of users. Blog posts come fast and
furious which causes a lot of writes and writes are particularly hard to

<p>Introduction: Memcached is one of the most common In-Memory cache implementation.  It was
originally developed by Danga Interactive for LiveJournal, but is now used by
many other sites as a side cache to speed up read mostly operations. It gained
popularity in the non-Java world, too, especially since it's a language-
neutral side cache for which few alternatives existed.  As a side-cache,
Memcache clients relies on the database as the system of record, The database
is still used for write,update and complex query operations.  Since the
memcached specification includes no query operations, memcached is not a
database alternative, unlike most of the NoSQL offerings. It also exclude
memcache from being a real solution for write scalability. As a result of that
many of the heavy sites started to move away from Memcache and replace it with
other NoSQL alternatives as noted in a recent highscalability post MySQL And

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add
cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case.
Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we
don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL
hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to
deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is

Fotolog inSecrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success, which was one of my personal
favorites.Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site
nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog
has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G

<p>Introduction: Michael Nygard talks aboutTwo Ways To Boost Your Flagging Web Site. The idea
behind cache farms is to move memory devoted to the various caching layers
into one large farm of caches, as with memcached. The idea behind read pools
is to allocate your database read requests to a pool of dedicated read
servers, thus offloading the write server. Using a combination of the
strategies you aren't forced to scale up the database tier to scale your
website.</p><p>3 0.67394978 <a title="192-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-17-Scaling_Django_Web_Apps_by_Mike_Malone.html">602 high scalability-2009-05-17-Scaling Django Web Apps by Mike Malone</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++
to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development
productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and
platform independence (Java Bytecode). They may even have gotten better
throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and
application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking
applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution,
you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor.
Why? Because of the unpredictable pauses introduced by the garbage collector
which result in significant jitter (variance of execution time).In this post
Frederic Pariente Engineering Manager at Sun Microsystems posted a summary of
a case study on how the use of Sun Real Time JVM and GigaSpaces was used in
the context of of a customer proof-of-concept this summer to ensureguaranteed

<p>Introduction: A very entertaining and somewhat educational article onIBM Poopheads say LAMP
UsersNeed to "grow up". The physical three tier architecture turns out to be
the root of all evil and shared nothing architectures brings simplicity and
light.In the commentsSimon Willisonmakes an insightful comment on why fine
grained caching works for personalized pages and proxy's don't:Great post, but
I have to disagree with you on the finely grained caching part. If you look at
big LAMP deployments such as Flickr, LiveJournal and Facebook the common
technology component that enables them to scale is memcached - a tool for
finely grained caching. That's not to say that they aren't doing shared-
nothing, it's just that memcached is critical for helping the database layer
scale. LiveJournal serves around 50% of its page views "permission controlled"
(friends only) so an HTTP proxy on the front end isn't the right solution -
but memcached reduces their database hits by 90%.</p><p>4 0.83146137 <a title="192-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-13-Still_Time_to_Attend_My_Webinar_Tomorrow%3A_What_Should_I_Do%3F_Choosing_SQL%2C_NoSQL_or_Both_for_Scalable_Web_Applications.html">957 high scalability-2010-12-13-Still Time to Attend My Webinar Tomorrow: What Should I Do?

cutting off my hair and joining a monastery, nor does it mean buying a cherry
red convertible (yet), it means doing a webinar!On December 14th, 2:00 PM -
3:00 PM EST, I'll be hosting What Should I Do? Choosing SQL, NoSQL or Both for
Scalable Web Applications.The webinar is sponsored by VoltDB, but it will be
completely vendor independent, as that's the only honor preserving and
technically accurate way of doing these things.The webinar will run about 60
minutes, with 40 minutes of speechifying and 20 minutes for questions.The
hashtag for the event on Twitter will beSQLNoSQL. I'll be monitoring that
hashtag if you have any suggestions for the webinar or if you would like to
ask questions during the webinar. The motivation for me to do the webinar was

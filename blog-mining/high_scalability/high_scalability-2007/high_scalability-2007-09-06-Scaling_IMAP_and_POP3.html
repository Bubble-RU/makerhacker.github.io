<p>Introduction: Perditionis a fully featured POP3 and IMAP4 proxy server. It is able to handle
both SSL and non-SSL connections and redirect users to a real-server based on
a database lookup. Perdition supports modular based database access. ODBC,
MySQL, PostgreSQL, GDBM, POSIX Regular Expression and NIS modules ship with
the distribution. The API for modules is open allowing arbitrary modules to be
written to allow access to any data store.Perdition has many uses. Including,
creating large mail systems where an end-user's mailbox may be stored on one
of several hosts, integrating different mail systems together, migrating
between different email infrastructures, and bridging plain-text, SSL and TLS
services. It can also be used as part of a firewall. The use of perditon to
scale mail services beyond a single box is discussed in high capacity email.</p><p>4 0.13832207 <a title="81-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

for?Lavabit is a mid-sized email service provider. We currently have about
140,000 registered users with more than 260,000 email addresses. While most of
our accounts belong to individual users, we also provide corporate email
services to approximately 70 companies.Why did you decide to build this

<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from
over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle
ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the greatMapReduce Versus Database War,
you would be correct.Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail
division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved
their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each
machine approach, to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just
couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that
works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability
potential.Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data
streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful
with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text
files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each
individual machine. Then came a</p><p>6 0.10161509 <a title="81-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-12-MySpace_Architecture.html">511 high scalability-2009-02-12-MySpace Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In 1999 Dan Kegel issued a big hairy audacious challenge to web servers:It's
time for web servers to handle ten thousand clients simultaneously, don't you
think? After all, the web is a big place now.This became known as theC10K
problem. Engineers solved the C10K scalability problems by fixing OS kernels
and moving away from threaded servers like Apache to event-driven servers like
Nginx and Node.Today we are considering an even bigger goal, how to support10
Million Concurrent Connections, which requires even more radical techniques.No
similar challenge was issued for managing servers in a datacenter, but
according toDave Nearyfrom Red Hat, in a recentFLOSS Weekly episode, we have
passed the 10K barrier for server management with 10,000 or more servers
managed per sysadmin.Should we let this milestone pass without
mention?Absolutely not! It's a stunning accomplishment with 200x-2000x
increases in productivity. Dave said he remembered in the 1990s it took one
sysadmin to manage 4 or 5 W</p><p>5 0.62181884 <a title="81-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-09-Lots_of_questions_for_high_scalability_-_high_availability.html">63 high scalability-2007-08-09-Lots of questions for high scalability - high availability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey,I do have a website that I would like to scale. Right now we have 10
servers but this does not scale well.I know how to deal with my apache web
servers but have problems with sql servers.I would like to use the "scale out"
system and add servers when we need. We have over 100Gb of data for mysql and
we tried to have around 20G per server. It works well except that if a server
goes down then 1/5 of the user can't access the website. We could use
replication but we would need to at least double sql servers to replicate each
server. And maybe in the future it's not gonna be enough we would need maybe 3
slaves per master ... well I don't really like this idea.I would prefer to
have 8 servers that all deal with data from the 5 servers we have right now
and then we could add new servers when we need. I looked at NFS but that does
not seem to be a good idea for SQL servers ? Can you confirm?</p><p>6 0.603104 <a title="81-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-08-13-In_Memoriam%3A_Lavabit_Architecture_-_Creating_a_Scalable_Email_Service.html">1501 high scalability-2013-08-13-In Memoriam: Lavabit Architecture - Creating a Scalable Email Service</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail
system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded
architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each
with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies
(Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers . The benefit of this
approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA loadbalancing on the
perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move
accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users).
Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has
MySQL support. What we also liked about this approach was that it had no
dependency on a distributed or networked filesystem, so less chance of
corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches
capacity, we just off load users to a less used server. If any server goes
offline, it only affects the fraction of users</p><p>same-blog 2 0.87129635 <a title="81-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling_IMAP_and_POP3.html">81 high scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling IMAP and POP3</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Terrastoreis a new-born document store which provides advanced scalability and
elasticity features without sacrificing consistency.Here are a few
highlights:Ubiquitous: based on the universally supported HTTP
protocol.Distributed: nodes can run and live everywhere on your
network.Elastic: you can add and remove nodes dynamically to/from your running
cluster with no downtime and no changes at all to your configuration.Scalable
at the data layer: documents are partitioned and distributed among your nodes,
with automatic and transparent re-balancing when nodes join and leave.Scalable
at the computational layer: query and update operations are distributed to the
nodes which actually holds the queried/updated data, minimizing network
traffic and spreading computational load.Consistent: providing per-document
consistency, you're guaranteed to always get the latest value of a single
document, with read committed isolation for concurrent
modifications.Schemaless: providing a collection-based i</p><p>6 0.79797971 <a title="81-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-13-10_Hot_Scalability_Links_for_January_13%2C_2010.html">760 high scalability-2010-01-13-10 Hot Scalability Links for January 13, 2010</a></p>

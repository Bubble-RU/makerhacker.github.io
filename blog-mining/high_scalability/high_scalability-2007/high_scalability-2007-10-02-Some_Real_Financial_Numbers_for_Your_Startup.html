<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by BugSense Founder/CTO Jon Vlachogiannisand Head of
Infrastructure at BugSensePanagiotis Papadomitsos.There has been a lot of
speculation and assumptions around whetherPRISMexists and if it is cost
effective. I don't know whether it exists or not, but I can tell you if it
could be built.Short answer: It can.If you believe it would be impossible for
someone with access to a social "datapool" to find out more about you (if they
really want to track you down) in the tsunami of data, you need to think
again.Devices, apps and websites are transmitting data. Lots of data. The
questions are could the data compiled and searched and how costly would it be
to search for your targeted data. (hint: It is not $4.56 trillion).Let's
experiment and try to build PRISM by ourselves with a few
assumptions:Assumption 1: We have all the appropriate "data connectors" that
will provide us with data.Assumption 2: These connectors provide direct access
to social networks, emails, mobile t</p><p>3 0.09525723 <a title="107-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-14-CLOUD_%26_GRID_EVENT_BY_THE_ONLINE_GAMING_HIGH_SCALABILITY_SIG.html">629 high scalability-2009-06-14-CLOUD & GRID EVENT BY THE ONLINE GAMING HIGH SCALABILITY SIG</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The first meeting of this Online Gaming High Scalability SIG will be on the
9th of July 2009 in central London, starting at 10 AM and finishing around
5PM.The main topic of this meeting will be potentials for using cloud and grid
technologies in online gaming systems. In addition to experience reports from
the community, we have invited some of the leading cloud experts in the UK to
discuss the benefits such as resource elasticity and challenges such as
storage and security that companies from other industries have experienced. We
will have a track for IT managers focused on business opportunities and issues
and a track for architects and developers more focused on implementation
issues.The event is free but up-front registration is required for capacity
planning, so please let us know in advance, if you are planning to attend by
completing the registration form on this pageTo propose a talk or for
programme enquiries, contact meetings [at] gamingscalability [dot] org.Note:

<p>Introduction: Robert Scoble in an often poignantFriendFeed threadcommiserating PodTech's
unfortunate end, shared what he learned about creating a successful startup.
Here's a summary of a Robert's rules and why Machiavelli just may agree with
them:Have a story.Have everyone on board with that story.If anyone goes off of
that story, make sure they get on board immediately or fire them.Make sure
people are judged by the revenues they bring in. Those that bring in revenues
should get to run the place. People who don't bring in revenues should get
fewer and fewer responsibilities, not more and more.Work ONLY for a leader who
will make the tough decisions.Build a place where excellence is expected,
allowed, and is enabled.Fire idiots quickly.If your engineering team can't
give a media team good measurements, the entire company is in trouble. Only
things that are measured ever get improved.When your stars aren't listened to
the company is in trouble.Getting rid of the CEO, even if it's all his fault,

<p>Introduction: Khan Academyis a non profit company started bySalman Khanwith the Big Hairy
Audacious Goal of providing a free, world class education to anyone, anywhere,
anytime. That's a lot of knowledge. Having long been inspired and captivated
by the Khan Academy, I was really curious to know how they plan to do it.Ben
Kamens, lead developer at Khan Academy, gives the somewhat surprising answer
in an interview:How to Scale your Startup to Millions of Users.Theshort
answer: develop a strong team, focus on features, letGoogle App Enginedo the
heavy lifting.Some people seem to be turned off by all the GAE love in the
interview. Part of it is that the interviewer is Fred Sauer, Developer
Advocate for Google App Engine, so there's a level of familiarity between the
two. But the biggest part is simply that they really like GAE, for all the
reasons your are supposed to like GAE. And that's OK. In this day and age you
are free to love whichever platform you choose.Biggest surprise:A profile on

5:Damn You Google, Damn You Yahoo! Why D'Ya Do This to Us? Free accounts on a
cloud platform are a constant drain of money.Update 4:Caching becomes even
more important inCPU based billing environments. Avoiding the CPU means saving
money.Update 3:An interesting simple example of this idea showed up on the
Google AppEngine list. With one paging algorithm and one use of AJAX the
yearly cost of the site was $1000. By changing those algorithms the site went
under quota and became free again. This will make life a lot more interesting

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:Now that we have a new computing paradigm,
Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data
vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds?
Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space,
and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still
seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids
versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are
a number of issues driving this uncertainty.read more at:BigDataMatters.com</p><p>2 0.99600369 <a title="107-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-23-When_to_migrate_your_database%3F.html">782 high scalability-2010-02-23-When to migrate your database?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming
your business - reports are out of date, your batch processing window is
nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database
consolidation - remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database
environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware,
OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are
clear,  what now?ÄÅ¥Å¼Read more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>3 0.9947511 <a title="107-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-14-Paper%3A_Pig_Latin%3A_A_Not-So-Foreign_Language_for_Data_Processing.html">443 high scalability-2008-11-14-Paper: Pig Latin: A Not-So-Foreign Language for Data Processing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo has developed a new language called Pig Latin that fit in a sweet spot
between high-level declarative querying in the spirit of SQL, and low-level,
procedural programming `a la map-reduce and combines best of both worlds.The
accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into
physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce
implementation. Pig has just graduated from the Apache Incubator and joined
Hadoop as a subproject.The paper has a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo!
are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the development and
execution of their data analysis tasks, compared tousing Hadoop
directly.References:Apache Pig Wiki</p><p>4 0.99138421 <a title="107-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-12-Should_I_use_LAMP_or_Windows%3F.html">8 high scalability-2007-07-12-Should I use LAMP or Windows?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi, I stumbled on your site and I am thinking about starting a website. I
haven't received a good answer about what I should use to buildit, so I
thought I would give it a shot.I am a windows guy. I know .Net and ASP and how
to build web sites using that stack. But I notice most sites use LAMP and
that's what most people talk about using. What's wrong with using Windows?.Net

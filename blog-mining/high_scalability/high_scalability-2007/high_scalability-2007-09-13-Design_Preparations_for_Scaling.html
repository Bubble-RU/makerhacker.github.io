<p>Introduction: Hi, I stumbled on your site and I am thinking about starting a website. I
haven't received a good answer about what I should use to buildit, so I
thought I would give it a shot.I am a windows guy. I know .Net and ASP and how
to build web sites using that stack. But I notice most sites use LAMP and
that's what most people talk about using. What's wrong with using Windows?.Net

I'm investigating solutions for storing uploaded photos from users - not too
many, probably in the low thousands. The site is commercial so I'm straying
away from the Flickrs of the world. S3 seems to offer a solution but I'd like
to hear from those who have used it before.ThanksAndy</p><p>6 0.1420891 <a title="91-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-31-Need_help_on_Site_loading_%26_database_optimization_-_URGENT.html">611 high scalability-2009-05-31-Need help on Site loading & database optimization - URGENT</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site
has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this
day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out
the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was
taking too much load.There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my
database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I
have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain
PHP/HTML coding is used.Technology:PHP -- 5.2MYSQL -- 5.0Apache --

<p>Introduction: Find out with Builtwith.com. It scans a site and guesses how the site is
built. I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows, PHP, Adsense, RSS,
CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have
guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which
AJAX library is used. Though it's kind of cool to see which sites use PHP and
other technologies.</p><p>5 0.69735098 <a title="91-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-01-S3_for_image_storing.html">199 high scalability-2008-01-01-S3 for image storing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The reference configurations described in this blueprint are starting points
for building Sun Customer Ready HPC Clusters configured with Sun Fire X2100 M2
and X2200 M2 servers. The configurations define how Sun Systems Group products
can be configured in a typical grid rack deployment. This document describes
configurations in detail using Sun Fire X2100 M2 and X2200 M2 servers with a
Gigabit Ethernet data fabric, as well as configurations using Sun Fire X2200
M2 servers with a high-speed InfiniBand fabric. These configurations focus on
single rack solutions, with external connections through uplink ports of the
switches.These reference configurations have been architected using Sun's
expertise gained in actual, real-world installations. Within certain
constraints, as described in the later sections, the system can be tailored to
the customer needs. Certain system components described in this document are
only available through Sun's factory integration. Although the information

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>5 0.81238824 <a title="91-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-07-Using_ThreadLocal_to_pass_context_information_around_in_web_applications.html">115 high scalability-2007-10-07-Using ThreadLocal to pass context information around in web applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,In java web servers, each http request is handled by a thread in thread
pool. So for a Servlet handling the request, a thread is assigned. It is
tempting (and very convinient) to keep context information in the threadlocal
variable. I recently had a requirement where we need to assign logged in user
id and timestamp to request sent to web services. Because we already had the
code in place, it was extremely difficult to change the method signatures to
pass user id everywhere. The solution I thought isclass ReferenceIdGenerator
{public static setReferenceId(String login) {threadLocal.set(login +
System.currentMillis());}public static String getReferenceId() {return
threadLocal.get();}private static ThreadLocal threadLocal =new
ThreadLocal();}class MySevlet {void service(.....) {HttpSession session =
request.getSession(false);String userId =
session.get("userId");ReferenceIdGenerator.setRefernceId(userId);try

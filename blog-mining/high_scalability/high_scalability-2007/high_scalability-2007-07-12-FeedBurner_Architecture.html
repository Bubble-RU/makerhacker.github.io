<p>Introduction: A man had a dream. His dream was to blend a bunch of RSS/Atom/RDF feeds into a
single feed. The man is Beau Lebens ofFeedvilleand like most dreamers he was a
little short on coin. So he took refuge in the home of a cheap hosting
provider and Beau realized his dream, creatingFEEDblendr. But FEEDblendr
chewed up so much CPU creating blended feeds that the cheap hosting provider
ordered Beau to find another home. Where was Beau to go? He eventually found a
new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how
Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of
affordable CPU cycles.Site: http://feedblendr.com/The PlatformEC2 (Fedora Core
6 Lite distro)S3ApachePHPMySQLDynDNS (for round robin DNS)The StatsBeau is a
developer with some sysadmin skills, not a web server admin, so a lot of
learning was involved in creating FEEDblendr.FEEDblendr uses 2 EC2 instances.

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just
post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to get the r</p><p>5 0.14108966 <a title="7-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling_Pinterest_-_From_0_to_10s_of_Billions_of_Page_Views_a_Month_in_Two_Years.html">1440 high scalability-2013-04-15-Scaling Pinterest - From 0 to 10s of Billions of Page Views a Month in Two Years</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pinterest has been riding an exponential growth curve, doubling every month
and half. They've gone from 0 to 10s of billions of page views a month in two
years, from 2 founders and one engineer to over 40 engineers, from one little
MySQL server to 180 Web Engines, 240 API Engines, 88 MySQL DBs (cc2.8xlarge) +
1 slave each, 110 Redis Instances, and 200 Memcache Instances.Stunning growth.
So what's Pinterest's story? To tell their story we have our bards,
Pinterest'sYashwanth NelapatiandMarty Weiner, who tell the dramatic story of
Pinterest's architecture evolution in a talk titledScaling Pinterest. This is
the talk they would have liked to hear a year and half ago when they were
scaling fast and there were a lot of options to choose from. And they made a
lot of incorrect choices.This is a great talk. It's full of amazing details.
It's also very practical, down to earth, and it contains strategies adoptable
by nearly anyone. Highly recommended.Two of my favorite lessons from the
talk:Arc</p><p>6 0.13382237 <a title="7-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-04-Digg_Architecture.html">554 high scalability-2009-04-04-Digg Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TypePad is considered the largest paid blogging service in the world. After
experience problems because of their meteoric growth, they eventually
transitioned to an architecture patterned after their sister company,
LiveJournal.Site: http://www.typepad.com/The
PlatformMySQLMemcachedPerlMogileFSApacheLinuxThe StatsAs of 2005 TypePad sends
250mbps of traffic using multiple network pipes for 3TB of traffic a day. They
were growing by 10-20% each month. I was unable to find more recent
statistics.The ArchitectureOriginal Architecture:- Single server running
Linux, Apache, Postgres, Perl, mod_perl- Storage was NFS on a filer.A
Devastating Crash Caused a New Direction- A RAID controller failed and spewed
data across all RAID disks.- The database was corrupted and the backups were

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO ofPlaytomic. Playtomic is a game
analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games
played by approximately 20 million people daily.Here's a good summary quote by
Ben Lowry on Hacker News:Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday
700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is
integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just
yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people
operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated
a whole bunch of them very cheaply.Playtomic began with an almost exclusively
Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being
replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire
platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then
spread to second dedicated, then the API server was offloaded to a VPS
provider and 4 - 6 fairl</p><p>5 0.76440173 <a title="7-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-06-The_Design_of_99designs_-_A_Clean_Tens_of_Millions_Pageviews_Architecture.html">1188 high scalability-2012-02-06-The Design of 99designs - A Clean Tens of Millions Pageviews Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: 99designs is a crowdsourced design contest marketplace based out of Melbourne
Australia. The idea is that if you have a design you need created you create a
contest and designers compete to give you the best design within your
budget.If you are a medium sized commerce site this is a clean example
architecture of a site that reliably supports a lot of users and a complex
workflow on the cloud. Lars Yencken wrote a nicely written overview of the
architecture behind 99designs in Infrastructure at 99designs. Here's a gloss
on their architecture:StatsTeam has 8 devs, 2 dev ops, 2 ux/designersHundreds

<p>Introduction: SummaryIn this presentation, a three steps approach for turning your existing
stateful tier-based/Spring-application into a dynamically scalable services
application using OpenSpaces is demonstrated. The existing programming model
is kept the same while focusing on abstracting and replacing the underlying
implementations of the middleware stack in a way that will fit the scale-out
model.BioNati Shalom is the CTO and Founder ofGigaSpacesand responsible for
the technology roadmap. He has 10 years of experience with distributed
technology and architecture namely CORBA, Jini, J2EE, Grid and SOA. Nati is
the Head of the Israeli Grid consortium and an evangelist of Space Based
Architecture and Data Grid patterns. Blog:Gigaspaces BlogRead the rest of the

<p>Introduction: Comet is anactive distributed key-value storebuilt at the University of
Washington. The paper describing Comet is Comet: An active distributed key-
value store, there are also slides, and a MP3 of a presentation given atOSDI
'10. Here's a succinct overview of Comet:Today's cloud storage services, such
as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety
of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes,
fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility
first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption
keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage
service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their
data's behavior inside the storage service.I found this paper quite
interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-
value store, which turns it into what might called a key-code store. This is

<p>Introduction: Inthis posti wrote my view on the anti SQL database movement and where the
alternative approach fits in:- SQL databases are not going away anytime soon.-
The current "one size fit it all" databases thinking was and is wrong.- There
is definitely a place for a more a more specialized data management solutions
alongside traditional SQL databases.In addition to the options that was
mentioned on the original article i pointed out the the in-memory alternative
approach and how that fits into the puzzle. I used a real life scenario:

<p>Introduction: Cloud-based services for all things digital will either drive - or die by -
bandwidthConsumers, by definition, consume. In the realm of the Internet, they
consume far more than they produce. Or so it's been in the past. Broadband
connectivity across all providers have long offered asymmetric network feeds
because it mirrored reality: an HTTP request is significantly smaller than its
corresponding response, and in general web-based activity is heavily biased
toward fat download and thin upload speeds. The term "broadband" is really a
misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very
narrowband of a typical consumer's upload speed.cloud computing, or to be more
accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the
status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing
all things digital "in the cloud", network providers must consider the impact
on them - and the satisfaction of their customer base with performance over

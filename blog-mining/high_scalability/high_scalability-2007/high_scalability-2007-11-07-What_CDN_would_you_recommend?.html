<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.Why flash rules for databasesThe economics of
flash memory are staggering.If you're not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.
Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory -
less than 100GB - great for in-memory solutions. There's a place for
rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data.
But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option. For
example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive
is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random
4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB
Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated
as slowest, but our internal testing showing solid performance. Most

do we do in that situation?Of course, I am not talking here about the kind of
traffic Digg, Yahoo Buzz or other social media sites can bring to a website,
which is temporary overnight traffic, or a website which uses cloud computing
like Amazon EC2 service, MediaTemple Grid Service or Mosso Hosting Cloud
service.I am talking about traffic that consistently increases over time as
the service achieves success. Google.com, Yahoo.com, Myspace.com,
Facebook.com, Plentyoffish.com, Linkedin.com, Youtube.com and others are
examples of services which have constant high traffic.Knowing that users want
speed from their applications, these services will always use a Content

<p>Introduction: This question is for all the gurus here. Please help this novicexI am starting
a video sharing site like YouTube in India. I want to offer the best quality
possible, at minimum cost. Nothing new about it, right? :).I have done some
research on the dedicated hosting services and CDN services available and I
have some basic knowledge on these.Following are my requirements1) My budget
is $500 to $1000 per month for hosting (including CDN if and as applicable).2)
I will need around 500GB of storage and 1TB per month of bandwidth in first
2-3 months and then about 10TB of storage and 5TB per month of bandwidth. And
more ... depending on how big it gets (I can afford more when it gets big)3)
90% of my viewers are in India. Other 10% are in US and UK.Based on the above,
could you please answer my following questions?1) Can I go with just a good
dedicated server to start with and get a CDN service later on when the site
gets big? Or do you think its wise to start with a CDN service?2) Should I</p><p>3 0.72057748 <a title="144-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-31-Need_help_on_Site_loading_%26_database_optimization_-_URGENT.html">611 high scalability-2009-05-31-Need help on Site loading & database optimization - URGENT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site
has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this
day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out
the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was
taking too much load.There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my
database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I
have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain
PHP/HTML coding is used.Technology:PHP -- 5.2MYSQL -- 5.0Apache --

familiar with Cisco ASA and also familiar with Juniper, Foundry and others. I
also came across snort but haven't used it before. I'm more of looking for an
appliance (for the ease of configuration,support etc...)Could any one share
their thoughts on performane of IPS/IDS from this vendors?Thanks!Janakan

<p>Introduction: Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail
system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded
architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each
with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies
(Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers . The benefit of this
approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA loadbalancing on the
perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move
accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users).
Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has
MySQL support. What we also liked about this approach was that it had no
dependency on a distributed or networked filesystem, so less chance of
corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches
capacity, we just off load users to a less used server. If any server goes
offline, it only affects the fraction of users</p><p>2 0.9479506 <a title="144-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling_IMAP_and_POP3.html">81 high scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling IMAP and POP3</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Professor Lance Fortnow, in his blog post Drowning in Data, says complexity
has taught him this lesson:When storage is expensive, it is cheaper to
recompute what you've already computed. And that's the world we now live in:
Storage is pretty cheap but data acquisition and computation are even
cheaper.Jouni, one of the commenters, thinks the opposite is true:storage is
cheap, but computation is expensive. When you are dealing with massive data,
the size of the data set is very often determined by the amount of computing
power available for a certain price.With such data, a linear-time algorithm
takes O(1) seconds to finish, while a quadratic-time algorithm requires O(n)
seconds. But as computing power increases exponentially over time, the
quadratic algorithm gets exponentially slower.For me it's not a matter of
which is true, both positions can be true, but what's interesting is to think
that storage and computation are in some cases fungible. Your architecture can
decide which tradeof</p><p>6 0.92825693 <a title="144-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-30-Terrastore_-_Scalable%2C_elastic%2C_consistent_document_store..html">756 high scalability-2009-12-30-Terrastore - Scalable, elastic, consistent document store.</a></p>

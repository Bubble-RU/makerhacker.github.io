<p>Introduction: Web Log Stormingis an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows.
The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any
other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down
to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and
how it fits into your desired scenario.Web Log Storming does far more than
just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with
interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of
activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.In
other words, analyze your web logs like never before!It's easy to track
sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to
each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and
keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the
top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed. You

<p>Introduction: AWStatsis a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web,
streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works
as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log
contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be
able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files
from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log
format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of
other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.</p><p>4 0.14618659 <a title="36-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-30-How_Rackspace_Now_Uses_MapReduce_and_Hadoop_to_Query_Terabytes_of_Data.html">233 high scalability-2008-01-30-How Rackspace Now Uses MapReduce and Hadoop to Query Terabytes of Data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you query hundreds of gigabytes of new data each day streaming in from
over 600 hyperactive servers? If you think this sounds like the perfect battle
ground for a head-to-head skirmish in the greatMapReduce Versus Database War,
you would be correct.Bill Boebel, CTO of Mailtrust (Rackspace's mail
division), has generously provided a fascinating account of how they evolved
their log processing system from an early amoeba'ic text file stored on each
machine approach, to a Neandertholic relational database solution that just
couldn't compete, and finally to a Homo sapien'ic Hadoop based solution that
works wisely for them and has virtually unlimited scalability
potential.Rackspace faced a now familiar problem. Lots and lots of data
streaming in. Where do you store all that data? How do you do anything useful
with it? In the first version of their system logs were stored in flat text
files and had to be manually searched by engineers logging into each
individual machine. Then came a</p><p>5 0.13180101 <a title="36-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-01-Statistics_Logging_Scalability.html">105 high scalability-2007-10-01-Statistics Logging Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My company is developing a centralized web platform to service our clients. We
currently use about 3Mb/s on our uplink at our ISP serving web pages for about
100 clients. We'd like to offer them statistics that mean something to their
businesses and have been contemplating writing our own statistics code to
handle the task.All statistics would be gathered at the page view level and
we're implementing a HttpModule in ASP.Net 2.0 to handle the gather of the
data. That said, I'm curious to hear comments on writing this data (~500 bytes
of log data/page request). We need to write this data somewhere and then build
a process to aggregate the data into a warehouse application used in our
reporting system. Google Analytics is out of the question because we do not
want our hosting infrastructure dependant upon a remote server. Web Trends et
al. are too expensive for our clients.I'm thinking of a couple of options.1)

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byGordon Worley, a Software Engineer atKorrelate, where
they correlate (see what they did there) online purchases to offline
purchases.Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every
server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not
making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come
online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were
originally told to expect. I wouldn't say we panicked, but the office was
certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks
both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the
added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.At
Korrelate, we deploytracking pixels, also known beacons or web bugs, that our
partners use to send us information about their users. These tiny web objects
contain no visible content, but may include transparent 1 by 1 gifs or

<p>Introduction: Guys,At one of my jobs I have to administer a CISCO ACE (application control
engine) hardware load-balancer.I don't particularly love this beast, but it's
very very powerful.There appears to be little real-world info out there, so it
could be interesting writing an article on that.But I don't have other HW LB's
to compare it to and I don't want to rehash the product page.What would
interest you in a 'product review' of a loadbalancer?No replies means it's not
an interesting topic, so no article then ;-)</p><p>4 0.8157205 <a title="36-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Product%3A_ISPMan_Centralized_ISP_Management_System_.html">228 high scalability-2008-01-28-Product: ISPMan Centralized ISP Management System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: FromFRESH Portsand their website:ISPmanis an ISP management software written
in perl, using an LDAPbackend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP. It can be
used to manage,DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration,
cyrusmail boxes, proftpd etc.ISPMan was written as a management tool for the
network at 4unet wherebetween 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is
crazily growing.Managing these domains and their users was a little time
consuming,and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these
daemonsfluently. Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and
users.LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server canbe
scaled from 1 to n as required. An LDAP entry called maildroptells the SMTP
server (postfix) where to deliver the mail. The SMTPservers can be
loadbalanced with one of many load balancingtechniques. The program is written
with scalability and Highavailability in mind.This may not be the right
software for you if you want to run a sm</p><p>5 0.7970084 <a title="36-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-19-GemFire_6.0%3A_New_innovations_in_data_management.html">633 high scalability-2009-06-19-GemFire 6.0: New innovations in data management</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GemStone has unveiled GemFire 6.0 which is the culmination of several years of
development and the continuous solving of the hardest data management problems
in the world. With this release GemFire touts some of the latest innovative
features in data management.In this release:- GemFire introduces a resource
manager to continuously monitor and protect cache instances from running out
of memory, triggering rebalancing to migrate data to less loaded nodes or
allow dynamic increase/decrease in the number of nodes hosting data for linear
scalability without impeding ongoing operations (no contention points).-
GemFire provides explicit control over when rebalancing can be triggered, on
what class of data and even allows the administrator to simulate a "rebalance"
operation to quantify the benefits before actually doing it.- With built in
instrumentation that captures throughput and latency metrics, GemFire now
enables applications to sense changing performance patterns and proactively

<p>Introduction: Web Analytics: An Hour A Day is the first book by an in-the-trenches
practitioner of web analytics. It provides a unique insider’s perspective of
the challenges and opportunities that web analytics presents to each person
who touches the Web in your organization. Rather than spamming you with
metrics and definitions, Web Analytics: An Hour A Day will enhance your
mindset and teach you how to fish for yourself.Avinash Kaushik is a expert in
web analytics and author of the top-rated blog Occam’s Razor
(http://www.kaushik.net/avinash). In this book, he goes beyond web analytics
concepts and definitions to provide a step-by-step guide to implementing a
successful web analytics strategy. His revolutionary approach to web analytics
challenges prevalent thinking about the field and guides readers to a solution
that will provide truly informed and actionable insights.</p><p>3 0.25601077 <a title="9-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-07-18-Building_your_own_Facebook_Realtime_Analytics_System__.html">1081 high scalability-2011-07-18-Building your own Facebook Realtime Analytics System  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently, I was reading Todd Hoff's write-up on FaceBook real time analytics
system. As usual, Todd did an excellent job in summarizing this video from
Engineering Manager at Facebook Alex Himel.Inthe first post, I'd like to
summarize the case study, and consider some things that weren't mentioned in
the summaries. This will lead to an architecture for building your own
Realtime Time Analytics for Big-Data that might be easier to implement, using
Facebook's experience as a starting point and guide as well as the experience
gathered through a recent work with few of GigaSpaces customers. Thesecond
postprovide a summary of that new approach as well as a pattern and a demo for
building your own Real Time Analytics system..ReferencesReal Time analytics

how web analytics is implemented at organizations with large volumes of web
traffic and a critcal business need to analyze that data - e.g. places like
Amazon.com, eBay, and Google?Just as a fun project I'm planning to build my
own web log analysis app that can effectively index and query large volumes of
web log data (i.e. TB range). But first I'd like to learn more about how it's
done in the organizations whose lifeblood depends on this stuff. Even just a

<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations. Jeremy Cole inOn
efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GISsuccinctly
explains the many uses for such a feature:Geo-referencing IPs is, in a
nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a
log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity
owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-
reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting
systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more
applications.This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit
of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-
rereferncing data, how to load data, and the performance of different
approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to
the subject.</p><p>5 0.59271353 <a title="9-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-04-New_Book%3A_Even_Faster_Web_Sites%3A_Performance_Best_Practices_for_Web_Developers.html">617 high scalability-2009-06-04-New Book: Even Faster Web Sites: Performance Best Practices for Web Developers</a></p>

evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable
techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.Souders' previous
book, the bestsellingHigh Performance Web Sites, shocked the web development
world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on
the client side. In Even Faster Web Sites, Souders and eight expert
contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your

<p>Introduction: Today, most banks have migrated their internal software development from C/C++
to the Java language because of well-known advantages in development
productivity (Java Platform), robustness & reliability (Garbage Collector) and
platform independence (Java Bytecode). They may even have gotten better
throughput performance through the use of standard architectures and
application servers (Java Enterprise Edition). Among the few banking
applications that have not been able to benefit yet from the Java revolution,
you find the latency-critical applications connected to the trading floor.
Why? Because of the unpredictable pauses introduced by the garbage collector
which result in significant jitter (variance of execution time).In this post
Frederic Pariente Engineering Manager at Sun Microsystems posted a summary of
a case study on how the use of Sun Real Time JVM and GigaSpaces was used in
the context of of a customer proof-of-concept this summer to ensureguaranteed

Scalable Web Applications.The webinar is sponsored by VoltDB, but it will be
completely vendor independent, as that's the only honor preserving and

minutes, with 40 minutes of speechifying and 20 minutes for questions.The

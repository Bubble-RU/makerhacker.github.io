<p>Introduction: CDNs ( content delivery networks ) are the secret shadow super powers behind the web and Dan Rayburn at   streamingmedia.com    is the go to investigative reporter for quality information on CDNs. Every year Dan has a Content Delivery Summit on all things CDN and those videos are    now available   . Dan also gives a kind of    state of the industry talk    where he does something wonderful, he gives real numbers and prices. Dan really knows his stuff and is an excellent speaker, so watch the video, but here’s my gloss on the state of the CDN so far this year: 
  
  Massive growth . Large customers are expecting 126% growth in video traffic over last year; medium size customers are seeing 48% traffic growth, small sized customer are seeing 73.3% traffic growth. 
   More traffic != More profit   . Traffic growth doesn’t lead to more profit because the traffic growth is concentrated in larger customers that can make the best deals.

<p>Introduction: We build web applications…and there are plenty of them around. Now, if we hit the jackpot and our application becomes very popular, traffic goes up, and our servers are brought down by the hordes of people coming to our website. What do we do in that situation?     Of course, I am not talking here about the kind of traffic Digg, Yahoo Buzz or other social media sites can bring to a website, which is temporary overnight traffic, or a website which uses cloud computing like Amazon EC2 service, MediaTemple Grid Service or Mosso Hosting Cloud service.     I am talking about traffic that consistently increases over time as the service achieves success. Google.com, Yahoo.com, Myspace.com, Facebook.com, Plentyoffish.com, Linkedin.com, Youtube.com and others are examples of services which have constant high traffic.     Knowing that users want speed from their applications, these services will always use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver that speed.

<p>Introduction: One of the best projects I've ever worked on was creating a large scale web site publishing system that was almost entirely static. A large team of very talented creatives made the art work, writers penned the content, and designers generated templates. All assets were controlled in a database. Then all that was extracted, after applying many different filters, to a static site that was uploaded via ftp to dozens of web servers. It worked great. Reliable, fast, cheap, and simple. Updates were a bit of a pain as it required pushing a lot of files to a lot of servers, and that took time, but otherwise a solid system.
 
 Alas, this elegant system was replaced with a new fangled dynamic database based system. Content was pulled from a database using a dynamic language generated front-end. With a recent series of posts from Amazon's Werner Vogels, chronicling his experience of transforming his   All Things Distributed   blog into a static site using S3's ability to serve web pages, I get th</p><p>6 0.16536695 <a title="100-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-01-HOW_CDN_works.html">198 high scalability-2008-01-01-HOW CDN works</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:   How-To Minimize Load Time for Fast User Experiences .  Shows how to analyze the bottlenecks preventing websites and blogs from loading quickly and how to resolve them.  80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the frontend, so it makes sense to concentrate efforts there before heroically rewriting the backend. Take a shower before buying a Porsche, if you know what I mean. Steve Souders, author of  High Performance Websites  and  Yslow , has  ten more best practices to speed up your website :
  Split the initial payload   Load scripts without blocking   Don’t scatter scripts   Split dominant content domains   Make static content cookie-free   Reduce cookie weight   Minify CSS   Optimize images   Use iframes sparingly   To www or not to www  Sadly, according to String Theory, there are only 26.7 rules left, so get them while they're still in our dimension.  Here are  slides  on the first few rules. Love the speeding dog slide.

<p>Introduction: Update:  Nice explanation in  The importance of bandwidth versus latency  of how long latencies cause cascading delays in resource loading.  Doloto  tries to optimize how resources are loaded.   Twenty new rules  have been added to the  original 14 rules  for sizzling web performance. Part of scalability is worrying about performance too. The front-end is where 80-90% of end-user response time is spent and following these best practices improved the performance of Yahoo! properties by 25-50%. The rules are divided into server, content, cookie, JavaScript, CSS, images, and mobile categories. The new rules are:

<p>Introduction: If you have a lot of static content to store and you aren't looking forward to setting up and maintaining your own giganto SAN,  maybe you can push off a lot of the hard lifting to a CDN?     Jesse Robbins at O'Reilly Radar posts that you have a lot more options now because the number of   Content Distribution Networks have doubled since last year  . In fact, Dan Rayburn says there are now   28 CDN   providers in the market. Hopefully you can find reasonable pricing at one of them.      Other than easing your burden, why might a CDN work for you? Because it makes your site faster and customers like that. How can a CDN so dramatically improve your site's performance?           Steve Saunders, author of   High Performance Web Sites: Essential Knowledge for Front-End Engineers  , has using a CDN has one of his "Thirteen Simple Rules for Speeding Up Your Web Site."      About CDNs Steve says:     Remember that 80-90% of the end-user response time is spent downloading all the components in</p><p>2 0.81410778 <a title="100-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-06-GEO-aware_traffic_load_balancing_and_caching_at_CNBC.com.html">773 high scalability-2010-02-06-GEO-aware traffic load balancing and caching at CNBC.com</a></p>
<p>Introduction: CNBC, like many large web sites, relied  on a CDN for content delivery.  Recently, we started looking  to see if we could improve this model.  Our criteria was:     - improve response time  - have better control over traffic (real time reporting, change management and alerting)  - better utilize internal datacenters and their infrastructure  - shield users from any troubles at the origin infrastructure  - cost out       After researching the market, we turned to two vendors: Dyn (Dynamic Network Services) and  aiScaler . We' have had   about a year worth of experience with  aiScaler  (search for "CNBC" to see my previous post ), but Dyn was a new vendor for us.  We started building our relationship at Velocity conference in the summer of 2009.    Dyn has recently started offering a geo-aware DNS load balancing solution, using Anycast and the distributed nature of their DNS presence to enable a key component of what we were trying to achieve: steer users to geographically closest origin</p><p>3 0.81063122 <a title="100-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_February_22%2C_2013.html">1411 high scalability-2013-02-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For February 22, 2013</a></p>

 Quotable Quotes:                                    
 
  @p337er : I have committed some truly horrendous crimes against scalability today. 
  @ErrataRob : doubling performance doesn't double scalability. 
  @rsingel : In 2008 when Yahoo.com  linked out, I had a Wired story get 1M visitors in an hour from their homepage. 
  @philiph : Lets solve this scalability problem with a queuing system 
  @jaykreps : Transferring data across data centers? Read this page and go tune your TCP buffer sizes... 
  @gwestr : In which the node community showers schadenfreude upon the rails community for "scalability is not my problem" architectures 
  @pbailis :  Makes sense, though I think there's a tradeoff re: coordination and scalability (always homogeneous vs dynamically heterogenous) 
  @pembleton : To summarize Yoav's philosophy: we started as quick as we can and then we accelerated #operationgrandma in #reversim

<p>Introduction: When building a system on top of a set of wildly uncooperative and unruly computers you have knowledge problems: knowing when other nodes are dead; knowing when nodes become alive; getting information about other nodes so you can make local decisions, like knowing which node should handle a request based on a scheme for assigning nodes to a certain range of users; learning about new configuration data; agreeing on data values; and so on.
 
How do you solve these problems? 
 
A common centralized approach is to use a database and all nodes query it for information. Obvious availability and performance issues for large distributed clusters. Another approach is to use  Paxos , a protocol for solving consensus in a network to maintain strict consistency requirements for small groups of unreliable processes. Not practical when larger number of nodes are involved.
 
So what's the super cool decentralized way to bring order to large clusters?

<p>Introduction: A recent   InfoWorld article   claims that "With Cisco expected to enter the blade market and Sun expected to offer networking equipment, things could get interesting awfully fast." How does this effect your infrastructure strategy and decisions?     Would you consider to build scalable web applications on the Cisco Unified Computing System? Or would you consider to build a router out of a server with the use of OpenSolaris and Project Crossbow as the article suggests? Will any of these initiatives change the way we build scalable web infrastructure or are these just attempts to sale these systems?     What do you think?</p><p>6 0.80262411 <a title="100-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-12-Slashdot_Architecture_-_How_the_Old_Man_of_the_Internet_Learned_to_Scale.html">150 high scalability-2007-11-12-Slashdot Architecture - How the Old Man of the Internet Learned to Scale</a></p>

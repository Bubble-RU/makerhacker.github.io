<p>Introduction: Scalability forces us to think differently. What worked on a small scale
doesn't always work on a large scale -- and costs are no different. If 90% of
our application is free of contention, and only 10% is spent on a shared
resources, we will need to grow our compute resources by a factor of 100 to
scale by a factor of 10! Another important thing to note is that 10x, in this
case, is the limit of our ability to scale, even if more resources are
added.1. The cost of non-linearly scalable applications grows exponentially
with the demand for more scale.2. Non-linearly scalable applications have an
absolute limit of scalability. According to Amdhal's Law, with 10% contention,
the maximum scaling limit is 10. With 40% contention, our maximum scaling
limit is 2.5 - no matter how many hardware resources we will throw at the
problem.This post discuss in further details how to measure the true cost of
non linearly scalable systems and suggest a model for reducing that cost
significantly.</p><p>5 0.15479675 <a title="43-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-21-Tracking_usage_of_public_resources_-_throttling_accesses_per_hour.html">256 high scalability-2008-02-21-Tracking usage of public resources - throttling accesses per hour</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi,We have an application that allows the user to define a publicly available
resource with an ID. The ID can then be accessed via an HTTP call, passing the
ID. While we're not a picture site, thinking of a resource like a picture may
help understand what is going on.We need to be able to stop access to the
resource if it is accessed 'x' times in an hour, regardless of who is
requesting it.We see two options- go to the database for each request to see
if the # of returned in the last hour is within the limit.- keep a counter in
each of the application servers and sync the counters every few minutes or #
of requests to determine if we've passed the limit. The sync point would be
the database.Going to the database (and updating it!) each time we get a
request isn't very attractive.We also have a load balanced farm of servers, so
we know 'x' is going to have to be a soft limit if we count in the app
serevrs. (We know there will be a period of time between syncing the counts in
the app ser</p><p>6 0.14453857 <a title="43-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-Too_many_databases.html">231 high scalability-2008-01-29-Too many databases</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Why isn't Google's aggressive new database pricing strategy getting more pub?
That's whatBill Katz, instigator of theGAE Meetupand prize winningscience
fiction authoris wondering:It's surprising that the blogosphere hasn't picked
up the biggest difference in pricing:Google's datastore is less than a tenth
of the price of Amazon's SimpleDB while offering a better API.If money matters
to you then the burn rate under GAE could be convincingly lower. Let's compare
the numbers:breakGAE pricing:* $0.10 - $0.12 per CPU core-hour* $0.15 - $0.18
per GB-month of storage* $0.11 - $0.13 per GB outgoing bandwidth* $0.09 -
$0.11 per GB incoming bandwidthSimpleDB Pricing:* $0.14 per Amazon SimpleDB
Machine Hour consumed* Structured Data Storage - $1.50 per GB-month* $0.100
per GB - all data transfer in* $0.170 per GB - first 10 TB / month data

competitive with Amazon. We may see a response by Amazon in the near feature,

Can JSPs cause issue with scalability?Thanks,Unmesh</p><p>4 0.56757486 <a title="43-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-02-16-Paper%3A_An_Experimental_Investigation_of_the_Akamai_Adaptive_Video_Streaming.html">991 high scalability-2011-02-16-Paper: An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading
retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent
applications. Furthermore, over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are
more likely to make a purchase after "liking" a brand they find online.
(source)Sears Architect Tomer Gabel provides an insightful overview on how
they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex
relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:the architectural
considerations behind their solutionwhy they chose memory over diskhow they
partitioned the data to gain scalabilitywhy they chose to execute code with
the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution frameworkhow they integrated
with Facebookwhy they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-
memory caching and scaleIn this post I tried to summarize the main takeaway
from the interview.You can also watch the full interview (highly
recomended).Read the full storyhere</p><p>6 0.52915126 <a title="43-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-16-Paper%3A_Warp%3A_Multi-Key_Transactions_for_Key-Value_Stores.html">1459 high scalability-2013-05-16-Paper: Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Cactiis a network statistics graphing tool designed as a frontend to RRDtool's
data storage and graphing functionality. It is intended to be intuitive and
easy to use, as well as robust and scalable. It is generally used to graph
time-series data like CPU load and bandwidth use.The frontend is written in
PHP; it can handle multiple users, each with their own graph sets, so it is
sometimes used by web hosting providers (especially dedicated server, virtual
private server, and colocation providers) to display bandwidth statistics for
their customers. It can be used to configure the data collection itself,
allowing certain setups to be monitored without any manual configuration of
RRDtool.</p><p>3 0.11937623 <a title="101-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-13-Design_Preparations_for_Scaling.html">91 high scalability-2007-09-13-Design Preparations for Scaling</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Lustreé€Ÿis a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system. It
is designed, developed and maintained by Cluster File Systems, Inc.The central
goal is the development of a next-generation cluster file system which can
serve clusters with 10,000's of nodes, provide petabytes of storage, and move
100's of GB/sec with state-of-the-art security and management
infrastructure.Lustre runs on many of the largest Linux clusters in the world,
and is included by CFS's partners as a core component of their cluster
offering (examples include HP StorageWorks SFS, and the Cray XT3 and XD1
supercomputers). Today's users have also demonstrated that Lustre scales down
as well as it scales up, and runs in production on clusters as small as 4 and
as large as 25,000 nodes.The latest version of Lustre is always available from
Cluster File Systems, Inc. Public Open Source releases of Lustre are available
under the GNU General Public License. These releases are found here, and are

<p>Introduction: Much of the focus of high performance computing (HPC) has centered on CPU
performance. However, as computing requirements grow, HPC clusters are
demanding higher rates of aggregate data throughput. Today's clusters feature
larger numbers of nodes with increased compute speeds. The higher clock rates
and operations per clock cycle create increased demand for local data on each
node. In addition, InfiniBand and other high-speed, low-latency interconnects
increase the data throughput available to each node.Traditional shared file
systems such as NFS have not been able to scale to meet this growing demand
for data throughput on HPC clusters. Scalable cluster file systems that can
provide parallel data access to hundreds of nodes and petabytes of storage are
needed to provide the high data throughput required by large HPC applications,
including manufacturing, electronic design, and research.This paper describes
an implementation of the Sun Lustre file system as a scalable storage cluster

<p>Introduction: Comet is anactive distributed key-value storebuilt at the University of
Washington. The paper describing Comet is Comet: An active distributed key-
value store, there are also slides, and a MP3 of a presentation given atOSDI
'10. Here's a succinct overview of Comet:Today's cloud storage services, such
as Amazon S3 or peer-to-peer DHTs, are highly inflexible and impose a variety
of constraints on their clients: specific replication and consistency schemes,
fixed data timeouts, limited logging, etc. We witnessed such inflexibility
first-hand as part of our Vanish work, where we used a DHT to store encryption
keys temporarily. To address this issue, we built Comet, an extensible storage
service that allows clients to inject snippets of code that control their
data's behavior inside the storage service.I found this paper quite
interesting because it takes the initial steps of collocating code with a key-
value store, which turns it into what might called a key-code store. This is
something</p><p>4 0.70688355 <a title="101-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-30-Terrastore_-_Scalable%2C_elastic%2C_consistent_document_store..html">756 high scalability-2009-12-30-Terrastore - Scalable, elastic, consistent document store.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Terrastoreis a new-born document store which provides advanced scalability and
elasticity features without sacrificing consistency.Here are a few
highlights:Ubiquitous: based on the universally supported HTTP
protocol.Distributed: nodes can run and live everywhere on your
network.Elastic: you can add and remove nodes dynamically to/from your running
cluster with no downtime and no changes at all to your configuration.Scalable
at the data layer: documents are partitioned and distributed among your nodes,
with automatic and transparent re-balancing when nodes join and leave.Scalable
at the computational layer: query and update operations are distributed to the
nodes which actually holds the queried/updated data, minimizing network
traffic and spreading computational load.Consistent: providing per-document
consistency, you're guaranteed to always get the latest value of a single
document, with read committed isolation for concurrent
modifications.Schemaless: providing a collection-based i</p><p>5 0.70280957 <a title="101-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-14-Using_Gossip_Protocols_for_Failure_Detection%2C_Monitoring%2C_Messaging_and_Other_Good_Things.html">1142 high scalability-2011-11-14-Using Gossip Protocols for Failure Detection, Monitoring, Messaging and Other Good Things</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When building a system on top of a set of wildly uncooperative and unruly
computers you have knowledge problems: knowing when other nodes are dead;
knowing when nodes become alive; getting information about other nodes so you
can make local decisions, like knowing which node should handle a request
based on a scheme for assigning nodes to a certain range of users; learning
about new configuration data; agreeing on data values; and so on.How do you
solve these problems? A common centralized approach is to use a database and
all nodes query it for information. Obvious availability and performance
issues for large distributed clusters. Another approach is to use Paxos, a
protocol for solving consensus in a network to maintain strict consistency
requirements for small groups of unreliable processes. Not practical when
larger number of nodes are involved.So what's the super cool decentralized way
to bring order to large clusters?Gossip protocols, which maintain relaxed
consistency requireme</p><p>6 0.69537705 <a title="101-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala_-_P2P_Online_Storage_Cloud.html">368 high scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala - P2P Online Storage Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Gangliais a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance
computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical
design targeted at federations of clusters. It leverages widely used
technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable
data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses
carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-
node overheads and high concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been
ported to an extensive set of operating systems and processor architectures,
and is currently in use on thousands of clusters around the world. It has been
used to link clusters across university campuses and around the world and can
scale to handle clusters with 2000 nodes.</p><p>3 0.71335006 <a title="101-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-11-11-Arhcitecture_for_content_management.html">440 high scalability-2008-11-11-Arhcitecture for content management</a></p>

<p>Introduction: After Googlecut prices on their Google Cloud Platform Amazon quickly followed
with their ownprice cuts. Even more interesting is what the future holds for
pricing. The near future looks great. After that? We'll see.Adrian Cockcroft
highlights that Google thinksprices should followMoore's law, which means we
should expect prices to halve every 18-24 months.That's good news. Greater
cost certainty means you can make much more aggressive build out plans. With
the savings you can hire more people, handle more customers, and add those
media rich features you thought you couldn't afford. Design is directly
related to costs.Without Google competing with Amazon there's little doubt the
price reduction curve would be much less favorable.As a late cloud entrant
Google is now in a customer acquisition phase, so they are willing to pay for
customers, which means lower prices are an acceptable cost of doing business.
Profit and high margins are not the objective. Getting market share is what is

<p>Introduction: Many enterprises' high-availability architecture is based on the assumption
that you can prevent failure from happening by putting all your critical data
in a centralized database, back it up with expensive storage, and replicate it
somehow between the sites. As I argued in one of my previous posts (Why
Existing Databases (RAC) are So Breakable!) many of those assumptions are
broken at their core, as storage is doomed to failure just like any other
device, expensive hardware doesn't make things any better and database
replication is often not enough.One of the main lessons that we can take from
the likes of Amazon and Google is that the right way to ensure continuous high
availability is by designing our system to cope with failure. We need to
assume that what we tend to think of as unthinkable will probably happen, as
that's the nature of failure. So rather than trying to prevent failures, we
need to build a system that will tolerate them.As we can learn from a recent
outage event in</p><p>6 0.63888752 <a title="101-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-16-Books%3A_Web_2.0_Architectures_and_Cloud_Application_Architectures.html">539 high scalability-2009-03-16-Books: Web 2.0 Architectures and Cloud Application Architectures</a></p>

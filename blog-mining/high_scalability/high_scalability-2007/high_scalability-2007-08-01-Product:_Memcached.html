<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case. Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on Fotolog in  Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success , which was one of my personal favorites.  Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've developed a</p><p>3 0.15576445 <a title="52-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-26-Marrying_memcached_and_NoSQL.html">927 high scalability-2010-10-26-Marrying memcached and NoSQL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Memcached   is one of the most common In-Memory cache implementation.  It was originally developed by  Danga Interactive   for  LiveJournal  , but is now used by many other sites as a  side cache   to speed up read mostly operations. It gained popularity in the non-Java world, too, especially since it’s a language-neutral side cache for which few alternatives existed.    

As a side-cache, Memcache clients relies on the database as the system of record, The database is still used for write,update and complex query operations.  Since the  memcached specification includes no query operations, memcached is not a database alternative, unlike most of the NoSQL offerings. It also exclude memcache from being a real solution for write scalability. As a result of that many of the heavy sites started to move away from Memcache and replace it with other NoSQL alternatives as noted in a recent highscalability post  MySQL And Memcached: End Of An Era?

<p>Introduction: Hi everybody :)     We have a bunch of webservers (about 14 at th  i  s time) running Apache. As app  l  ication framework we're using PHP with the APC Cache insta  l  led to improve performance. For load ba  l  ancing we're using a Big F5 system with dynamic ratio (SNMP driven)     To sync new/updated sourcecode we're using subversion to "automaticly" update these servers w  i  th our latest software relases. After updating the new source to these production servers the load of the mashines is ra  i  sing to hell.     While updating the servers, they are sti  l  l in "production", serving webpages to the users. Otherwise the process of updating wou  l  d take ages. Most of the time we're only updating in the morning hours while less users are online, because of the above issue.     My guess is, that the load is raising that h  i  gh, because APC needs to recompile a bunch of new f  i  les each time. Before and while compi  l  ing the performance simply is "bad".     My goal would be t</p><p>5 0.12762107 <a title="52-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish_Architecture.html">638 high scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 5 :  PlentyOfFish Update - 6 Billion Pageviews And 32 Billion Images A Month     Update 4 :  Jeff Atwood  costs out Markus' scale up approach against a scale out approach and finds scale up wanting. The discussion in the comments is as interesting as the article. My guess is Markus doesn't want to rewrite his software to work across a scale out cluster so even if it's more expensive scale up works better for his needs.   Update 3 :  POF now has 200 million images  and serves 10,000 images served per second. They'll be moving to a 250,000 IOPS RamSan to handle the load. Also upgraded to a core database machine with 512 GB of RAM, 32 CPU’s, SQLServer  2008 and Windows 2008.   Update 2 : This seems to be a  POF Peer1 love fest infomercial .

<p>Introduction: The BBC's iPlayer site averages 8 million page views a day for 1.3 million users. Technical Architect Simon Frost describes how they scaled their site in   Scaling the BBC iPlayer to handle demand :
  
  Use frameworks . Frameworks support component based development which makes it convenient for team development, but can introduce delays that have to be minimized. Zend/PHP is used because it supports components and is easy to recruit for.Â  MySQL is used for program metadata. CouchDB is used for key-value access for fast read/write of user-focused data. 
  Prove architecture before building it . Eliminate guesswork by coming up with alternate architectures and create prototypes to determine which option works best. Balance performance with factors like ease of development.  
  Cache a lot . Data is cached in memcached for a few seconds to minutes. Short cache invalidation periods keep the data up to date for the users, but even these short periods make a huge difference in performance.</p><p>3 0.77577758 <a title="52-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish_Architecture.html">638 high scalability-2009-06-26-PlentyOfFish Architecture</a></p>

  Traffic : 17,000 requests/second peak; 450,000 websites; 15 million profiles; 75 million comments; 250 million visitors; 40 million monthly users / developer. 
  Forces : unpredictable traffic patterns because of celebrity gossip and events like disasters; discussion never expire which means they can't fit in memory; must always be up. 
  Machines : 100 servers; 30% web servers (Appache + mod_wsgi); 10% databases (PostgreSQL); 25% cache servers (memcached); 20% load balancing / high availability (HAProxy + heartbeat); 15% Utility servers (Python scripts).

<p>Introduction: At some point as a programmer you might have the insight/fear that all programming is just doing stuff to other stuff.
 
Then you may observe after coding the same stuff over again that stuff in a program often takes the form of interacting patterns of flows.
 
Then you may think hey, a program isn't only useful for coding datastructures, but a program is a kind of datastructure and that with a meta level jump you could program a program in terms of flows over data and flow over other flows.
 
That's the kind of stuff Prismatic is making available in the Graph extension to their  plumbing  package ( code examples ), which is described in an excellent post:  Graph: Abstractions for Structured Computation .
 
You may remember Prismatic from previous profile we did on HighScalability:  Prismatic Architecture - Using Machine Learning On Social Networks To Figure Out What You Should Read On The Web .

<p>Introduction: Memcached  is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.  Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com, a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers. memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the databases on a memcache miss.</p><p>3 0.8889035 <a title="52-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Yslow_to_speed_up_your_web_pages.html">47 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Yslow to speed up your web pages</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update :   Speed up Apache - how I went from F to A in YSlow .  Good example of using YSlow to speed up a website with solid code examples.  Every layer in the multi-layer cake that is your website contributes to how long a page takes to display.  YSlow , from Yahoo, is a cool tool for discovering how the ingredients of your site's top layer contribute to performance.
 
YSlow analyzes web pages and tells you why they're slow based on the rules for high performance web sites. YSlow is a Firefox add-on integrated with the popular Firebug web development tool.   YSlow gives you:

<p>Introduction: Scoble   the Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.     For a strategy hit he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about when making   FeedBlendr  :     One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in designing their architecture.</p><p>5 0.8785516 <a title="52-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-22-Why_not_Cache_from_Intersystems%3F.html">164 high scalability-2007-11-22-Why not Cache from Intersystems?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have some experience with a very large OLTP system that is 7+ TB in size and performs very well for 30K+ concurrent users.  It is built using Intersystems Cache based on the very old but very scalable MUMPS platform.  Why don't I see more discussions about archiectures such as these in this forum?  I am curious why this platform scales so much better then the typical RDBMS.</p><p>6 0.86919409 <a title="52-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-05-Pairing_NoSQL_and_Relational_Data_Storage%3A_MySQL_with_MongoDB.html">872 high scalability-2010-08-05-Pairing NoSQL and Relational Data Storage: MySQL with MongoDB</a></p>

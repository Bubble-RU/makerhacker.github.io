Learn the tricks of the trade so you can build and architect applications that
scale quickly--without all the high-priced headaches and service-level
agreements associated with enterprise app servers and proprietary programming
and database products. Culled from the experience of the Flickr.com lead
developer, Building Scalable Web Sites offers techniques for creating fast

<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do
something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one
Ilya Grigorik, Developer Advocate,Make the Web Fastat Google, and author of a
great new book:High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer
should know about networking and web performance. That's a big topic you might
be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed
pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It's like
a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.In case you are not familiar
with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For
years Ilya has been producing excellent content onhis blog and if yousearch
YouTube you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the
book. Authority established.Reading the book I was struck by what a

<p>Introduction: Performance is critical to the success of any web site, and yet today's web
applications push browsers to their limits with increasing amounts of rich
content and heavy use of Ajax. In his new bookEven Faster Web Sites:
Performance Best Practices for Web Developers, Steve Souders, web performance
evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable
techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.Souders' previous
book, the bestsellingHigh Performance Web Sites, shocked the web development
world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on
the client side. In Even Faster Web Sites, Souders and eight expert
contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your
site's performance in three critical categories:JavaScript- Get advice for
understanding Ajax performance, writing efficient JavaScript, creating
responsive applications, loading scripts without blocking other components,

<p>Introduction: Hello highscalability world. I just discovered this site yesterday in a search
for a scalability resource and was very pleased to find such useful
information. I have some questions regarding distributed caching that I was
hoping the scalability intelligentsia trafficking this forum could answer. I
apologize for my lack of technical knowledge; I'm hoping this site will
increase said knowledge! Feel free to answer all or as much as you want. Thank
you in advance for your responses and thank you for a great resource!1.) What
are the standard benchmarks used to measure the performance of memcached or
mySQL/memcached working together (from web 2.0 companies etc)?2.) The little
research I've conducted on this site suggests that most web 2.0 companies use
a combination of mySQL and a hacked memcached (and potentially sharding). Does
anyone know if any of these companies use an enterprise vendor for their
distributed caching layer? (At this point in time I've only heard of Jive

<p>Introduction: CloudCampis an interesting unconference where early adapters of Cloud
Computing technologies exchange ideas. With the rapid change occurring in the
industry, we need a place we can meet to share our experiences, challenges and
solutions. At CloudCamp, you are encouraged you to share your thoughts in
several open discussions, as we strive for the advancement of Cloud Computing.
End users, IT professionals and vendors are all encouraged to
participate.CloudCamp Silicon Valley 08is scheduled for Tuesday, September 30,
2008 from 06:00 PM - 10:00 PM in Sun Microsystems' EBC Briefing Center15
Network CircleMenlo Park, CA 94025CloudCamp follows an interactive, unscripted
unconference format. You can propose your own session or you can attend a
session proposed by someone else. Either way, you are encouraged to engage in
the discussion and “Vote with your feet”, which means … “find another session
if you don’t find the session helpful”. Pick and choose from the

<p>Introduction: As a developer, you are aware of the increasing concern amongst developers and
site architects that websites be able to handle the vast number of visitors
that flood the Internet on a daily basis. Scalable Internet Architecture
addresses these concerns by teaching you both good and bad design
methodologies for building new sites and how to scale existing websites to
robust, high-availability websites. Primarily example-based, the book
discusses major topics in web architectural design, presenting existing
solutions and how they work. Technology budget tight? This book will work for
you, too, as it introduces new and innovative concepts to solving
traditionally expensive problems without a large technology budget. Using open
source and proprietary examples, you will be engaged in best practice design
methodologies for building new sites, as well as appropriately scaling both
growing and shrinking sites. Website development help has arrived in the form
of Scalable Internet Architecture.</p><p>3 0.90414643 <a title="51-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons_Learned_at_208K%3A_Towards_Debugging_Millions_of_Cores.html">484 high scalability-2009-01-05-Lessons Learned at 208K: Towards Debugging Millions of Cores</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we debug and profile a cloud full of processors and threads? It's a
problem more will be seeing as we code big scary programs that run on even
bigger scarier clouds. Logging gets you far, but sometimes finding the root
cause of problem requires delving deep into a program's execution. I don't
know about you, but setting up 200,000+ gdb instances doesn't sound all that
appealing. Tools like STAT (Stack Trace Analysis Tool) are being developed to
help with this huge task. STAT "gathers and merges stack traces from a
parallel application's processes." So STAT isn't a low level debugger, but it
will help you find the needle in a million haystacks.Abstract:Petascale
systems will present several new challenges to performance and correctness
tools. Such machines may contain millions of cores, requiring that tools use
scalable data structures and analysis algorithms to collect and to process
application data. In addition, at such scales, each tool itself will become a
large parallel app</p><p>4 0.87855053 <a title="51-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-30-10_Tips_for_Optimizing_NGINX_and_PHP-fpm_for_High_Traffic_Sites.html">1640 high scalability-2014-04-30-10 Tips for Optimizing NGINX and PHP-fpm for High Traffic Sites</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Adrian Singer has boiled down 7 years of experience to a set of 10 very useful
tips on how to bestoptimize NGINX and PHP-fpm for high traffic sites:Switch
from TCP to UNIX domain sockets. When communicating to processes on the same
machine UNIX sockets have better performance the TCP because there's less
copying and fewer context switches.Adjust Worker Processes. Set the
worker_processes in your nginx.conf file to the number of cores your machine
has and  increase the number of worker_connections.Setup upstream load
balancing. Multiple upstream backends on the same machine produce higher
throughout than a single one.Disable access log files. Log files on high
traffic sites involve a lot of I/O that has to be synchronized across all
threads. Can have a big impact.Enable GZip. Cache information about frequently
accessed files. Adjust client timeouts.Adjust output buffers./etc/sysctl.conf
tuning.Monitor. Continually monitor the number of open connections, free
memory and number of waiting</p><p>5 0.84523547 <a title="51-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-30-Scalability_Perspectives_%235%3A_Werner_Vogels_%E2%80%93_The_Amazon_Technology_Platform.html">480 high scalability-2008-12-30-Scalability Perspectives #5: Werner Vogels – The Amazon Technology Platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectivesis a series of posts that highlights the ideas that
will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a
thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned
though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires
an open mind.Werner VogelsDr. Werner Vogels is Vice President & Chief
Technology Officer at Amazon.com where he is responsible for driving the
company’s technology vision, which is to continuously enhance the innovation
on behalf of Amazon’s customers at a global scale. Prior to joining Amazon, he
worked as a researcher at Cornell University where he was a principal
investigator in several research projects that target the scalability and
robustness of mission-critical enterprise computing systems. He is regarded as
one of the world's top experts on ultra-scalable systems and he uses his
weblog to educate the community about issues such as eventual consistency.

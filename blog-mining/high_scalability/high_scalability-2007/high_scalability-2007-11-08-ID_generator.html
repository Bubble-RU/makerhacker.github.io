<p>Introduction: (Please bare with me, I'm a new, passionate, confident and terrified programmer :D )     Background:   I'm pre-launch and 1 year into the development of my application.  My target is to be able to eventually handle millions of registered users with 5-10% of them concurrent.  Up to this point I've used auto-increment to assign unique identifiers to rows.  I am now considering switching to a non-sequential strategy.  Oh, I'm using the LAMP configuration.     My reasons for avoiding auto-increment:   1.  Complicates replication when scaling horizontally.  Risk of collision is significant (when running multiple masters).  Note: I've read the other entries in this forum that relate to ID generation and there have been some great suggestions -- including a strategy that uses auto-increment in a way that avoids this pitfall... That said, I'm still nervous about it.   2.  Potential bottleneck when retrieving/assigning IDs -- IDs assigned at the database.

 Fashiolista  started out as a hobby project which we built on the side. We had absolutely no idea it would grow into one of the largest online fashion communities. The entire first version took about two weeks to develop and our feed implementation was dead simple. We’ve come a long way since then and I’d like to share our experience with scaling feed systems.
 
Feeds are a core component of many large startups such as Pinterest, Instagram, Wanelo and Fashiolista. At Fashiolista the feed system powers the  flat feed ,  aggregated feed  and the  notification  system.

<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.    We're basically using a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget). Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text, author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.    I'm wondering if we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just post IDs) from Redis, and then Rails app would need to query to g</p><p>5 0.090572834 <a title="145-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-28-ID_generation_schemes.html">346 high scalability-2008-06-28-ID generation schemes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here's an  Update On Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes Python . 
 
How do you add realtime functionality to a web scale application? That's what  Adam Hitchcock , a Software Engineer at Disqus talks about in an excellent talk:  Making DISQUS Realtime  ( slides ).
 
Disqus had to take their commenting system and add realtime capabilities to it. Not something that's easy to do when at the time of the talk (2013) they had had just hit a billion unique visitors a month.
 
What Disqus developed is a realtime commenting system called “realertime” that was tested to handle 1.5 million concurrently connected users, 45,000 new connections per second, 165,000 messages/second, with less than .2 seconds latency end-to-end.
 
The nature of a commenting system is that it is IO bound and has a high fanout, that is a comment comes in and must be sent out to a lot of readers. It's a problem very similar to what  Twitter must solve . 
 
Disqus' solution was quite interesting as was th</p><p>3 0.59934402 <a title="145-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-10-28-Design_Decisions_for_Scaling_Your_High_Traffic_Feeds.html">1538 high scalability-2013-10-28-Design Decisions for Scaling Your High Traffic Feeds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In  How to take advantage of Redis just adding it to your stack  Salvatore 'antirez' Sanfilippo shows how to solve some common problems in Redis by taking advantage of its unique data structure handling capabilities. Common Redis primitives like LPUSH, and LTRIM, and LREM are used to accomplish tasks programmers need to get done, but that can be hard or slow in more traditional stores. A very useful and practical article. How would you accomplish these tasks in your framework?
  
  Show latest items listings in your home page . This is a live in-memory cache and is very fast.  LPUSH  is used to insert a content ID at the head of the list stored at a key.  LTRIM  is used to limit the number of items in the list to 5000. If the user needs to page beyond this cache only then are they sent to the database. 
  Deletion and filtering . If a cached article is deleted it can be removed from the cache using  LREM . 
  Leaderboards and related problems . A leader board is a set sorted by score.</p><p>5 0.58476841 <a title="145-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-07-Update_on_Disqus%3A_It%27s_Still_About_Realtime%2C_But_Go_Demolishes_Python.html">1644 high scalability-2014-05-07-Update on Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes Python</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our last article on Disqus:  How Disqus Went Realtime With 165K Messages Per Second And Less Than .2 Seconds Latency , was a little out of date, but the folks at Disqus have been busy implementing, not talking, so we don't know a lot about what they are doing now, but we do have a short update in  C1MM and NGINX  by John Watson and an article  Trying out this Go thing .
 
So Disqus has grown a bit:
  
 1.3 billion unique visitors 
 10 billion page views 
 500 million users engaged in discussions 
 3 million communities 
 25 million comments 
  
They are still all about realtime, but Go replaced Python in their Realtime system:
  
 Original Realtime backend was written in a pretty lightweight Python + gevent. 
 The realtime service is a hybrid of CPU intensive tasks + lots of network IO. Gevent was handling the network IO without an issue, but at higher contention, the CPU was choking everything. Switching over to Go removed that contention, which was the primary issue that was being se</p><p>6 0.5819332 <a title="145-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-08-13-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Facing_scaling_issues_with_news_feeds_on_Redis.__Any_advice%3F.html">1303 high scalability-2012-08-13-Ask HighScalability: Facing scaling issues with news feeds on Redis.

<p>Introduction: What do you guys think/know about the scalability of the popular CMSs (like Joomla, Drupal or Typo3)?   Any experience/suggestions there?     I'm not sure which to pick yet...

<p>Introduction: Hi,     I would like feed back on a ID generator I just made. What positive and negative effects do you see with this. It's programmed in Java, but could just as easily be programmed in any other typical language. It's thread safe and does not use any synchronization. When testing it on my laptop, I was able to generate 10 million IDs within about 15 seconds, so it should be more than fast enough.     Take a look at the attachment.. (had to rename it from IdGen.java to IdGen.txt to attach it)      IdGen.java</p><p>3 0.82012326 <a title="145-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-03-Six_guiding_principles_to_Consolidate_your_IT_.html">894 high scalability-2010-09-03-Six guiding principles to Consolidate your IT </a></p>
<p>Introduction: The need for IT consolidation is most evident in two types of organizations. In the first group, IT grew organically with business over the decades, and survived changes of strategy, management, staff and vendor orientation. The second group of businesses capital groups are characterized by rapid growth through acquisitions (followed by attempts to integrate radically different IT environments). In both groups, their IT infrastructures have typically been pieced together over the past 20 (or more) years.ďťż

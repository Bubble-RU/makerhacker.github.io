<p>Introduction: Lighttpd  (pronounced "lighty") is a web server which is designed to be secure, fast, standards-compliant, and flexible while being optimized for speed-critical environments. Its low memory footprint (compared to other web servers), light CPU load and its speed goals make lighttpd suitable for servers that are suffering load problems, or for serving static media separately from dynamic content. lighttpd is free software / open source, and is distributed under the BSD license. lighttpd runs on GNU/Linux and other Unix-like operating systems and Microsoft Windows.

Early we learned   PlentyOfFish   catches and releases many millions of hits a day on just 1 web server and three database servers.   Google   runs a   Dalek   army full of servers.   YouSendIt  , a company making it easy to send and receive large files, has 24 web servers,  3 database servers, 170 storage servers, and a few miscellaneous servers.   Vimeo  , a video sharing company, has 100 servers for streaming video, 4 web servers, and 2 database servers.   Meebo  , an AJAX based instant messaging company, uses 40 servers to handle messaging, over 40 web servers,  and 10 servers for forums, jabber, testing, and so on.   FeedBurner  , a news feed management company, has 70 web servers, 15 database servers, and 10 miscellaneous servers.

<p>Introduction: The term "cloud portability" is often considered a synonym for "Cloud  API  portability," which implies a series of misconceptions.
 
If we break away from dogma, we can find that what we really looking for in cloud portability is Application portability between clouds which can be a vastly simpler requirement, as we can achieve application portability without settling on a common Cloud  API. 
 
In this post i'll be covering five common misconceptions people have  WRT  to cloud portability.
  
  Cloud portability = Cloud API portability . API portability is easy; cloud API portability is not.  
  The main incentive for Cloud Portability is - Avoiding Vendor lock-in .Cloud portability is more about business agility than it is about vendor lock-in.  
  Cloud portability isn√¢&euro;&trade;t for startups . Every startup that is expecting rapid growth should re-examine their deployments and plan for cloud portability rather than wait to be forced to make the switch when you are least prepared to do so.</p><p>5 0.1024814 <a title="26-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-02-05-Little%E2%80%99s_Law%2C_Scalability_and_Fault_Tolerance%3A_The_OS_is_your_bottleneck._What_you_can_do%3F.html">1591 high scalability-2014-02-05-Little‚Äôs Law, Scalability and Fault Tolerance: The OS is your bottleneck. What you can do?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guestrepostby Ron Pressler, the founder and CEO ofParallel Universe,
a Y Combinator company building advanced middleware for real-time
applications. Little's Law helps us determine the maximum request rate a
server can handle. When we apply it, we find that the dominating factor
limiting a server's capacity is not the hardware but theOS.Should we buy more
hardware if software is the problem? If not, how can we remove that software
limitation in a way that does not make the code much harder to write and
understand?Many modern web applications are composed of multiple (often
many)HTTPservices (this is often called a micro-service architecture). This
architecture has many advantages in terms of code reuse and maintainability,
scalability and fault tolerance. In this post I'd like to examine one
particular bottleneck in the approach, which hinders scalability as well as
fault tolerance, and various ways to deal with it (I am using the term
"scalability" very loosely in this post</p><p>6 0.097584635 <a title="26-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-03-26-7_Years_of_YouTube_Scalability_Lessons_in_30_Minutes.html">1215 high scalability-2012-03-26-7 Years of YouTube Scalability Lessons in 30 Minutes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update : More background by Ikai Lan, who worked on the mobile server team at LinkedIn,¬†says  some facts were left out : the app made "a cross data center request, guys. Running on single-threaded Rails servers (every request blocked the entire process), running Mongrel, leaking memory like a sieve."¬†Which explains why any non-blocking approach would be a win. And Ikai, I hope as you do that nobody reads HS and just does what somebody else does without thinking. The goal here is information that you can use to make your own decisions.

Ryan Paul has written an excellent¬† behind-the-scenes look at LinkedIn‚Äôs mobile engineering . While the mobile part of the story--23% mobile usage; focus on simplicity, ease of use, and reliability; using a room metaphor; 30% native, 80% HTML; embedded lightweight HTTP server; single client-app connection--could help guide your mobile strategy, the backend effects of moving from Rails to Node.js may also prove interesting.¬†

Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server, e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.     The problem is that I'm still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my qu</p><p>6 0.7462166 <a title="26-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere_Commerce_High_Availability_and_Performance_Configurations.html">321 high scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere Commerce High Availability and Performance Configurations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Garry Tan, cofounder of Posterous, lists 12 lessons for scaling that apply to more than just Rails. 
  Use cloud storage for static files.   Use HTTP Cache Control to tell the browser what it can cache.   Use Sphinx for text search.   Use InnoDB for more crash resistant and faster writes.   Don't use textbook Rails ActiveRecord objects. Use New Relic to find exactly what is slow in your system.   Use memcache later so you find your database bottlenecks now.   Use mongrel proctitle to find your slow queries. You are only as fast as your slowest queries.   Use asynchronous job queuing to do work in parallel.    Use monitoring so you'll know when your site went down and why.   Learn by reading the source code, fixing problems, and submitting them back to the community.   Use new plugins. Old plugins can't be trusted.   Use new information. Old information can't be trusted.</p><p>2 0.82634622 <a title="26-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad_Architecture.html">68 high scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TypePad is considered the largest paid blogging service in the world.  After experience problems because of their meteoric growth, they eventually transitioned to an architecture patterned after their sister company, LiveJournal.
 
Site: http://www.typepad.com/
  The Platform    MySQL    Memcached    Perl    MogileFS    Apache    Linux 
 The Stats 
    As of 2005 TypePad sends 250mbps of traffic using multiple network pipes for 3TB of traffic a day. They were growing by 10-20% each month. I was unable to find more recent statistics. 
 The Architecture 
    Original Architecture: - Single server running Linux, Apache, Postgres, Perl, mod_perl - Storage was NFS on a filer.    A Devastating Crash Caused a New Direction - A RAID controller failed and spewed data across all RAID disks. - The database was corrupted and the backups were corrupted. - Their redundant filers suffered from "split brain" syndrome.    They move to  LiveJournal Architecture  type architecture which isn't surprising</p><p>same-blog 3 0.82259691 <a title="26-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Paper%3A_Lightweight_Web_servers.html">26 high scalability-2007-07-25-Paper: Lightweight Web servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This paper is a great overview of different lightweight web servers. A lot of websites  use lightweight web servers to serve images and static content. YouTube is one example:  YouTube Architecture .
   
So if you need to improve performance consider changing over a different web server for some types of content.
 
Overview:   Recent years have enjoyed a florescence of interesting implementations of Web servers, including lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel, among others. These Web servers boast different combinations of performance, ease of administration, portability, security, and related values. The following engineering study surveys the field of lightweight Web servers to help you find one likely to meet the technical requirements of your next project.  "Lightweight" Web servers like lighttpd, litespeed, and mongrel can offer dramatic benefits for your projects. This article surveys the possibilities and shows how they apply to you.

<p>Introduction: Recently, I was reading Todd Hoff's write-up on¬† FaceBook real time analytics system  . As usual, Todd did an excellent job in summarizing¬† this video ¬†from Engineering Manager at Facebook¬† Alex Himel .
 
In  the first post , I‚Äôd like to summarize the case study, and consider some things that weren't mentioned in the summaries. This will lead to an architecture for building your own Realtime Time Analytics for Big-Data that might be easier to implement, using Facebook's experience as a starting point and guide as well as the experience gathered through a recent work with few of GigaSpaces customers. The  second post  provide a summary of that new approach as well as a pattern and a demo for building your own Real Time Analytics system..

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Nice introductory New York Time's article  Cloud Computing: So You Don‚Äôt Have to Stand Still . Good example of how Animoto used RightScale and Amazon to meet a Facebook driven demand of 25,000 test drives an hour.     Update: Peter Laird in  Understanding the Cloud Computing/SaaS/PaaS markets: a Map of the Players in the Industry  paints a very cool visual map of all the cloud service players. It's a larger industry than you might think.      Once upon a time I worked at an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch startup. Over a delicious Christmas punch my grandma asked me what I did for a living that I could afford such extravagantly inexpensive gifts. Always so subtle. I explained I worked on an ATM switch. Mistake. She sniffed, said that's nice, and asked me why the Automated Teller Machine ate her bank card that morning. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't convince her I didn't work on bank ATMs. To all future job interrogations I waxed off, protesting I do boring soft</p><p>6 0.78353328 <a title="26-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-21-Product%3A_Hyperic.html">219 high scalability-2008-01-21-Product: Hyperic</a></p>

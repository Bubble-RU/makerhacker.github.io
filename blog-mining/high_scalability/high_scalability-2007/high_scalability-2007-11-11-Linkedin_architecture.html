<p>Introduction: LinkedIn is the largest professional networking site in the world. LinkedIn employees presented two sessions about their server architecture at JavaOne 2008.   This post   contains a summary of these presentations.     Key topics include:      Up-to-date statistics about the LinkedIn user base and activity level   The evolution of the LinkedIn architecture, from 2003 to 2008   "The Cloud", the specialized server that maintains the LinkedIn network graph   Their communication architecture</p><p>3 0.24253301 <a title="148-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-06-Graph_server.html">621 high scalability-2009-06-06-Graph server</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've seen mentioned in few times sites like Digg or LinkedIn using graph servers to hold their social graphs. But the only sort of open source graph server I've found is http://neo4j.org/ .   Can anyone recommend an open source graph server?  Thanks Aaron</p><p>4 0.18080212 <a title="148-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-04-LinkedIn_Moved_from_Rails_to_Node%3A__27_Servers_Cut_and_Up_to_20x_Faster.html">1333 high scalability-2012-10-04-LinkedIn Moved from Rails to Node:  27 Servers Cut and Up to 20x Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update : More background by Ikai Lan, who worked on the mobile server team at LinkedIn, says  some facts were left out : the app made "a cross data center request, guys. Running on single-threaded Rails servers (every request blocked the entire process), running Mongrel, leaking memory like a sieve." Which explains why any non-blocking approach would be a win. And Ikai, I hope as you do that nobody reads HS and just does what somebody else does without thinking. The goal here is information that you can use to make your own decisions.
 
 
 
Ryan Paul has written an excellent  behind-the-scenes look at LinkedIn’s mobile engineering . While the mobile part of the story--23% mobile usage; focus on simplicity, ease of use, and reliability; using a room metaphor; 30% native, 80% HTML; embedded lightweight HTTP server; single client-app connection--could help guide your mobile strategy, the backend effects of moving from Rails to Node.js may also prove interesting.

<p>Introduction: Hi,     An interesting post on Linkedin architecture:     http://furiouspurpose.blogspot.com/2007/11/qcon-linkedin-architecture.html</p><p>4 0.81134564 <a title="148-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-09-GridwiseTech_revolutionizes_data_management.html">697 high scalability-2009-09-09-GridwiseTech revolutionizes data management</a></p>
<p>Introduction: GridwiseTech has  developed AdHoc , an advanced framework for sharing geographically distributed data and compute resources. It simplifies the resource management and makes cooperation secure and effective. The premise of AdHoc is to enable each member of the associated institution to control access to his or her resources without an IT administrator’s help, and with high security level of any exposed data or applications assured. It takes 3 easy steps to establish cooperation within AdHoc: create a virtual organization, add resources and share them. The application can be implemented within any organization to exchange data and resources or between institutions to join forces for more efficient results.  AdHoc was initially created for a consortium of hospitals and institutions to share medical data sets. As a technical partner in that project, GridwiseTech implemented the Security Framework to provide access to that data and designed a graphical tool to facilitate the administration</p><p>5 0.79550445 <a title="148-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-23-Postgresql_on_high_availability_websites%3F.html">73 high scalability-2007-08-23-Postgresql on high availability websites?</a></p>

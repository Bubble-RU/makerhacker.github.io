Proxy articles all over the place. It's like those "get rich quick" books that
say all you have to do is visualize a giraffe with a big yellow dot
superimposed over it and by sympathetic magic giraffes will suddenly stampede
into your life. Without realizing it I must have visualized transparent
proxies smothered in yellow dots.One of the brightest images is a wonderful
series of articles by Peter Romianowski describing the evolution of their
proxy architecture. Their application is an OLTP system executing 200 million

<p>Introduction: Skypeuses PostgreSQL as their backend database. PostgreSQL doesn't get enough
run in the database world so I was excited to see how PostgreSQL is used "as
the main DB for most of [Skype's] business needs." Their approach is to use a
traditional stored procedure interface for accessing data and on top of that
layer proxy servers which hash SQL requests to a set of database servers that
actually carry out queries. The result is a horizontally partitioned system
that they think will scale to handle 1 billion users.Skype's goal is an
architecture that can handle 1 billion plus users. This level of scale isn't
practically solvable with one really big computer, so our masked superhero
horizontal scaling comes to the rescue.Hardware is dual or quad Opterons with
SCSI RAID.Followed common database progression: Start with one DB. Add new
databases partitioned by functionality. Replicate read-mostly data for better
read access. Then horizontally partition data across multiple nodes..In a

<p>Introduction: I met the CodeFutures folks, makers ofdbShards, atGluecon. They occupy an
interesting niche in the database space, somewhere betweenNoSQL, which
jettisons everything SQL, and high end analytics platformsthat completely
rewrite the backend while keeping a SQL facade.High concept: I think of
dbShards as a sort of commercial OLTP mashup of features from HSCALE
(partitioning) +MySQL Proxy (transparent intermediate layer) +Memcached
(client side sharding) +Gigaspaces(parallel query) + MySQL (transactions).You
may find dbShards interesting if you are looking to keep SQL, need scale out
writes and reads, need out of the box parallel query capabilities, and would
prefer to use a standard platform like MySQL as a base. To learn more about
dbShards I asked Cory Isaacson (CEO and CTO) a few devastatingly difficult
questions (not really).Who are you, what is dbShards, and what problem was
dbShards created to solve?I'm Cory Isaacson, CEO/CTO of CodeFutures

<p>Introduction: At the core of the new real-time web, which is really really old, are
continuous queries. I like how this paper proposed to handle dynamic demand
and dynamic resource availability by making the underlying system adaptable,
which seems like a very cloudy kind of thing to do.Abstract:The long-running
nature of continuous queries poses new scalability challenges for dataflow
processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that may be shared across
multiplequeries. The scalability of these dataflows is limited by their
constituent, stateful operators - e.g. windowed joins or grouping operators.
To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a
shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static
techniquesfor partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as
workload and runtime conditions evolve. Longrunning CQ dataflows must continue
to function robustly inthe face of these imbalances. To address this
challenge, we introduce a dataflo</p><p>2 0.80969477 <a title="18-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy%3A_Stop_Using_Linked-Lists.html">1462 high scalability-2013-05-22-Strategy: Stop Using Linked-Lists</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What data structure is more sacred than the link list? If we get rid of it
what silly interview questions would we use instead? But not using linked-
lists is exactly what Aater Suleman recommends inShould you ever use Linked-
Lists?InThe Secret To 10 Million Concurrent Connectionsone of the important
strategies is not scribbling data all over memory via pointers because
following pointers increases cache misses whichreduces performance. And
there's nothing more iconic of pointers than the link list.Here are Aeter's
reasons to be anti-linked-list:They reduce the benefit of out-of-order
execution.They throw off hardware prefetching.They reduce DRAM and TLB
locality.They cannot leverage SIMD.They are harder to send to GPUs.He also
demolishes the pros of linked-lists, finding arrays a better option in almost
every case. Good discussion in the comment section as not everyone
agrees.Patrick Wyatt detailshow a linked-list threading bugrepeatedly crashed

<p>Introduction: MySQL Scale-Out by application partitioningby Oli SennhauserEventually every
database system hit its limits. Especially on the Internet, where you have
millions of users which theoretically access your database simultaneously,
eventually your IO system will be a bottleneck. [A] promising but more complex
solution with nearly no scale-out limits is application partitioning. If and
when you get into the top-1000 rank on alexa [1], you have to think about such
solutions.A Quick Hit of What's InsideHorizontal application partitioning,

<p>Introduction: Jurriaan Persyn is a Lead Web Developer at Netlog, a social portal site that
gets 50 million unique visitors and 5+ billion page views per month. In this
paper Jurriaan goes into a lot of excellent nuts and bolts details about how
they used sharding to scale their system. If you are pondering sharding as a
solution to your scaling problems you'll want to read this paper. As the paper
is quite well organized there's no reason to write a summary, but I especially
liked this part from the conclusion:If you can do with simpler solutions
(better hardware, more hardware, server tweaking and tuning, vertical
partitioning, sql query optimization, ...) that require less development cost,
why invest lots of effort in sharding? On the other hand, when your visitor
statistics really start blowing through the roof, it is a good direction to
go. After all, it worked for us.</p><p>6 0.71870798 <a title="18-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-22-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_June_22%2C_2012.html">1270 high scalability-2012-06-22-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For June 22, 2012</a></p>

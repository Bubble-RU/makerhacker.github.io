<p>Introduction: In articleBuilding Super-Scalable Web Systems with RESTUdi Dahan tells an
interesting story of how they made a weather reporting system scale for over
10 million users. So many users hitting their weather database didn't scale.
Caching in a straightforward way wouldn't work because weather is obviously
local. Caching all local reports would bring the entire database into memory,
which would work for some companies, but wasn't cost efficient for them.So in
typical REST fashion they turned locations into URIs. For example:
http://weather.myclient.com/UK/London. This allows the weather information to
be cached by intermediaries instead of hitting their servers. Hopefully for
each location their servers will be hit a few times and then the caches will
be hit until expiry.breakIn order to send users directly to the correct
location an IP location check is performed on login and stored in a cookie.
The lookup is done once and from then on out a GET is performed directly on
the resource. Ther</p><p>3 0.10049181 <a title="34-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-27-Product%3A_System_Imager_-_Automate_Deployment_and_Installs.html">263 high scalability-2008-02-27-Product: System Imager - Automate Deployment and Installs</a></p>

Linux to masses of similar machines relatively easy. It makes software
distribution, configuration, and operating system updates easy, and can also
be used for content distribution.SystemImager makes it easy to do automated
installs (clones), software distribution, content or data distribution,
configuration changes, and operating system updates to your network of Linux
machines. You can even update from one Linux release version to
another!breakIt can also be used to ensure safe production deployments. By
saving your current production image before updating to your new production
image, you have a highly reliable contingency mechanism. If the new production
enviroment is found to be flawed, simply roll-back to the last production
image with a simple update command!Some typical environments include: Internet

<p>Introduction: Muninthe monitoring tool surveys all your computers and remembers what it saw.
It presents all the information in graphs through a web interface. Its
emphasis is on plug and play capabilities. After completing a installation a
high number of monitoring plugins will be playing with no more effort.Using
Munin you can easily monitor the performance of your computers, networks,
SANs, applications, weather measurements and whatever comes to mind. It makes
it easy to determine "what's different today" when a performance problem crops
up. It makes it easy to see how you're doing capacity-wise on any resources.</p><p>2 0.59340793 <a title="34-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-12-4_Strategies_for_Punching_Down_Traffic_Spikes.html">1282 high scalability-2012-07-12-4 Strategies for Punching Down Traffic Spikes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Travis Reeder inSpikability - An Application's Ability to Handle Unknown
and/or Inconsistent Load gives four good ways of handling spikey loads:Have
more resources than you'll ever need. Estimate the maximum traffic you'll need
and keep that many servers running. Downside is you are paying for capacity
you aren't using.Disable features during high loads. Reduce load by disabling
features or substituting in lighter weight features. Downside is users to have
access to features.Auto scaling. Launch new servers in response to load.
Downsides are it's complicated to setup and slow to respond. Random spikes
will cause cycling of instances going up and down.Use message queues. Queues
soak up work requests during traffic spikes. More servers can be started to
process work from the queue. Resources aren't wasted and features are
disabled. Downside is increased latency.</p><p>3 0.58372331 <a title="34-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-29-100%25_on_Amazon_Web_Services%3A_Soocial.com_-_a_lesson_of_porting_your_service_to_Amazon.html">477 high scalability-2008-12-29-100% on Amazon Web Services: Soocial.com - a lesson of porting your service to Amazon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Simone Brunozzi, technology evangelist for Amazon Web Services in Europe,
describes how Soocial.com was fully ported to Amazon web services.
----------------This period of the year I decided to dedicate some time to
better understand how our customers use AWS, therefore I spent some online
time with Stefan Fountain and the nice guys at Soocial.com, a "one address
book solution to contact management", and I would like to share with you some
details of their IT infrastructure, which now runs 100% on Amazon Web
Services!In the last few months, they've been working hard to cope with tens
of thousands of users and to get ready to easily scale to millions. To make
this possible, they decided to move ALL their architecture to Amazon Web
Services. Despite the fact that they were quite happy with their previous
hosting provider, Amazon proved to be the way to go.-----------------Read the

<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical
successful website goes through:Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture,
low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers,
database server, and internal storage.Stage 2 - More of the same, just
bigger.Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache
static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding.Stage 4 - The Pain
Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too
long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content,
significant re-architecting for DB.Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink
entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters,
using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster.Stage 6
- Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database
architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again,
optimizing some code,</p><p>5 0.53561574 <a title="34-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-01-11-Have_We_Reached_the_End_of_Scaling%3F.html">758 high scalability-2010-01-11-Have We Reached the End of Scaling?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an excerpt from my articleBuilding Super Scalable Systems: Blade
Runner Meets Autonomic Computing in the Ambient Cloud.Have we reached the end
of scaling? That's what I asked myself one day after noticing a bunch of "The
End of" headlines. We've reachedThe End of Historybecause the Western liberal
democracy is the "end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the
final form of human government." We've reachedThe End of Sciencebecause of the
"fact that there aren't going to be any obvious, cataclysmic revolutions."
We've even reachedThe End of Theorybecause all answers can be found in the
continuous stream of data we're collecting. And doesn't always seem like we're
atThe End of the World?Motivated by the prospect of everything ending, I began
to wonder: have we really reached The End of Scaling?For a while I thought
this might be true. The reason I thought the End of Scaling might be near is
because of the slow down of potential articles at

So he took refuge in the home of a cheap hosting provider and Beau realized his dream, creating  FEEDblendr . But FEEDblendr chewed up so much CPU creating blended feeds that the cheap hosting provider ordered Beau to find another home. Where was Beau to go? He eventually found a new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of affordable CPU cycles.

<p>Introduction: Scoble   the Ubiquitous has a fascinating post on how Mogulus, a live video channel startup, uses S3/EC2 and doesn't own a single server. The trends that have been happening for a while now are going mainstream. To do great things you no longer need to start by creating a huge war chest. You can forage off the land, like any good mobile, light weight fighting unit.     For a strategy hit he mentions the same needed change in perspective as Beau Lebens talked about when making   FeedBlendr  :     One tip he gave us is that when using Amazon’s services you have to design your systems with the assumption that they will never be up and running. What he means by that is services are “volatile” and can go up and down without notice. So, he’s designed his systems to survive that. He told me that it meant his engineering teams had to be quite disciplined in designing their architecture.</p><p>3 0.16917993 <a title="138-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-09-16-The_Hidden_DNS_Tax_-_Cascading_Timeouts_and_Errors.html">1517 high scalability-2013-09-16-The Hidden DNS Tax - Cascading Timeouts and Errors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by    Nick Burling , VP of Product Management of  Bluestripe . 
   Readers of High Scalability know are well versed in performance optimization techniques. Reverse proxies, Varnish, Redis — you hear about them daily. But what you may not realize is that one of the oldest technologies in your stack can be one of your biggest bottlenecks: DNS. 
   People don't spend a lot of time thinking about DNS. It's not sexy. It's an infrastructure service, and it's just supposed to work. 
  At BlueStripe, we work with many teams running applications that support millions of web requests a day. We keep seeing DNS delays and errors that the platform operations team never knows about. It's so common we've start calling it the  Hidden DNS Tax .
   What is the Hidden DNS Tax?     The Hidden DNS Tax is a hard-to-see performance hit your users take from DNS timeouts and errors in your back-end architecture. We've seen it bring down the main web application for a Fortune 10 company.</p><p>4 0.15727799 <a title="138-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-02-An_Epic_TripAdvisor_Update%3A_Why_Not_Run_on_the_Cloud%3F_The_Grand_Experiment..html">1331 high scalability-2012-10-02-An Epic TripAdvisor Update: Why Not Run on the Cloud?

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by  Shawn Hsiao ,  Luke Massa , and  Victor Luu . Shawn runs  TripAdvisor ’s Technical Operations team, Luke and Victor interned on his team this past summer. This post is introduced by  Andy Gelfond , TripAdvisor’s head of engineering.   It's been a little over a year since our last post about the  TripAdvisor architecture . It has been an exciting year. Our business and team continues to grow, we are now an independent public company, and we have continued to keep/scale our development process and culture as we have grown - we still run dozens of independent teams, and each team continues to work across the entire stack. All that has changed are the numbers:
  
 56M visitors per month 
 350M+ pages requests a day 
 120TB+ of warehouse data running on a large Hadoop cluster, and quickly growing 
  
We also had a very successful college intern program that brought on over 60 interns this past summer, all who were quickly on boarded and doing the same kind of work a</p><p>5 0.15020597 <a title="138-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy%3A_Order_Two_Mediums_Instead_of_Two_Smalls_and_the_EC2_Buffet.html">812 high scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy: Order Two Mediums Instead of Two Smalls and the EC2 Buffet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Vaibhav Puranik  in  Web  serving in the cloud – our experiences with nginx and instance sizes  describes their experience trying to maximum traffic and minimum their web serving costs on EC2. Initially they tested with two m1.small instance types and then they the switched to two c1.mediums instance types. The m1s are the standard instance types and the c1s are the high CPU instance types. Obviously the mediums have greater capability, but the cost difference was interesting:
  
 In the long term they will save money using the larger instances and not autoscaling. With the small instances, traffic bursts caused autoscaling to kick in. New instances were started in response to load. The instances woud be up for a short period of time and then spin down again. This constant churn costs a lot of money. Selecting the larger instance sizes, which are capable of handling the load without autoscaling, turn out to save money even though they are more expensive. Starting new instances also tak</p><p>6 0.14492579 <a title="138-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-12-FeedBurner_Architecture.html">7 high scalability-2007-07-12-FeedBurner Architecture</a></p>

 Urbandive  is an immersive view service launched by the  French YellowPages  which allows you to travel in cities in France thanks to a 360° view. Urbandive focuses on providing high definition pictures and accurate professional and social content. One of the biggest jobs was to enable a fast scalable architecture, because it was really difficult to forecast the traffic load at production time. Traffic load may be influenced if the service receives attention from users as a result of advertising.

<p>Introduction: Authored by  Chris Fregly   :  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.  
   Ahead of the upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi’s recent    presentation    at an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few of my recent    Fluxcapacitor.com    consulting engagements, I’ve compiled a list of 10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS. 
    1) Query AWS resource metadata  
      
   Can’t remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?     awsnow.info    is the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.  Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You’re in luck.  There’s now a    REST API   , as well! 
   Note:  These are default soft limits and will vary by account.

<p>Introduction: Amazon is fixing two of their major problems: no static IP addresses and single datacenter operation. By adding these two new features developers can finally build a no apology system on Amazon. Before you always had to throw in an apology or two. No, we don't have low failover times because of the silly DNS games and unexceptionable DNS update and propagation times and no, we don't operate in more than one datacenter. No more. Now Amazon is adding   Elastic IP Addresses   and   Availability Zones  .     Elastic IP addresses are far better than normal IP addresses because they are both in tight with   Jessica Alba   and they are:        Static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your account, not a particular instance, and you control that address until you choose to explicitly release it. Unlike traditional static IP addresses, however, Elastic IP addresses allow you to mask instance or availability zone failures by programmatica</p><p>6 0.7068339 <a title="138-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy%3A_Order_Two_Mediums_Instead_of_Two_Smalls_and_the_EC2_Buffet.html">812 high scalability-2010-04-19-Strategy: Order Two Mediums Instead of Two Smalls and the EC2 Buffet</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How does Facebook handle the massive New Year's Eve traffic spike? Thanks to Mike Swift, in  Facebook gets ready for New Year's Eve , we get a little insight as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still interesting.
  Problem Setup   
 Facebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be shared on New Year's eve. 
 Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average of 130 friends. 
 Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then rendered. 
 Different events put different stresses on different parts of Facebook.       
 
 Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of capacity  
 News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve Jobs drive user status updates

<p>Introduction: In article   Building Super-Scalable Web Systems with REST   Udi Dahan tells an interesting story of how they made a weather reporting system scale for over 10 million users.  So many users hitting their weather database didn't scale. Caching in a straightforward way wouldn't work because weather is obviously local. Caching all local reports would bring  the entire database into memory, which would work for some companies, but wasn't cost efficient for them.   So in typical REST fashion they turned locations into URIs. For example: http://weather.myclient.com/UK/London. This allows the weather information to be cached by intermediaries instead of hitting their servers.  Hopefully for each location their servers will be hit a few times and then the caches will be hit until expiry.
   
 In order to send users directly to the correct location an IP location check is performed on login and stored in a cookie. The lookup is done once and from then on out a GET is performed directly on the r</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90728652 <a title="138-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Feedblendr_Architecture_-_Using_EC2_to_Scale.html">138 high scalability-2007-10-30-Feedblendr Architecture - Using EC2 to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A man had a dream. His dream was to blend a bunch of RSS/Atom/RDF feeds into a single feed. The man is Beau Lebens of  Feedville  and like most dreamers he was a little short on coin. So he took refuge in the home of a cheap hosting provider and Beau realized his dream, creating  FEEDblendr . But FEEDblendr chewed up so much CPU creating blended feeds that the cheap hosting provider ordered Beau to find another home. Where was Beau to go? He eventually found a new home in the virtual machine room of Amazon's EC2. This is the story of how Beau was finally able to create his one feeds safe within the cradle of affordable CPU cycles.

  1,000,000 daily users and no cache . Wooga flash game with 50K DB updates/second, Ruby backend. They hit an IO wall with MySQL at 1000 DB updates/sec. They needed more so they went with Redis. Not quite honest to say no cache was used as everything is RAM, but maybe that's the point. Use a lot of automation. Inactive users are archived. Moved away from EBS.

<p>Introduction: StubHub is an interesting architecture to take a look at because, as market makers for tickets, they are in a different business than we normally get to consider.
 
StubHub is surprisingly large, growing at 20% a year, serving 800K complex pages per hour, selling 5 million tickets per year, and handling 2 million API calls per hour. 
 
And the ticket space is surprisingly rich in complexity. StubHub's traffic is tricky. It's bursty, centering around unpredictable game outcomes, events, schedules, and seasons. There’s a lot of money involved. There are a lot of different actors involved. There are a lot of complex business processes involved. And StubHub has several complementary but very different parts of their business: they have an ad server component serving ads to sites like ESPN, a rich interactive UI, and a real-time ticket market component.
 
Most interesting to me is how StubHub is bringing into the digital realm the once quintessentially high-touch physical world of tickets,</p><p>6 0.89569229 <a title="138-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-04-10-Paper%3A_Scalable_Atomic_Visibility_with_RAMP_Transactions_-_Scale_Linearly_to_100_Servers.html">1629 high scalability-2014-04-10-Paper: Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions - Scale Linearly to 100 Servers</a></p>

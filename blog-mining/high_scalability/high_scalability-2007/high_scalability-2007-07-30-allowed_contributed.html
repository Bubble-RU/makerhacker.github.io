<p>Introduction: The main thrust of the Packet Pushers  Show 41  episode was to reveal and ruminate over the horrors of a successful  attack on RSA , which puts the whole world security complex at risk. Near the end, at about 46 minutes in, there was an excellent section on how to go about building out a low cost datacenter.
 
Who cares? Well, someone emailed me this exact same question awhile back and I had a pretty useless response. So here's making up for that by summarizing the recommendations from the elite Packet Pushers cabal:
 
 
  
 Look at Arista and Juniper.  
 Juniper           
 
 Has a range of stackable switches, which includes some 10 gig. 
 If your budget can stretch for it they might make a good deal on their new QFX proto-fabric product. You can't get a full sized fabric solution, but you can get a few switches together to make a two port fabric. Good solution if you are running 10 gig and only need 30 or 40 10 gig ports.

<p>Introduction: Love this little example of the human condition from  John Kellden Â via  Ilya Grigorik .

<p>Introduction: From the website:   The  lbpool project  provides a load balancing JDBC driver for use with DB connection pools. It wraps a normal JDBC driver providing reconnect semantics in the event of additional hardware availability, partial system failure, or uneven load distribution. It also evenly distributes all new connections among slave DB servers in a given pool. Each time connect() is called it will attempt to use the best server with the least system load.     
 
 The biggest scalability issue with large applications that are mostly READ bound is the number of transactions per second that the disks in your cluster can handle. You can generally solve this in two ways.  1. Buy bigger and faster disks with expensive RAID controllers. 2. Buy CHEAP hardware on CHEAP disks but lots of machines.   We prefer the cheap hardware approach and lbpool allows you to do this.  Even if you *did* manage to use cheap hardware most load balancing hardware is expensive, requires a redundant balancer (if it</p><p>6 0.1302601 <a title="49-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-08-Servers_Component_-_How_to_choice_and_build_perfect_server.html">653 high scalability-2009-07-08-Servers Component - How to choice and build perfect server</a></p>

<p>Introduction: All the cool kids advocate scaling out as the secret sauce of scaling. And it is, but don't forget to serve some tasty "scaling up" as a side dish. Scaling up doesn't have to mean buying a jet propelled, liquid cooled, 128 core monster super computer. Scaling up can just mean buying at the high end of the commodity buffet by buying more cores, more memory and using a shared nothing architecture to  take advantage of all that power without adding complexity. Scale out when you need to, but big beefy boxes can absorb a lot of load before it's necessary to hit up your data center for more rack space. Here are a few examples of scaling out and up:            John Allspaw , Flickr's operations manager, coined the term  diagonal scaling  for this strategy. In  Making a site faster by removing machines  (and a comment on this post) John told how Flickr replaced 67 dual-cpu boxes with 18 dual quad-core machines and recovered almost 4x rack space and reduced costs by about 50 percent.

<p>Introduction: Update:   Good Vibrations  by Radovan Semančík. Lot's of interesting questions about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.   Google Wave  is a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new, convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users of  Google Wave  and we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to "federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.

<p>Introduction: Database normalization is a technique for designing relational database schemas that ensures that the data is optimal for ad-hoc querying and that modifications such as deletion or insertion of data does not lead to data inconsistency. Database denormalization is the process of optimizing your database for reads by creating redundant data. A consequence of denormalization is that insertions or deletions could cause data inconsistency if not uniformly applied to all redundant copies of the data within the database.

<p>Introduction: In his blog post,  Scaling WSO2 Stratos , Srinath Perera explains the scaling architecture of the WSO2 Stratos Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure. It is explained as a series of solutions where every solution adds a new concept to solve a specific problem found in the earlier solution.
 
Overall, WSO2 Stratos uses a combination of intelligent Load balancing and lazy loading to scale up the architecture. More details about Stratos can be found from the paper     WSO2 Stratos: An Industrial Stack to Support Cloud Computing .   
  Problem  
 Stratos is   multi-tenanted  . In other words, there are many tenants. Each tenant generally represents an organization and isolated from other tenants, where each tenant has his own users, resources, and permissions. Stratos supports multiple PaaS services. Each PaaS service is actually a WSO2 Products (e.g. AS, BPS, ESB etc.) offered as a service. Using those services, tenants may deploy their own Web Services, Mediation logic, Workflows, a</p><p>5 0.30466357 <a title="49-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-16-S3_Failed_Because_of_Authentication_Overload.html">249 high scalability-2008-02-16-S3 Failed Because of Authentication Overload</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Being an authentic human being is difficult and apparently authenticating all those S3 requests can be a bit overwhelming as well. Amazon fingered a lot of processor heavy authentication requests as the reason for their downtime:        Early this morning, at 3:30am PST, we started seeing elevated levels of authenticated requests from multiple users in one of our locations.  While we carefully monitor our overall request volumes and these remained within normal ranges, we had not been monitoring the proportion of authenticated requests.  Importantly, these cryptographic requests consume more resources per call than other request types.  Shortly before 4:00am PST, we began to see several other users significantly increase their volume of authenticated calls.  The last of these pushed the authentication service over its maximum capacity before we could complete putting new capacity in place.  In addition to processing authenticated requests, the authentication service also performs accou</p><p>6 0.27217296 <a title="49-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-12-SPHiveDB%3A_A_mixture_of_the_Key-Value_Store_and_the_Relational_Database..html">655 high scalability-2009-07-12-SPHiveDB: A mixture of the Key-Value Store and the Relational Database.</a></p>

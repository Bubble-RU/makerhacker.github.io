commodity systems since 1989.Why flash rules for databasesThe economics of
flash memory are staggering.If you're not using SSD, you are doing it wrong.
Not quite true, but close. Some small applications fit entirely in memory -
less than 100GB - great for in-memory solutions. There's a place for
rotational drives (HDD) in massive streaming analytics and petabytes of data.
But for the vast space between, flash has become the only sensible option. For
example, the Samsung 840 costs $180 for 250GB. The speed rating for this drive
is rated by the manufacturer at 96,000 random 4K read IOPS, and 61,000 random
4K write IOPS. The Samsung 840 is not alone at this price performance. A 300GB
Intel 320 is $450. An OCZ Vertex 4 256GB is $235, with the Intel being rated
as slowest, but our internal testing showing solid performance. Most

aren't just limited to MongoDB, they work for most any database: Optimize your

Computer science works. Complexity analysis works. A btree search is faster
than a table scan. So analyze your queries. Use explain to see what your query
is doing. If it is saying it's using a cursor then it's doing a table scan.
That's slow. Look at the number of documents it looks at to satisfy a query.
Look at how long it takes. Fix: add indexes. It doesn't matter if you are
running on 1 or 100 servers.Know your working set size. Sticking memcache in
front of your database is silly. You have lots of RAM, use it. Embed your
cache in the database, which is how MongoDB works. Working set = Active

<p>Introduction: Hi all, aI run a site that after a complete redesign have gotten a lot more
traffic. The site provides free flash games, so the biggest traffic share goes
to serving flash files (from about 100K and up to several megabytes in size
each.)I currently host the entire site on a hosting provider that have no
traffic limits. But since they are very cheap (yet have served me very well
all the time with at least 99,9% uptime), I don't trust them in allowing me to
continue consuming more and more bandwidth. I just guess I'm going to reach
some internal limit they have on day, so I'm looking into moving all the flash
content over to a content delivery network of some sort.Some recent traffic
stats:August: 12 GBSeptember: 22 GBOctober: 55 GBNovember: Currently 2,3 GB pr
day on average, but it's rising..I've been looking into Amazon S3, but have
not decided on anything yet. So therefor I'm asking if there are any other
provides I should consider, that operates within the same price range as

<p>Introduction: Likewise the current belief that, in the case of artificial machines the very
large and the very small are equally feasible and lasting is a manifest error.
Thus, for example, a small obelisk or column or other solid figure can
certainly be laid down or set up without danger of breaking, while the large
ones will go to pieces under the slightest provocation, and that purely on
account of their own weight. -- GalileoGalileo observed how things broke if
they were naively scaled up. Interestingly, Google noticed a similar pattern
when building larger software systems using the same techniques used to build
smaller systems. Luiz Andre Barroso, Distinguished Engineer at Google, talks
about this fundamental property of scaling systems in his fascinating talk,
Warehouse-Scale Computing: Entering the Teenage Decade. Google found the
larger the scale the greater the impact of latency variability. When a request
is implemented by work done in parallel, as is common with today's service

<p>Introduction: Planning your next buildout and thinking SSDs are still far in the future?
Still too expensive, too low density. Hard disks are cheap, familiar, and
store lots of stuff. In this short and entertaining video Wikia's Artur
Bergmanwants to change your mind about SSDs. SSDs are for today, get with the
math already.Here's Artur's logic:Wikia is all SSD in production. The new
Wikia file servers have a theoretical read rate of ~10GB/sec sequential,
6GB/sec random and 1.2 million IOPs. If you can't do math or love the past,
you love spinning rust. If you are awesome you love SSDs.SSDs are cheaper than
drives using the most relevant metric: $/GB/IOPS. 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS and one
hard drive is 180 IOPS. Need 1 SSD instead of 50 hard drives.With 8 million
files there's a 9 minute fsck. Full backup in 12 minutes (X-25M based).4

<p>Introduction: How would you implement a key-value storage system if you were starting from
scratch? The approach Basho settled on withBitcask, their new backend for
Riak, is an interesting combination of using RAM to store a hash map of file
pointers to values and a log-structured file system for efficient writes.  In
this excellent Changelog interview, some folks from Basho describe Bitcask in
more detail.The essential Bitcask:Keys are stored in memory for fast lookups.
All keys must fit in RAM.Writes are append-only, which means writes are
strictly sequential and do not require seeking. Writes are write-through.
Every time a value is updated the data file on disk is appended and the in-
memory key index is updated with the file pointer.Read queries are satisfied
with O(1) random disk seeks. Latency is very predictable if all keys fit in
memory because there's no random seeking around through a file.For reads, the
file system cache in the kernel is used instead of writing a complicated
caching sche</p><p>5 0.67899978 <a title="104-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-09-13-Must_see%3A_5_Steps_to_Scaling_MongoDB_%28Or_Any_DB%29_in_8_Minutes.html">1114 high scalability-2011-09-13-Must see: 5 Steps to Scaling MongoDB (Or Any DB) in 8 Minutes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: SmugMug's CEO & Chief Geek Don MacAskill smugly (hard to resist) gushes over
finally finding, after a long and arduous quest, their "best bang-for-the-buck
storage array." It's theDell MD300. His in-depth explanation of why he prefers
the MD3000 should help anyone with their own painful storage deliberations.
His key points are:breakThe price is right; DAS via SAS, 15 spindles at 15K
rpm each, 512MB of mirrored battery-backed write cache; You can disable read
caching; You can disable read-ahead prefetching; The stripe sizes are
configurable up to 512KB; The controller ignores host-based flush commands by
default; They support an ‘Enhanced JBOD’ mode.His reasoning for the
desirability each option is astute and he even gives you the configuration
options for carrying out the configuration. This is not your average CEO.Don
also speculates that a three tier system using flash (system RAM + flash
storage + RAID disks) is a possible future direction. Unfortunately, flash may
not be the dream</p><p>2 0.85012436 <a title="104-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-20-PaxosLease%3A_Diskless_Paxos_for_Leases.html">710 high scalability-2009-09-20-PaxosLease: Diskless Paxos for Leases</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In my lastpost, I outlined considerations that need to be taken into account
when choosing between a centralized and federated security model. So, how do
we implement the chosen model?Based on a real-world case study, I will outline
a Kerberos architecture that enables cutting-edge collaborative research
through federated sharing of resources.Read more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>5 0.71395606 <a title="104-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-10-Paper%3A_Consensus_Protocols%3A_Paxos___.html">529 high scalability-2009-03-10-Paper: Consensus Protocols: Paxos   </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update: Barbara Liskov's Turing Award, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance.Henry
Robinson has created an excellent series of articles on consensus protocols.
We already covered his2 Phase Commitarticle and he also has a3 Phase
Commitarticle showing how to handle 2PC under single node failures.But that is
not enough! 3PC works well under node failures, but fails for network
failures. So another consensus mechanism is needed that handles both network
and node failures. And that'sPaxos.Paxos correctly handles both types of
failures, but it does this by becoming inaccessible if too many components
fail. This is the "liveness" property of protocols. Paxos waits until the
faults are fixed. Read queries can be handled, but updates will be blocked
until the protocol thinks it can make forward progress.The liveness of Paxos
is primarily dependent on network stability. In a distributed heterogeneous
environment you are at risk of losing the ability to make updates. Users hate
that.breakSo when compani</p><p>6 0.64135963 <a title="104-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-15-Does_Sun_Buying_MySQL_Change_Your_Scaling_Strategy%3F.html">213 high scalability-2008-01-15-Does Sun Buying MySQL Change Your Scaling Strategy?</a></p>

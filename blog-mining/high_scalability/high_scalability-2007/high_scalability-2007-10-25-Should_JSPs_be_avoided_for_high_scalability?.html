proprietary open source applications for content creation.* 4,500-processor
render farm in the datacenter. Workstations are used off hours.* Developed
their own proprietary scheduler to schedule their 5,500 available processors.*
Render nodes, the blade racks (from Verari), run dual-core dual Opteron chips
with 32GB of memory on board, but are expanding those to quad-core. Are an AMD

10-20TB of new data on a render. A project will use up to a hundred-plus
terabytes of storage.* Incremental backups are a challenge because the data
changes up to 50 percent over a week.* NetApps used for storage. They like the

<p>Introduction: Small Imrovements, makers of a hosted, lightweight feedback platform, have
written an excellent article on Performance issues on GAE, and how we resolved
them. They show how they trimmed most of their requests to between 300ms and
800ms, some still take 2 seconds when memcache is stale, and others clock in
at 150ms. Notzippy overall, but acceptable, especially if you really like
GAE's PaaS promise.What's tricky with PaaS is if your performance is poor,
there's often not a lot you can do about it. But the folks at Small
Improvements have been clever and diligent, giving many specific details and
timings. Though their advice is specifically for GAE, it will apply to a lot
of different situations as well.Here are the 15 ways they made small
performance improvements: Understand App Engine has bad days. App Engine can
have bad days where performance can degrade. Your design needs to take this
potential for high latency variability into account. Don't always assume the
best case.Always prefe</p><p>6 0.061860375 <a title="131-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-16-Google%2B_Infrastructure_Update_-_the_JavaScript_Story.html">1143 high scalability-2011-11-16-Google+ Infrastructure Update - the JavaScript Story</a></p>

<p>Introduction: John McCutchan,after a long career spent working on the Linux kernel and being
hired out as a code optimization guru, joined Google's Dart team. A curious
hire until you watch Bringing SIMD to the Web via Dart, where John makes a
programmer accessible explanation of why he likes Dart: performance,
performance, performance.Dartis an open-source Web programming
languagedeveloped by Google. The motivation for Dart is twofold: provide a
language capable of scaling up to the complex web applications that are
becoming the norm. Think Gmail. And provide a single language capable of
working on both the client and server. Towards those ends Dart is a complete
language, full tool environment, and provides an advanced Web UI framework for
building web applications at a high level of abstraction.Why isn't JavaScript
good enough? The fear is for large web apps the nature of JavaScript puts
crippling limits on potential performance improvements, which will cause web
apps to lose out to mobile apps.</p><p>3 0.63073766 <a title="131-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-04-New_Book%3A_Even_Faster_Web_Sites%3A_Performance_Best_Practices_for_Web_Developers.html">617 high scalability-2009-06-04-New Book: Even Faster Web Sites: Performance Best Practices for Web Developers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pre-generating static files is an oldy but a goody, and as Thomas Brox RĂ¸st
says, it's probably an underused strategy today. At one time this was the
dominate technique for structuring a web site. Then the age of dynamic web
sites arrived and we spent all our time worrying how to make the database
faster and add more caching to recover the speed we had lost in the transition
from static to dynamic.Static files have the advantage of being very fast to
serve. Read from disk and display. Simple and fast. Especially when caching
proxies are used. The issue is how do you bulk generate the initial files, how
do you serve the files, and how do you keep the changed files up to date? This
is the process Thomas covers in his excellent articleServing static files with
Django and AWS - going fast on a budget", where he explains how he converted
600K thousand previously dynamic pages to static pages for his
siteEventseer.net, a service for tracking academic events.Eventseer.net was

<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading
retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent
applications. Furthermore, over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are
more likely to make a purchase after "liking" a brand they find online.
(source)Sears Architect Tomer Gabel provides an insightful overview on how
they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex
relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:the architectural
considerations behind their solutionwhy they chose memory over diskhow they
partitioned the data to gain scalabilitywhy they chose to execute code with
the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution frameworkhow they integrated
with Facebookwhy they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-
memory caching and scaleIn this post I tried to summarize the main takeaway
from the interview.You can also watch the full interview (highly

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency
transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL
architecture."Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores
overview:Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for
NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture,
transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past
work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or
clock synchronization for this coordination.This paper presents a novel
protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top
of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves
scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that
hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by
serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could
potentially yield a violation of ACI</p><p>6 0.71068919 <a title="131-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Book%3A_High_Performance_MySQL.html">16 high scalability-2007-07-16-Book: High Performance MySQL</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi we are looking at sharding our existing Java/Oracle based application. We
are looking to make the app servers able to process requests for multiple
(any?) shard. The concern that has come up is the amount of memory that would
be consumed by having so many connection pools on one app server. Additionally
there is concern about having so many physical connections to the database
server coming from all the various app servers that may talk to that
particular shard. I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this issue and
how you resolved it?Thanks,Scott</p><p>3 0.65752017 <a title="177-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-12-P2P_server_technology%3F.html">598 high scalability-2009-05-12-P2P server technology?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Is there any type of server technology that allows visitors to a website to
become part of the server? Like with bittorrent, users share some of their
bandwidth, so would this be possible with web servers where a person goes to a
website, downloads and runs the software which makes their internet connection
and cpu and hdd become part of the web server?</p><p>4 0.63665843 <a title="177-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Try_Squid_as_a_Reverse_Proxy.html">59 high scalability-2007-08-04-Try Squid as a Reverse Proxy</a></p>

recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget
with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid
expiration headers) is employ areverse proxyas mentioned in this article.In
the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a
single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a
single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max
server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.It's trivial to implement for

am compelled to do so? The question is not only when but also what. Should I
plan to implement a true caching layer on top of my application or do I need
to shard my database. Do I need to move to a distributed search infrastructure
and if yes when ! Essentially we try to find out the functionalities of the

Any advice?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just released a social section to our iOS app several days ago and we are
already facing scaling issues with the users' news feeds.We're basically using
a Fan-out-on-write (push) model for the users' news feeds (posts of people and
topics they follow) and we're using Redis for this (backend is Rails on
Heroku).  However, our current 60,000 news feeds is ballooning our Redis store
to almost 1GB in a just a few days (it's growing way too fast for our budget).
Currently we're storing the entire news feed for the user (post id, post text,
author, icon url, etc) and we cap the entries to 300 per feed.I'm wondering if
we need to just store the post IDs of each user feed in Redis and then store
the rest of the post information somewhere else?  Would love some feedback
here.  In this case, our iOS app would make an api call to our Rails app to
retrieve a user's news feed.  Rails app would retrieve news feed list (just

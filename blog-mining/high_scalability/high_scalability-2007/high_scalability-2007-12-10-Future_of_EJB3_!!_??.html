<p>Introduction: on Wiki someone posted"...For relatively small installations, pub/sub provides
the opportunity for better scalability than traditional client-server, through
parallel operation, message caching, tree-based or network-based routing,
etc.However, as systems scale up to become datacenters with thousands of
servers sharing the pub/sub infrastructure, this benefit is often lost; in
fact, scalability for pub/sub products under high load in large deployments is
very much a research challenge."Does anyone have something to say regarding
scaling Publish/subscribe models?</p><p>5 0.097771525 <a title="179-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-05-Product%3A_HAProxy_-_The_Reliable%2C_High_Performance_TCP-HTTP_Load_Balancer.html">509 high scalability-2009-02-05-Product: HAProxy - The Reliable, High Performance TCP-HTTP Load Balancer</a></p>

Supporting tens of thousands of connections is clearly realistic with todays
hardware. Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing
architectures very easy and riskless, while still offering the possibility not
to expose fragile web servers to the Net.Currently, two major versions are

<p>Introduction: Hi gurus, I'm totally new to this high scalability thing. I'm trying to create
a website with scalability in mind (personal project). In my application I'll
have forums for different groups of people (each group will have their own
forums, members of groups can still post in other groups' forums but each
group will mainly be using their forums most of the time). Now, I'm going to
start with about 2000 groups with the potential of reaching up to 10000 groups
(this is the maximum due to the nature of my application). I was thinking that
having all posts in one table will be way too much for one table (esp. that
some groups are expected to post hundreds or even thousands times per day,
let's say about 500 of the groups, the rest of the groups won't be that active
though) as I'll have to index the PostID, ParentPostID, GroupID and PostDate
which can produce large indexes (consequentially causing slow inserts) if
having everything in one table. So, I'm thinking of a way to divide the posts</p><p>5 0.55206233 <a title="179-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-10-A_Perfect_Fifth_of_Notes_on_Scalability.html">1172 high scalability-2012-01-10-A Perfect Fifth of Notes on Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremiah Peschka with a great a set ofNotes on Scalability, just in case you
do reach your wildest expectations of success:Build it to Break. Plan for the
fact that everything you make is going to break. Design in layers that are
independent and redundant.Everything is a Feature. Your application is a set
of features created by a series of conscious choices made by considering
trade-offs. Scale Out, Not Up. Purchasing more hardware is easier than coding
and managing horizontal resources. Buy More Storage. Large numbers of smaller,
faster drives have more IOPS than fewer, larger drives.You're Going to Do It
Wrong. Be prepared to iterate on your ideas. You will make mistakes.  Be
prepared to re-write code and to quickly move on to the next idea.Please read

<p>Introduction: The story of driving thegolden spiketo symbolize the completion of
thetranscontinental railroad is famous in the US. What is not so well known is
the story of how it also foreshadowed changes to come as an early version of
both the Internet and the Internet of Things. But that was 1869, how can that
possibly be?Telegraph as InternetFirst, let's establish the telegraph and
cable systems was an early version of an Internet.As railroad tracks were
being laid atranscontental telegraphsystem was also being constructed.
Telegraph lines were installed parallel to the tracks making instant
communication available across the continent, faster than any horse could
ride.With the transalantic cable system information could quickly span
continents in minutes:The miles of American telegraph grew from 40 in 1846 to
12,000 in 1850 to 23,000 in 1852. In Europe it increased from 2,000 in 1849 to
110,000 in 1869. The cost of sending 10 words was $1.55 in 1850, $1 in 1870,

<p>Introduction: Update:New Gearman Server & Library in C, MySQL UDFs.Gearmanis an open
sourcemessage queuingsystem that makes it easy to do distributed job
processing using multiple languages. With Gearman you:farm out work to other
machines, dispatching function calls to machines that are better suited to do
work, to do work in parallel, to load balance lots of function calls, to call
functions between languages, spread CPU usage around your network.Gearman is
used by companies like LiveJournal, Yahoo!, and Digg. Digg, for example, runs
300,000 jobs a day through Gearman without any issues. Most large sites use
something similar. Why would anyone ever even need a message queuing
system?breakMessage queuing is a handy way to move work off your web servers
(like image manipulation), to generate thousands of documents in the
background, to run the multiple requests in parallel needed to build a web
page, or to perform tasks that can comfortably be run in the background and
not part of the main request l</p><p>4 0.34300321 <a title="179-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-28-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_March_28th%2C_2014.html">1621 high scalability-2014-03-28-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For March 28th, 2014</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Authored by Chris Fregly:  Former Netflix Streaming Platform Engineer, AWS
Certified Solution Architect and Purveyor of fluxcapacitor.com.Ahead of the
upcoming 2nd annual re:Invent conference, inspired by Simone Brunozzi's
recentpresentationat an AWS Meetup in San Francisco, and collected from a few
of my recentFluxcapacitor.com consulting engagements, I've compiled a list of
10 useful time and clock-tick saving tips about AWS.1) Query AWS resource
metadata Can't remember the EBS-Optimized IO throughput of your c1.xlarge
cluster?  How about the size limit of an S3 object on a single PUT?
awsnow.infois the answer to all of your AWS-resource metadata questions.
Interested in integrating awsnow.info with your application?  You're in luck.
There's now aREST API, as well!Note:  These are default soft limits and will
vary by account.2) Tame your S3 buckets Delete an entire S3 bucket with a
single CLI command:  aws s3 rb s3://\--forceRecursively copy a
local directory to S3:aws</p><p>6 0.29461789 <a title="179-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-21-9_Principles_of_High_Performance_Programs.html">1652 high scalability-2014-05-21-9 Principles of High Performance Programs</a></p>

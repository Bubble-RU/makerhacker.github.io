<p>Introduction: Amazon has announced the limited beta of Amazon SimpleDB - a simple web
services interface to create and store multiple data sets, query your data
easily, and return the results. Together with the Simple Storage Service (S3),
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and other web services Amazon offers a complete
utility computing platform. SimpleDB was the missing piece of AWS - the
scalable structured database.Check out my blog entry:

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory
Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players
can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a
game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are
complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before
a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new
players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.Let's take a short trip
down web architecture lane:It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl
scripts and a SQL databaseIt's 1995: Scale-up the database.It's 1998: LAMPIt's
1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SANIt's 2001: In-memory data-

<p>Introduction: With so many database options available these days, like for the rest of life,
it's natural to wonder how it allfits together. Amazon complicated, or rather
expanded the available options by introducing RDS, theirrelational database
service. RDS is MySQL safely cocooned as a manageable cloud element, resting
boldly within an energy providing elasticCPU pool, supported by a
virtuallyinfinite supplyof verycapable virtualized storage.MySQL in AWS isnow
easyto start, stop, monitor, backup, snapshot, expand, and effortlessly move
up and down the instance hierarchy. What it's not, contrary to what you might
expect, is a scale-out solution, it's a scale-up solution. You get more by
buying a bigger instance, not by horizontally adding more instances. There's
alimit. Admittedly a larger limit now with Amazon's newhigh memory
instances.That's OK, well maybe not for people who helped grow Amazon's
ecosystem by offering a similar product, but so many projects use MySQL that

<p>Introduction: In an audacious move for such an established property, Netflix is moving their
website out of the comfort of their own datacenter and into the wilds of the
Amazon cloud. This paper by Netflix's Siddharth "Sid" Anand,Netflix's
Transition to High-Availability Storage Systems, gives a detailed look at this
transition and does a deep dive on SimpleDB best practices, focussing
especially on techniques useful to those who are making the move from a
RDBMS.Sid is going to give a talk at QCon based on this paper and he would
appreciate your feedback. So if you have any comments or thoughts please
comment here or email Sid atr39132@hotmail.com or Twitter at @r39132 Here's
the introduction from the paper:Circa late 2008, Netflix had a single data
center. This single data center raised a few concerns. As a single-point-of-

<p>Introduction: Someone is killing the Internet. Since you probably use the Internet everyday
you might find this surprising. It almost sounds silly, and the reason is
technical, but our crack team of networking experts has examined the patient
and made the diagnosis. What did they find?Diagnostic team: the Packet Pushers
gang (Greg Ferro,Jan Zorz,Ivan Pepelnjak) in the podcast How We Are Killing
the Internet.Diagnosis: invasive tunnelation. (tubes anyone?)Prognosis: even
Dr. House might not be able to help.Cure: go back to what the Internet was;
kill the tunnels; route IPv4 and IPv6; have public addresses on everything;
disrupt the telcos.This is a classic story in a strange setting--the network--
but the themes are universal: centralization vs. decentralization (that's
where the telcos obviously come in), good vs. evil, order vs. disorder,
tyranny vs. freedom, change vs. stasis, simplicity vs. complexity. And it's
all being carried out on battlefield few get to see: the infrastructure of
Internet.Ou</p><p>2 0.96714908 <a title="187-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Paper%3A_Dynamo%3A_Amazon%E2%80%99s_Highly_Available_Key-value_Store.html">139 high scalability-2007-10-30-Paper: Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Read/WriteWeb has a good article talking about the scalability
issues of relational databases and how Dynamo solves them:Amazon Dynamo: The
Next Generation Of Virtual Distributed Storage. But since Dynamo is just
another frustrating walled garden protected by barbed wire and guard dogs, its
relevance is somewhat overstated.Update:Greg Lindenhas a take on the paper
where he questions some of Amazon's design choices: emphasizing write
availability over fast reads, a lack of indexing support, use of random
distribution for load balancing, and punting on some scalability issues.Werner
Vogels, Amazon's avuncular CTO, just announced a newpaperon the internal
database technology Amazon uses to handle tens of millions customers. I'll
dive into more details later, but I thought you'd want to read it hot off the
blog. The bad news is it won't be a service. They are keeping this tech not so
secret, but very safe. Happily, it's another real-life example to learn from.

<p>Introduction: It's HighScalability Time:@davilagrau: Youtube, GitHub,..., Are cloud services
facing a entropic limit to scalability?Async all the way down? The Tyranny of
the Clock: The cost of logic and memory dominated Turing's thinking, but
today, communication rather than logic should dominate our thinking. Clock-
free design uses less than half, about 40%, as much energy per addition as its
clocked counterpart. We can regain the efficiency of local decision making by
revolting against the pervasive beat of an external clock. Why Google Compute
Engine for OpenStack. Smart move. Having OpenStack work inside a super charged
cloud, in private clouds, and as a bridge between the two ought to be quite
attractive to developers looking for some sort of ally for independence. All
it will take are a few victories to cement new alliances.3 Lessons That
Startups Can Learn From Facebook's Failed Credits Experiment. I thought this

<p>Introduction: We will be developing an RIA that will have a lot of database access. Think
something like a QuickBooks but with about 50 transactions entered per hour
per user. Users will be in the system for 7 to 9 hours a day and there will be
around 20,000 users, all logged in at the same time.Reporting will be done
just like a QuickBooks style app plus a lot of extra things you don't do in
QuickBooks.Our operations is familiar with W2003 Server and MS SQL Server so
they are recommending we stick with that. I originally requested Linux and
PostgreSQL.How far can a single database server get me? If we have a 4
processor, 8 core, 128gb server, how far am I going to get before I need to
shard or do something else? I know there are a lot of factors involved but in
general for this size of a site, what should the strategy be?I've read almost
all articles on this website but most of the applications are not RIA type of
apps with this type of usage or they are architectures for sites with millions
of use</p><p>same-blog 5 0.95685124 <a title="187-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-14-The_Current_Pros_and_Cons_List_for_SimpleDB.html">187 high scalability-2007-12-14-The Current Pros and Cons List for SimpleDB</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Not surprisingly opinions onSimpleDBvary from it sucks, don't take my
database, to it will change the world, who needs a database anyway? From
aquick survey of the blogosphere, here's where SimpleDB stands at the
moment:SimpleDB ConsNo SLA. We don't know how reliable it will be, how fast it
will be, or how consistent the performance will be.Consistency constraints are
relaxed. Reading data immediately after a write may not reflect the latest
updates. To programmers used to transactions, this may be surprising, but many
people think this is one of the tradeoffs that needs to be made to
scale.Database is a core competency. If you don't control your database you
can't out compete your competition.When your database is out of your control
you can't guarantee it will work properly. You can't create the proper indexes
and other optimizations.No join or IN operator. You'll need to do multiple
client side calls to simulate joins, which will be slow.No stored procedures,
referential integrity,</p><p>6 0.94625717 <a title="187-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-21-SQL_%2B_NoSQL_%3D_Yes_%21.html">961 high scalability-2010-12-21-SQL + NoSQL = Yes !</a></p>

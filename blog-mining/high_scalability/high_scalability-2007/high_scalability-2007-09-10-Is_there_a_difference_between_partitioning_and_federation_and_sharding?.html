<p>Introduction: Update 4:   Why you don’t want to shard.  by Morgon on the MySQL Performance Blog.  Optimize everything else first, and then if performance still isn’t good enough, it’s time to take a very bitter medicine.    Update 3:   Building Scalable Databases: Pros and Cons of Various Database Sharding Schemes  by Dare Obasanjo. Excellent discussion of why and when you would choose a sharding architecture, how to shard, and problems with sharding.  Update 2:   Mr. Moore gets to punt on sharding  by Alan Rimm-Kaufman of 37signals. Insightful article on design tradeoffs and the evils of premature optimization. With more memory, more CPU, and new tech like SSD,  problems can be avoided before more exotic architectures like sharding are needed.  Add features not infrastructure.  Jeremy Zawodny  says he's wrong wrong wrong. we're running multi-core CPUs at slower clock speeds. Moore won't save you.

<p>Introduction: Update:   Good Vibrations  by Radovan Semančík. Lot's of interesting questions about how Wave works, scalability, security, RESTyness, and so on.   Google Wave  is a new communication and collaboration platform based on hosted XML documents (called waves) supporting concurrent modifications and low-latency updates. This platform enables people to communicate and work together in new, convenient and effective ways. We will offer these benefits to users of  Google Wave  and we also want to share them with everyone else by making waves an open platform that everybody can share. We welcome others to run wave servers and become wave providers, for themselves or as services for their users, and to "federate" waves, that is, to share waves with each other and with Google Wave. In this way users from different wave providers can communicate and collaborate using shared waves. We are introducing the Google Wave Federation Protocol for federating waves between wave providers on the Internet.

<p>Introduction: I've been interested in sharding concepts since first hearing the term "shard" a few years back. My interest had been piqued earlier, the first time I read about Google's original approach to distributed search. It was described as a hashtable-like system in which independent physical machines play the role of the buckets. More recently, I needed the capacity and performance of a Sharded system, but did not find helpful libraries or toolkits which would assist with the configuration for my language of preference these days, which is Python. And, since I had a few weeks on my hands, I decided I would begin the work of creating these tools.       The result of my initial work the Pyshards project, a still-incomplete python and MySQL based horizontal partitioning and sharding toolkit. HighScalability.com readers will already know that horizontal partitioning is a data segmenting pattern in which distinct groups of physical row-based datasets are distributed across multiple partitions.

<p>Introduction: Unlike Theo Schlossnagle, author of   Scalable Internet Architectures  , I am not a stickler for semantics because I have an unswerving faith in the ultimate unknowability of the world as experienced by others. That's why it is Theo who bravely tackles the differences in his informative blog post   Partitioning vs. Federation vs. Sharding  . Royans Tharakan also talks about it on his   blog  .   Is there a difference and does it really matter to all our intrepid scalable website builders?            Generally whatever Theo says is probably close to the truth. Yet, in my mind I think of partitioning as a   basic level category   and federation and sharding as more specific (subordinate) instances of partitioning. And partitioning is a more specific instance of the more more general (superordinate) category divide-and-conquer. Which isn't a useful way to think about the topic at all.     So, let's say federation is like Star Trek.

<p>Introduction: Marton Trencseni has collected a wonderful list of different papers on distributed systems. He's organized them into the following sections: The Google Papers, Distributed Filesystems, Non-relational Distributed Databases, The Lamport Papers, and Implementation Issues. Many old favorites on the list and some that are likely new to you. My new favorite is "Frangipani: A Scalable Distributed File System." How can you not love "Frangipani" as a word?</p><p>3 0.84146464 <a title="89-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-15-Ask_HS%3A_What%27s_Wrong_with_Twitter%2C_Why_Isn%27t_One_Machine_Enough%3F.html">1491 high scalability-2013-07-15-Ask HS: What's Wrong with Twitter, Why Isn't One Machine Enough?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Can anyone convincingly explain why properties sporting traffic statistics that may seem in-line with with the capabilities of a single big-iron machine need so many machines in their architecture?
 
This is a common reaction to architecture profiles on High Scalability: I could do all that on a few machines so they must be doing something really stupid. 
 
Lo and behold this same reaction also occurred to the article  The Architecture Twitter Uses to Deal with 150M Active Users . On Hacker News  papsosouid  voiced what a lot of people may have been thinking:
  

I really question the current trend of creating big, complex, fragile architectures to "be able to scale". These numbers are a great example of why, the entire thing could run on a single server, in a very straight forward setup. When you are creating a cluster for scalability, and it has less CPU, RAM and IO than a single server, what are you gaining? They are only doing 6k writes a second for crying out loud.

<p>Introduction: For a long epoch there was a strategy of scaling up by making ever bigger super computers. I had the pleasure of programming on a few large massively multi-processor machines from SGI and DEC. Beautiful, highly specialized machines that were very expensive. These met the double-tap extinction event of Moore's law and a Google inspired era of commodity machine based clusters and extreme software parallelism. Has the tide turned? Does it now make more sense to use big machines instead of clusters?
 
In  Big-Ass Servers™ and the myths of clusters in bioinformatics , Jerm makes the case that for bionformatics, it's more cost effective to buy a Big-Ass Server instead of using a cluster of machines and a lot of specialized parallel programming techniques. It's a classic scale-up argument that has been made more attractive by the recent development of relatively inexpensive large machines.  SeaMicro  has developed a 512 core machine. Dell has a new  96 core server . Supermicro has  48 core  m</p><p>5 0.82496607 <a title="89-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-06-7_Not_So_Sexy_Tips_for_Saving_Money_On_Amazon.html">1452 high scalability-2013-05-06-7 Not So Sexy Tips for Saving Money On Amazon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Harish Ganesan  CTO of  8KMiles  has a very helpful blog,  Cloud, Big Data and Mobile , where he shows a nice analytical bent which leads to a lot of practical advice and cost saving tips:       
  Use SQS Batch Requests  to reduce the number of requests hitting SQS which saves costs. Sending 10 messages in a single batch request which in the example save $30/month. 
  Use SQS Long Polling  to reduce extra polling requests, cutting down empty receives, which in the example saves ~$600 in empty receive leakage costs. 
  Choose the right search technology choice to save costs in AWS  by matching your activity pattern to the technology. For a small application with constant load or a heavily utilized search tier or seasonal loads Amazon Cloud Search looks like the cost efficient play.  
  Use Amazon CloudFront Price Class to minimize costs  by selecting the right Price Class for your audience to potentially reduce delivery costs by excluding Amazon CloudFront’s more expensive edge locatio</p><p>6 0.81366545 <a title="89-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-07-19-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_July_19%2C_2013.html">1494 high scalability-2013-07-19-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For July 19, 2013</a></p>

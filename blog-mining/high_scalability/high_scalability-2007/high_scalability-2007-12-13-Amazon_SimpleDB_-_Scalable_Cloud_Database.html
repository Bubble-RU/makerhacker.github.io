<p>Introduction: Update 2: Yurii responds with the  Top 10 Reasons to Avoid Document Databases FUD .     Update:  Top 10 Reasons to Avoid the SimpleDB Hype  by Ryan Park provides a well written counter take. Am I really that fawning? If so, doesn't that make me a dear?      All your life you've used a relational database. At the tender age of five you banged out your first SQL query to track your allowance. Your RDBMS allegiance was just assumed, like your politics or religion would have been assumed 100 years ago. They now say--you know them--that relations won't scale and we have to do things differently. New databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are what's different. As a long time RDBMS user what can you expect of SimpleDB? That's what Alex Tolley of MyMeemz.com set out to discover. Like many brave explorers before him, Alex gave a report of his adventures to the Royal Society of the   AWS Meetup  .

<p>Introduction: In an audacious move for such an established property, Netflix is moving their website out of the comfort of their own datacenter and into the wilds of the Amazon cloud. This paper by Netflix's Siddharth “Sid” Anand,  Netflix’s Transition to High-Availability Storage Systems , gives a detailed look at this transition and does a deep dive on SimpleDB best practices, focussing especially on techniques useful to those who are making the move from a RDBMS.
 
Sid is going to give a talk at QCon based on this paper and he would appreciate your feedback. So if you have any comments or thoughts please comment here or email Sid at  r39132@hotmail.com  or Twitter at @r39132 Here's the introduction from the paper:
  Circa late 2008, Netflix had a single data center. This single data center raised a few concerns. As a single-point-of-failure (a.k.a. SPOF), it represented a liability – data center outages meant interruptions to service and negative customer impact.

<p>Introduction: Scalability Perspectives  is a series of posts that highlights the ideas that will shape the next decade of IT architecture. Each post is dedicated to a thought leader of the information age and his vision of the future. Be warned though – the journey into the minds and perspectives of these people requires an open mind.     Werner Vogels    Dr. Werner Vogels is Vice President & Chief Technology Officer at Amazon.com where he is responsible for driving the company’s technology vision, which is to continuously enhance the innovation on behalf of Amazon’s customers at a global scale. Prior to joining Amazon, he worked as a researcher at Cornell University where he was a principal investigator in several research projects that target the scalability and robustness of mission-critical enterprise computing systems. He is regarded as one of the world's top experts on ultra-scalable systems and he uses his weblog to educate the community about issues such as eventual consistency.

<p>Introduction: Simone Brunozzi, technology evangelist for Amazon Web Services in Europe, describes how Soocial.com was fully ported to Amazon web services.         ----------------   This period of the year I decided to dedicate some time to better understand how our customers use AWS, therefore I spent some online time with Stefan Fountain and the nice guys at Soocial.com, a "one address book solution to contact management", and I would like to share with you some details of their IT infrastructure, which now runs 100% on Amazon Web Services!    In the last few months, they've been working hard to cope with tens of thousands of users and to get ready to easily scale to millions. To make this possible, they decided to move ALL their architecture to Amazon Web Services. Despite the fact that they were quite happy with their previous hosting provider, Amazon proved to be the way to go.    -----------------           Read the rest of the article here .</p><p>6 0.70009261 <a title="184-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Build_an_Infinitely_Scalable_Infrastructure_for_%24100_Using_Amazon_Services.html">38 high scalability-2007-07-30-Build an Infinitely Scalable Infrastructure for $100 Using Amazon Services</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Amazon has announced the limited beta of Amazon SimpleDB - a simple web services interface to create and store multiple data sets, query your data easily, and return the results. Together with the Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and other web services Amazon offers a complete utility computing platform. SimpleDB was the missing piece of AWS - the scalable structured database.

<p>Introduction: The 5th annual MySQL Conference & Expo, co-presented by Sun Microsystems, MySQL and O'Reilly Media.   Happening   April 20-23, 2009 in Santa Clara, CA  , at the Santa Clara Convention Center and  Hyatt Regency Santa Clara, brings over 2,000 open source and database enthusiasts together to harness the power of MySQL and celebrate the huge MySQL ecosystem. All around the world, people just like you are innovating with MySQLâ&euro;&rdquo;and MySQL is fueling the innovation engine by releasing new mission critical solutions to help you work smarter. This deeply technical conference brings all of that creativity, energy, and knowledge together in one place for four very full days.      Early registration ends February 16, 2009.      The largest gathering of MySQL developers, users, and DBAs worldwide, the event reflects MySQL's wide-ranging appeal and capabilities.

<p>Introduction: Enterprises want to protect their data.   As the appetite for data volumes grows, storage technology becomes a critical business asset on which business continuity relies.  My recent survey in the medium-size enterprise segment shows the five dominant investment directions at the level of data management architecture: disaster recovery (DR), high availability (HA), backup, data processing performance and migration to more advanced databases.﻿
   
  This suggests that corporations generally have sufficiently structured data collections but are concerned with business continuity and continuous availability of data. What infrastructures can provide these assurances? In this post I want to focus on yet another option, and that is the Real-Time Data Integration model. As an example I am going to discuss Oracle GoldenGate, which permits you to manage the data critical to your business in safety, ensuring business continuity without disruption even if the data is distributed among multiple, h</p><p>6 0.90579981 <a title="184-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-12-28-Zynga_Needs_a_Server-side_Systems_Engineer.html">755 high scalability-2009-12-28-Zynga Needs a Server-side Systems Engineer</a></p>

strong. Using Amazon's platform you can quickly build an infrastructure that

unbounded mass of people to implement and maintain. Yet Amazon doesn't provide
SLAs, so you can you really trust them with your crown jewels? Facebook

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBenjamin Wootton, CTO ofContino, a London based
consultancy specialising in applying DevOps and Continuous Delivery to
software delivery projects. Microservices are a style of software architecture
that involves delivering systems as a set of very small, granular, independent
collaborating services.Though they aren't a particularly new idea,
Microservices seem to have exploded in popularity this year, with articles,
conference tracks, and Twitter streams waxing lyrical about the benefits of
building software systems in this style.This popularity is partly off the back
of trends such as Cloud, DevOps and Continuous Delivery coming together as
enablers for this kind of approach, and partly off the back of great work at
companies such as Netflix who have very visibly applied the pattern to great
effect.Let me say up front that I am a fan of the approach. Microservices
architectures have lots of very real and significant benefits:The services
themselves are very simp</p><p>3 0.88021439 <a title="96-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-30-Paper%3A_Dynamo%3A_Amazon%E2%80%99s_Highly_Available_Key-value_Store.html">139 high scalability-2007-10-30-Paper: Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2: Read/WriteWeb has a good article talking about the scalability
issues of relational databases and how Dynamo solves them:Amazon Dynamo: The
Next Generation Of Virtual Distributed Storage. But since Dynamo is just
another frustrating walled garden protected by barbed wire and guard dogs, its
relevance is somewhat overstated.Update:Greg Lindenhas a take on the paper
where he questions some of Amazon's design choices: emphasizing write
availability over fast reads, a lack of indexing support, use of random
distribution for load balancing, and punting on some scalability issues.Werner
Vogels, Amazon's avuncular CTO, just announced a newpaperon the internal
database technology Amazon uses to handle tens of millions customers. I'll
dive into more details later, but I thought you'd want to read it hot off the
blog. The bad news is it won't be a service. They are keeping this tech not so
secret, but very safe. Happily, it's another real-life example to learn from.

<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do
something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one
Ilya Grigorik, Developer Advocate,Make the Web Fastat Google, and author of a
great new book:High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer
should know about networking and web performance. That's a big topic you might
be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed
pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It's like
a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.In case you are not familiar
with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For
years Ilya has been producing excellent content onhis blog and if yousearch
YouTube you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the
book. Authority established.Reading the book I was struck by what a
complicated beast or little World Wide Web has become. That's clear from just

<p>Introduction: Google has released an epic second edition of their ground breaking The
Datacenter as a Computer book. It's called an introduction, but at 156 pages I
would love to see what the Advanced version would look like!John Fries in aG+
commenthas what I think is a perfect summary of the ultimate sense of the
book:It's funny, when I was at Google I was initially quite intimidated by
interacting with an enormous datacenter, and then I started imagining the
entire datacenter was shrunk down into a small box sitting on my desk, and
realized it was just another machine and the physical size didn't matter
anymoreIt's such a far ranging book that it's impossible to characterize
simply. It covers an amazing diversity of topics, from an introduction to
warehouse-scale computing; workloads and software infrastructure; hardware;
datacenter architecture; energy and power efficiency; cost structures; how to
deal with failures and repairs; and it closes with a discussion of key
challenges, which include ra</p><p>3 0.98015594 <a title="96-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-22-Facebook%27s_New_Realtime_Analytics_System%3A_HBase_to_Process_20_Billion_Events_Per_Day.html">1008 high scalability-2011-03-22-Facebook's New Realtime Analytics System: HBase to Process 20 Billion Events Per Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Facebook did it again. They've built another system capable of doing something
useful with ginormous streams of realtime data. Last time we saw Facebook
release their New Real-Time Messaging System: HBase To Store 135+ Billion
Messages A Month. This time it's a realtime analytics system handlingover 20
billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30
seconds. Alex Himel, Engineering Manager at Facebook, explains what they've
built (video) and the scale required:Social plugins have become an important
and growing source of traffic for millions of websites over the past year. We
released a new version of Insights for Websites last week to give site owners
better analytics on how people interact with their content and to help them
optimize their websites in real time. To accomplish this, we had to engineer a
system that could process over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per
second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds. Alex does an excellent job with

<p>Introduction: Guest post byAsya Kamsky, Principal Solutions Architect at MongoDB.This post
outlines ten things you need to know for operating MongoDB at scale based on
my experience working with MongoDB customers and open source users:MongoDB
requires DevOps, too.MongoDB is a database. Like any other data store, it
requires capacity planning, tuning, monitoring, and maintenance. Just because
it's easy to install and get started and it fits the developer paradigm more
naturally than a relational database, don't assume that MongoDB doesn't need
proper care and feeding. And just because it performs super-fast on a small
sample dataset in development doesn't mean you can get away without having a
good schema and indexing strategy, as well as the right hardware resources in
production! But if you prepare well and understand the best practices,
operating large MongoDB clusters can be boring instead of nerve-
wracking.Successful MongoDB users monitor everything and prepare for
growth.Tracking current capac</p><p>5 0.97932053 <a title="96-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-12-Poppen.de_Architecture.html">808 high scalability-2010-04-12-Poppen.de Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture
forPoppen.de, a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be
careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they
manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new,
using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached,
RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.What is Poppen.de?Poppen.de (NSFW) is
the top dating website in Germany, and while it may be a small site compared
to giants like Flickr or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to
learn from if you are starting to get some scaling problems.The Stats2.000.000

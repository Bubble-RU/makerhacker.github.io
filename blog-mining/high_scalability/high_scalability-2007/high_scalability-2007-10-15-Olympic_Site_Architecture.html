<p>Introduction: We're implementing a website which should be oriented to content and with massive access by public and we would need a search engine to index and execute queries on the indexes of contents (stored in a database, most likely MySQL InnoDB or Oracle).      The solution we found is to implement a separate service to make index constantly the contents of the database at regular intervals. Anyway, this is a complex and not optimal solution, since we would like it to index in real time and make it searchable.     Could you point me to some examples or articles I could review to design a   solution for such this context?</p><p>3 0.10630381 <a title="123-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-14-Newbie_in_scalability_design_issues.html">121 high scalability-2007-10-14-Newbie in scalability design issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have 3 exp in building website using java.I work on only single server.Website is not very scalable.I always wonder how ebay,youtube,monster handle traffic, giving responses within seconds.From the google i find this site and i hope i can also able to build very scalable website .I need guidelines from where to start ,what are the things we needed.I know that scalability comes through the use of distributed applications but don't how to implement it.   I see many website build in languages other than java so java is good choice for building high scalable website.

<p>Introduction: The High Scalable Systems (i.e. Websites) such as: Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. need high scalable storage system that can deal with huge amount of data with high availability and reliability. Building large systems on top of a traditional RDBMS data storage layer is no longer good enough. This presentation explores the landscape of new technologies available today to augment your data layer to improve performance and reliability.

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how to make it work. Dan Rayburn  has a post  pointing to a fascinating paper:  An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming , which talks in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the Internet. For Akamai they found:
  
 Each video is encoded in five versions at different bit rates and stored in separate files. 
 The client sends commands to the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds.  
 Akamai uses only the video level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame rate of the video is kept constant. 
 When a sudden drop in the available bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to the a large actuation delay.

<p>Introduction: An   Amazon EC2 Flash Video Streaming   solution has been announced by Wowza Media. What do you think about the future of similar solutions? Is Amazon EC2 and S3 ready for video streaming?     I have found threads on their forums related to the performance, scalability and high availability of the hosted streaming solution. How would you make it scalable? Is it really cheaper than traditional hosting?

<p>Introduction: Hi High Scalability community!  Do you have any information on the architecture behind  Google Voice , the new service by Google that offers one Google Number for all your calls and SMS? It is based on GrandCentral who has been acquired by Google 2 years ago.  Thanks!</p><p>3 0.64547908 <a title="123-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-16-Reducing_Your_Website%27s_Bandwidth_Usage_-_how_to.html">494 high scalability-2009-01-16-Reducing Your Website's Bandwidth Usage - how to</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In this article Jeff Atwood (a rockstar programmer and one of   StackOverflow   website founders) discusses the measures of how you can reduce you bandwidth usage and refers specifically on high trafficked websites for which bandwidth is more costly than for an average website.          This is his experience and you can read more on his post on  CodingHorror.com .</p><p>4 0.61902046 <a title="123-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-25-Product%3A_Condor__-_Compute_Intensive_Workload_Management.html">326 high scalability-2008-05-25-Product: Condor  - Compute Intensive Workload Management</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From their website:   Condor  is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their serial or parallel jobs to Condor, Condor places them into a queue, chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user upon completion.  While providing functionality similar to that of a more traditional batch queueing system, Condor's novel architecture allows it to succeed in areas where traditional scheduling systems fail. Condor can be used to manage a cluster of dedicated compute nodes (such as a "Beowulf" cluster). In addition, unique mechanisms enable Condor to effectively harness wasted CPU power from otherwise idle desktop workstations. For instance, Condor can be configured to only use desktop machines where the keyboard</p><p>5 0.48095626 <a title="123-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-20-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_May_20%2C_2011.html">1045 high scalability-2011-05-20-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For May 20, 2011</a></p>

  Group Decision Making in Honey Bee Swarms . In distributed computing systems nodes reach a  quorum  when deciding what to do as a group. It turns out bees also use quorum logic when deciding on where to nest! Bees do it a bit differently of course:   A scout bee votes for a site by spending time at it, somehow the scouts act and interact so that their numbers rise faster at superior sites, and somehow the bees at each site monitor their numbers there so that they know whether they've reached the threshold number (quorum) and can proceed to initiating the swarm's move to this site.  Ants use similar mechanisms to control foraging.   Distributed systems may share common mechanisms based on their nature as being a distributed system,  the components may not matter that much.

<p>Introduction: Plenty of Fish CEO Markus Frind, famous nerd hero for making over $10 million
a year from Google ads on a free dating site he made and ran all by himself,
nowsees a problem with the free model:The problem with free is that every time
you double the size of your database the cost of maintaining the site grows 6
fold. I really underestimated how much resources it would take, I have one
database table now that exceeds 3 billion records. The bigger you get as a
free site the less money you make per visit and the more it costs to service a
visit...There is really no money in being free and we have to start
experimenting with other models now or we won't be able to compete in 3 or 4
years.As one commenter succinctly put it: the"golden time" of AdSense is over.
Time to look at costs. The POF architecture is to run scarily huge tables on
single machines. They also buy and maintain their own SAN. So it seems scaling
up is what is increasing costs and decreasing profits. I wonder if the

<p>Introduction: It looks like I'll have the chance to interview someone tomorrow from
Justin.tv about their architecture, which is pretty exciting given their
leadership role in live broadcasting. They get 30 million uniques a month, can
handle 1 million simultaneous broadcasts and hope to grow another magnitude in
the near future. That must take some doing.Here's your opportunity, especially

<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the
DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that
will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains
mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web
server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server,
e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use
reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to
get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been
reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on
how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but
I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.The problem is that I'm
still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some
company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my questio</p><p>5 0.60133237 <a title="67-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-22-Gone_Fishin%27%3A_PlentyOfFish_Architecture.html">1361 high scalability-2012-11-22-Gone Fishin': PlentyOfFish Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Digg has been researching ways to scale our database infrastructure for some
time now. We've adopted a traditional vertically partitioned master-slave
configuration with MySQL, and also investigated sharding MySQL with IDDB.
Ultimately, these solutions left us wanting. In the case of the traditional
architecture, the lack of redundancy on the write masters is painful, and both
approaches have significant management overhead to keep running.Since it was
already necessary to abandon data normalization and consistency to make these
approaches work, we felt comfortable looking at more exotic, non-relational
data stores. After considering HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, Tokyo
Cabinet/Tyrant, Voldemort, and Dynomite, we settled on Cassandra.Each system
has its own strengths and weaknesses, but Cassandra has a good blend of
everything. It offers column-oriented data storage, so you have a bit more
structure than plain key/value stores. It operates in a distributed, highly
available, peer-to-pee</p><p>3 0.86445284 <a title="67-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-16-Seven_Signs_You_May_Need_a_NoSQL_Database.html">779 high scalability-2010-02-16-Seven Signs You May Need a NoSQL Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>4 0.86393201 <a title="67-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_SmarterStats.html">45 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: SmarterStats</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Ehcache  is a pure Java cache with the following features: fast, simple, small foot print, minimal dependencies,  provides memory and disk stores for scalability into gigabytes, scalable to hundreds of caches is a pluggable cache for Hibernate, tuned for high concurrent load on large multi-cpu servers, provides LRU, LFU and FIFO cache eviction policies, and is production tested. Ehcache is used by  LinkedIn  to cache member  profiles. The user guide says it's possible to get at 2.5 times system speedup for persistent Object Relational Caching, a 1000 times system speedup for Web Page Caching, and a 1.6 times system speedup Web Page Fragment Caching. From the website:
   
  Introduction  Ehcache is a cache library. Before getting into ehcache, it is worth stepping back and thinking about caching generally.  About Caches  Wiktionary defines a cache as A store of things that will be required in future, and can be retrieved rapidly . That is the nub of it.  In computer science terms, a cac</p><p>3 0.14274344 <a title="194-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-30-Better_Browser_Caching_is_More_Important_than_No_Javascript_or_Fast_Networks_for_HTTP_Performance.html">1396 high scalability-2013-01-30-Better Browser Caching is More Important than No Javascript or Fast Networks for HTTP Performance</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case. Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on Fotolog in  Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success , which was one of my personal favorites.  Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding performance and scaling requirements. To meet those requirements they've developed a</p><p>5 0.12896161 <a title="194-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-Speed_up_%28Oracle%29_database_code_with_result_caching.html">230 high scalability-2008-01-29-Speed up (Oracle) database code with result caching</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the most interesting new features of Oracle 11 is the new function result caching mechanism.

<p>Introduction: The Gear6 Web Cache hybrid DRAM-flash memory architecture allows for 5-10 times more memcache memory per unit of rack space than DRAM-only configurations, and cuts memory costs by 50%. Other software enhancements include a slab allocator that is more efficient than traditional memcache implementations due to its fine-grained bucket sizing. Gear6 Web Cache also supports object sizes greater than 1 megabyte and manages evictions based on the cost of replacing objects, depending on the size and frequency of object access. It intelligently places cache instances across DRAM and flash, taking into account their different characteristics, while at the same time monitoring their health and detecting and deâ&euro;?allocating faulty or failing memory.  Gear6 Web Cache is a Memcached protocol compliant solution that scales and accelerates web applications, reduces memory footprint, enhances availability and implements comprehensive Memcached management features. Designed to work with all popular memcac</p><p>3 0.74646854 <a title="194-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-01-30-Better_Browser_Caching_is_More_Important_than_No_Javascript_or_Fast_Networks_for_HTTP_Performance.html">1396 high scalability-2013-01-30-Better Browser Caching is More Important than No Javascript or Fast Networks for HTTP Performance</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The SHOP.COM Cache System is now available at http://code.google.com/p/sccache/     The SHOP.COM Cache System is an object cache system that...   * is an in-process cache and external, shared Cache   * is horizontally scalable   * stores cached objects to disk   * supports associative keys   * is non-transactional   * can have any size key and any size data   * does auto-GC based on TTL   * is container and platform neutral     It was built in-house at SHOP.COM (by me) and has powered our website for years. We are open-sourcing it in the hope that it will be useful to others and to get some help in its maintenance.     This is our first open source attempt and we'd appreciate any help and comments.</p><p>5 0.69628364 <a title="194-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_Symfony_a_Web_Framework.html">31 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: Symfony a Web Framework</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TGL  delivers Virtual Private Datacenters and virtual private servers from grids of commodity servers. Each TGL grid consists of a pool of HP servers connected with a Gigabit backbone network and running 3Tera's AppLogic grid operating system.  With a Virtual Private Datacenter, you get complete control of your own private grid. Using our visual interface, you set up and assemble disposable virtual infrastructure, including firewalls, load balancers, web servers, database servers, NAS boxes, etc. visually, by pointing and clicking. You can build advanced clusters, deploy large and small applications, and save them as templates that can be provisioned in minutes. You can even build your own virtual servers and appliances.</p><p>4 0.93560797 <a title="194-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Sun%27s_High-Performance_and_Reliable_Web_Proxy_Solution.html">456 high scalability-2008-12-01-Sun's High-Performance and Reliable Web Proxy Solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core. The Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software is highly threaded and takes advantage of the large number of threads supported by Sun UltraSPARC T1 processors with CoolThreads technology. Together, these products provide a highly scalable solution that</p><p>5 0.93309486 <a title="194-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_AWStats_a_Log_Analyzer.html">30 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: AWStats a Log Analyzer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: AWStats  is a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced web, streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.</p><p>6 0.93294096 <a title="194-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Sun_Utility_Computing.html">46 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Sun Utility Computing</a></p>

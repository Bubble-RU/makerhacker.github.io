<p>Introduction: Counting at scale in a distributed environment is  surprisingly hard . And it's a subject we've covered before in various ways:  Big Data Counting: How to count a billion distinct objects using only 1.5KB of Memory ,  How to update video views count effectively? ,  Numbers Everyone Should Know (sharded counters) .
 
 Kellabyte  (which is an excellent blog) in  Scalable Eventually Consistent Counters  talks about how the Cassandra counter implementation scores well on the scalability and high availability front, but in so doing has "over and under counting problem in partitioned environments."
 
Which is often fine. But if you want more accuracy there's a PN-counter, which is a  CRDT (convergent replicated data type)  where "all the changes made to a counter on each node rather than storing and modifying a single value so that you can merge all the values into the proper final value. Of course the trade-off here is additional storage and processing but there are ways to optimize this."</p><p>3 0.1992406 <a title="15-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-10-Blog%3A_Scalable_Web_Architectures_by_Royans_Tharakan.html">88 high scalability-2007-09-10-Blog: Scalable Web Architectures by Royans Tharakan</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!, maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life environments.

<p>Introduction: I am planning the scaling of a hosted service, similar to typepad etc. and would appreciate feedback on my plan so far.     Looking into scaling storage, I have come accross MogileFS and OpenAFS. My concern with these is I am not at all experienced with them and as the sole tech guy I don't want to build something into this hosting service that  proves complex to update and adminster.     So, I'm thinking of building replication and scalability right into the application, in a similar but simplified way to how MogileFS works (I think).     So, for our database table of uploaded files, here's how it currently looks (simplified):     fileid (pkey)   filename   ownerid     For adding the replication and scalability, I would add a few more columns:     serveroneid   servertwoid   serverthreeid   s3     At the time the user uploads a file, it will go to a specific server (managed by the application) and the id of that server will be placed in the "serverone" column. Then hourly or so, a cro</p><p>3 0.98786277 <a title="15-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-03-Read_This_Site_and_Ace_Your_Next_Interview%21.html">264 high scalability-2008-03-03-Read This Site and Ace Your Next Interview!</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Paul Tyma published a massive and massively good 96 page insider's manual on   How to Pass a Silicon Valley Software Engineering Interview  . My eyes immediately latched on to one of his key example scenarios, which involves scaling Facebook:           Facebook     ● What was Facebook day 1?   – A database with a PHP front-end   ● In PHP, Java, C#, whatever   – How long would it take you to reproduce Facebook's first incarnation?   ● A single MySQL instance with some simple queries probably used to happily query the whole userbase.       Facebook     ● What is it today?   ● Its not about “that stuff you learned in school”   – Its about what a company with thousands of (possibly conflicting) queries per second operating   on a directed-graph with 50 million nodes   ● And of course a few Petabytes of data   ● And 99.99% uptime   ● Design decision? A Facebook user is (or recently was) currently limited to 5000 friends.

<p>Introduction: It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the World.  -- Isaac Newton
 
The practice of IT reminds me a lot of the practice of science before Isaac Newton. Aristotelianism was dead, but there was nothing to replace it. Then Newton came along, created a scientific revolution with his  System of the World . And everything changed. That was New System of the World number one.
 
New System of the World number two was written about by the incomparable Neal Stephenson in his incredible  Baroque Cycle  series. It explores the singular creation of a new way of organizing society grounded in new modes of thought in business, religion, politics, and science. Our modern world emerged Enlightened as it could from this roiling cauldron of forces.
 
In IT we may have had a Leonardo da Vinci or even a Galileo, but we’ve never had our Newton. Maybe we don't need a towering genius to make everything clear? For years startups, like the frenetically inventive</p><p>5 0.98124224 <a title="15-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-07-02-C_is_for_Compute_-_Google_Compute_Engine_%28GCE%29.html">1275 high scalability-2012-07-02-C is for Compute - Google Compute Engine (GCE)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After poking around the   Google Compute Engine    (GCE) documentation I had some trouble creating a mental model of how GCE works. Is it like AWS, GAE, Rackspace, just what is it? After watching    Google I/O 2012 - Introducing Google Compute Engine    and    Google Compute Engine -- Technical Details   , it turns out my initial impression, that GCE is disarmingly straightforward, turns out to be the point.     The focus of GCE is on the C, which stands for Compute, and that’s what GCE is all about: deploying lots of servers to solve computationally hard problems. What you get with GCE is a Super Datacenter on Google Steroids.     If you are wondering how you will run the next Instagram on GCE then that would be missing the point. GAE is targeted at applications. GCE is targeted at:

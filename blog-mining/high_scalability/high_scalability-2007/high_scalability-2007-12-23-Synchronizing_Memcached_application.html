<p>Introduction: We are not yet at the End of History for database theory asPeter Bailisand
theDatabase Groupat UC Berkeley continue to prove with a greatcompanion blog
post to their new paper: Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions. I
like the approach of pairing a blog post with a paper. A paper almost by
definition is formal, but a blog post can help put a paper in context and give
it some heart.From the abstract:Databases can provide scalability by
partitioning data across several servers. However, multi-partition, multi-
operation transactional access is often expensive, employing coordination-
intensive locking, validation, or scheduling mechanisms. Accordingly, many
real-world systems avoid mechanisms that provide useful semantics formulti-
partition operations. This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of
applications including secondary indexing,foreign key enforcement, and
materialized view maintenance. In this work, we identify a new isolation model

<p>Introduction: A user named Apathyon how Reddit scales some of their features, shares some
advice he learned while working at Google and other major companies.To be
fair, I [Apathy] was working at Google at the time, and every job I held
between 1995 and 2005 involved at least one of the largest websites on the
planet. I didn't come up with any of these ideas, just watched other smart
people I worked with who knew what they were doing and found (or wrote) tools
that did the same things. But the theme is always the same:Cache everything
you can and store the rest in some sort of database (not necessarily
relational and not necessarily centralized).Cache everything that doesn't
change rapidly. Most of the time you don't have to hit the database for
anything other than checking whether the users' new message count has
transitioned from 0 to (1 or more).Cache everything--templates, user message
status, the front page components--and hit the database once a minute or so to
update the front page, forums, e</p><p>4 0.083493844 <a title="191-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-08-19-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_August_19%2C_2011.html">1101 high scalability-2011-08-19-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For August 19, 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update:Final Thoughts on SSD and MySQL AKA Battleship Spinn3r. Tips on how to
make your database 10x faster using solid state drives. Potential exists for
100x speedup.Solid-state drives(SSDs) are the holy grail of storage. The
promise of RAM speeds and hard disk like persistence have for years driven us
crazy with power user lust, but they've stayed tantalizingly just out of
reach. Always too expensive, too small, and oddly too slow. Has that changed?
Can you now miraculously have your cake and eat it too? Can you now have it
both ways? Is balancing work with family life now as easy as tripping over a
terabyte drive?In a pioneering series of blog articles Kevin Burton conducts
original research on next generation SSD drives in real world configurations.

<p>Introduction: Dormandoshows an enlightened middle wayfor storing sessions in cache and the
database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient,
smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing
all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out
session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache
and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or
needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry
users.The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the
database:Reads: read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache
logic.Writes: write to memcached every time, write to the database every N
seconds (assuming the data has changed).There's a small chance of data loss,
but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing
reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>3 0.70760751 <a title="191-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy%3A_Break_Up_the_Memcache_Dog_Pile_.html">673 high scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy: Break Up the Memcache Dog Pile </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:AsynchronousHTTP cache validations. A proposed HTTP caching
extension:if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content,
then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served
directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-
experience.Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin.
Slow site: add caching.Facebookmust have a lot of headaches because they
popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL
servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way
for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich
topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called theDog
PileEffectinDog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails. Glenn
Franxman also has a Django solution inMintCache.Data is usually cached because
it's too expensive to calculate for every hit. Maybe it's a gnarly SQL query

<p>Introduction: The Gear6 Web Cache hybrid DRAM-flash memory architecture allows for 5-10
times more memcache memory per unit of rack space than DRAM-only
configurations, and cuts memory costs by 50%. Other software enhancements
include a slab allocator that is more efficient than traditional memcache
implementations due to its fine-grained bucket sizing. Gear6 Web Cache also
supports object sizes greater than 1 megabyte and manages evictions based on
the cost of replacing objects, depending on the size and frequency of object
access. It intelligently places cache instances across DRAM and flash, taking
into account their different characteristics, while at the same time
monitoring their health and detecting and deâ&euro;?allocating faulty or failing
memory.Gear6 Web Cache is a Memcached protocol compliant solution that scales
and accelerates web applications, reduces memory footprint, enhances
availability and implements comprehensive Memcached management features.

<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:My
recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget
with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid
expiration headers) is employ areverse proxyas mentioned in this article.In
the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a
single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a
single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max
server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.It's trivial to implement for
anyone interested...</p><p>2 0.91375124 <a title="191-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome_List_of_Advanced_Distributed_Systems_Papers.html">1049 high scalability-2011-05-31-Awesome List of Advanced Distributed Systems Papers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have an application with couple of web servers that uses MemcacheD. How can
i synchronize concurrent put to the cache? The value of the entry is
list.Atomic append operation could have been helpful, but unfortunately
memcahe doesn't support atomic append.</p><p>4 0.8394444 <a title="191-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-06-Product%3A_ChironFS.html">143 high scalability-2007-11-06-Product: ChironFS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across
data centers, then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so
there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What
isChironFSand how does it work?Adapted from the ChironFS website:The Chiron
Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of
failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using
replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not
FILESYSTEMS.Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it
is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other
server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many
servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become
a real nightmare!</p><p>5 0.82579577 <a title="191-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-03-100_Node_Hazelcast_cluster_on_Amazon_EC2.html">820 high scalability-2010-05-03-100 Node Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Deploying, running and monitoring application on a big cluster is a
challenging task. RecentlyHazelcastteam deployed a demo application on Amazon
EC2 platform to show how Hazelcast p2p cluster scales and screen recorded the
entire process from deployment to monitoring.Hazelcast is open source (Apache
License), transactional, distributed caching solution for Java. It is a little
more than a cache though as it provides distributed implementation of map,
multimap, queue, topic, lock and executor service. Details of running 100 node
Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2 can befound here. Make sure towatch the
screencast!</p><p>6 0.79666448 <a title="191-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-27-Product%3A_Sequoia_Database_Clustering_Technology.html">102 high scalability-2007-09-27-Product: Sequoia Database Clustering Technology</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you have a lot of static content to store and you aren't looking forward to setting up and maintaining your own giganto SAN,  maybe you can push off a lot of the hard lifting to a CDN?     Jesse Robbins at O'Reilly Radar posts that you have a lot more options now because the number of   Content Distribution Networks have doubled since last year  . In fact, Dan Rayburn says there are now   28 CDN   providers in the market. Hopefully you can find reasonable pricing at one of them.      Other than easing your burden, why might a CDN work for you? Because it makes your site faster and customers like that. How can a CDN so dramatically improve your site's performance?           Steve Saunders, author of   High Performance Web Sites: Essential Knowledge for Front-End Engineers  , has using a CDN has one of his "Thirteen Simple Rules for Speeding Up Your Web Site."      About CDNs Steve says:     Remember that 80-90% of the end-user response time is spent downloading all the components in</p><p>3 0.082378827 <a title="130-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-08-file_synchronization_solutions.html">488 high scalability-2009-01-08-file synchronization solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have two servers connected via Internet (NOT IN THE SAME LAN) serving the same website (http://www.ourexample.com).The problem is files uploaded on serverA and serverB cannot see each other immediately,thus rsync with certain intervals is not a good solution.   Can anybody give me some advice on the following options?     1.NFS over Internet for file sharing   2.sshfs   3.inotify(our system's kernel does not support this and we donot want to risk upgrading our kernel as well)    4.drbd in active-active mode   5 or any other solutions     Any suggestions will be welcomed.   Thank you in advance.</p><p>4 0.072273746 <a title="130-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Flickr.html">41 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Flickr</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Update 3: InfoQ's  Big Architecture Up Front - A Case of Premature Scalaculation?  twines several different threads on the topic together into a fine noose.     Update 2: Kevin says the  biggest problems he sees with startups is they need to scale  their backend (no, the other one).     Update: My bad.  It's hard to sell scalability  so just forget it.       The premise of   Startups and The Problem Of Premature Scalaculation   and   Don√¢&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Mart   is that you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its best chance of survival.

<p>Introduction: Gordon Ramsay  is a world renowned chef with a surprising amount to say on software development. Well, he says it about cooking and running a restaurant, but it applies to software development too.
 
You may have seen Gordon Ramsay on one of his many TV shows.¬†Hell's Kitchen is a competition between chefs trying to win a dream job: head chef of their own high-end restaurant. On this show Ramsay is judge, jury, and executioner. And he chops off more than a few heads. Kitchen Nightmares is a show where Ramsay is called in by restaurant owners to help turn around their failing restaurants. On this show Ramsay is there to help.
 
If you just watch Hell's Kitchen you will likely conclude Ramsay is one of the devil's own helpers ("ram" is the symbol of the devil and "say" means he speaks for the devil: Ramsay). Ramsay screams, yells, cusses, belittles, and throws tantrums even a 7 year old could learn from. Then he does it all over gain just for spite. In Hell's Kitchen there's no evidence a</p><p>5 0.68855488 <a title="130-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-11-How_Flickr_Handles_Moving_You_to_Another_Shard.html">120 high scalability-2007-10-11-How Flickr Handles Moving You to Another Shard</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Colin Charles  has cool picture showing  Flickr's message telling  him they'll need about 15 minutes to move his 11,500 images to another shard. One, that's a lot of pictures! Two, it just goes to show you don't have to make this stuff complicated. Sure, it might be nice if their infrastructure could auto-balance shards with no down time and no loss of performance, but do you really need to go to all the extra complexity? The manual system works and though Colin would probably like his service to have been up, I am sure his day will still be a pleasant one.</p><p>6 0.68845028 <a title="130-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-07-Five_Ways_to_Stop_Framework_Fixation_from_Crashing_Your_Scaling_Strategy.html">347 high scalability-2008-07-07-Five Ways to Stop Framework Fixation from Crashing Your Scaling Strategy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Jesse Robbins at O'Reily Radar has a nice  post on how spending  a little up front time on figuring out how to scale your operations process saves money on ops people and allows you to save time adding and upgrading servers. Adding, monitoring, and upgrading servers can get so incredibly screwed up that a herd of squirrels has to work overtime just to put out  a release. Or it can be one button simple from your automated build system out to your servers. This is one area where "do the simplest thing that could possibly work" is a dumb idea and Jesse does a good job capturing the advantages of doing it right.</p><p>2 0.56579888 <a title="130-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-27-Windows_and_SQL_Server_%3A_Receive_so_much_negativity_in_terms_of_the_Highly_Available%2C_Scalable_Platform...html">225 high scalability-2008-01-27-Windows and SQL Server : Receive so much negativity in terms of the Highly Available, Scalable Platform..</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I remain neutral, but time and again, when people talk Windows or SQL Server, they seem to consider them unreliable with limits around scalability, performance and availability.     And then you start looking at some of the big boys you have listed here in the architectural section and most of them are on Linux, MySQL,Oracle platforms that we dont see Windows and SQL Server in there..

<p>Introduction: Update 3: InfoQ's  Big Architecture Up Front - A Case of Premature Scalaculation?  twines several different threads on the topic together into a fine noose.     Update 2: Kevin says the  biggest problems he sees with startups is they need to scale  their backend (no, the other one).     Update: My bad.  It's hard to sell scalability  so just forget it.       The premise of   Startups and The Problem Of Premature Scalaculation   and   Don√¢&euro;&trade;t scale: 99.999% uptime is for Wal-Mart   is that you shouldn't spend precious limited resources worrying about scaling before you've first implemented the functionality that will make you successful enough to have scaling problems in the first place. It's kind of an embodied life force model of system creation. Energy is scarce so any parasites siphoning off energy must be hunted down and destroyed so the body has its best chance of survival. Is this really how it works?     If I ever believed this I certainly don't believe it anymore.

 Marko Rodriguez in¬† Memoirs of a Graph Addict: Despair to Redemption ¬†tells a¬†stirring¬†tale of how graph programming saved the world from certain destruction by realizing Aritstotle's dream of an¬†eudaimonia-driven society. Could a relational database do that? The tools of the revolution can be found at¬† tinkerprop.com ,¬†which describes a databases agnostic stack for working with property graphs, they include Blueprints - a property graph model interface; Pipes - a dataflow netowork using process grapphs; Gremlin - a graph based programming language; Rexster - a RESTful graph shell.

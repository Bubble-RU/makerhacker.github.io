<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Alberto Lopez Toledo, PHD, CTO of Pixable, and Julio
Viera, VP of Engineering at Pixable.Pixableaggregates photos from across your
different social networks and finds the best ones so you never miss an
important moment. That means currently processing the metadata of more than 20
million new photos per day: crawling, analyzing, ranking, and sorting them
along with the other 5+ billion that are already stored in our database.
Making sense of all that data has challenges, but two in particular rise above
the rest:How to access millions of photos per day from Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, and other services in the most efficient manner.How to process,
organize, index, and store all the meta-data related to those photos.Sure,
Pixable's infrastructure is changing continuously, but there are some things
that we have learned over the last year. As a result, we have been able to
build a scalable infrastructure that takes advantage of today's tools,
languages and cloud s</p><p>3 0.087562062 <a title="71-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-13-Strategy%3A_Facebook_Tweaks_to_Handle_6_Time_as_Many_Memcached_Requests.html">464 high scalability-2008-12-13-Strategy: Facebook Tweaks to Handle 6 Time as Many Memcached Requests</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our latest strategy is taken from agreat post by Paul Saab of Facebook,
detailing how with changes Facebook has made to memcached they have:...been
able to scale memcached to handle 200,000 UDP requests per second with an
average latency of 173 microseconds. The total throughput achieved is 300,000
UDP requests/s, but the latency at that request rate is too high to be useful
in our system. This is an amazing increase from 50,000 UDP requests/s using
the stock version of Linux and memcached.To scale Facebook has hundreds of
thousands of TCP connections open to their memcached processes. First, this is
still amazing. It's not so long ago you could have never done this. Optimizing
connection use was always a priority because the OS simply couldn't handle
large numbers of connections or large numbers of threads or large numbers of
CPUs. To get to this point is a big accomplishment. Still, at that scale there
are problems that are often solved.Some of the problem Facebook faced and
fixed:Pe</p><p>4 0.084964961 <a title="71-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-15-Implementing_large_scale_web_analytics.html">570 high scalability-2009-04-15-Implementing large scale web analytics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Does anyone know of any articles or papers that discuss the nuts and bolts of
how web analytics is implemented at organizations with large volumes of web
traffic and a critcal business need to analyze that data - e.g. places like
Amazon.com, eBay, and Google?Just as a fun project I'm planning to build my
own web log analysis app that can effectively index and query large volumes of
web log data (i.e. TB range). But first I'd like to learn more about how it's
done in the organizations whose lifeblood depends on this stuff. Even just a
high level architectural overview of their approaches would be nice to have.</p><p>5 0.084224023 <a title="71-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-03-14-6_Lessons_from_Dropbox_-_One_Million_Files_Saved_Every_15_minutes.html">1003 high scalability-2011-03-14-6 Lessons from Dropbox - One Million Files Saved Every 15 minutes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dropboxsaves one million files every 15 minutes,  more tweets than even
Twitterers tweet. That mind blowing statistic was revealed by Rian Hunter, a
Dropbox Engineer, in his presentation How Dropbox Did It and How Python Helped
at PyCon 2011.The first part of the presentation is some Dropbox lore, origin
stories and other foundational myths. We learn thatDropbox is a startup
company located in San Francisco that has probably one of the most popular
file synchronization and sharing tools in the world, shipping Python on the
desktop and supporting millions of users and growing every day. About half way
through the talk turns technical. Not a lot of info on how Dropbox handles
this massive scale was dropped, but there were a number of good lessons to
ponder:Use Python99.9 % of their code is in Python. Used on the server
backend; desktop client, website controller logic, API backend, and
analytics.Can't use Python on the Android due to memory constraints.Runs on a

<p>Introduction: Find out with Builtwith.com. It scans a site and guesses how the site is
built. I ran it on this site and it said: Apache, Windows, PHP, Adsense, RSS,
CSS, Javascript, and UTF-8 encoding. Correct, yet I think it should have
guessed Drupal was the CMS and it should have been able to determine which
AJAX library is used. Though it's kind of cool to see which sites use PHP and
other technologies.</p><p>3 0.69387543 <a title="71-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-05-31-Need_help_on_Site_loading_%26_database_optimization_-_URGENT.html">611 high scalability-2009-05-31-Need help on Site loading & database optimization - URGENT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi Friends,I need some help in making site access fast. On an average my site
has the traffic 2500 hits per day and on 16th May it had 60,000 hits. On this
day site was loading very slow even it was getting time out. I also check out
the processes running by using "top" command it was indicating mysql was
taking too much load.There are around 166 tables (Including PHPBB forum) in my
database. All contents on site are displayed by fetching it from database. I
have also added indexing to respective tables where it is required. Plain
PHP/HTML coding is used.Technology:PHP -- 5.2MYSQL -- 5.0Apache --

<p>Introduction: OK,I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any
sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll
ask here.Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application"
that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good
consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen
sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but
no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server"
when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously
useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-
alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.The
normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page
like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy
page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let a user
"in" a</p><p>5 0.65877217 <a title="71-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-15-starting_small_with_growth_in_mind.html">632 high scalability-2009-06-15-starting small with growth in mind</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hello all,I'm working on a web site that might totally flop or it might
explode to be the next facebook/flickr/digg/etc. Since I really don't know how
popular the site will be I don't want to spend a ton of money on the
hardware/hosting right away but I want to be able to scale it easily if it
does grow rapidly. With this in mind, what would be the best approach to
launch the site?Thanks,Dan</p><p>6 0.65443611 <a title="71-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere_Commerce_High_Availability_and_Performance_Configurations.html">321 high scalability-2008-05-17-WebSphere Commerce High Availability and Performance Configurations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For a great Christmas read forgetThe Night Before Christmas, a heart warming
poem written by Clement Moore for his children, that created the modern idea
of Santa Clause we all know and anticipate each Christmas eve. Instead, curl
up with a some potent eggnog, nog being any drink made with rum, and read
CRDTs: Consistency without concurrency control by Mihai Letia, Nuno Preguiรงa,
and Marc Shapiro, which talks about CRDTs (Commutative Replicated Data Type),a
data type whose operations commute when they are concurrent.From the
introduction, which also serves as a nice concise overview of distributed
consistency issues:Shared read-only data is easy to scale by using well-
understood replication techniques. However, sharing mutable data at a large
scale is a difficult problem, because of the CAP impossibility result [5]. Two
approaches dominate in practice. One ensures scalability by giving up

<p>Introduction: This is a hilarious presentation byJosh Berkus, calledScale Fail, given at
O'Reilly MySQL CE 2011. Josh is entertaining, well spoken, and cleverly hides
insight inside chaos. And he makes some dang good points along the way.Josh
has a problem, you see Josh has learned how to make sites that are both
scalable and reliable. So he's puzzled why companies "whose downtime
interfaces (Twitter) are more well known than their uptime interfaces" get all
the attention, respect, and money for being failures. Just doing your job
doesn't make you a hero.  You need these self-inflicted wounds in-order to
have the war stories to share at conferences. They get the attention. Just
doing your job is boring. This is so unfair in that way life can be. So if you
want to turn the tables and take the low road to fame and fortune, here's
Josh's program for learning how not to scale:Be trendy. Use the tool that has
the most buzz: NoSQL, Cloud, MapReduce, Rails, RabbitMQ. It helps you not
scale and the VCs like</p><p>4 0.54829806 <a title="71-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-03-Ideas_on_how_to_scale_a_shared_inventory_database%3F%3F%3F.html">236 high scalability-2008-02-03-Ideas on how to scale a shared inventory database???</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We have a database today that holds all of our shared inventory. How do we
scale out ? We run into concurrency issues today as mutliple users may want to
access the same inventory,etc.Im sure its a common problem.. So how do folks
implement this while also having faster response to available inventory and
also ensuring no downtimeThanks</p><p>5 0.51729089 <a title="71-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-21-Eucalyptus__-__Build_Your_Own_Private_EC2_Cloud.html">355 high scalability-2008-07-21-Eucalyptus  -  Build Your Own Private EC2 Cloud</a></p>

Video by Rich Wolskiand a Visualization.com interviewRich Wolski on
Eucalyptus: Open Source Cloud Computing.Eucalyptusis generating some
excitement on theCloud Computinggroup as a potential vendor neutral EC2
compatible cloud platform. Two reasons why Eucalyptus is potentially
important: private clouds and cloud portability:breakPrivate clouds. Let's say
you want a cloud like infrastructure for architectural purposes but you want
it to run on your own hardware in your own secure environment. How would you
do this today? Hm....Cloud portability. With the number of cloud offerings
increasing how can you maintain some level of vendor neutrality among this
"swarm" of different options? Portability is a key capability for cloud
customers as the only real power customers have is in where they take their
business and the only way you can change suppliers is if there's a ready
market of fungible services.

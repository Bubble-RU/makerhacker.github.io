<p>Introduction: How do you plan to scale your system as you reach predictable milestones? This
topic came up in another venue and it reminded me about a great comment an
Anonymous wrote a while ago and I wanted to make sure that comment didn't get
lost.The Anonymous scaling plan was relatively simple and direct:My two cents
on what I'm using to start a website from scratch using a single server for
now. Later, I'll scale out horizontally when the need arises.Phase
1breakSingle Server, Dual Quad-Core 2.66, 8gb RAM, 500gb Disk Raid 10OS:
Fedora 8. You could go with pretty much any Linux though. I like Fedora 8 best
for servers.Proxy Cache: Varnish - it is way faster than Squid per my own
benchmarks. Squid chokes bigtime.Web Server: Lighttpd - faster than Apache 2
and easier to configure for me.Object Cache: Memcached. Very scalable.PHP
Cache: APC. Easy to configure and seems to work fine.Language: PHP 5 - no
bloated frameworks, waste of time for me. You spend too much time trying to
figure out the frame</p><p>3 0.17018582 <a title="33-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-04-Digg_Architecture.html">554 high scalability-2009-04-04-Digg Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 4::Introducing Digg's IDDB Infrastructureby Joe Stump.IDDB is a way to
partition both indexes (e.g. integer sequences and unique character indexes)
and actual tables across multiple storage servers (MySQL and MemcacheDB are
currently supported with more to follow).Update 3::Scaling Digg and Other Web
Applications.Update 2::How Digg WorksandHow Digg Really Works(wear ear plugs).
Brought to you straight from Digg's blog. A very succinct explanation of the
major elements of the Digg architecture while tracing a request through the
system. I've updated this profile with the new information.Update:Digg now
receives 230 million plus page views per month and 26 million unique visitors
- traffic that necessitated major internal upgrades.Traffic generated by
Digg's over 22 million famously info-hungry users and 230 million page views
can crash an unsuspecting website head-on into its CPU, memory, and bandwidth
limits. How does Digg handle billions of requests a month?Site:

<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture
forPoppen.de, a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be
careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they
manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new,
using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached,
RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.What is Poppen.de?Poppen.de (NSFW) is
the top dating website in Germany, and while it may be a small site compared
to giants like Flickr or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to

<p>Introduction: Joe Stump, Lead Architect at Digg, gavethis presentationat the Web 2.0 Expo. I
couldn't find the actual presentation, but fortunatelyKris Jordantook some
great notes. That's how key moments in history are accidentally captured
forever. Joe was also kind enough to respond to my email questions with a
phone call.In this first part of the post Joe shares some timeless wisdom that
you may or may not have read before. I of course take some pains to extract
all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules. What
really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDBWill be the biggest new
kid on the block in scaling. MemcacheDB has been around for a little while and
I've never thought of it in that way. Well learn why Joe is so excited by
MemcacheDB at the end of the post.Impressive Stats80th-100th largest site in

<p>Introduction: Recently I had to help users on one of my opensource project ISPMan.
http://ispman.netThis project started in 2001 as I was too unwilling to take
care of the DNS and VitualHosting stuff as it was a side-thing to the company
I worked for (so i wrote a software that took care of all these little
details)Summary: A large project that needs a rewrite can be done in a matter
of day.I will not give you a full case study about a project that went through
a re-write but a case study about how easy it is to re-write
something.breakDetails:My boss was cool enough to let me open-source the
project and obviously, I got a lot of cool-cred out of it.Later on I also did
some support and implementation and earned quiet some money with it.Eventually
I had to let the project go out of my hand to the community as I only did it
to facilitate a job that wasnt williing to do. (Setup DNS zones of multiple

<p>Introduction: Jonathan Block, CTO atRockThePost.com, a crowdfunding company, haswritten a
nice set of tipsfor smaller sites on how to scale a service on EC2 using a
small two person development team. Their service has a typical small scale
structure:PHP's Zend Framework 2Two m1.medium for web serversELB to split the
loadmaster/slave MySQL databaseSiege for load testingThe very sensible tips
that can handle 30,000 concurrent users per web server: Use PHP's APC feature.
APC is opcode cache that is "really a requirement in order for a website to
have a chance at performing well."Put everything that's not a .php request on
a CDN. Don't serve static files from your web server. They put everything on
S3 and use CloudFront as their CDN. Recent CloudFront problems have caused

minutes, with 40 minutes of speechifying and 20 minutes for questions.The

<p>Introduction: Monitor, monitor, monitor. That's the advice every startup gives once they
reach a certain size. But can you ever monitor enough? If you are Bitly and
everyone will complain when you are down, probably not.Here are 10 Things We
Forgot to Monitor from Bitly, along with good stories and copious amounts of
code snippets. Well worth reading, especially after you've already started
monitoring the lower hanging fruit.An interesting revelation from the article
is that:We run bitly split across two data centers, one is a managed
environment with DELL hardware, and the second is Amazon EC2.  Fork Rate. A
strange configuration issue caused processes to be created at a rate of
several hundred a second rather than the expected 1-10/second. Flow control
packets.  A network configuration that honors flow control packets and isn't
configured to disable them, can temporarily cause dropped traffic.Swap In/Out

<p>Introduction: How do you scale an inbox that has multiple highly volatile feeds? That's a
problem faced by social networks like Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter. Follow a
few hundred event sources and it's hard to scalably order an inbox so that you
see a correct view as event sources continually publish new events.This can be
considered like aview materializationproblem in a database. In a database a
view is a virtual table defined by a query that can be accessed like a table.
Materialization refers to when the data behind the view is created. If a view
is a join on several tables and that join is performed when the view is
accessed, then performance will be slow. If the view is precomputed access to
the view will be fast, but more resources are used, especially considering
that the view may never be accessed.Your wall/inbox/stream is a view on all
the people/things you follow. If you never look at your inbox then
materializing the view in your inbox is a waste of resources, yet you'll be

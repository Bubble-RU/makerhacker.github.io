<p>Introduction: When you have a large population of servers you have both the opportunity and the incentive to perform interesting studies. Authors from Google and the University of California in  Optimizing Google’s Warehouse Scale Computers: The NUMA Experience  conducted such a study, taking a look at how jobs run on clusters of machines using a  NUMA  architecture. Since NUMA is common on server class machines it's a topic of general interest for those looking to maximize machine utilization across clusters.
 
Some of the results are surprising:
  
 The methodology of how to attribute such fine performance variations to NUMA effects within such a complex system is perhaps more interesting than the results themselves. Well worth reading just for that story. 
 The performance swing due to NUMA is up to 15% on AMD Barcelona for Gmail backend and 20% on Intel Westmere for Web-search frontend.

<p>Introduction: NetApp MetroCluster Software  Cost-effective is an integrated high-availability storage cluster and site failover capability.  NetApp MetroCluster is an integrated high-availability and disaster recovery solution that can reduce system complexity and simplify management while ensuring greater return on investment. MetroCluster uses clustered server technology to replicate data synchronously between sites located miles apart, eliminating data loss in case of a disruption. Simple and powerful recovery process minimizes downtime, with little or no user action required.   At one company I worked at they used the NetApp snap mirror feature to replicate data across long distances to multiple datacenters. They had a very fast backbone and it worked well. The issue with NetApp is always one of cost, but if you can afford it, it's a good option.</p><p>4 0.12029576 <a title="27-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle_-_Provisioning_Tool_to_Build_Remote_Servers.html">461 high scalability-2008-12-05-Sprinkle - Provisioning Tool to Build Remote Servers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At  37 Signals  Joshua Sierles describes how 37 Signals uses  Sprinkle  to configure their servers within EC2. Sprinkle  defines a domain specific meta-language for describing and processing the installation of software . You can find an interesting discussion of Sprinkle's creation story by the creator himself, Marcus Crafter, in  Sprinkle Some Powder! .  Marcus divides provisioning tools into two categories:
    Task Based  - the tool issues a list of commands to run on the remote system, either remotely via a network connection or smart client.     Policy/state Based  - the tool determines what needs to be run on the remote system by examining its current and final state.  Sprinkle combines both models together in a chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter approach using normal Ruby code as the DSL (domain specific language) to declaratively describe remote system configurations. 37 Signals likes the use of Ruby as the DSL because it makes learning a separate syntax unnecessary. I've successfu</p><p>5 0.10878336 <a title="27-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-05-15-Building_a_Database_remote_availability_site.html">1041 high scalability-2011-05-15-Building a Database remote availability site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The AWS East Region outage showed all of us the importance of running our apps and databases across multiple Amazon regions (or multiple cloud providers). In this post, I’ll try to explain how to build a MySQL (or Amazon RDS) redundant site.
 
For simplicity, we create a passive redundant site. This means that the site is not used during normal operation and only comes into action when the primary site crashes. There are many reasons for choosing such an architecture – it’s easy to configure, simple to understand, and minimizes the risk of data collision. The downside is that you have hardware just sitting around doing nothing.
 
Still, it’s a common enough scenario. So what do we need to do to make it work?
  DATA SYNCHRONIZATION  
We need to synchronize the database. This is done by means of database replication. Now, there are two options for database replication: synchronous and a-synchronous. Synchronous replication is great; it ensures that the backup database is identical to the</p><p>6 0.093384437 <a title="27-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-21-n-phase_commit_for_FS_writes%2C_reads_stay_local.html">163 high scalability-2007-11-21-n-phase commit for FS writes, reads stay local</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It’s  called “east-west” networking, which when compared to its predecessor,  “north-south” networking, evinces images of maelstroms and hurricane  winds and tsunamis for some reason. It could be the subtle correlation  between the transformative shift this change in networking patterns has  on the data center with that of El Niño’s transformative power upon the  weather patterns across the globe.
  

    Traditionally,  data center networks have focused on North-South network traffic. The  assumption is that clients on the edge would mainly communicate with  servers at the core, rather than across the network to other clients. 


 But  server virtualization changes all this, with servers, virtual  appliances and even virtual desktops scattered across the same physical  infrastructure. These environments are also highly dynamic, with  workloads moving to different physical locations on the network as  virtual servers are migrated (in the case of data center networks) and  clients move</p><p>4 0.65969431 <a title="27-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Paper%3A_Designing_Disaster_Tolerant_High_Availability_Clusters.html">25 high scalability-2007-07-25-Paper: Designing Disaster Tolerant High Availability Clusters</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Deferred Deletes  is a technique where deleted items  are marked as deleted but not garbage collected until some days or  preferably weeks later .    James Hamilton talks describes this strategy in his classic  On Designing and Deploying  Internet-Scale Services: 
  

Never delete anything. Just mark it deleted. When new data comes in, record the requests on the way. Keep a rolling two week (or more) history of all changes to help recover from software or administrative errors. If someone makes a mistake and forgets the where clause on a delete statement (it has happened before and it will again), all logical copies of the data are deleted. Neither RAID nor mirroring can protect against this form of error. The ability to recover the data can make the difference between a highly embarrassing issue or a minor, barely noticeable glitch. For those systems already doing off-line backups, this additional record of data coming into the service only needs to be since the last backup. But, bein</p><p>6 0.64807212 <a title="27-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-04-Business_continuity_with_real-time_data_integration.html">822 high scalability-2010-05-04-Business continuity with real-time data integration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 3PAR Remote Copy  is a uniquely simple and efficient replication technology that allows customers to protect and share any application data affordably. Built upon 3PAR Thin Copy technology, Remote Copy lowers the total cost of storage by addressing the cost and complexity of remote replication.  Common Uses of 3PAR Remote Copy:  Affordable Disaster Recovery: Mirror data cost-effectively across town or across the world.  Centralized Archive: Replicate data from multiple 3PAR InServs located in multiple data centers to a centralized data archive location.  Resilient Pod Architecture: Mutually replicate tier 1 or 2 data to tier 3 capacity between two InServs (application pods).  Remote Data Access: Replicate data to a remote location for sharing of data with remote users.</p><p>2 0.83338422 <a title="27-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-02-Total_Cost_of_Ownership_for_different_web_development_frameworks.html">338 high scalability-2008-06-02-Total Cost of Ownership for different web development frameworks</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have introduced pattern languages in my earlier post on  The Pattern Bible for Distributed Computing .  Achieving highest possible scalability is a complex combination of many factors. This PLoP 2007  paper  presents a pattern language that can be used to make a system highly scalable.  The Scalability Pattern Language introduced by Kanwardeep Singh Ahluwalia includes patterns to:
  
 Introduce Scalability 
 
 Optimize Algorithm 
 
 Add Hardware 
 
 Add Parallelism 
 
 Add Intra-Process Parallelism 
 Add Inter-Porcess Parallelism 
 Add Hybrid Parallelism 
 
 
 
 Optimize Decentralization 
 
 Control Shared Resources 
 
 Automate Scalability</p><p>4 0.7984767 <a title="27-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-05-29-Amazon%3A_Creating_a_Customer_Utopia_One_Culture_Hack_at_a_Time.html">1466 high scalability-2013-05-29-Amazon: Creating a Customer Utopia One Culture Hack at a Time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you don’t cannibalize yourself, someone else will. --  Steve Jobs   
 
       
 
 
America as the New World has a long history of inspiring  Utopian communities . Early experiments were famously religious. But there have been many others as new waves of thought have inspired people to organize and try something different.
 
In the 1840s Transcendentalists, believing the true path lay in the perfection of the individual, created intentional communities like  Brook Farm . We've also seen  socialist ,  anarchist ,  hippy , and virtually every other kind of Utopia in-between. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote an infamous book,  Walden Two , with a more "scientific" take on creating a Utopian community and Ayn Rand in  Atlas Shrugged  had her free market version.
 
I believe in startup organizations we see the modern version of Utopian energy in action. We now call it by names like "culture hacking", but the goal is the same: to create a new form of human community to achieve a profound go</p><p>5 0.77472669 <a title="27-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-07-It%27s_a_VM_Wasteland_-_A_Near_Optimal_Packing_of_VMs_to_Machines_Reduces_TCO_by_22%25.html">1419 high scalability-2013-03-07-It's a VM Wasteland - A Near Optimal Packing of VMs to Machines Reduces TCO by 22%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In  Algorithm Design for Performance Aware VM Consolidation  we learn some shocking facts (gambling in Casablanca?):
  
  Average server utilization in many data centers is low, estimated between 5% and 15%. This is wasteful because an idle server often consumes more than 50% of peak power.  
 Surely that's just for old style datacenters? Nope. In Google data centers, workloads that are consolidated use only 50% of the processor cores. Every other processor core is left unused simply to ensure that performance does not degrade. 
  
It's a VM wasteland. The goal is to reduce waste by packing VMs onto machines without hurting performance or wasting resources. The idea is to select VMs that interfere the least with each other and places them together on the same server.
 
It's a NP-Complete problem, but this paper describes a practical method that performs provably close to the optimal. Interestingly they can optimize for performance or power efficiency, so you can use different algorithm</p><p>6 0.75821263 <a title="27-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-17-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_July_17%2C_2010.html">860 high scalability-2010-07-17-Hot Scalability Links for July 17, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Gangliais a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance
computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical
design targeted at federations of clusters. It leverages widely used
technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable
data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses
carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-
node overheads and high concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been
ported to an extensive set of operating systems and processor architectures,
and is currently in use on thousands of clusters around the world. It has been
used to link clusters across university campuses and around the world and can
scale to handle clusters with 2000 nodes.</p><p>3 0.12848827 <a title="58-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j_-_a_Graph_Database_that_Kicks_Buttox.html">628 high scalability-2009-06-13-Neo4j - a Graph Database that Kicks Buttox</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Social networks in the database: using a graph database. A nice post on
representing, traversing, and performing other common social network
operations using a graph database.If you areDiggorLinkedInyou can build your
own speedy graph database to represent your complex social network
relationships. For those of more modest meansNeo4j, a graph database, is a
good alternative.A graph is a collection nodes (things) and edges
(relationships) that connect pairs of nodes. Slap properties (key-value pairs)
on nodes and relationships and you have a surprisingly powerful way to
represent most anything you can think of. In a graph database "relationships
are first-class citizens. They connect two nodes and both nodes and
relationships can hold an arbitrary amount of key-value pairs. So you can look
at a graph database as a key-value store, with full support for
relationships."A graph looks something like:For more lovely examples take a

<p>Introduction: WordPress.com hosts 300 servers in 5 different data centers. It's always
useful to learn how large installations manage all their unruly
children:Currently we Nagios for server health monitoring, Munin for graphing
various server metrics, and a wiki to keep track of all the server hardware
specs, IPs, vendor IDs, etc. All of these tools have suited us well up until
now, but there have been some scaling issues.The post covers how these
different tools are working for them and the comment section has some
interesting discussions too.</p><p>5 0.1162081 <a title="58-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-11-17-Some_Services_are_More_Equal_than_Others.html">944 high scalability-2010-11-17-Some Services are More Equal than Others</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Remember when the iPhone launched? Remember the complaints about the device
not maintaining calls well? Was it really the hardware? Or was it the service
provider network, overwhelmed by not just the call volume but millions of
hyper-customers experimenting with their new toy? Look - a video! Look a
videoand a call.Hey, I'm on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and streaming audio at
the same time I'm making a call! How awesome is that?Meanwhile, there's an
entire army of operators at a service provider's NOC who are stalking through
the data center with scissors because it's the only way to stop the
madness.Service providers, probably better than any other, understand
"services". For longer than the enterprise has been talking about them,
service providers have been implementing them. They've got their own set of
standards and reference architectures and even language to describe them, but
in a nutshell that's what a service provider does: offers services.The problem
for service providers is</p><p>6 0.11212949 <a title="58-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-29-Platform_virtualization_-_top_25_providers_%28software%2C_hardware%2C_combined%29.html">479 high scalability-2008-12-29-Platform virtualization - top 25 providers (software, hardware, combined)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: GraphChiuses aParallel Sliding Windowsmethod which can: process a graph with
mutable edge values efficiently from disk, with only a small number of non-
sequential disk accesses, while supporting the asynchronous model of
computation.The result is graphs with billions of edges can be processed on
just a single machine. It uses a vertex-centric computation model similar
toPregel, which supports iterative algorithims as apposed to the batch style
of MapReduce. Streaming graph updates are supported.About GraphChi, Carlos
Guestrin, codirector of Carnegie Mellon's Select Lab,says:A Mac Mini running
GraphChi can analyze Twitter's social graph from 2010--which contains 40
million users and 1.2 billion connections--in 59 minutes. "The previous

<p>Introduction: Relational databases, document databases, and distributed hash tables get most
of the hype these days, but there's another option: graph databases. Back to
the future it seems. Here's a really interesting paper by Marko A. Rodriguez
introducing the graph model and it's extension to representing the world wide
web of data.Modern day open source and commercial graph databases can store on
the order of 1 billion relationships with some databases reaching the 10
billion mark. These developments are making the graph database practical for
applications that require large-scale knowledge structures. Moreover, withthe
Web of Data standards set forth by the Linked Data community, it is possible
to interlink graph databases across the web into a giant global knowledge
structure. This talk will discuss graph databases, their underlying data
model, their querying mechanisms, and the benefits of the graph data structure
for modeling and analysis.</p><p>6 0.6850009 <a title="58-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-14-When_all_the_Program%27s_a_Graph_-_Prismatic%27s_Plumbing_Library.html">1406 high scalability-2013-02-14-When all the Program's a Graph - Prismatic's Plumbing Library</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Although the problem of scaling human genome sequencing is not exactly about
building bigger, faster and more reliable websites it is most interesting in
terms of scalability. Thepaperdescribes a new technology by the startup
company Complete Genomics to sequence the full human genome for the fraction
of the cost of earlier possibilities.Complete Genomics is building the world's
largest commercial human genome sequencing center to provide turnkey,
outsourced complete human genome sequencing to customers worldwide.By 2010,
their data center will contain approximately 60,000 processors with 30
petabytes of storage running their sequencing software on Linux clusters.Do
you find this interesting and relevant to HighScalability.com?</p><p>2 0.88912922 <a title="58-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-07-10-Can_cloud_computing_smite_down_evil_zombie_botnet_armies%3F.html">349 high scalability-2008-07-10-Can cloud computing smite down evil zombie botnet armies?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the more cool stuff I've never heard of before department is something
calledSelf Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance(SCIT).Botnetsare created when
vulnerable computers live long enough to become infected with the will to do
the evil bidding of their evil masters. Security is almost always about
removing vulnerabilities (a process which to outside observers often looks
like adog chasing its tail). SCIT takes a different approach, it works on the
availability angle. Something I never thought of before, but which makes a
great deal of sense once I thought about it.With SCIT you stop and restart VM
instances every minute (or whatever depending in your desired window
vulnerability)....breakThis short exposure window means worms and viri do not
have long enough to fully infect a machine and carry out a coordinated attack.
A machine is up for a while. Does work. And then is torn down again only to be
reborn as a clean VM with no possibility of infection (unless of course the VM
mechanisms becom</p><p>same-blog 3 0.86836267 <a title="58-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Product%3A_Cacti.html">58 high scalability-2007-08-04-Product: Cacti</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cactiis a network statistics graphing tool designed as a frontend to RRDtool's
data storage and graphing functionality. It is intended to be intuitive and
easy to use, as well as robust and scalable. It is generally used to graph
time-series data like CPU load and bandwidth use.The frontend is written in
PHP; it can handle multiple users, each with their own graph sets, so it is
sometimes used by web hosting providers (especially dedicated server, virtual
private server, and colocation providers) to display bandwidth statistics for
their customers. It can be used to configure the data collection itself,
allowing certain setups to be monitored without any manual configuration of
RRDtool.</p><p>4 0.84496766 <a title="58-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy%3A_Efficiently_Geo-referencing_IPs.html">168 high scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy: Efficiently Geo-referencing IPs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations. Jeremy Cole inOn
efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GISsuccinctly
explains the many uses for such a feature:Geo-referencing IPs is, in a
nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a
log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity
owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-
reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting
systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more
applications.This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit
of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-
rereferncing data, how to load data, and the performance of different
approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to
the subject.</p><p>5 0.81728911 <a title="58-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-27-Solving_the_Client_Side_API_Scalability_Problem_with_a_Little_Game_Theory.html">166 high scalability-2007-11-27-Solving the Client Side API Scalability Problem with a Little Game Theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now that the internet has become defined as a mashup over a collection of
service APIs, we have a little problem: for clients using APIs is a lot like
drinking beer through a straw. You never get as much beer as you want and you
get a headache after. But what if I've been a good boy and deserve a bigger
straw? Maybe we can use game theory to model trust relationships over a life
time of interactions over many different services and then give more
capabilities/beer to those who have earned them?breakLet's say Twitter limits
me to downloading only 20 tweets at a time through their API. But I want more.
I may even want to do something so radical as download all my tweets. Of
course Twitter can't let everyone do that. They would be swamped serving all
this traffic and service would be denied. So Twitter does that rational thing
and limits API access as a means of self protection. As does Google,
Yahoo,Skynet, and everyone else.But when I hit the API limit I think, but hey

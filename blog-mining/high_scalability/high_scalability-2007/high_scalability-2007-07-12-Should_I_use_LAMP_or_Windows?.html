they seem to consider them unreliable with limits around scalability,
performance and availability.And then you start looking at some of the big

Linux, MySQL,Oracle platforms that we dont see Windows and SQL Server in

store?I'm writing a website that I need to keep as low budget as possible, and
I'm investigating solutions for storing uploaded photos from users - not too
many, probably in the low thousands. The site is commercial so I'm straying
away from the Flickrs of the world. S3 seems to offer a solution but I'd like
to hear from those who have used it before.ThanksAndy</p><p>4 0.79469186 <a title="8-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-15-starting_small_with_growth_in_mind.html">632 high scalability-2009-06-15-starting small with growth in mind</a></p>

popular the site will be I don't want to spend a ton of money on the
hardware/hosting right away but I want to be able to scale it easily if it
does grow rapidly. With this in mind, what would be the best approach to

<p>Introduction: OK,I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any
sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll
ask here.Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application"
that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good
consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen
sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but
no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server"
when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously
useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-
alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.The
normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page
like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy
page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let a user
"in" a</p><p>6 0.75223583 <a title="8-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-16-What_tech_is_used_to_build_your_favorite_site%3F.html">66 high scalability-2007-08-16-What tech is used to build your favorite site?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Contributed by Wolfgang Gentzsch:Now that we have a new computing paradigm,
Cloud Computing, how can Clouds help our data? Replace our internal data
vaults as we hoped Grids would? Are Grids dead now that we have Clouds?
Despite all the promising developments in the Grid and Cloud computing space,
and the avalanche of publications and talks on this subject, many people still
seem to be confused about internal data and compute resources, versus Grids
versus Clouds, and they are hesitant to take the next step. I think there are

<p>Introduction: Why migrate your database? Efficiency and availability problems are harming
your business - reports are out of date, your batch processing window is
nearing its limits, outages (unplanned/planned) frequently halt work. Database
consolidation - remove the costs that result from a heterogeneous database
environment (DBAs time, database vendor pricing, database versions, hardware,
OSs, patches, upgrades etc.). OK, so the driving forces for migration are

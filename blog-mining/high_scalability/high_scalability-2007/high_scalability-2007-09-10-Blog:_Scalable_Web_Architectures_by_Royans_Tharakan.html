<p>Introduction: Unlike Theo Schlossnagle, author ofScalable Internet Architectures, I am not a
stickler for semantics because I have an unswerving faith in the ultimate
unknowability of the world as experienced by others. That's why it is Theo who
bravely tackles the differences in his informative blog postPartitioning vs.
Federation vs. Sharding. Royans Tharakan also talks about it on hisblog.Is
there a difference and does it really matter to all our intrepid scalable
website builders?breakGenerally whatever Theo says is probably close to the
truth. Yet, in my mind I think of partitioning as abasic level categoryand
federation and sharding as more specific (subordinate) instances of
partitioning. And partitioning is a more specific instance of the more more
general (superordinate) category divide-and-conquer. Which isn't a useful way
to think about the topic at all.So, let's say federation is like Star Trek.

<p>Introduction: ProfessorDavid Malangives a very good lecture on scalability for dynamic
websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a
great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching
style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible
explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal
scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load
balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high
availability.Watch it onAcademic EarthThis is one lecture in a series of 13
lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to: build dynamic
websites with Ajax and with Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP); set up
domain names with DNS; structure pages with XHTML and CSS how to program in
JavaScript and PHP; configure Apacheand MySQL; design and query databases with
SQL; use Ajax with both XML andJSON;  build mashups.For thelecture notesgo to

<p>Introduction: Complex applications coordinating work across a lot of machines often need a
highly performing fault tolerant message layer. Though a blast to write, it's
probably a better use of your time to use an off the shelf solution. And
that's whereSpreadcomes in. Flickr, for example, uses Spread to create real-
time event feeds from their web server logs. What exactly is Spread?breakFrom
theSpreadwebsite:Spread is an open source toolkit that provides a high
performance messaging service that is resilient to faults across local and
wide area networks. Spread functions as a unified message bus for distributed
applications, and provides highly tuned application-level multicast, group
communication, and point to point support. Spread services range from reliable
messaging to fully ordered messages with delivery guarantees.Spread can be
used in many distributed applications that require high reliability, high
performance, and robust communication among various subsets of members. The

<p>Introduction: A couple of videos about distributed computing with direct reference on Google
infrastructure.You will get acquainted with:--MapReduce the software framework
implemented by Google to support parallel computations over large (greater
than 100 terabyte) data sets on commodity hardware--GFS and the way it stores
it's data into 64mb chunks--Bigtable which is the simple implementation of a
non-relational database at GoogleCluster Computing and MapReduce Lectures 1-5.</p><p>6 0.70777142 <a title="88-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-10-Sponsored_Post%3A_Okta%2C_EzRez%2C_VoltDB%2C_Digg%2C_Cloud_Sigma%2C_Applications_Manager%2C_Site24x7.html">876 high scalability-2010-08-10-Sponsored Post: Okta, EzRez, VoltDB, Digg, Cloud Sigma, Applications Manager, Site24x7</a></p>

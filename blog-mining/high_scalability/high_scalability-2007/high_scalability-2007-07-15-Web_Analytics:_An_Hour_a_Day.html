<p>Introduction: Recently, I was reading Todd Hoff's write-up on  FaceBook real time analytics system  . As usual, Todd did an excellent job in summarizing  this video  from Engineering Manager at Facebook  Alex Himel .
 
In  the first post , I’d like to summarize the case study, and consider some things that weren't mentioned in the summaries. This will lead to an architecture for building your own Realtime Time Analytics for Big-Data that might be easier to implement, using Facebook's experience as a starting point and guide as well as the experience gathered through a recent work with few of GigaSpaces customers. The  second post  provide a summary of that new approach as well as a pattern and a demo for building your own Real Time Analytics system..

<p>Introduction: Facebook did it again. They've built another system capable of doing something useful with ginormous streams of realtime data. Last time we saw Facebook release their  New Real-Time Messaging System: HBase To Store 135+ Billion Messages A Month . This time it's a realtime analytics system handling  over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds . 
 
Alex Himel, Engineering Manager at Facebook,  explains what they've built  ( video ) and the scale required:
  

Social plugins have become an important and growing source of traffic for millions of websites over the past year. We released a new version of Insights for Websites last week to give site owners better analytics on how people interact with their content and to help them optimize their websites in real time. To accomplish this, we had to engineer a system that could process over 20 billion events per day (200,000 events per second) with a lag of less than 30 seconds.

<p>Introduction: If you are Google you don't just complain about performance on the web, you do something about it. Doing something about web performance is the job of one  Ilya Grigorik , Developer Advocate,  Make the Web Fast  at Google, and author of a great new book:  High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer should know about networking and web performance . 
 
That's a big topic you might be saying to yourself. And it is. The book is 400 plus information packed pages. But never fear. Ilya writes in a very straightforward style. It’s like a man page for the web. Which is a good thing.
 
In case you are not familiar with Ilya, he's the perfect choice for writing such an ambitious book. For years Ilya has been producing excellent content on  his blog  and if you  search YouTube  you'll find presentation after presentation on the topics found in the book. Authority established.
 
Reading the book I was struck by what a complicated beast or little World Wide Web has become.

<p>Introduction: Does anyone know of any articles or papers that discuss the nuts and bolts of how web analytics is implemented at organizations with large volumes of web traffic and a critcal business need to analyze that data - e.g. places like Amazon.com, eBay, and Google?     Just as a fun project I'm planning to build my own web log analysis app that can effectively index and query large volumes of web log data (i.e. TB range). But first I'd like to learn more about how it's done in the organizations whose lifeblood depends on this stuff. Even just a high level architectural overview of their approaches would be nice to have.</p><p>4 0.64213479 <a title="14-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-04-New_Book%3A_Even_Faster_Web_Sites%3A_Performance_Best_Practices_for_Web_Developers.html">617 high scalability-2009-06-04-New Book: Even Faster Web Sites: Performance Best Practices for Web Developers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Performance is critical to the success of any web site, and yet today's web applications push browsers to their limits with increasing amounts of rich content and heavy use of Ajax. In his new book  Even Faster Web Sites: Performance Best Practices for Web Developers  , Steve Souders, web performance evangelist at Google and former Chief Performance Yahoo!, provides valuable techniques to help you optimize your site's performance.  Souders' previous book, the bestselling  High Performance Web Sites , shocked the web development world by revealing that 80% of the time it takes for a web page to load is on the client side. In Even Faster Web Sites, Souders and eight expert contributors provide best practices and pragmatic advice for improving your site's performance in three critical categories:
  
  JavaScript  - Get advice for understanding Ajax performance, writing efficient JavaScript, creating responsive applications, loading scripts without blocking other components, and more.</p><p>5 0.62139457 <a title="14-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy%3A_Efficiently_Geo-referencing_IPs.html">168 high scalability-2007-11-30-Strategy: Efficiently Geo-referencing IPs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A lot of apps need to map IP addresses to locations.  Jeremy Cole in   On efficiently geo-referencing IPs with MaxMind GeoIP and MySQL GIS   succinctly explains the many uses for such a feature:     Geo-referencing IPs is, in a nutshell, converting an IP address, perhaps from an incoming web visitor, a log file, a data file, or some other place, into the name of some entity owning that IP address. There are a lot of reasons you may want to geo-reference IP addresses to country, city, etc., such as in simple ad targeting systems, geographic load balancing, web analytics, and many more applications.       This is difficult to do efficiently, at least it gives me a bit of brain freeze. In the same post Jeremy nicely explains where to get the geo-rereferncing data, how to load data,  and the performance of different approaches for IP address searching. It's a great practical introduction to the subject.</p><p>6 0.59582043 <a title="14-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-31-Book%3A_Scalable_Internet_Architectures.html">51 high scalability-2007-07-31-Book: Scalable Internet Architectures</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how to make it work. Dan Rayburn  has a post  pointing to a fascinating paper:  An Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming , which talks in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the Internet. For Akamai they found:
  
 Each video is encoded in five versions at different bit rates and stored in separate files. 
 The client sends commands to the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds.  
 Akamai uses only the video level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame rate of the video is kept constant. 
 When a sudden drop in the available bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to the a large actuation delay. 
  For a sudden increase of the avai</p><p>4 0.83309782 <a title="14-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling_Social_Ecommerce_Architecture_Case_study.html">1016 high scalability-2011-04-04-Scaling Social Ecommerce Architecture Case study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent applications. Furthermore,  over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are more likely to make a purchase after “liking” a brand they find online. ( source  ) 
 
Sears Architect Tomer Gabel provides an insightful overview on how they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:
  
 the architectural considerations behind their solution 
 why they chose memory over disk 
 how they partitioned the data to gain scalability 
 why they chose to execute code with the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution framework 
 how they integrated with Facebook 
 why they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-memory caching and scale

<p>Introduction: Looks like an interesting take on "a completely asynchronous, low-latency transaction management protocol, in line with the fully distributed NoSQL architecture."
 
 Warp: Multi-Key Transactions for Key-Value Stores Â overview:
  

Implementing ACID transactions has been a longstanding challenge for NoSQL systems. Because these systems are based on a sharded architecture, transactions necessarily require coordination across multiple servers. Past work in this space has relied either on heavyweight protocols such as Paxos or clock synchronization for this coordination.


This paper presents a novel protocol for coordinating distributed transactions with ACID semantics on top of a sharded data store. Called linear transactions, this protocol achieves scalability by distributing the coordination task to only those servers that hold relevant data for each transaction. It achieves high performance by serializing only those transactions whose concurrent execution could potentially yield a vio</p><p>6 0.78130352 <a title="14-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_ImageShack.html">43 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: ImageShack</a></p>

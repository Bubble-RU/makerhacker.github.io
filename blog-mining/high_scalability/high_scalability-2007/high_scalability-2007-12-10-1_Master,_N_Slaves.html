<p>Introduction: Hello all,I'm working on a web site that might totally flop or it might
explode to be the next facebook/flickr/digg/etc. Since I really don't know how
popular the site will be I don't want to spend a ton of money on the
hardware/hosting right away but I want to be able to scale it easily if it
does grow rapidly. With this in mind, what would be the best approach to
launch the site?Thanks,Dan</p><p>4 0.14007208 <a title="178-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-24-How_Google_Serves_Data_from_Multiple_Datacenters.html">687 high scalability-2009-08-24-How Google Serves Data from Multiple Datacenters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:Streamy Explains CAP and HBase's Approach to CAP.We plan to employ
inter-cluster replication, with each cluster located in a single DC. Remote
replication will introduce some eventual consistency into the system, but each
cluster will continue to be strongly consistent.Ryan Barrett, Google App
Engine datastore lead, gave this talkTransactions Across Datacenters (and
Other Weekend Projects)at the Google I/O 2009 conference.While the talk
doesn't necessarily break new technical ground, Ryan does an excellent job
explaining and evaluating the different options you have when architecting a
system to work across multiple datacenters. This is calledmultihoming,
operating from multiple datacenters simultaneously.As multihoming is one of
the most challenging tasks in all computing, Ryan's clear and thoughtful style
comfortably leads you through the various options. On the trip you learn:The
differentmulti-homing optionsare: Backups, Master-Slave, Multi-Master, 2PC,
and Paxos. You'll als</p><p>5 0.12542784 <a title="178-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-21-n-phase_commit_for_FS_writes%2C_reads_stay_local.html">163 high scalability-2007-11-21-n-phase commit for FS writes, reads stay local</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have put down my thoughts in the architecture discussed inthe blog. Although
I have done substantial research to understand how things should work before
deciding this architecture but I will be requiring huge amount of inputs from
everyone to come to an architecture decision. Hardware entities which were
thought while designing the entities are:1. Master Web Server which will map
different users to web servers placed in different geographical locations.
(will prefer storing a mapping table in RAM)2. Web Servers3. Application
Servers4. Master Database Servers (to implement entity wise look up
sharding)5. Slave Database Servers.Will really appreciate if some good inputs
of using Cloud Computing are given and how to go about it against or in
addition to the given architecture. Would like to in fact know people's view
on when to decide using cloud computing techniques. Looking forward for inputs
from the community.</p><p>5 0.57133681 <a title="178-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-14-Scaling_Digg_and_Other_Web_Applications.html">512 high scalability-2009-02-14-Scaling Digg and Other Web Applications</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joe Stump, Lead Architect at Digg, gavethis presentationat the Web 2.0 Expo. I
couldn't find the actual presentation, but fortunatelyKris Jordantook some
great notes. That's how key moments in history are accidentally captured
forever. Joe was also kind enough to respond to my email questions with a
phone call.In this first part of the post Joe shares some timeless wisdom that
you may or may not have read before. I of course take some pains to extract
all the wit from the original presentation in favor of simple rules. What
really struck me however was how Joe thought MemcacheDBWill be the biggest new
kid on the block in scaling. MemcacheDB has been around for a little while and
I've never thought of it in that way. Well learn why Joe is so excited by
MemcacheDB at the end of the post.Impressive Stats80th-100th largest site in

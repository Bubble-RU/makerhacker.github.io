<p>Introduction: The primero recommendation for speeding up a website is almost always to add cache and more cache. And after that add a little more cache just in case. Memcached is almost always given as the recommended cache to use. What we don't often hear is how to effectively use a cache in our own products. MySQL hosted two excellent webinars (referenced below) on the subject of how to deploy and use memcached. The star of the show, other than MySQL of course, is Farhan Mashraqi of Fotolog. You may recall we did an earlier article on Fotolog in  Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success , which was one of my personal favorites.  Fotolog, as they themselves point out, is probably the largest site nobody has ever heard of, pulling in more page views than even Flickr. Fotolog has 51 instances of memcached on 21 servers with 175G in use and 254G available. As a large successful photo-blogging site they have very demanding performance and scaling requirements.

<p>Introduction: I currently use BerkeleyDB as an embedded database   http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/   a decision which was initially brought on by learning that Google used BerkeleyDB for their universal sign-on feature.     Lustre looks impressive, but their white paper shows speeds of 800 files created per second, as a good number.  However, BerkeleyDB on my mac mini does 200,000 row creations per second, and can be used as a distributed file system.     I'm having I/O scalability issues with BerkeleyDB on one machine, and about to implement their distributed replication feature (and go multi-machine), which in effect makes it work like a distributed file system, but with local access speeds.  That's why I was looking at Lustre.     The key feature difference between BerkeleyDB and Lustre is that BerkeleyDB has a complete copy of all the data on each computer, making it not a viable solution for massive sized database applications.  However, if you have < 1TB (ie, one disk) of total pos</p><p>4 0.18089318 <a title="174-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-16-%5BANN%5D_New_Open_Source_Cache_System.html">467 high scalability-2008-12-16-[ANN] New Open Source Cache System</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The SHOP.COM Cache System is now available at http://code.google.com/p/sccache/     The SHOP.COM Cache System is an object cache system that...   * is an in-process cache and external, shared Cache   * is horizontally scalable   * stores cached objects to disk   * supports associative keys   * is non-transactional   * can have any size key and any size data   * does auto-GC based on TTL   * is container and platform neutral     It was built in-house at SHOP.COM (by me) and has powered our website for years. We are open-sourcing it in the hope that it will be useful to others and to get some help in its maintenance.

<p>Introduction: The Gear6 Web Cache hybrid DRAM-flash memory architecture allows for 5-10 times more memcache memory per unit of rack space than DRAM-only configurations, and cuts memory costs by 50%. Other software enhancements include a slab allocator that is more efficient than traditional memcache implementations due to its fine-grained bucket sizing. Gear6 Web Cache also supports object sizes greater than 1 megabyte and manages evictions based on the cost of replacing objects, depending on the size and frequency of object access. It intelligently places cache instances across DRAM and flash, taking into account their different characteristics, while at the same time monitoring their health and detecting and deâ&euro;?allocating faulty or failing memory.  Gear6 Web Cache is a Memcached protocol compliant solution that scales and accelerates web applications, reduces memory footprint, enhances availability and implements comprehensive Memcached management features.

<p>Introduction: Dormando  shows an enlightened middle way  for storing sessions in cache and the database. Sessions are a perfect cache candidate because they are transient, smallish, and since they are usually accessed on every page access removing all that load from the database is a good thing. But as Dormando points out session caches have problems. If you remove expiration times from the cache and you run out of memory then no more logins. If a cache server fails or needs to be upgrade then you just logged out a bunch of potentially angry users.  The middle ground Dormando proposes is using both the cache and the database:
    Reads : read from the cache first, then the database. Typical cache logic.     Writes :  write to memcached every time, write to the database every N seconds (assuming the data has changed).   There's a small chance of data loss, but you've still greatly reduced the database load while providing reliability. Nice solution.</p><p>4 0.85462755 <a title="174-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy%3A_Break_Up_the_Memcache_Dog_Pile_.html">673 high scalability-2009-08-07-Strategy: Break Up the Memcache Dog Pile </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:  Asynchronous  HTTP cache validations . A proposed HTTP caching extension:  if your application can afford to show slightly out of date content, then stale-while-revalidate can guarantee that the user will always be served directly from the cache, hence guaranteeing a consistent response-time user-experience.   Caching is like aspirin for headaches. Head hurts: pop a 'sprin. Slow site: add caching.  Facebook  must have a lot of headaches because they popped 805 memcached servers between 10,000 web servers and 1,800 MySQL servers and they reportedly have a 99% cache hit rate. But what's the best way for you to cache for your application? It's a remarkably complex and rich topic. Alexey Kovyrin talks about one common caching problem called the   Dog Pile  Effect  in  Dog-pile Effect and How to Avoid it with Ruby on Rails . Glenn Franxman also has a Django solution in  MintCache .
 
Data is usually cached because it's too expensive to calculate for every hit.

<p>Introduction: Over the last several decades computer architects have been phenomenally successful turning the transistor bounty provided by Moore's Law into chips with ever increasing single-threaded performance. During many of these successful years, however, many researchers paid scant attention to multiprocessor work. Now as vendors turn to multicore chips, researchers are reacting with more papers on multi-threaded systems. While this is good, we are concerned that further work on single-thread performance will be squashed.     To help understand future high-level trade-offs, we develop a corollary to Amdahl's Law for multicore chips [Hill & Marty, IEEE Computer 2008]. It models fixed chip resources for alternative designs that use symmetric cores, asymmetric cores, or dynamic techniques that allow cores to work together on sequential execution. Our results encourage multicore designers to view performance of the entire chip rather than focus on core efficiencies. Moreover, we observe that obtai</p><p>2 0.90793753 <a title="174-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-06-27-Paper%3A_Logic_and_Lattices_for_Distributed_Programming.html">1273 high scalability-2012-06-27-Paper: Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Neil Conway  from Berkeley CS is giving an advanced level talk at  a meetup today  in San Francisco on a new paper:  Logic and Lattices for Distributed Programming  - extending set logic to support CRDT-style lattices. 
 
The description of the meetup is probably the clearest introduction to the paper:
  Developers are increasingly choosing datastores that sacrifice strong consistency guarantees in exchange for improved performance and availability. Unfortunately, writing reliable distributed programs without the benefit of strong consistency can be very challenging.

 


In this talk, I'll discuss work from our group at UC Berkeley that aims to make it easier to write distributed programs without relying on strong consistency. Bloom is a declarative programming language for distributed computing, while CALM is an analysis technique that identifies programs that are guaranteed to be eventually consistent. I'll then discuss our recent work on extending CALM to support a broader range of</p><p>3 0.90245533 <a title="174-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-09-09-How_did_Google_Instant_become_Faster_with_5-7X_More_Results_Pages%3F.html">899 high scalability-2010-09-09-How did Google Instant become Faster with 5-7X More Results Pages?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We don't have a lot of details on how Google pulled off their technically very impressive Google Instant release, but in  Google Instant behind the scenes , they did share some interesting facts:
  
 Google was serving more than a billion searches per day. 
 With Google Instant they served 5-7X more results pages than previously. 
 Typical search results were returned in less than a quarter of second. 
 A team of 50+ worked on the project for an extended period of time. 
  
Although  Google  is associated with muscular data centers, they just didn't throw more server capacity at the problem, they worked smarter too. What were their general strategies?
  
 Increase backend server capacity. 
 Add new caches to handle high request rates while keeping results fresh while the web is continuously crawled and re-indexed. 
 Add User-state data to the back-ends to keep track of the results pages already shown to a given user, preventing the same results from being re-fetched repeatedly.

<p>Introduction: If you just can't get enough high scalability talk you might want to take a look GigaOm's Structure 08 conference. The slate of speakers looks appropriately interesting and San Francisco is truly magical this time of year. High Scalability readers even get a price break is you use the HIGHSCALE discount code! I'll be on vacation so I won't see you there, but it looks like a good time. For a nice change of pace consider visiting   MoMA   next door.  Here's a blurb on the conference:   A reminder to our readers about Structure 08, GigaOm's upcoming conference dedicated to web infrastructure. In addition to keynotes from leaders like Jim Crowe, chairman and CEO of Level 3 Communications and Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon, the event will feature workshops from Google App Engine, Microsoft and a special workshop from Fenwick and West who will cover how to raise money for an infrastructure start up.

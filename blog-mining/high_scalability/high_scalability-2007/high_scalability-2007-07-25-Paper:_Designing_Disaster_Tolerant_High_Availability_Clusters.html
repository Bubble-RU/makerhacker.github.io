storage cluster and site failover capability.NetApp MetroCluster is an
integrated high-availability and disaster recovery solution that can reduce
system complexity and simplify management while ensuring greater return on

synchronously between sites located miles apart, eliminating data loss in case
of a disruption. Simple and powerful recovery process minimizes downtime, with
little or no user action required.At one company I worked at they used the
NetApp snap mirror feature to replicate data across long distances to multiple
datacenters. They had a very fast backbone and it worked well. The issue with

<p>Introduction: Update:Yahoo! Launches World's Largest Hadoop Production Application. A 10,000
core Hadoop cluster produces data used in every Yahoo! Web search query. Raw
disk is at 5 Petabytes. Their previous 1 petabyte database couldn't handle the
load and couldn't grow larger.Greg Lindenthinks the Google cluster has way
over 133,000 machines.From an InfoQinterviewwith project lead Doug Cutting, it
appearsHadoop, an open source distributed computing platform, is making good
progress towards their 1.0 release. They've successfully reached a 1000 node
cluster size, improved file system integrity, and jacked performance by 20x in
the last year.How they are making progress could be a good model for
anyone:breakThe speedup has been an aggregation of our work in the past few
years, and has been accomplished mostly by trial-and-error. We get things
running smoothly on a cluster of a given size, then double the size of the
cluster and see what breaks. We aim for performance to scale linearly as you

<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000
or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is
estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High
Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as
uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.This post focuses on a
customer's backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a
dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA
features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the
challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services
and annual support?Read more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>5 0.070934258 <a title="25-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-04-Business_continuity_with_real-time_data_integration.html">822 high scalability-2010-05-04-Business continuity with real-time data integration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Enterprises want to protect their data.As the appetite for data volumes grows,
storage technology becomes a critical business asset on which business
continuity relies.My recent survey in the medium-size enterprise segment shows
the five dominant investment directions at the level of data management
architecture: disaster recovery (DR), high availability (HA), backup, data
processing performance and migration to more advanced databases.ďťż This
suggests that corporations generally have sufficiently structured data
collections but are concerned with business continuity and continuous
availability of data. What infrastructures can provide these assurances? In
this post I want to focus on yet another option, and that is the Real-Time
Data Integration model. As an example I am going to discuss Oracle GoldenGate,
which permits you to manage the data critical to your business in safety,
ensuring business continuity without disruption even if the data is
distributed among multiple, heterogeneou</p><p>6 0.067715712 <a title="25-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-03-03-The_%E2%80%9CFour_Hamiltons%E2%80%9D_Framework_for_Mitigating_Faults_in_the_Cloud%3A_Avoid_it%2C_Mask_it%2C_Bound_it%2C_Fix_it_Fast.html">1604 high scalability-2014-03-03-The “Four Hamiltons” Framework for Mitigating Faults in the Cloud: Avoid it, Mask it, Bound it, Fix it Fast</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From their website:DRBDis a block device which is designed to build high
availability clusters. This is done by mirroring a whole block device via (a
dedicated) network. You could see it as a network raid-1.DRBD takes over the
data, writes it to the local disk and sends it to the other host. On the other
host, it takes it to the disk there.breakThe other components needed are a
cluster membership service, which is supposed to be heartbeat, and some kind
of application that works on top of a block device.Examples:A filesystem &
fsck.A journaling FS.A database with recovery capabilities.Each device (DRBD
provides more than one of these devices) has a state, which can be 'primary'
or 'secondary'. On the node with the primary device the application is
supposed to run and to access the device (/dev/drbdX). Every write is sent to
the local 'lower level block device' and to the node with the device in
'secondary' state. The secondary device simply writes the data to its lower
level block devi</p><p>3 0.63144165 <a title="25-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-25-Product%3A_NetApp_MetroCluster_Software.html">28 high scalability-2007-07-25-Product: NetApp MetroCluster Software</a></p>

<p>Introduction: RAMCube is a datacenter oriented design for RAM-based key-value store that
supports thousands or tens of thousands of servers to offer up to hundreds of
terabytes of RAM storage. Here's thePDF Paper describing the system and here's
avideo of the presentationgiven atHotCloud.The big idea is: RAMCube exploits
the proximity of a BCube network to construct a symmetric MultiRing structure,
restricting all failure detection and recovery trafﬁc within a one-hop
neighborhood, which addresses problems including false failure detection and
recovery trafﬁc congestion. In addition, RAMCube leverages BCube's multiple
paths between any pairs of servers to handle switch failures.A few notes:75%
of Facebook data is stored in memcache.RAM is 1000 time faster than diskRAM is
used in caches, but this increases application complexity as applications are
responsible for cache consistency.Under a high work load a 1% cache miss rate
can lead to a 10x performance penalty.So store data directly in RAM instead</p><p>5 0.6090458 <a title="25-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-15-Lustre_cluster_file_system.html">13 high scalability-2007-07-15-Lustre cluster file system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lustre速is a scalable, secure, robust, highly-available cluster file system. It
is designed, developed and maintained by Cluster File Systems, Inc.The central
goal is the development of a next-generation cluster file system which can
serve clusters with 10,000's of nodes, provide petabytes of storage, and move
100's of GB/sec with state-of-the-art security and management
infrastructure.Lustre runs on many of the largest Linux clusters in the world,
and is included by CFS's partners as a core component of their cluster
offering (examples include HP StorageWorks SFS, and the Cray XT3 and XD1
supercomputers). Today's users have also demonstrated that Lustre scales down
as well as it scales up, and runs in production on clusters as small as 4 and
as large as 25,000 nodes.The latest version of Lustre is always available from
Cluster File Systems, Inc. Public Open Source releases of Lustre are available
under the GNU General Public License. These releases are found here, and are

profiling tool and learn it in and out. Dev-ops cooperation is essential.The
most critical difference in organizations that handles crises well.Test on
production data.Code behavior (especially performance) is often data
driven.Track and trend.Understanding your historical performance
characteristics is essential for spotting emerging problems.Assumptions will
burn you.Systems are complex and often break in unexpected
ways.Decouple.Isolate performance failures.Cache.Caching is the core of most
optimizations.Federate.Data federation is taking a single data set and
spreading it across multiple database/application
servers.Replicate.Replication is making synchronized copies of data available
in more than one place.Avoid straining hard-to-scale resources.Some resources
are inherently hard to scale: Uncacheable' data, Data with a very high
read+write rate, Non-federatable data, Data in a black-boxUse a compiler

<p>Introduction: Wikipedia andWikimediahave some of the best, most complete real-world
documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas
Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an
overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid,
lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN, how
caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how
they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle
load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of
configuration files. This is a really useful resource.Related

<p>Introduction: Sun FireTM X4540 Server as Backup Server for Zmanda's Amanda Enterprise 2.6
Softwareby Thomas Hanvey (Sun Microsystems) and Dmitri Joukovski and Ken
Crandall (Zmanda)September, 2008Explosive data growth, combined with demanding
requirements for data availability, has placed a tremendous burden on IT
operations staff at businesses of all sizes. Yet, many organizations do not
have the staff or budget to purchase and manage complex and expensive backup
and recovery software products.The Sun FireTM X4540 server can deliver massive
storage capacity and remarkable throughput so it is well-suited as a nearline
storage platform for backup and restore applications. Combining the power of
the SolarisTM 10 Operating System with the data integrity and simplified
administration of ZFS, the Sun Fire X4540 server can be an ideal candidate for
streamlining and improving backup and restore operations.Amanda Enterprise
Edition from Zmanda was designed to address these challenges, providing a

<p>Introduction: The BBC's iPlayer site averages 8 million page views a day for 1.3 million
users. Technical Architect Simon Frost describes how they scaled their site
inScaling the BBC iPlayer to handle demand:Use frameworks. Frameworks support
component based development which makes it convenient for team development,
but can introduce delays that have to be minimized. Zend/PHP is used because
it supports components and is easy to recruit for.  MySQL is used for program
metadata. CouchDB is used for key-value access for fast read/write of user-
focused data.Prove architecture before building it. Eliminate guesswork by
coming up with alternate architectures and create prototypes to determine
which option works best. Balance performance with factors like ease of
development.Cache a lot. Data is cached in memcached for a few seconds to
minutes. Short cache invalidation periods keep the data up to date for the
users, but even these short periods make a huge difference in performance.

<p>Introduction: Nobody came up with an example of a website powered by a Websphere product
(which has a community edition) and backed up by a DB2 database.I guess you
all know about usopen.org so here's the story:breakWhile the re-emergence of
35-year-old Andre Agassi and the continued dominance of wunderkind Maria
Sharapova have highlighted the on-court headlines at this year's U.S. Open
Tennis Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., IBM is hoping its new Power5
chip-based IT support for USOpen.org can make news among those more interested
in .NET than tennis nets.Big Blue has partnered with the U.S. Tennis
Association and the U.S. Open -- the most prestigious tennis tournament in the
U.S. -- since 1992. Together, they launched USOpen.org in 1995 so racket heads
could follow the matches online.The iSeries' role this year is in powering a

<p>Introduction: Now that the internet has become defined as a mashup over a collection of
service APIs, we have a little problem: for clients using APIs is a lot like
drinking beer through a straw. You never get as much beer as you want and you
get a headache after. But what if I've been a good boy and deserve a bigger
straw? Maybe we can use game theory to model trust relationships over a life
time of interactions over many different services and then give more
capabilities/beer to those who have earned them?breakLet's say Twitter limits
me to downloading only 20 tweets at a time through their API. But I want more.
I may even want to do something so radical as download all my tweets. Of
course Twitter can't let everyone do that. They would be swamped serving all
this traffic and service would be denied. So Twitter does that rational thing
and limits API access as a means of self protection. As does Google,
Yahoo,Skynet, and everyone else.But when I hit the API limit I think, but hey
it's Todd here, w</p><p>5 0.092913851 <a title="48-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-02-Product%3A_Mashery.html">55 high scalability-2007-08-02-Product: Mashery</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All APIs are different. At its core, an API provides direct access deep into a
web service (lower case - a service that is provided on the web) and turns it
into a Web Service (upper case) that people can use as a building block. What
makes it an API is the infrastructure that sits in front of it, attracts
developers to use it, secures it from misuse and provides the metrics and
management needed to turn an internal web service into a Web Service managed
through an effective distribution channel, and providing strategic and/or
financial benefit.While each API is different, the infrastructure I have
described is consistent across virtually all of them, so it is neither
economical nor effective to reinvent the wheel for each API someone wants to
release. It is similar to the concept of an adserver - all websites have
different content and fucntionality, but the concept of selecting and serving
an ad, tracking it, and targeting it is pretty consistent across sites; as a
result, there are</p><p>6 0.078209408 <a title="48-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-24-4_New_Podcasts_for_Scalable_Summertime_Reading.html">864 high scalability-2010-07-24-4 New Podcasts for Scalable Summertime Reading</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Recently I had to help users on one of my opensource project ISPMan.
http://ispman.netThis project started in 2001 as I was too unwilling to take
care of the DNS and VitualHosting stuff as it was a side-thing to the company
I worked for (so i wrote a software that took care of all these little
details)Summary: A large project that needs a rewrite can be done in a matter
of day.I will not give you a full case study about a project that went through
a re-write but a case study about how easy it is to re-write
something.breakDetails:My boss was cool enough to let me open-source the
project and obviously, I got a lot of cool-cred out of it.Later on I also did
some support and implementation and earned quiet some money with it.Eventually
I had to let the project go out of my hand to the community as I only did it
to facilitate a job that wasnt williing to do. (Setup DNS zones of multiple

section there, find out which m</p><p>4 0.56673586 <a title="48-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster_Lost_Lead_Because_of_a_Failure_to_Scale.html">153 high scalability-2007-11-13-Friendster Lost Lead Because of a Failure to Scale</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey, this scaling stuff might just be important. Jim Scheinman, former Bebo
and Friendster exec, puts the blame squarely on Friendster's inability to
scale as why they lost the social networking race:VB: Can you tell me a bit
about what you learned in your time at Friendster? JS:For me, it basically
came down to failed execution on the technology side -- we had millions of
Friendster members begging us to get the site working faster so they could log
in and spend hours social networking with their friends. I remember coming in
to the office for months reading thousands of customer service emails telling
us that if we didn't get our site working better soon, they'd be 'forced to
join' a new social networking site that had just launched called MySpaceâ&euro;Śthe
rest is history. To be fair to Friendster's technology team at the time, they
were on the forefront of many new scaling and database issues that web sites
simply hadn't had to deal with prior to Friendster. As is often the case, the

<p>Introduction: This guest post is written byJosh Fraser, co-founder and CEO ofTorbit. Torbit
creates tools for measuring, analyzing and optimizing web performance.  Did
you know that 5% of the pageviews on Walmart.com take over 20 seconds to load?
Walmart discovered this recently after adding real user measurement (RUM) to
analyze their web performance for every single visitor to their site. Walmart
used JavaScript to measure their median load time as well as key metrics like
their 95th percentile. While 20 seconds is a long time to wait for a website
to load,the Walmart storyis actually not that uncommon. Remember, this is the
worst 5% of their pageviews, not the typical experience.Walmart's median load
time was reported at around 4 seconds, meaning half of their visitors loaded
Walmart.com faster than 4 seconds and the other half took longer than 4
seconds to load. Using this knowledge, Walmart was prepared to act. By
reducing page load times by even one second, Walmart found that they would

<p>Introduction: This is an interesting and still relevant research paper by Jim Gray, Prashant
Shenoy at Microsoft Research that examines the rules of thumb for the design
of data storage systems. It looks at storage, processing, and networking
costs, ratios, and trends with a particular focus on performance and
price/performance.Jim Gray has an updated presentation on this interesting
topic:Long Term Storage Trends and You. Robin Harris has a great post that
reflects on the Rules of Thumb whitepaper on his StorageMojo blog:Architecting

<p>Introduction: Bees have a similar problem to website servers: how to do a lot of work with
limited resources in an ever changing environment. Usually lessons from
biology are hard to apply to computer problems. Nature throws hardware at
problems. Billions and billions of cells cooperate at different levels of
organizations to find food, fight lions, and make sure your DNA is passed
on.Nature's software is "simple," but her hardware rocks. We do the opposite.
For us hardware is in short supply so we use limited hardware and leverage
"smart" software to work around our inability to throw hardware at problems.
But we might be able to borrow some load balancing techniques from bees. What
do bees do that we can learn from?Bees do a dance to indicate the quality and
location of a nectar source. When a bee finds a better source they do a better
dance and resources shift to the new location. This approach may seem
inefficient, but it turns out to be "optimal for the unpredictable nectar
world." Craig Tovey</p><p>5 0.57979238 <a title="48-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-26-Strategy%3A_Caching_404s_Saved_the_Onion_66%25_on_Server_Time.html">800 high scalability-2010-03-26-Strategy: Caching 404s Saved the Onion 66% on Server Time</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the articleThe Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us, a lot of
interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from
Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and
work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn
in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting
the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-
in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer
specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed
development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and
reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5 second procedure;
capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git
for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem;
memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10
minutes; videos, articl</p><p>6 0.56862307 <a title="48-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-11-30-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_November_30%2C_2012.html">1365 high scalability-2012-11-30-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For November 30, 2012</a></p>

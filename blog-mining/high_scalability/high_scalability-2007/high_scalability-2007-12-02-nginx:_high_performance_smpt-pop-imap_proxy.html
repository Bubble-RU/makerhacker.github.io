<p>Introduction: Given S3's  recent failure  ( Cloud Status  tells the tale)  Kevin Burton  makes the  excellent suggestion of  fronting S3  with a  caching proxy server .   A caching proxy server  can reply to service requests without contacting the specified server, by retrieving content saved from a previous request, made by the same client or even other clients. This is called caching. Caching proxies keep local copies of frequently requested resources.  In normal operation when an asset (a user's avatar, for example) is requested the cache is tried first. If the asset is found in the cache then it's returned. If the asset is not in the cache it's retrieved from S3 (or wherever) and cached. So when S3 goes down it's likely you can ride out the down time by serving assets out of the cache.   This strategy only works when using S3 as a  CDN . If you are using S3 for its "real" purpose, as a storage service, then a caching proxy can't help you...

<p>Introduction: Skype  uses PostgreSQL as their backend database . PostgreSQL doesn't get enough run in the database world so I was excited to see how PostgreSQL is used "as the main DB for most of [Skype's] business needs." Their approach is to use a traditional stored procedure interface for accessing data and on top of that layer proxy servers which hash SQL requests to a set of database servers that actually carry out queries. The result is a horizontally partitioned system that they think will scale to handle 1 billion users.
   Skype's goal is an architecture that can handle 1 billion plus users. This level of scale isn't practically solvable with one really big computer,  so our masked superhero horizontal scaling comes to the rescue.    Hardware is dual or quad Opterons with SCSI RAID.    Followed common database progression: Start with one DB. Add new databases partitioned by functionality. Replicate read-mostly data for better read access. Then horizontally partition data across multiple nod</p><p>5 0.12983303 <a title="172-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-Sun%27s_High-Performance_and_Reliable_Web_Proxy_Solution.html">456 high scalability-2008-12-01-Sun's High-Performance and Reliable Web Proxy Solution</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As individuals and businesses depend on the Web more than ever to conduct business, rapid and reliable content retrieval is critical. Reducing wait time improves productivity and increases user satisfaction. Web proxy technology has emerged as an effective solution to improve performance, help ensure content availability and enhance network security by caching and filtering Web content. The combination of Sun SPARC Enterprise servers with CoolThreads technology and the Sun Java System Web Proxy Server software provides a compelling foundation for a robust Web proxy solution. Sun SPARC Enterprise T1000 and T2000 servers include the UltraSPARC T1 processor with CoolThreads technology, offering six or eight cores with four threads per core.

<p>Introduction: For some special reason, I'm trying to make a web server able to get all the DNS names mapped to its IP. Let me explain more, I'm creating a website that will run in a web farm, every web server in the farm will have some subdomains mapped to its ip, what I want is that whenever my application starts on a web server is to be able to get all the subdomains mapped/assigned to that server, e.g. sub1.mydomain.com, sub2.mydomain.com. I understand that I have to use reverse dns lookup (i.e. give the IP get the domain name), but I also want to get all the subdomains not just the first one that maps to that IP. I've been reading about DNS on the internet but I don't seem to find any information on how to achieve what I want, normally you use dns to get the ip of a domain but I'm not sure that all servers enable reverse lookup.     The problem is that I'm still not sure whether I'll host my own DNS server or use the services of some company (many companies offer DNS hosting services), so, my qu</p><p>4 0.56065696 <a title="172-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-23-Product%3A_Varnish.html">74 high scalability-2007-08-23-Product: Varnish</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Varnish  is a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator. Varnish is targeted primarily at the FreeBSD 6 and Linux 2.6 platforms, and will take full advantage of the virtual memory system and advanced I/O features offered by these operating systems.  Varnish was written from the ground up to be a high performance caching reverse proxy. Squid is a forward proxy that can be configured as a reverse proxy. Besides - Squid is rather old and designed like computer programs where supposed to be designed in 1980.  Varnish is reported to be 10x-20x faster than Squid on the same hardware.</p><p>5 0.55235642 <a title="172-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-28-Product%3A_ISPMan_Centralized_ISP_Management_System_.html">228 high scalability-2008-01-28-Product: ISPMan Centralized ISP Management System </a></p>
<p>Introduction: From  FRESH Ports  and their website:    ISPman  is an ISP management software written in perl, using an LDAP backend to manage virtual hosts for an ISP.  It can be used to manage, DNS, virtual hosts for apache config, postfix configuration, cyrus mail boxes, proftpd etc.    
 
 ISPMan was written as a management tool for the network at 4unet where between 30 to 50 domains are hosted and the number is crazily growing. Managing these domains and their users was a little time consuming, and needed an Administrator who knows linux and these daemons fluently.  Now the help-desk can easily manage the domains and users.  LDAP data can be easily replicated site wide, and mail box server can be scaled from 1 to n as required.  An LDAP entry called maildrop tells the SMTP server (postfix) where to deliver the mail.  The SMTP servers can be loadbalanced with one of many load balancing techniques.  The program is written with scalability and High availability in mind.

<p>Introduction: nginx is a high performance smtp/pop/imap proxy that lets you do custom authorization and lookups and is very scalable. (just add nodes)     Nginx by default is a reverse proxy and this is what it is doing here for pop/imap connections. It is also an excellelent reverse proxy for web servers.     Advantage: You dont have to have a speacial database or ldap schema. Just an url to  do auth and lookup with.   A url that may be accessed by a unix or a tcp socket. Write your own auth handler - according to your own policy.     For example:    A user called atif tries to login with the pass testxyz.   You pass this infomation to a URL such as   socket:/var/tmp/xyz.sock   or   http://auth.corp.mailserver.net:someport/someurl     The auth server replies with either a FAILURE such as      Auth-Status: Invalid Login or password     or with a success such as   Auth-Status: OK   Auth-Server: OneOfThe100Servers   Auth-Port: optionalyAPort     We have implemented it at our ISP and it has saves us a</p><p>2 0.66020334 <a title="172-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-12-31-Facebook_in_20_Minutes%3A_2.7M_Photos%2C_10.2M_Comments%2C_4.6M_Messages.html">966 high scalability-2010-12-31-Facebook in 20 Minutes: 2.7M Photos, 10.2M Comments, 4.6M Messages</a></p>
<p>Introduction: To celebrate the new year Facebook has  shared the results  of a little end of the year introspection. It has been a fecund year for Facebook:
  
 43,869,800 changed their status to single 
 3,025,791 changed their status to "it's complicated" 
 28,460,516 changed their status to in a relationship 
 5,974,574 changed their status to engaged 
 36,774,801 changes their status to married 
  
If these numbers are simply to large to grasp, it doesn't get any better when you look at happens in a mere 20 minutes:
  
 Shared links: 1,000,000

<p>Introduction: Update:   MapReduce and PageRank Notes from Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau's Fall 2008 class  . Collects interesting facts about MapReduce and PageRank. For example, the history of the solution to searching for the term "flu" is traced through multiple generations of technology.   With Google entering the cloud space with  Google AppEngine  and a maturing  Hadoop  product, the MapReduce scaling approach might finally become a standard programmer practice. This is the best paper on the subject and is an excellent primer on a content-addressable memory future.  Some interesting stats from the paper: Google executes 100k MapReduce jobs each day; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day; more than 10k MapReduce programs have been implemented; machines are dual processor with gigabit ethernet and 4-8 GB of memory.  One common criticism ex-Googlers have is that it takes months to get up and be productive in the Google environment. Hopefully a way will be found to lower the learning curve a</p><p>4 0.45405111 <a title="172-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-19-The_cost_of_High_Availability_%28HA%29_with_Oracle_.html">813 high scalability-2010-04-19-The cost of High Availability (HA) with Oracle </a></p>
<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000 or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.
 
This post focuses on a customer’s backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services and annual support?

<p>Introduction: Constructing a scalable  risk analysis  solution is a fascinating architectural challenge. If you come from Financial Services you are sure to appreciate that. But even architects from other domains are bound to find the challenges fascinating, and the architectural patterns of my suggested solution highly useful in other domains.
 
Recently I held an interesting webinar  around architecting solutions for scalable and near-real-time   risk analysis   solutions based on experience gathered with Financial Services customers. Seeing the vast interest in the webinar, I would like to share the highlights with you here. 
 
 From an architectural point of view, risk analysis is a data-intensive and a compute-intensive process, which also has an elaborate orchestration logic. volumes in this domain are massive and ever-increasing, together with an ever-increasing demand to reduce response time. These trends are aggravated by   global financial regulatory reforms   set following the late-2000s</p><p>6 0.4386473 <a title="172-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-22-It%27s_the_Fraking_IOPS_-_1_SSD_is_44%2C000_IOPS%2C_Hard_Drive_is_180.html">1066 high scalability-2011-06-22-It's the Fraking IOPS - 1 SSD is 44,000 IOPS, Hard Drive is 180</a></p>

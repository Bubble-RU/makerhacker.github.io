<p>Introduction: Hi,First of all I want to to say that this is an extremely interesting and
informative website. i have enjoyed reading the various posts on how the big
sites scale to meet the needs of their customers.The service we are developing
is a webcam service. The client application sends images to the server via
HTTP POST and they are saved in folder specified by the users id. When a new
image is sent to the server it will overwrite the current image.Users can then
view the images via our web server.Ideally we want the images to upload as
quickly as possible and allow users to view them as quickly as possible.Would
I be correct to assume that when the number of uploading clients exceeds the
capability of the server the only way to scale is to add more hardware.Also I
assume that to use HTTP accelerator caches will not speed up viewing the
images as the new images will invalidate the cache.I appreciate any input on
the subject.</p><p>3 0.18157046 <a title="5-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-22-Wikimedia_architecture.html">72 high scalability-2007-08-22-Wikimedia architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things).
That's why scaling Facebook is hardsays Jeff Rothschild, Vice President of
Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and
Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why
would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional
web sites? Let's find out.Traditional websites are easier to scale than social
networking sites for two reasons:They usually access only their own data and
common cached data.Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one
time.Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your
profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the
website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around
single records usingdistributed hashing schemes. And since only a few percent
of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little RAM cache
to handle a</p><p>5 0.17481293 <a title="5-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets_to_Fotolog%27s_Scaling_Success.html">106 high scalability-2007-10-02-Secrets to Fotolog's Scaling Success</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Fotolog, a social blogging site centered around photos, grew from about 300
thousand users in 2004 to over 11 million users in 2007. Though they initially
experienced the inevitable pains of rapid growth, they overcame their problems
and now manage over 300 million photos and 800,000 new photos are added each
day. Generating all that fabulous content are 20 million unique monthly
visitors and a volunteer army of 30,000 new users each day. They did so well a
very impressed suitor bought them out for a cool $90 million. That's scale
meets success by anyone standards. How did they do it?Site:

<p>Introduction: By John Engales CTO, Rackspace. Good presentation of the stages a typical
successful website goes through:Stage 1 - The Beginning: Simple architecture,
low complexity. no redundancy. Firewall, load balancer, a pair of web servers,
database server, and internal storage.Stage 2 - More of the same, just
bigger.Stage 3 - The Pain Begins: publicity hits. Use reverse proxy, cache
static content, load balancers, more databases, re-coding.Stage 4 - The Pain
Intensifies: caching with memcached, writes overload and replication takes too
long, start database partitioning, shared storage makes sense for content,
significant re-architecting for DB.Stage 5 - This Really Hurts!: rethink
entire application, partition on geography user ID, etc, create user clusters,
using hashing scheme for locating which user belongs to which cluster.Stage 6
- Getting a little less painful: scalable application and database
architecture, acceptable performance, starting to add ne features again,

<p>Introduction: Skypeuses PostgreSQL as their backend database. PostgreSQL doesn't get enough
run in the database world so I was excited to see how PostgreSQL is used "as
the main DB for most of [Skype's] business needs." Their approach is to use a
traditional stored procedure interface for accessing data and on top of that
layer proxy servers which hash SQL requests to a set of database servers that
actually carry out queries. The result is a horizontally partitioned system
that they think will scale to handle 1 billion users.Skype's goal is an
architecture that can handle 1 billion plus users. This level of scale isn't
practically solvable with one really big computer, so our masked superhero
horizontal scaling comes to the rescue.Hardware is dual or quad Opterons with
SCSI RAID.Followed common database progression: Start with one DB. Add new
databases partitioned by functionality. Replicate read-mostly data for better
read access. Then horizontally partition data across multiple nodes..In a

<p>Introduction: The BBC's iPlayer site averages 8 million page views a day for 1.3 million
users. Technical Architect Simon Frost describes how they scaled their site
inScaling the BBC iPlayer to handle demand:Use frameworks. Frameworks support
component based development which makes it convenient for team development,
but can introduce delays that have to be minimized. Zend/PHP is used because
it supports components and is easy to recruit for.  MySQL is used for program
metadata. CouchDB is used for key-value access for fast read/write of user-
focused data.Prove architecture before building it. Eliminate guesswork by
coming up with alternate architectures and create prototypes to determine
which option works best. Balance performance with factors like ease of
development.Cache a lot. Data is cached in memcached for a few seconds to
minutes. Short cache invalidation periods keep the data up to date for the
users, but even these short periods make a huge difference in performance.

<p>Introduction: Snoozeis an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient virtual
machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly to other VM
management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it
allows to build compute infrastructures from virtualized resources.
Particularly, once installed and configured users can submit and control the
life-cycle of a large number of VMs. However, contrary to existing frameworks
for scalability and fault tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and
healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical architecture. Moreover, it
performs distributed VM management and is designed to be energy efficient.
Therefore, it implements features to monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU,
memory, network Rx, network Tx) demands, detect and resolve overload/underload
situations, perform dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and
finally power management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a
generic scheduler</p><p>5 0.94617116 <a title="5-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-04-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_February_4%2C_2010.html">771 high scalability-2010-02-04-Hot Scalability Links for February 4, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lots of cool stuff happening this week...Voldemort gets rebalancing.It's one
thing to shard data to scale, it's a completely different level of
functionality to manage those shards intelligently. Voldemort has stepped up
by adding advanced rebalancing functionality: Dynamic addition of new nodes to
the cluster; Deletion of nodes from cluster; Load balancing of data inside a
cluster.Microsoft Finally Opens Azure for Business.Out of the blue Microsoft
opens up their platform as a service service. Good to have more competition
and we'll keep an eye out for experience reports.New details on LinkedIn
architectureby Greg Linden.LinkedIn appears to only use caching minimally,
preferring to spend their efforts and machine resources on making sure they
can recompute computations quickly than on hiding poor performance behind

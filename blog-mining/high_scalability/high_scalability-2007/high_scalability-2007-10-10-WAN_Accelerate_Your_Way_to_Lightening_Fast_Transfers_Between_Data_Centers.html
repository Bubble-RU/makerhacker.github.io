<p>Introduction: Cloud-based services for all things digital will either drive - or die by -
bandwidthConsumers, by definition, consume. In the realm of the Internet, they
consume far more than they produce. Or so it's been in the past. Broadband
connectivity across all providers have long offered asymmetric network feeds
because it mirrored reality: an HTTP request is significantly smaller than its
corresponding response, and in general web-based activity is heavily biased
toward fat download and thin upload speeds. The term "broadband" is really a
misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very
narrowband of a typical consumer's upload speed.cloud computing, or to be more
accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the
status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing
all things digital "in the cloud", network providers must consider the impact

<p>Introduction: Georeplication is one of the standard techniques for dealing when bad things--
failure and latency--happen to good systems. The problem is always: how do you
do that? Murat Demirbas, Associate Professor at SUNY Buffalo, has a couple of
really good posts that can help:MDCC: Multi-Data Center Consistency andMaking
Geo-Replicated Systems Fast as Possible, Consistent when Necessary. In MDCC:
Multi-Data Center Consistency Murat discusses a paper that says synchronous
wide-area replication can be feasible. There's a quick and clear explanation
of Paxos and various optimizations that is worth the price of admission. We
find that strong consistency doesn't have to be lost across a WAN:The good
thing about using Paxos over the WAN is you /almost/ get the full CAP  (all
three properties: consistency, availability, and partition-freedom). As we
discussed earlier (Paxos taught), Paxos is CP, that is, in the presence of a
partition, Paxos keeps consistency over availability. But, Paxos can still

<p>Introduction: Update:VcubeV- an OpenVPN-based solution designed to build and operate a
multisourced infrastructure.True high availability requires a presence in
multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation
like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys
can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers. Cloud
computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling
the playing field. Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk
by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost, Mosso and other
providers.The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk
amongst the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy

misnomer, as it focuses only on the download speed and ignores the very
narrowband of a typical consumer's upload speed.cloud computing, or to be more
accurate, cloud-hosted services aimed at consumers may very well change the
status quo by necessity. As providers continue to push the notion of storing
all things digital "in the cloud", network providers must consider the impact
on them - and the satisfaction of their customer base with performance over

<p>Introduction: How do you keep in sync a crescendo of data between data centers over a slow
WAN? That's the questionAlbertoposted a few weeks ago. Normally I'm not into
all boy bands, but I was frustrated there wasn't a really good answer for his
problem. It occurred to me later a WAN accelerator might help turn his slow
WAN link into more of a LAN, so the overhead of copying files across the WAN
wouldn't be so limiting. Many might not consider a WAN accelerator in this
situation, but since my friend Damon Ennis works at the WAN accelerator
vendorSilver Peak, I thought I would ask him if their product would help. Not
surprisingly his answer is yes! Potentially a lot, depending on the nature of
your data. Here's a no BS overview of their product:breakWhat is it?- Scalable
WAN Accelerator from Silver Peak (http://www.silver-peak.com)What does it do?-
You can send 5x-100x times more data across your expensive, low-bandwidth WAN

we moved to a cluster of six quad core Xeons with 8GB RAM for webheads that
all boot off a central NFS (Network File System) root, with the capability of
adding more webheads as needed," . They also "added two 16GB eight-core Xeons
and a 6Ă&mdash;73GB RAID-10 array for database files running a MySQL master/slave

<p>Introduction: Over the years I've read a lot of research papers looking for better ways of
doing things. Sometimes I find ideas I can use, but more often than not I come
up empty. The problem is there are very few good papers. And by good I mean:
can a reasonably intelligent person read a paper and turn it into something
useful? Now, clearly I'm not an academic and clearly I'm no genius, I'm just
an everyday programmer searching for leverage, and as a common specimen of the
species I've often thought how much better our industry would be if we could
simply move research from academia into production with some sort of self-
conscious professionalism. Currently the process is horribly hit or miss. And
this problem extends equally to companies with research divisions that often
do very little to help front-line developers succeed. How many ideas break out
of academia into industry in computer science? We have many brilliant
examples: encryption, microprocessors, compression, transactions, distributed

<p>Introduction: Update:VcubeV- an OpenVPN-based solution designed to build and operate a
multisourced infrastructure.True high availability requires a presence in
multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation
like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys
can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers. Cloud
computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling
the playing field. Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk
by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost, Mosso and other
providers.The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk
amongst the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy
Samovskiy in his Linux Journal article titledBuilding aMultisourced
Infrastructure Using OpenVPN.breakDmitriy's idea is to create a secure UDP
tunnel between different data centers over public internet links so your

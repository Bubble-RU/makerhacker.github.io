<p>Introduction: Update 2:EBay's Randy Shoup spills the secrets of how to service hundreds of
millions of users and over two billion page views a day in ScalabilityBest
Practices: Lessons from eBayon InfoQ. The practices: Partition by Function,
Split Horizontally, Avoid Distributed Transactions, Decouple Functions
Asynchronously, Move Processing To Asynchronous Flows, Virtualize At All
Levels, Cache Appropriately.Update:eBay Serves 5 Billion API Calls Each Month.
Aren't we seeing more and more traffic driven by mashups composed on top of
open APIs? APIs are no longer a bolt on, they are your application.
Architecturally that argues for implementing your own application around the
same APIs developers and users employ.Who hasn't wondered how eBay does their
business? As one of the largest most loaded websites in the world, it can't be
easy. And the subtitle of the presentation hints at how creating such a
monster system requires true engineering: Striking a balance between site

<p>Introduction: Unlike Theo Schlossnagle, author ofScalable Internet Architectures, I am not a
stickler for semantics because I have an unswerving faith in the ultimate
unknowability of the world as experienced by others. That's why it is Theo who
bravely tackles the differences in his informative blog postPartitioning vs.
Federation vs. Sharding. Royans Tharakan also talks about it on hisblog.Is
there a difference and does it really matter to all our intrepid scalable
website builders?breakGenerally whatever Theo says is probably close to the
truth. Yet, in my mind I think of partitioning as abasic level categoryand
federation and sharding as more specific (subordinate) instances of
partitioning. And partitioning is a more specific instance of the more more
general (superordinate) category divide-and-conquer. Which isn't a useful way
to think about the topic at all.So, let's say federation is like Star Trek.

<p>Introduction: Surgeis a conference put on by OmniTI targeting practical Scalability matters.
OmniTI specializes in helping people solve their scalability problems, as is
only natural, as it was founded by Theo Schlossnagle, author of the
canonicalScalable Internet Architectures. Now that Surge 2011 is on the
horizon, they've generously made available nearly all thevideos from the Surge
2010conference.  A pattern hopefully every conference will follow (only don't
wait a year please). We lose a lot of collective wisdom from events not being
available online in a timely manner.In truth, nearlyall the talksare on topic
and are worth watching, but here are a few that seem especially relevant:Going

<p>Introduction: As a developer, you are aware of the increasing concern amongst developers and
site architects that websites be able to handle the vast number of visitors
that flood the Internet on a daily basis. Scalable Internet Architecture
addresses these concerns by teaching you both good and bad design
methodologies for building new sites and how to scale existing websites to
robust, high-availability websites. Primarily example-based, the book
discusses major topics in web architectural design, presenting existing
solutions and how they work. Technology budget tight? This book will work for
you, too, as it introduces new and innovative concepts to solving
traditionally expensive problems without a large technology budget. Using open
source and proprietary examples, you will be engaged in best practice design
methodologies for building new sites, as well as appropriately scaling both
growing and shrinking sites. Website development help has arrived in the form
of Scalable Internet Architecture.</p><p>6 0.68010229 <a title="94-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-10-Blog%3A_Scalable_Web_Architectures_by_Royans_Tharakan.html">88 high scalability-2007-09-10-Blog: Scalable Web Architectures by Royans Tharakan</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Just thought I'd drop a brief suggestion to anyone building a large mail
system. Our solution for scaling mail pickup was to develop a sharded
architecture whereby accounts are spread across a cluster of servers, each
with imap/pop3 capability. Then we use a cluster of reverse proxies
(Perdition) speaking to the backend imap/pop3 servers . The benefit of this
approach is you can use simply use round-robin or HA loadbalancing on the
perdition servers that end users connect to (e.g. admins can easily move
accounts around on the backend storage servers without affecting end users).
Perdition manages routing users to the appropriate backend servers and has
MySQL support. What we also liked about this approach was that it had no
dependency on a distributed or networked filesystem, so less chance of
corruption or data consistency issues. When an individual server reaches
capacity, we just off load users to a less used server. If any server goes
offline, it only affects the fraction of users</p><p>2 0.8421452 <a title="94-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling_IMAP_and_POP3.html">81 high scalability-2007-09-06-Scaling IMAP and POP3</a></p>

we use a cluster of reverse proxies (Perdition) speaking to the backend
imap/pop3 servers .The benefit of this approach is you can use simply use
round-robin or HA load balancing on the perdition servers that end users
connect to (e.g. admins can easily move accounts around on the backend storage
servers without affecting end users). Perdition manages routing users to the
appropriate backend servers and has MySQL support.What we also liked about
this approach was that it had no dependency on a distributed or networked file
system, so less chance of corruption or data consistency issues. When an
individual server reaches capacity, we just off load users to a less used
server. If an</p><p>same-blog 3 0.83314204 <a title="94-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-17-Blog%3A_Adding_Simplicity_by_Dan_Pritchett.html">94 high scalability-2007-09-17-Blog: Adding Simplicity by Dan Pritchett</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Recently I attended a lecture presented by Manik Surtani , JBoss Cache &
Infinispan project lead. The goal of the talk was to provide a technical
overview of both products and outline Infinispan's road-map. Infinispan is the
successor to the open-source JBoss Cache. JBoss Cache was originally targeted
at simple web page caching and Infinispan builds on this to take it into the
Cloud paradigm.Why did I attend? Well, over the past few years I have worked
on projects that have used commercial distributed caching (aka data grid)
technologies such as GemFire, GigaSpaces XAP or Oracle Coherence . These
projects required more functionality than is currently provided by open-source
solutions such as memcached or EHCache. Looking at the road-map for
Infinispan, I was struck by its ambition - will it provide the functionality
that I need?Read more at:http://bigdatamatters.com/bigdatamatters/2009/09

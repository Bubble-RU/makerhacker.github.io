ScalableDecentralized Data DistributionFrom the abstract:Typical algorithms

before it first used;adding or removing components results in either
extensivereorganization of data or load imbalance in the system.We have
developed a family of decentralized algorithms,RUSH (Replication Under
Scalable Hashing), thatmaps replicated objects to a scalable collection of
storageservers or disks. RUSH algorithms distribute objects toservers
according to user-specified server weighting. Whileall RUSH variants support
addition of servers to the system,different variants have different

<p>Introduction: Pomegranateis a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular
storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at
increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support
applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high
concurrency, high throughput, and low latency. Their tests seem to indicate it
works:We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well
for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observedlinearly
increased more than100,000aggregate read and write requests served per second
(RPS). Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V
store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system
API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use.
Every application could use it out of the box.The features of Pomegranate
are:It handles billions of small files efficiently, even in one directory;It

<p>Introduction: SmugMug's CEO & Chief Geek Don MacAskill smugly (hard to resist) gushes over
finally finding, after a long and arduous quest, their "best bang-for-the-buck
storage array." It's theDell MD300. His in-depth explanation of why he prefers
the MD3000 should help anyone with their own painful storage deliberations.
His key points are:breakThe price is right; DAS via SAS, 15 spindles at 15K
rpm each, 512MB of mirrored battery-backed write cache; You can disable read
caching; You can disable read-ahead prefetching; The stripe sizes are
configurable up to 512KB; The controller ignores host-based flush commands by
default; They support an â€˜Enhanced JBODâ€™ mode.His reasoning for the
desirability each option is astute and he even gives you the configuration
options for carrying out the configuration. This is not your average CEO.Don
also speculates that a three tier system using flash (system RAM + flash
storage + RAID disks) is a possible future direction. Unfortunately, flash may
not be the dream</p><p>6 0.56594574 <a title="125-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala_-_P2P_Online_Storage_Cloud.html">368 high scalability-2008-08-17-Wuala - P2P Online Storage Cloud</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hi,I am an owner of an large community website and currently we are having
problems with our database architecture. We are using 2 database servers and
spread tables across them to divide read/writes. We have about 90% reads and
10% writes. We use Memcached on all our webservers to cache as much as we can,
traffic is load balanced between webservers. We have 2 extra servers ready to
put to use!We have looked into a couple of solution so far:Continuent
Uni/Cluster aka Sequoia -> Commercial version way too expensive and Java isn't
as fast as it suppose to be.MySQL Proxy -> We couldn't find any good example
on how to create a master - master with failover scenario.MySQL Clustering ->
Seems to be not mature enough, had a lot of performance issues when we tried
to go online with it.MySQL DRDB HA -> Only good for failover, cannot be
scaled!MySQL Replication -> Well don't get me started ;)So now I turn to you
guys to help me out, I am with my hands in my hair and see the site still
growning a</p><p>3 0.18666673 <a title="102-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc_-_Database_Clustering_via_JDBC.html">151 high scalability-2007-11-12-a8cjdbc - Database Clustering via JDBC</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Practically any software project nowadays could not survive without a database
(DBMS) backend storing all the business data that is vital to you and/or your
customers. When projects grow larger, the amount of data usually grows larger
exponentially. So you start moving the DBMS to a separate server to gain more
speed and capacity. Which is all good and healthy but you do not gain any
extra safety for this business data. You might be backing up your database
once a day so in case the database server crashes you don't lose EVERYTHING,
but how much can you really afford to lose? Well clearly this depends on what
kind of data you are storing. In our case the users of our solutions use our
software products to do their everyday (all day) work. They have "everything"
they need for their business stored in the database we are providing. So is 24
hours of data loss acceptable? No, not really. One hour? Maybe. But what we
really want is a second database running with the EXACT same data. We mos</p><p>4 0.12552378 <a title="102-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-16-Product%3A_lbpool_-_Load_Balancing_JDBC_Pool.html">157 high scalability-2007-11-16-Product: lbpool - Load Balancing JDBC Pool</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From the website:Thelbpool projectprovides a load balancing JDBC driver for
use with DB connection pools. It wraps a normal JDBC driver providing
reconnect semantics in the event of additional hardware availability, partial
system failure, or uneven load distribution. It also evenly distributes all
new connections among slave DB servers in a given pool. Each time connect() is
called it will attempt to use the best server with the least system load.The
biggest scalability issue with large applications that are mostly READ bound
is the number of transactions per second that the disks in your cluster can
handle. You can generally solve this in two ways.1. Buy bigger and faster
disks with expensive RAID controllers.2. Buy CHEAP hardware on CHEAP disks but
lots of machines.We prefer the cheap hardware approach and lbpool allows you
to do this.Even if you *did* manage to use cheap hardware most load balancing
hardware is expensive, requires a redundant balancer (if it were to fail), and

<p>Introduction: People sometimes wonder why Oracle isn't mentioned on this site more. Maybe it
will now asMichael Nygard reportsOracle 11g now does read/write splitting with
theirActive Data Guardproduct. Average replication latency was 1 second and
it's accomplished with standard Oracle JDBC drivers. They see a 250% increase
in transactions per service for read-write service. And a 110% improvement in
tps for read-only service was found. You see a change in hardware architecture
with the new setup. They now recommend using a primary and multiple standby
servers, a single controller per server, and a single set of disks in RAID1.
Previously the recommendation was to have a primary and secondary server with
two controllers per server and a set of mirrored disks per controller. The
changes increase performance, availability, and hardware utilization. They
also have a useful looking best practices document for High Availability
calledMaximum Availability Architecture (MAA).</p><p>6 0.10487588 <a title="102-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-17-Five_Misconceptions_on_Cloud_Portability.html">1144 high scalability-2011-11-17-Five Misconceptions on Cloud Portability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Searching around the HS website I noticed that there are no articles regarding
db2, which has an express edition, free of charge and from what I know there
aren't any restrictions.Being a powerful database system I thought it could
make be an alternative to MySQL, PostgreSQL databases.Here is the IBM
statement:"DB2 Express Edition for Community (DB2 Express-C) is a no charge
data server for use in development and deployment. DB2 Express-C supports a
full range of APIs, drivers, and interfaces for application development
including PHP, C/C++, and .NET. In addition, DB2 Express-C V9 contains
advanced XML features. DB2 Express-C provides ISVs an ideal starting database
server for Web, enterprise, and eBusiness applications.This IBM Redbook
provides fundamentals of DB2 application development with DB2 Express-C. It
covers the DB2 Express-C installation and configuration for application
development and skills and techniques for building DB2 applications with XML,

<p>Introduction: This scalability strategy is brought to you by Erik Osterman:My
recommendations for anyone dealing with explosive growth on a limited budget
with lots of cachable content (e.g. content capable of returning valid
expiration headers) is employ areverse proxyas mentioned in this article.In
the last week, we had a site get AP'd, triggering 100K unique visitors to a
single IIS server in under 5 hours. It took out the IIS server. Placing a
single squid infront of the server handled the entire onslaught with a max
server load of 0.10 on a modest Intel IV 3Ghz.It's trivial to implement for
anyone interested...</p><p>3 0.95008546 <a title="102-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing_Memcached_application.html">191 high scalability-2007-12-23-Synchronizing Memcached application</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sequoiais a transparent middleware solution offering clustering, load
balancing and failover services for any database. Sequoia is the continuation
of the C-JDBC project. The database is distributed and replicated among
several nodes and Sequoia balances the queries among these nodes. Sequoia
handles node and network failures with transparent failover. It also provides
support for hot recovery, online maintenance operations and online
upgrades.Features in a nutshellNo modification of existing applications or
databases.Operational with any database providing a JDBC driver.High
availability provided by advanced RAIDb technology.Transparent failover and
recovery capabilities.Performance scalability with unique load balancing and
query result caching features.Integrated JMX-based administration and
monitoring.100% Java implementation allowing portability across platforms with
a JRE 1.4 or greater.Open source licensed under Apache v2 license.Professional

<p>Introduction: If you are trying to create highly available file systems, especially across
data centers, then ChironFS is one potential solution. It's relatively new, so
there aren't lots of experience reports, but it looks worth considering. What
isChironFSand how does it work?Adapted from the ChironFS website:The Chiron
Filesystem is a Fuse based filesystem that frees you from single points of
failure. It's main purpose is to guarantee filesystem availability using
replication. But it isn't a RAID implementation. RAID replicates DEVICES not
FILESYSTEMS.Why not just use RAID over some network block device? Because it
is a block device and if one server mounts that device in RW mode, no other
server will be able to mount it in RW mode. Any real network may have many
servers and offer a variety of services. Keeping everything running can become
a real nightmare!</p><p>6 0.89501065 <a title="102-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-03-100_Node_Hazelcast_cluster_on_Amazon_EC2.html">820 high scalability-2010-05-03-100 Node Hazelcast cluster on Amazon EC2</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Most every programmer who gets sucked into deep performance analysis for long running processes eventually realizes memory allocation is the heart of evil at the center of many of their problems. So you replace malloc with something less worse. Or you tune your garbage collector like a fineÂ ukulele. But there's a smarter approach brought to you from the folks at  RAMCloud , a Stanford University production, which is a large scale, distributed, in-memory key-value database.
 
What they've found is that typical memory management approaches don't work and using a log structured approach yields massive benefits:
  

Performance measurements of log-structured memory in RAMCloud show that it enables high client through- put at 80-90% memory utilization, even with artificially stressful workloads. In the most stressful workload, a single RAMCloud server can support 270,000-410,000 durable 100-byte writes per second at 90% memory utilization.

<p>Introduction: We are on the edge of two potent technological changes: Clouds and Memory Based Architectures. This evolution will rip open a chasm where new players can enter and prosper. Google is the master of disk. You can't beat them at a game they perfected. Disk based databases like SimpleDB and BigTable are complicated beasts, typical last gasp products of any aging technology before a change. The next era is the age of Memory and Cloud which will allow for new players to succeed. The tipping point will be soon.   Let's take a short trip down web architecture lane:
  It's 1993: Yahoo runs on FreeBSD, Apache, Perl scripts and a SQL database   It's 1995: Scale-up the database.   It's 1998: LAMP   It's 1999: Stateless + Load Balanced + Database + SAN   It's 2001: In-memory data-grid.   It's 2003: Add a caching layer.   It's 2004: Add scale-out and partitioning.   It's 2005: Add asynchronous job scheduling and maybe a distributed file system.   It's 2007: Move it all into the cloud.

<p>Introduction: Dropbox  saves one million files every 15 minutes,  more tweets than even Twitterers tweet. That mind blowing statistic was revealed by Rian Hunter, a Dropbox Engineer, in his presentation  How Dropbox Did It and How Python Helped  at PyCon 2011.
 
The first part of the presentation is some Dropbox lore, origin stories and other foundational myths. We learn that  Dropbox is a startup company located in San Francisco that has probably one of the most popular file synchronization and sharing tools in the world, shipping Python on the desktop and supporting millions of users and growing every day . 
 
About half way through the talk turns technical. Not a lot of info on how Dropbox handles this massive scale was dropped, but there were a number of good lessons to ponder:
  
  Use Python 
 
 99.9 % of their code is in Python. Used on the server backend; desktop client, website controller logic, API backend, and analytics. 
 Can't use Python on the Android due to memory constraints.

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Greg Luck Founder and CTO,  Ehcache  Terracotta Inc.  Note: this article contains a bit too much of a product pitch, but the points are still generally valid and useful.
 
The legendary Moore’s Law, which  states that the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively  on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years, has  held true since 1965. It follows that integrated circuits will continue  to get smaller, with chip fabrication currently at a minuscule 22nm  process (1). Users of big iron hardware, or servers that  are dense in terms of CPU power and memory capacity, benefit from this  trend as their hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful over time.  At some point soon, however, density limits imposed by quantum mechanics  will preclude further density increases.
 
At the same time, low-cost commodity  hardware influences enterprise architects to scale their applications  horizontally, where processing is spread across clusters of l</p><p>6 0.11844024 <a title="92-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-07-25-Latency_is_Everywhere_and_it_Costs_You_Sales_-_How_to_Crush_it.html">661 high scalability-2009-07-25-Latency is Everywhere and it Costs You Sales - How to Crush it</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's not often you get so enthusiastic a recommendation for a paper as  Sergio Bossa  gives  Memory Barriers: a Hardware View for Software Hackers : If you only want to read one piece about CPUs architecture, cache coherency and memory barriers, make it this one.
 
It is a clear and well written article. It even has a quiz. What's it about?
  

So what possessed CPU designers to cause them to inﬂict memory barriers on poor unsuspecting SMP software designers?


In short, because reordering memory references allows much better performance, and so memory barriers are needed to force ordering in things like synchronization primitives whose correct operation depends on ordered memory references.


Getting a more detailed answer to this question requires a good understanding of how CPU caches work, and especially what is required to make caches really work well. The following sections:

 
 present the structure of a cache, 
 describe how cache-coherency protocols ensure that CPUs agree on t</p><p>4 0.76179802 <a title="92-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-20-8_Ways_Stardog_Made_its_Database_Insanely_Scalable.html">1582 high scalability-2014-01-20-8 Ways Stardog Made its Database Insanely Scalable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Stardog  makes a commercial graph database that is a great example of what can be accomplished with a scale-up strategy on BigIron. In a  recent article  StarDog described how they made their new 2.1 release insanely scalable, improving query scalability by about 3 orders of magnitude and it can now handle 50 billion triples on a $10,000 server with 32 cores and 256 GB RAM. It can also load 20B datasets at 300,000 triples per second. 
 
What did they do that you can also do?
  
  Avoid locks by using non-blocking algorithms and data structures . For example, moving from BitSet to ConcurrentLinkedQueue. 
  Use ThreadLocal aggressively to reduce thread contention and avoid synchronization . 
  Batch LRU evictions in a single thread . Triggered by several LRU caches becoming problematic when evictions were being swamped by additions. Downside is batching increases memory pressure and GC times. 
  Move to SHA1 for hashing URIs, bnodes, and literal values .

<p>Introduction: Wired has a  wonderful interview  with  Clayton Christensen , author of the tech ninja's bible,  Innovator's Dilemma . Innovation is the name of the game in Silicon Valley and if you want to understand the rules of the game this article is a quick and clear way of learning. Everything is simply explained with compelling examples by the man himself.
 
Just as every empire has fallen, every organization is open to disruption. It's the human condition to become comfortable and discount potential dangers. It takes a great deal of mindfulness to outwit and outlast the human condition. If you want to be the disruptor and avoid being the disruptee, this is good stuff.
 
He also talks about his new book,  The Capitalist's Dilemma , which addresses this puzzle: if corporations are doing so well why are individuals doing so bad?
 
If someone can help you see a deep meaningful pattern in life then they haven't brought you a fish, they've taught you how to fish. That's what Christensen does. Here'</p><p>5 0.93025064 <a title="92-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-22-Improving_performance_and_scalability_with_DDD.html">635 high scalability-2009-06-22-Improving performance and scalability with DDD</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Distributed systems are not typically a place domain driven design is applied. Distributed processing projects often start with an overall architecture vision and the idea about a processing model which basically drives the whole thing, including object design if it exists at all. Elaborate object designs are thought of as something that just gets in the way of distribution and performance, so the idea of spending time to apply DDD principles gets rejected in favour of raw throughput and processing power. However, from my experience, some more advanced DDD concepts can significantly improve the performance, scalability and throughput of distributed systems when applied correctly.   This article  a summary of the presentation titled "DDD in a distributed world" from the DDD Exchange 09 in London.</p><p>6 0.92979044 <a title="92-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-09-09-GridwiseTech_revolutionizes_data_management.html">697 high scalability-2009-09-09-GridwiseTech revolutionizes data management</a></p>

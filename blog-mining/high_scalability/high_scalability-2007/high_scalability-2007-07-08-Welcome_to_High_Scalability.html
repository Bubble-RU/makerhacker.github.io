<p>Introduction: Google made a right move by adding web-speed to the search engine ranking.
With this change site latency does't just impact the user experience but it
will determine where you will be placed in google search results.This move

It is now clear that site performance have much more direct impact on our
business (as appose to indirect impact resulted in user expereince) then ever
before.In this post i try to provide some architecture guide line on how to
control and improve site latency under scale based on a discussion with a
leading eCommerce site the Netherland.See detailed story  here</p><p>5 0.10090206 <a title="2-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-01-Art_of_scalability_%281%29_-_Scalability_principles.html">552 high scalability-2009-04-01-Art of scalability (1) - Scalability principles</a></p>

server.Website is not very scalable.I always wonder how ebay,youtube,monster
handle traffic, giving responses within seconds.From the google i find this
site and i hope i can also able to build very scalable website .I need
guidelines from where to start ,what are the things we needed.I know that
scalability comes through the use of distributed applications but don't how to
implement it.I see many website build in languages other than java so java is
good choice for building high scalable website.Thanks</p><p>4 0.73952395 <a title="2-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-06-Start_Here.html">1 high scalability-2007-07-06-Start Here</a></p>

explode to be the next facebook/flickr/digg/etc. Since I really don't know how
popular the site will be I don't want to spend a ton of money on the

<p>Introduction: I want to know how is Berkeley DB compared against other key-value solution. I
read it from Net that Google uses it for their Enterprise Sign-on feature. Is
anyone has any experience using Berkeley DB. Backward compatibility is poor in
Berkley DB but that is fine for me. How easy to scale using Berkeley DB.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.87445498 <a title="2-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-08-Welcome_to_High_Scalability.html">2 high scalability-2007-07-08-Welcome to High Scalability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: InSecrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Design, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger
shares three strategies Instagram uses to outsmart high latency mobile
networks and make mobile apps feel faster than they really are, which helped
Instagram reach 12 million users in 12 months:The motivation:"mobile
experiences fill gaps while we wait. no one wants to wait while they
wait"Perform actions optimistically. Make the user feel productive. Likes,
comments, and follows are registered on screen while the like operation is
being sent in the background. Adaptively preload content. Load content before
it's needed. Don't images according to time, it will take too long, instead
re-prioritize based on interest. Show what the social network things is the
most popular. Listen to what your user's flicks and taps are telling you.Move
bits when no-one is watching.Picture uploading startsbeforeyou share them,
most apps wait until after the share screen. The rule is send data as soon as
it's ready, then match it</p><p>5 0.76067138 <a title="2-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-19-Stuff_The_Internet_Says_On_Scalability_For_April_19%2C_2013.html">1443 high scalability-2013-04-19-Stuff The Internet Says On Scalability For April 19, 2013</a></p>

Trillion Objects, 1.1 Million Requests / Second: S3;1.4TB/s: Titan

Quotes:Google: We'll track EVERY task on EVERY data center serverStacey
Higginbotham: All in all in the last five years the world has gained 54 Tbps
of new capacity.@seveas: Scalability 103: Hardware sucks. Software sucks.
Everything *will* break, prepare for failure of any component of your
system.bloodredsun: The long and short of it is that Cassandra is a fantastic
system for write heavy situations. What it is not good at are read heavy
situations where deterministic low latency is required, which is pretty much
what the pinterest guys were dealing with.@viktorklang: "The e-mail message

<p>Introduction: Hi,We are running a backup solution that uploads every night the files our
clients worked on during the day (Cabonite-like).We have currently about 10GB
of data per night, via http PUT requests (1 per file), and the files are
written as-is on a NAS.Our architecture is basically compound of a load
balancer (hardware, sticky sessions), 5 servers (Tomcat under RHEL4/5, ) and a
NAS (nfs 3).Since our number of clients is rising, (as is our system load) how
would you recommend we could scale our infrastructure? hardware and software?
Should we go towards NAS sharding, more servers, NIO on tomcat...?Thanks for
your inputs!</p><p>3 0.15449926 <a title="98-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-04-22-Simple_NFS_failover_solution_with_symbolic_link%3F.html">308 high scalability-2008-04-22-Simple NFS failover solution with symbolic link?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've been trying to find a high availability file storage solution without
success. I tried GlusterFS which looks very promising but experienced problems
with stability and don't want something I can't easily control and rely on.
Other solutions are too complicated or have a SPOF.So I'm thinking of the
following setup:Two NFS servers, a primary and a warm backup. The primary
server will be rsynced with the warm backup every minute or two. I can do it
so frequently as a PHP script will know which directories have changed
recently from a database and only rsync those. Both servers will be NFS
mounted on a cluster of web servers as /mnt/nfs-primary (sym linked as
/home/websites) and /mnt/nfs-backup.I'll then use Ucarp
(http://www.ucarp.org/project/ucarp) to monitor both NFS servers availability
every couple of seconds and when one goes down, the Ucarp up script will be
set to change the symbolic link on all web servers for the /home/websites dir
from /mnt/nfs-primary to /mnt/nfs-backupThe</p><p>4 0.15359208 <a title="98-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-04-You_Can_Now_Store_All_Your_Stuff_on_Your_Own_Google_Like_File_System.html">112 high scalability-2007-10-04-You Can Now Store All Your Stuff on Your Own Google Like File System</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am planning the scaling of a hosted service, similar to typepad etc. and
would appreciate feedback on my plan so far.Looking into scaling storage, I
have come accross MogileFS and OpenAFS. My concern with these is I am not at
all experienced with them and as the sole tech guy I don't want to build
something into this hosting service that proves complex to update and
adminster.So, I'm thinking of building replication and scalability right into
the application, in a similar but simplified way to how MogileFS works (I
think).So, for our database table of uploaded files, here's how it currently
looks (simplified):fileid (pkey)filenameowneridFor adding the replication and
scalability, I would add a few more
columns:serveroneidservertwoidserverthreeids3At the time the user uploads a
file, it will go to a specific server (managed by the application) and the id
of that server will be placed in the "serverone" column. Then hourly or so, a
cron job will run through the "files" table, and copy</p><p>3 0.79779607 <a title="98-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Shared_filesystem_on_EC2.html">283 high scalability-2008-03-18-Shared filesystem on EC2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi. I'm looking for a way to share files between EC2 nodes. Currently we are
using glusterfs to do this. It has been reliable recently, but in the past it
has crashed under high load and we've had trouble starting it up again. We've
only been able to restart it by removing the files, restarting the cluster,
and filing it up again with our files from backup. This takes ages, and will
take even longer the more files we get.What worries me is that it seems to
make each node a point of failure for the entire system. One node crashes and
soon the entire cluster has crashed. The other problem is adding another node.
It seems like you have to take down the whole thing, reconfigure to include
the new node, and restart. This kind of defeats the horizontal scaling
strategy.We are using 2 EC2 instances as web servers, 1 as a DB master, and 1
as a slave. GlusterFS is installed on the web server machines as well as the
DB slave machine (we backup files to s3 from this machine). The files are

<p>Introduction: I am looking for a way to distribute files over servers in different physical
locations. My main concern is that I have bandwidth limitations on each
location, and wish to spread the bandwidth load evenly. Atm. I just have 1:1
copies of the files on all servers, and have the application pick a random
server to serve the file as a temp fix...It's a small video streaming service.
I want to spoonfeed the stream to the client with a max bandwidth output, and
support seek. At present I use php to limit the network stream, and read the
file at a given offset sendt as a get parameter from the player for seek. It's
psuedo streaming, but it works.I have been looking at MogileFS, which would
solve the storage part. With MogileFS I can make use of my current php
solution as it supports lighttpd and apache (with mod_rewrite or similar).
However I don't see how I can apply MogileFS to check for bandwidth %
usage?Any reccomendations for how I can solve this?</p><p>5 0.75103086 <a title="98-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-04-You_Can_Now_Store_All_Your_Stuff_on_Your_Own_Google_Like_File_System.html">112 high scalability-2007-10-04-You Can Now Store All Your Stuff on Your Own Google Like File System</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How does Facebook handle the massive New Year's Eve traffic spike? Thanks to
Mike Swift, in Facebook gets ready for New Year's Eve, we get a little insight
as to their method for the madness, nothing really detailed, but still
interesting.Problem SetupFacebook expects tha one billion+ photos will be
shared on New Year's eve.Facebook's 800 million users are scattered around the
world. Three quarters live outside the US. Each user is linked to an average
of 130 friends.Photos and posts must appear in less than a second. Opening a
homepage requires executing requests on a 100 different servers, and those
requests have to be ranked, sorted, and privacy-checked, and then
rendered.Different events put different stresses on different parts of
Facebook. Photo and Video Uploads - Holidays require hundreds of terabytes of
capacity News Feed - News events like big sports events and the death of Steve
Jobs drive user status updatesCoping StrategiesTry to predictthe surge in
traffic. Run checkson h</p><p>2 0.85303873 <a title="98-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-04-30-Behind_the_scenes_of_an_online_marketplace.html">818 high scalability-2010-04-30-Behind the scenes of an online marketplace</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have a few apache servers ( arround 11 atm ) serving a small amount of data
( arround 44 gigs right now ).For some time I have been using rsync to keep
all the content equal on all servers, but the amount of data has been growing,
and rsync takes a few too much time to "compare" all data from source to
destination, and create a lot of I/O.I have been taking a look at MogileFS, it
seems a good and reliable option, but as the fuse module is not finished, we
should have to rewrite all our apps, and its not an option atm.Any ideas?I
just want a "real time, non resource-hungry" solution alternative for rsync.
If I get more features on the way, then they are welcome :)Why I prefer to use
a Distributed File System instead of using NAS + NFS?- I need 2 NAS, if I dont
want a point of failure, and NAS hard is expensive.- Non-shared hardware, all
server has their own local disks.- As files are replicated, I can save a lot
of money, RAID is not a MUST.Thnx in advance for your help and sorry for</p><p>4 0.76566935 <a title="98-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-01-02-Strategy%3A_Understanding_Your_Data_Leads_to_the_Best_Scalability_Solutions.html">481 high scalability-2009-01-02-Strategy: Understanding Your Data Leads to the Best Scalability Solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In articleBuilding Super-Scalable Web Systems with RESTUdi Dahan tells an
interesting story of how they made a weather reporting system scale for over
10 million users. So many users hitting their weather database didn't scale.
Caching in a straightforward way wouldn't work because weather is obviously
local. Caching all local reports would bring the entire database into memory,
which would work for some companies, but wasn't cost efficient for them.So in
typical REST fashion they turned locations into URIs. For example:
http://weather.myclient.com/UK/London. This allows the weather information to
be cached by intermediaries instead of hitting their servers. Hopefully for
each location their servers will be hit a few times and then the caches will
be hit until expiry.breakIn order to send users directly to the correct
location an IP location check is performed on login and stored in a cookie.
The lookup is done once and from then on out a GET is performed directly on
the resource. Ther</p><p>5 0.76331592 <a title="98-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-02-09-Paper%3A_Consensus_Protocols%3A_Two-Phase_Commit__.html">510 high scalability-2009-02-09-Paper: Consensus Protocols: Two-Phase Commit  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Henry Robinson has created an excellent series of articles on consensus
protocols. Henry starts with a very useful discussion of what all this talk
about consensus really means:The consensus problem is the problem of getting a
set of nodes in a distributed system to agree on something - it might be a
value, a course of action or a decision. Achieving consensus allows a
distributed system to act as a single entity, with every individual node aware
of and in agreement with the actions of the whole of the network.In this
article Henry tackles Two-Phase Commit, the protocol most databases use to
arrive at a consensus for database writes. The article is very well written
with lots of pretty and informative pictures. He did a really good job.In
conclusion we learn 2PC is very efficient, a minimal number of messages are
exchanged and latency is low. The problem is when a co-ordinator fails
availability is dramatically reduced. This is why 2PC isn't generally used on
highly distributed systems</p><p>6 0.76188213 <a title="98-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-05-07-Update_on_Disqus%3A_It%27s_Still_About_Realtime%2C_But_Go_Demolishes_Python.html">1644 high scalability-2014-05-07-Update on Disqus: It's Still About Realtime, But Go Demolishes Python</a></p>

<p>Introduction: OK, thisinterview is with meon Java scalability issues. I sound like a bigger
idiot than I would like, but I suppose it could have been worse. The Java
World folks were very nice and did a good job, so there's no blame on them
:-)The interview went an interesting direction, but there's more I'd like add
and I will do so here. Two major rules regarding Java and scalability have
popped out at me:Java - It's the platform stupid. Java the language isn't the
big win. What is the big win is the ecosystem building up around the JVM,
libraries, and toolsets.Java - It's the community stupid. A lot of creativity
is being expended on leveraging the Java platform to meet scalability
challenges. The amazing community that has built up around Java is pushing
Java to the next level in almost every direction imaginable.The fecundity of
the Java ecosystem can most readily be seen with the efforts to tame our
multi-core future. There's a multi-core crisis going in case you haven't

<p>Introduction: Update 3: ReadWriteWeb saysGoogle App Engine Announces New Pricing Plans,
APIs, Open Access. Pricing is specified but I'm not sure what to make of it
yet. An image manipulation library is added (thus the need to pay for more CPU
:-) and memcached support has been added. Memcached will help resolve the
can't write for every read problem that pops up when keeping counters.Update
2: onGWT.com threw a GAE load party and a lot of people came. The results
atLoad test : Google App Engine = 1, Community = 0. GAE handled a peak of 35
requests/second and a sustained 10 requests/second. Some think performance was
good, others not so good. My GMT watch broke and I was late to arrive. Maybe
next time. Also added a few new design rules from the post.Update: Added a few
new rules gleaned from theGAE Meetup: Design By Explicit Cost Model and Puts
are Precious.How do you structure your database using a distributed hash table

<p>Introduction: In Google+ Is Built Using Tools You Can Use Too: Closure, Java Servlets,
JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround we glimpsed inside Google's
technology stack for building Google+. Mark Knichel, an engineer on the
Google+ infrastructure team, has helped us look alittle deeper on how
Javascript is handled in Google+.  Here's a quick look:They loveClosure for
its library, templates, compiler, and strict type checking. Compilation is now
required for good performance. I've wondered if GWT will be killed off as have
other Google properties, but I've been told GWT is being used heavily inside
Google, so thankfully that probably won't happen.Closure templatesare used
both Java and JavaScript to render pages server-side and in the browser. Just-
in-time JavaScript. Code is split into modules so the minimum amount of
JavaScript is loaded asynchronously in the background as necessary. Navigation
happens without loading the page.Page navigation happens without page reloads.

<p>Introduction: A giant step into the fully distributed future has been taken by the Google
App Engine team with the release of theirHigh Replication Datastore. The HRD
is targeted at mission critical applications that require data replicated to
at least three datacenters, full ACID semantics forentity groups, and lower
consistency guarantees across entity groups.This is a major accomplishment.
Few organizations can implement a true multi-datacenter datastore. Other than
SimpleDB, how many other publicly accessible database services can operate out
of multiple datacenters? Now that capability can be had by anyone. But there
is a price, literally and otherwise. Because the HRD uses three times the
resources as Google App Engine's Master/Slave datastatore, it will cost three
times as much. And because it is a distributed database, with all that implies
in the CAP sense, developers will have to be very careful in how they
architect their applications because as costs increased, reliability
increased, com</p><p>6 0.087849617 <a title="82-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-eBay_Architecture.html">331 high scalability-2008-05-27-eBay Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: PayPal gives yet another glowing reportof an app rewritten in node.js
experiencing substantial performance improvements. PayPal rewrote their
account overview page, one of the most trafficked apps on the website, which
was previously written in King Java.The benefits:Full-stack engineers. Using
JavaScript on both the front-end and the back-end removed an artificial
boundary between the browser and server, allowing engineers to code both.Built
almost twice as fast with fewer people Written in 33% fewer lines of code
Constructed with 40% fewer filesDouble the requests per second vs. the Java
application.35% decrease in the average response time for the same page.A
common pro Java response is an argument like clearly these people don't know
how to program Java. Or rewriting an application usually makes it faster. Or
the benchmark is faulty. And so on. Consider it noted. These are all potential
factors.Baron Schwartzfrom VividCortex has a different take. One based on
math. Using the Univer</p><p>4 0.70502371 <a title="82-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay_history_and_architecture.html">550 high scalability-2009-03-30-Ebay history and architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ebay[1]Starts in 1995, initial name AuctionWeb (V1) :- very simple
architecture- based on perl- no database, for data persistence they used plain
filesBecause of rapid growth they needed to improve their architecture and so
V2 (clever name) was born:- replaced perl with C/C++- started using a database
in a master-slave configuration- C++ back-end- XSLT front-endAny request will
lead to an XML file being created in C++ and the XLST processor will transform
that into html.*pretty sophisticated architecture for the 90s, XLST was
cutting-edge back then*breakThat hold out pretty well for a while but in the
late 90s ebay experienced an exponential growth.They started having some
trouble with outages and needed improvements, so V3 was developed:- based on
java- search engine still used C++- proof that relational databases can scale
(aggressive caching)- developed a messaging layer for making a lot of
asyncronious calls, they actually ended up being sued because of the delay in
which images ap</p><p>5 0.68532801 <a title="82-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-06-28-ID_generation_schemes.html">346 high scalability-2008-06-28-ID generation schemes</a></p>

Java, but in a very pragmatic way. They use servlets, an application server,
the JDK, and they do the rest themselves. They skip JSP, entity beans, and
JMS.When you need to scale putting all your eggs in one basket is a risky
strategy. Why use JSP when you can do better? When use entity beans when you
can do better? Use servlets because they are a very effective way of handling
http requests. Use Java because it is fast, runs everywhere, and has a boat
load of libraries you can use to build your build your custom system.Probably
the major reason J2EE is absentee is simply LAMP. LAMP is just so incredibly
functional for most 2-tier shared nothing sites they don't need a better

<p>Introduction: Adapted from their website:GlusterFSis a clustered file-system capable of
scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over
Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. Storage bricks can be made of any commodity hardware such as x86-64
server with SATA-II RAID and Infiniband HBA).Cluster file systems are still
not mature for enterprise market. They are too complex to deploy and maintain
though they are extremely scalable and cheap. Can be entirely built out of
commodity OS and hardware. GlusterFS hopes to solves this problem.GlusterFS
achieved35 GBps read throughput. The GlusterFS Aggregated I/O Benchmark was
performed on 64 bricks clustered storage system over 10 Gbps Infiniband
interconnect. A cluster of 220 clients pounded the storage system with
multiple dd (disk-dump) instances, each reading / writing a 1 GB file with 1MB
block size. GlusterFS was configured with unify translator and round-robin
scheduler.The advantage</p><p>4 0.7491799 <a title="82-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-19-Serving_JavaScript_Fast.html">285 high scalability-2008-03-19-Serving JavaScript Fast</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cal Hendersonwrites at thinkvitamin.com: "With our so-called "Web 2.0'
applications and their rich content and interaction, we expect our
applications to increasingly make use of CSS and JavaScript. To make sure
these applications are nice and snappy to use, we need to optimize the size
and nature of content required to render the page, making sure we're
delivering the optimum experience. In practice, this means a combination of
making our content as small and fast to download as possible, while avoiding
unnecessarily refetching unmodified resources." A lot of good comments too.</p><p>5 0.74219429 <a title="82-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-09-LiveJournal_Architecture.html">3 high scalability-2007-07-09-LiveJournal Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A fascinating and detailed story of how LiveJournal evolved their system to
scale. LiveJournal was an early player in the free blog service race and faced
issues from quickly adding a large number of users. Blog posts come fast and
furious which causes a lot of writes and writes are particularly hard to
scale. Understanding how LiveJournal faced their scaling problems will help

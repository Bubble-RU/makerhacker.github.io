<p>Introduction: I've been using GWT for an application and I get the same feeling using it
that I first got using html. I've always sucked at building UIs. Starting with
programming HP terminals, moving on to the Apple Lisa, then X Windows, and

Geek scale my interfaces are definitely horned-rimmed and pocket protector

but didn't have to look all that great. Expectations were pretty low and I
eagerly fulfilled them. With Ajax expectations have risen again and I find
myself once more easily identifiable as a styless geek. Using GWT I have some
hopes I can suck a little less.In working with GWT I was so focussed on its
tasty easily digestible Ajaxy goodness, I didn't stop to think about the topic

everything, which can be an deadly boring affliction in this field. In this
case Robert is asking for help in an upcoming interview. Maybe we can help?
Here's Robert's plight:I’m really freaked out. I have one of the biggest
interviews of my life coming up and I’m way under qualified to host it.It’s on
Thursday and it’s about Scalability and Performance of Web Services.Look at
who will be on. Matt Mullenweg, founder of Automattic, the company behind
WordPress (and behind this blog). Paul Bucheit, one of the founders of
FriendFeed and the creator of Gmail (he’s also the guy who gave Google the
“don’t be evil” admonishion). Nat Brown, CTO of iLike, which got six million

<p>Introduction: Google Talk is Google's instant communications service. Interestingly the IM
messages aren't the major architectural challenge, handling user presence
indications dominate the design. They also have the challenge of handling
small low latency messages and integrating with many other systems. How do
they do it?Site: http://www.google.com/talkInformation SourcesGoogleTalk

<p>Introduction: In Google+ Is Built Using Tools You Can Use Too: Closure, Java Servlets,
JavaScript, BigTable, Colossus, Quick Turnaround we glimpsed inside Google's
technology stack for building Google+. Mark Knichel, an engineer on the
Google+ infrastructure team, has helped us look alittle deeper on how
Javascript is handled in Google+.  Here's a quick look:They loveClosure for
its library, templates, compiler, and strict type checking. Compilation is now
required for good performance. I've wondered if GWT will be killed off as have
other Google properties, but I've been told GWT is being used heavily inside
Google, so thankfully that probably won't happen.Closure templatesare used
both Java and JavaScript to render pages server-side and in the browser. Just-
in-time JavaScript. Code is split into modules so the minimum amount of
JavaScript is loaded asynchronously in the background as necessary. Navigation
happens without loading the page.Page navigation happens without page reloads.

<p>Introduction: Joseph Smarr, former CTO of Plaxo (which explains why I recognized his
picture), in I'm a technical lead on the Google+ team. Ask me anything,
reveals the stack used for building Google+:Our stack is pretty standard fare
for Google apps these days: we use Java servlets for our server code and
JavaScript for the browser-side of the UI, largely built with the (open-
source) Closure framework, including Closure's JavaScript compiler and
template system. A couple nifty tricks we do: we use the HTML5 History API to
maintain pretty-looking URLs even though it's an AJAX app (falling back on
hash-fragments for older browsers); and we often render our Closure templates
server-side so the page renders before any JavaScript is loaded, then the
JavaScript finds the right DOM nodes and hooks up event handlers, etc. to make
it responsive (as a result, if you're on a slow connection and you click on
stuff really fast, you may notice a lag before it does anything, but luckily
most people don't run int</p><p>6 0.58472854 <a title="127-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-09-25-HighScalability.com_Rated_16th_Best_Blog_for_Development_Managers.html">394 high scalability-2008-09-25-HighScalability.com Rated 16th Best Blog for Development Managers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Robert Stewart shared this useful Ajax related scalability strategy:We avoided
XMLHttpRequests for individual keystrokes, choosing to go back to the server
only when a field lost focus. Google can afford all the servers to handle the
load for that, but we didn't want to.Do you have a scalability strategy to
share? Thenshare it!.</p><p>2 0.79784983 <a title="127-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-03-04-NoSQL_Style_-_A_Gangnam_Style_Parody.html">1416 high scalability-2013-03-04-NoSQL Style - A Gangnam Style Parody</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At Monday'sCloud Computing Meetup,Paco Nathangave an excellentGetting Started
on Hadooptalk (slides). I found one of Paco's strategies particularly
interesting: consider when a service starts charging in cost calculations.
Depending on your use case it may be cheaper to go with a more expensive
service that charges only for work accomplished rather than charging for both
work + startup time.The example is comparing the cost of running Hadoop on AWS
yourself versus using Amazon's prepackaged Hadoop service,Elastic
MapReduce(EMR). The thought may have gone through your mind as it did mine
that it doesn't necessarily make sense to use Amazon's Hadoop service. Why pay
a premium for EMR when Hadoop will run directly on AWS?One reason is that
Amazon has made significant changes to Hadoop to make it run more efficiently
and easily on AWS. The other more surprising reason is cost.When starting a
500 node Hadoop cluster, for example, you have to wait for all the nodes to
start and join the clus</p><p>4 0.7672289 <a title="127-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-01-10-A_Perfect_Fifth_of_Notes_on_Scalability.html">1172 high scalability-2012-01-10-A Perfect Fifth of Notes on Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jeremiah Peschka with a great a set ofNotes on Scalability, just in case you
do reach your wildest expectations of success:Build it to Break. Plan for the
fact that everything you make is going to break. Design in layers that are
independent and redundant.Everything is a Feature. Your application is a set
of features created by a series of conscious choices made by considering
trade-offs. Scale Out, Not Up. Purchasing more hardware is easier than coding
and managing horizontal resources. Buy More Storage. Large numbers of smaller,
faster drives have more IOPS than fewer, larger drives.You're Going to Do It
Wrong. Be prepared to iterate on your ideas. You will make mistakes.  Be
prepared to re-write code and to quickly move on to the next idea.Please read
theoriginal articlefor a much more expansive treatment.</p><p>5 0.76518852 <a title="127-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-11-14-Using_Gossip_Protocols_for_Failure_Detection%2C_Monitoring%2C_Messaging_and_Other_Good_Things.html">1142 high scalability-2011-11-14-Using Gossip Protocols for Failure Detection, Monitoring, Messaging and Other Good Things</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When building a system on top of a set of wildly uncooperative and unruly
computers you have knowledge problems: knowing when other nodes are dead;
knowing when nodes become alive; getting information about other nodes so you
can make local decisions, like knowing which node should handle a request
based on a scheme for assigning nodes to a certain range of users; learning
about new configuration data; agreeing on data values; and so on.How do you
solve these problems? A common centralized approach is to use a database and
all nodes query it for information. Obvious availability and performance
issues for large distributed clusters. Another approach is to use Paxos, a
protocol for solving consensus in a network to maintain strict consistency
requirements for small groups of unreliable processes. Not practical when
larger number of nodes are involved.So what's the super cool decentralized way
to bring order to large clusters?Gossip protocols, which maintain relaxed
consistency requireme</p><p>6 0.76375979 <a title="127-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-10-Antirez%3A_You_Need_to_Think_in_Terms_of_Organizing_Your_Data_for_Fetching.html">1337 high scalability-2012-10-10-Antirez: You Need to Think in Terms of Organizing Your Data for Fetching</a></p>

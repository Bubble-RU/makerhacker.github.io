store?I'm writing a website that I need to keep as low budget as possible, and
I'm investigating solutions for storing uploaded photos from users - not too
many, probably in the low thousands. The site is commercial so I'm straying
away from the Flickrs of the world. S3 seems to offer a solution but I'd like
to hear from those who have used it before.ThanksAndy</p><p>3 0.10670281 <a title="122-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-02-21-Pixable_Architecture_-_Crawling%2C_Analyzing%2C_and_Ranking_20_Million_Photos_a_Day.html">1197 high scalability-2012-02-21-Pixable Architecture - Crawling, Analyzing, and Ranking 20 Million Photos a Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Alberto Lopez Toledo, PHD, CTO of Pixable, and Julio
Viera, VP of Engineering at Pixable.Pixableaggregates photos from across your
different social networks and finds the best ones so you never miss an
important moment. That means currently processing the metadata of more than 20
million new photos per day: crawling, analyzing, ranking, and sorting them
along with the other 5+ billion that are already stored in our database.
Making sense of all that data has challenges, but two in particular rise above
the rest:How to access millions of photos per day from Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, and other services in the most efficient manner.How to process,
organize, index, and store all the meta-data related to those photos.Sure,
Pixable's infrastructure is changing continuously, but there are some things
that we have learned over the last year. As a result, we have been able to
build a scalable infrastructure that takes advantage of today's tools,

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byPatrick Eaton, Software Engineer and Distributed
Systems Architect at Stackdriver.Stackdriver provides intelligent monitoring-
as-a-service for cloud hosted applications.  Behind this easy-to-use service
is a large distributed system for collecting and storing metrics and events,
monitoring and alerting on them, analyzing them, and serving up all the
results in a web UI.  Because we ourselves run in the cloud (mostly on AWS),
we spend a lot of time thinking about how to deal with faults in the cloud.
We have developed a framework for thinking about fault mitigation for large,
cloud-hosted systems.  We endearingly call this framework the "Four Hamiltons"
because it is inspired by an article from James Hamilton, the Vice President
and Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Web Services.The article that led to this
framework is called "The Power Failure Seen Around the World".  Hamilton
analyzes the causes of the power outage that affected Super Bowl XLVII in
early 2013.</p><p>5 0.10118368 <a title="122-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-08-Strategy%3A_Flickr_-_Do_the_Essential_Work_Up-front_and_Queue_the_Rest_.html">406 high scalability-2008-10-08-Strategy: Flickr - Do the Essential Work Up-front and Queue the Rest </a></p>
<p>Introduction: This strategy is stated perfectly by Flickr's Myles Grant:The Flickr
engineering team is obsessed with making pages load as quickly as possible. To
that end, weâ&euro;&trade;re refactoring large amounts of our code to do only the essential
work up front, and rely on our queuing system to do the rest.Flickr uses a
queuing system to process 11 million tasks a day. Leslie Michael Orchard also
does a great job explaining the queuing meme in his excellent postQueue
everything and delight everyone. Asynchronous work queues are how you scalably
solve problems that are too big to handle in real-time.The process:Identify
the minimum feedback the client (UI, API) needs to know an operation
succeeded. It's enough, for example, to update a client's view when a posting
a message to a microblogging service. The client probably isn't aware of all
the other steps that happen when a message is added and doesn't really care
when they happen as long as the obvious cases happen in an appropariate period
of time.Queue</p><p>6 0.099244408 <a title="122-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me_Architecture_-_Synchronicity_Kills.html">431 high scalability-2008-10-27-Notify.me Architecture - Synchronicity Kills</a></p>

<p>Introduction: What should the architecture of your scalable, real-time, highly available
service look like? There are as many options as there are developers, but if
you are looking for a general template, this architecture as described by
Prashant Malik, Facebook's lead for theMessagesback end team, in Scaling the
Messages Application Back End, is a very good example to consider. Although
Messages is tasked with handling 135+ billion messages a month, from email,
IM, SMS,  text messages, and Facebook messages, you may think this is an
example of BigArchitecture and doesn't apply to smaller sites. Not so. It's a
good, well thought out example of a non-cloud architecture exhibiting many
qualities any mom would be proud of:Layered- components are independent and
isolated. Service/API Driven- each layer is connected via well defined
interface that is the sole entry point for accessing that service. This
prevents nasty complicated interdependencies. Clients hide behind an
application API.

<p>Introduction: When building a system on top of a set of wildly uncooperative and unruly
computers you have knowledge problems: knowing when other nodes are dead;
knowing when nodes become alive; getting information about other nodes so you
can make local decisions, like knowing which node should handle a request
based on a scheme for assigning nodes to a certain range of users; learning
about new configuration data; agreeing on data values; and so on.How do you
solve these problems? A common centralized approach is to use a database and
all nodes query it for information. Obvious availability and performance
issues for large distributed clusters. Another approach is to use Paxos, a
protocol for solving consensus in a network to maintain strict consistency
requirements for small groups of unreliable processes. Not practical when
larger number of nodes are involved.So what's the super cool decentralized way
to bring order to large clusters?Gossip protocols, which maintain relaxed
consistency requireme</p><p>4 0.69633716 <a title="122-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-11-07-Paper%3A_Tempest%3A_Scalable_Time-Critical_Web_Services_Platform.html">1544 high scalability-2013-11-07-Paper: Tempest: Scalable Time-Critical Web Services Platform</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An interesting and different implementation approach: Tempest: Scalable Time-
Critical Web Services Platform: Tempest is a new framework for developing
time-critical web services. Tempest enables developers to build scalable,
fault-tolerant services that can then be automatically replicated and deployed
across clusters of computing nodes. The platform automatically adapts to load
ďŹ&sbquo;uctuations, reacts when components fail, and ensures consistency between
replicas by repairing when inconsistencies do occur. Tempest relies on a
family of epidemic protocols and on Ricochet, a reliable time critical
multicast protocol with probabilistic guarantees.Tempest is built around a
novel storage abstraction called the TempestCollection in which application
developers store the state of a service. Our platform handles the replication
of this state across clones of the service, persistence, and failure handling.

developer, th</p><p>5 0.68767399 <a title="122-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-17-Paper%3A_Consistent_Hashing_and_Random_Trees%3A_Distributed_Caching_Protocols_for_Relieving_Hot_Spots_on_the_World_Wide_Web.html">280 high scalability-2008-03-17-Paper: Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Consistent hashing is one of those ideas that really puts the science in
computer science and reminds us why all those really smart people spend years
slaving over algorithms. Consistent hashing is "a scheme that provides hash
table functionality in a way that the addition or removal of one slot does not
significantly change the mapping of keys to slots" and was originally a way of
distributing requests among a changing population of web servers. My first
reaction to the idea was "wow, that's really smart" and I sadly realized I
would never come up with something so elegant. I then immediately saw
applications for it everywhere. And consistent hashing is used everywhere:
distributed hash tables, overlay networks, P2P, IM, caching, and CDNs. Here's
the abstract from the original paper and after the abstract are some links to
a few very good articles with accessible explanations of consistent hashing

<p>Introduction: ProfessorDavid Malangives a very good lecture on scalability for dynamic
websites. It's not highly technical, it's an extension course, but it's a
great introduction to a wide variety of topics. I really like his teaching
style. He continually asks questions, prompts for input, and gives accessible
explanations. Some of the topics covered: vertical scaling; horizontal
scaling; PHP acceleration; load balancing: DNS, L7, sticky sessions, load
balancers; caching; MySQL: replication, load balancing, partitioning, high
availability.Watch it onAcademic EarthThis is one lecture in a series of 13
lectures on building dynamic websites. Students learn how to: build dynamic
websites with Ajax and with Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP); set up
domain names with DNS; structure pages with XHTML and CSS how to program in
JavaScript and PHP; configure Apacheand MySQL; design and query databases with
SQL; use Ajax with both XML andJSON;  build mashups.For thelecture notesgo to

<p>Introduction: Ever wonder what powers Google's world spirit sensing Zeitgeist service? No,
it's not a homunculus ofGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel sitting in each browser.
It's actually a stream processing (think streaming MapReduce on steroids)
system called MillWheel, described in this very well written paper: MillWheel:
Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at Internet Scale. MillWheel isn't just used
for Zeitgeist at Google, it's also used for streaming joins for a variety of
Ads customers, generalized anomaly-detection service, and network switch and
cluster health monitoring.Abstract:MillWheel is a framework for building low-
latency data-processing applications that is widely used at Google. Users
specify a directed computation graph and application code for individual
nodes, and the system manages persistent state and the continuous ďŹ&sbquo;ow of
records, all within the envelope of the framework's fault-tolerance
guarantees. This paper describes MillWheel's programming model as well as its
implementation.</p><p>same-blog 6 0.83350718 <a title="122-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-14-Product%3A_The_Spread_Toolkit.html">122 high scalability-2007-10-14-Product: The Spread Toolkit</a></p>

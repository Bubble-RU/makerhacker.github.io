<p>Introduction: Mobile developers have a huge scaling problem ahead: doing something useful
with massive continuous streams of telemetry data from millions and millions
of devices. This is a really good problem to have. It means smartphone sales
are finally fulfilling their destiny: slaughtering PCsin the sales arena. And
it also means mobile devices aren't just containers for simple standalone apps
anymore, they are becoming the dominant interface to giant backend
systems.While developers are now rocking mobile development on the client
side, their next challenge is how to code those tricky backend bits. A company
facing those same exact problems right now isMedialets, a mobile rich media ad
platform. What they do is help publishers create high quality interactive ads,
though for our purposes their ad stuff isn't that interesting. What I did find
really interesting about their system is how they are tackling the problem of
defeating the mobile device data deluge.Each day Medialets munches on billions</p><p>4 0.066001356 <a title="186-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-07-Paper%3A_Architecture_of_a_Highly_Scalable_NIO-Based_Server.html">113 high scalability-2007-10-07-Paper: Architecture of a Highly Scalable NIO-Based Server</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byGordon Worley, a Software Engineer atKorrelate, where
they correlate (see what they did there) online purchases to offline
purchases.Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every
server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not
making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come
online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were
originally told to expect. I wouldn't say we panicked, but the office was
certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks
both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the
added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.At
Korrelate, we deploytracking pixels, also known beacons or web bugs, that our
partners use to send us information about their users. These tiny web objects
contain no visible content, but may include transparent 1 by 1 gifs or

<p>Introduction: This is an article published last year, but as today is Grace Hopper's
birthday I thought it would be a good time to share again an amazing talk from
this amazing woman.Computing pioneerGrace Hopper,inventor of the compiler,
searched for a concrete way to create an intuitive understanding of just how
fast is a nanosecond, a billionth of a second, which was the speed of their
new computer circuits. As an illustration she settled on the length of wire
that is as long as light can travel in one nanosecond. The length is a very
portable11.8 inches. A microseconds worth of wire is a still portable, but a
much bulkier 984 feet. In one millisecond light travels 186 miles, which only
Hercules could carry. In today's terms, at a3.06 GHz clock speed, there's .33
nanoseconds between ticks, or 3.73 inches of light travel.Understanding the
profligate ways of programmers, she suggests that every programmer wear a
necklace of a microseconds worth of wire so they know what they are wasting
when they t</p><p>5 0.53611219 <a title="186-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-09-Writing_about_cisco_loadbalancer%3F.html">678 high scalability-2009-08-09-Writing about cisco loadbalancer?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From their website:FAIis an automated installation tool to install or deploy
Debian GNU/Linux and other distributions on a bunch of different hosts or a
Cluster. It's more flexible than other tools like kickstart for Red Hat,
autoyast and alice for SuSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris. FAI can also be used
for configuration management of a running system.You can take one or more
virgin PCs, turn on the power and after a few minutes Linux is installed,
configured and running on all your machines, without any interaction
necessary. FAI it's a scalable method for installing and updating all your

<p>Introduction: If you are a normal human being and find thePaxos protocolconfusing, then this
paper, Paxos Made Moderately Complex, is a great find. Robbert van Renesse
from Cornell University has written a clear and well written paper with
excellent explanations.The Abstract:For anybody who has ever tried to
implement it, Paxos is by no means a simple protocol, even though it is based
on relatively simple invariants. This paper provides imperative pseudo-code
for the full Paxos (or Multi-Paxos) protocol without shying away from
discussing various implementation details. The initial description avoids
optimizations that complicate comprehension. Next we discuss liveness, and
list various optimizations that make the protocol practical.Related

<p>Introduction: Pud off*ckedcomany.com (FC) fame, a favorite site of the dot bomb era, and a
site I absolutely loved until my company became featured, has given us a look
at his backend: Why Must You Laugh At My Back End. For those whose don't
remember FC's history, TechCrunch published afitting eulogy:[FC] first went
live in 2000, chronicling failing and troubled companies in its unique and
abrasive style after the dot com bust. Within a year it had a massive audience
and was getting serious mainstream press attention. As the startup economy
became better in 2004, much of the attention the site received went away. But
a large and loyal audience remains at the site, coming back day after day for
its unique slant on the news. At its peak, FC had 4 million unique monthly
visitors.Delightfully, FC was not a real-names kind of site. Hard witty
cynicism ruled and not a single cat picture was in sight. It was a blast of
fun when all around was the enclosing dark.So when I saw Pud's post I was

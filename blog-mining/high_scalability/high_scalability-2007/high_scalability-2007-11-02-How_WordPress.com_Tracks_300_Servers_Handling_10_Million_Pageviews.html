<p>Introduction: on Wiki someone posted"...For relatively small installations, pub/sub provides
the opportunity for better scalability than traditional client-server, through
parallel operation, message caching, tree-based or network-based routing,
etc.However, as systems scale up to become datacenters with thousands of
servers sharing the pub/sub infrastructure, this benefit is often lost; in
fact, scalability for pub/sub products under high load in large deployments is
very much a research challenge."Does anyone have something to say regarding
scaling Publish/subscribe models?</p><p>3 0.12350857 <a title="140-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-04-Product%3A_Cacti.html">58 high scalability-2007-08-04-Product: Cacti</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Cactiis a network statistics graphing tool designed as a frontend to RRDtool's
data storage and graphing functionality. It is intended to be intuitive and
easy to use, as well as robust and scalable. It is generally used to graph
time-series data like CPU load and bandwidth use.The frontend is written in
PHP; it can handle multiple users, each with their own graph sets, so it is
sometimes used by web hosting providers (especially dedicated server, virtual
private server, and colocation providers) to display bandwidth statistics for
their customers. It can be used to configure the data collection itself,
allowing certain setups to be monitored without any manual configuration of
RRDtool.</p><p>4 0.11023893 <a title="140-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-01-MySQL_Database_Scale-out_and_Replication_for_High_Growth_Businesses.html">455 high scalability-2008-12-01-MySQL Database Scale-out and Replication for High Growth Businesses</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It is widely recognized that MySQL is the most popular database software in
the world. Since its inception in 1995, there have been 11 million product
installations around the world in a wide variety of markets. There are more
installations of MySQL in use today than any other database architecture. From
startup companies hoping to be the next Web2.0 poster child to large global
enterprises, the MySQL database architecture has proven to be flexible,
extendable, scalable, and more than capable of filling high-capacity database
roles in very different venues.</p><p>5 0.079985537 <a title="140-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-04-Manage_Downtime_Risk_by_Connecting_Multiple_Data_Centers_into_a_Secure_Virtual_LAN.html">266 high scalability-2008-03-04-Manage Downtime Risk by Connecting Multiple Data Centers into a Secure Virtual LAN</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update:VcubeV- an OpenVPN-based solution designed to build and operate a
multisourced infrastructure.True high availability requires a presence in
multiple data centers. The recent downtime of even a high quality operation
like Amazon makes this need all the more clear. Typically only the big boys
can afford the complexity of operating in two or more data centers. Cloud
computing along with utility billing starts to change that equation, leveling
the playing field. Even smaller outfits will be in a position to manage risk
by spreading machines amongst EC2, 3tera, Slicehost, Mosso and other
providers.The question then becomes: given we aren't Angels, how do we walk
amongst the clouds? One fascinating answer is exquisitely explained by Dmitriy
Samovskiy in his Linux Journal article titledBuilding aMultisourced
Infrastructure Using OpenVPN.breakDmitriy's idea is to create a secure UDP
tunnel between different data centers over public internet links so your

<p>Introduction: From the website:Thelbpool projectprovides a load balancing JDBC driver for
use with DB connection pools. It wraps a normal JDBC driver providing
reconnect semantics in the event of additional hardware availability, partial
system failure, or uneven load distribution. It also evenly distributes all
new connections among slave DB servers in a given pool. Each time connect() is
called it will attempt to use the best server with the least system load.The
biggest scalability issue with large applications that are mostly READ bound
is the number of transactions per second that the disks in your cluster can
handle. You can generally solve this in two ways.1. Buy bigger and faster
disks with expensive RAID controllers.2. Buy CHEAP hardware on CHEAP disks but
lots of machines.We prefer the cheap hardware approach and lbpool allows you
to do this.Even if you *did* manage to use cheap hardware most load balancing
hardware is expensive, requires a redundant balancer (if it were to fail), and

<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability
load balanced system using mod backhand andWackamole. The idea is you don't
need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of
the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-
based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read.
Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a
resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of
effect of keep-alives on performance.</p><p>5 0.68897921 <a title="140-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-05-SSL_RPC_API_Scalability.html">620 high scalability-2009-06-05-SSL RPC API Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi all!So nice to start discussing cool things in this even cooler forum :)I
am having a problem .. which i believe is already solved but i would love
someone confirming actual experience with the same topic.We are building a
client / server architecture, consisting of a web server part and many
clients.Transport will be provided as either XML-RPC / SOAP / JSON or all at
once.All of the communication has to be encrypted and passed within SSL3.We
expect a high load when the application starts (> 2000 concurrent
requests).Combine this with xml parsing for the rpc api, things really look
ugly :)So it's a big mess :)It will not be that much database bound behind the
api - mostly files will be transferred from the server to the clients and
simple api for control.So it's pretty much a matter of 'what-to-do-with-ssl'.I
was thinking of hardware - NetApp or a similar application accelerator.Can
anyone give examples of a hardware piece that combines: Load balancer / SSL
accelerator?I have also b</p><p>6 0.68506938 <a title="140-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2014/high_scalability-2014-01-29-10_Things_Bitly_Should_Have_Monitored.html">1587 high scalability-2014-01-29-10 Things Bitly Should Have Monitored</a></p>

<p>Introduction: WordPress.com hosts 300 servers in 5 different data centers. It's always
useful to learn how large installations manage all their unruly
children:Currently we Nagios for server health monitoring, Munin for graphing
various server metrics, and a wiki to keep track of all the server hardware
specs, IPs, vendor IDs, etc. All of these tools have suited us well up until
now, but there have been some scaling issues.The post covers how these
different tools are working for them and the comment section has some
interesting discussions too.</p><p>2 0.93506873 <a title="140-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-26-Akaros_-_an_open_source_operating_system_for_manycore_architectures.html">1234 high scalability-2012-04-26-Akaros - an open source operating system for manycore architectures</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you are interested in future foward OS designs then you might find Akaros
worth a look. It's an operating system designed for many-core architectures
and large-scale SMP systems, with the goals of:Providing better support for
parallel and high-performance applicationsScaling the operating system to a
large number of cores A more indepth explanation of the motiviation behind
Akaros can be found inImproving Per-Node Efﬁciency in the Datacenter with
NewOS Abstractions by Barret Rhoden, Kevin Klues, David Zhu, and Eric
Brewer.The abstract:We believe datacenters can beneﬁt from more focus on per-
node efﬁciency, performance, and predictability, versus the more common focus
so far on scalability to a large number of nodes. Improving per-node efﬁciency
decreases costs and fault recovery because fewer nodes are required for the
same amount of work. We believe that the use of complex, general-purpose
operating systems is a key contributing factor to these inefﬁciencies.

<p>Introduction: Lightcloud is a distributed and persistentkey-value databasefromPlurk.com.
Performance is said to be comparable to memcached. It's different
thanmemcachedbbecause it scales out horizontally by adding new nodes. It's
different than memcached because it persists to disk, it's not just a cache.

<p>Introduction: Submitted for your reading pleasure...A good night's sleep is why Facebook CTO
Bret Taylor says Friendfeed should have gone cloud, let others take the
midnight watch, even if it costs a bit more.James Urquhartwith an information
packed interview on a wide range of cloud topics: Cloud Expert Inside theCube
at Stata Conference. Highlights: cloud is an operations model, it is not a
technology, it is a way to apply technology to problems; the faster you can
get the resources into the hands of the people who use it the more money you
save overall; cloud is a cash flow story, not a savings story; services aren't
about servers or storage, they are about applications.Quotable Quotes:Ryan
Tomayko: Frameworks don't solve scalability problems, design solves
scalability problems. Via@GregSkloot@zuno: The golden rule of scalability: "it
can probably wait" look for other areas to save resources.@bihzad: joinserv

<p>Introduction: Data centers are reshaping themselves by taking ideas from public cloud
providers, such as Amazon and Google. The idea is to make the data center more
cost-effective by enabling on-demand utility-based computing rather than
dedicated machines. At the same time, it is clear that to make IT operations
more effective, it doesn't make sense to run all the applications that are
currently hosted in a company's data center in the private cloud. This calls
for an integration between private and public cloud. In this post i discuss
some of the challenges involved in making that happen:1. How do we design
applications to be cloud-agnostic?2. How do we enable seamless fail-over to a
public cloud?3. Future-proofing: There are many cases in which we can't make a
clear decision as to where our application should be running at the time of
writing or developing the application. We would like to be in a position to
change the decision as to where our application will be running even after our
applicati</p><p>6 0.88277316 <a title="140-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-10-14-Implementing_the_Lustre_File_System_with_Sun_Storage%3A_High_Performance_Storage_for_High_Performance_Computing.html">411 high scalability-2008-10-14-Implementing the Lustre File System with Sun Storage: High Performance Storage for High Performance Computing</a></p>

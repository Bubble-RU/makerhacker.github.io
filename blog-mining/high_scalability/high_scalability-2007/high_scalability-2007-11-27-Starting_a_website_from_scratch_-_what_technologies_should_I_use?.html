<p>Introduction: Drupal 7 is having a scalability makeover. Karoly Negyesi, Drupal Core Developer and Public Development Team Lead, explains the process in this video:  Drupal 7 APIs, scalability mindset . Karoly states the general theme of the changes as:  You give up some control and you get back scalability . An interesting comment on the politics of scalability?
 
Makeover may not be quite the right word though. A makeover implies a cosmetic change, looking better by changing the surface. Drupal's changes will go deeper than that, right to Drupal's core. It's a genuine and authentic change that will hopefully allow one of the Internet's most venerable Content Management Systems (CMSs) to compete with a constant stream of younger and sexier models.
 
Drupal is based on an older LAMP stack approach where PHP modules are scooped up and merged together each time a request is made to Drupal. Drupal's most intriguing idea is how it is built, expands, and changes by  weaving together a single system  out</p><p>4 0.14160007 <a title="167-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-27-Secure_Remote_Administration_for_Large-Scale_Networks.html">329 high scalability-2008-05-27-Secure Remote Administration for Large-Scale Networks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This website has been a great resource for helping me to understand the successful (and failed) scalable network designs from organizations that have actually done it, but I haven't seen any explicite explanations about secure remote administration of these systems.     I understand that the *nix people love to SSH, and the windows gang has their RDP, but how does one go about creating a network architecture that both allows one to manage their systems and does its best to avoid hacker interest? As I imagine, no big website will have the SSH/RDP/FTP ports open on the web server, so how is it that they go about remotely administering their geographically diverse groups of servers securely?</p><p>5 0.13358985 <a title="167-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-12-Should_I_use_LAMP_or_Windows%3F.html">8 high scalability-2007-07-12-Should I use LAMP or Windows?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have 3 exp in building website using java.I work on only single server.Website is not very scalable.I always wonder how ebay,youtube,monster handle traffic, giving responses within seconds.From the google i find this site and i hope i can also able to build very scalable website .I need guidelines from where to start ,what are the things we needed.I know that scalability comes through the use of distributed applications but don't how to implement it.   I see many website build in languages other than java so java is good choice for building high scalable website.

<p>Introduction: With the explosive growth of the Internet, increasing complexity of user requirements, and wide choice of hardware, operating systems, and middleware, IT executives are facing new challenges in their application infrastructures. Rapid expansion of the application tier has resulted in significant cost and complexity, and many organizations are simply running out of datacenter space, power, and cooling.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.8555513 <a title="167-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-27-Starting_a_website_from_scratch_-_what_technologies_should_I_use%3F.html">167 high scalability-2007-11-27-Starting a website from scratch - what technologies should I use?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hi, if you were to design your own highly scalable website from scratch, what technologies would you use?     Based on Web 2.0 popularity, LAMP seems to be high in the running.  But would you tack on CakePHP?  Drupal?  or build your framework/CMS from scratch?     What version of Linux runs best for a scalable website?       Would you consider Windows and .NET?  Java?  Or do you want to throw a brick at me for even suggesting such heresies?     Would you prefer Postgres, Tomcat, Perl, Python, or any of that other *NIX fancy stuff...why or why not?     Please forget for the moment, "use what you know" argument.  I am pretty versatile, and can look for an expert in whatever platform I choose.  So all skills being equal, I'm looking for the best community support, the fastest development time and most importantly, the best scaling approach.       Let's say, for fun, that I'm planning for the website to have as many messages going back & forth as an eBay.     Definitely building this on a</p><p>4 0.83908367 <a title="167-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP.html">921 high scalability-2010-10-18-NoCAP</a></p>

<p>Introduction: You don't even have to make a bid, Randy Shoup, anÂ eBay Distinguished Architect, gives this  presentation  on how eBay scales, for free. Randy has done a fabulous job in this presentation and in other talks listed at the end of this post getting at the heart of the principles behind scalability. It's more about ideas of how things work and fit together than a focusing on a particular technology stack.
  Impressive Stats  
In case you weren't sure, eBay is big, with lots of: users, data, features, and change...
  
 Over 89 million active users worldwide 
 190 million items for sale in 50,000 categories 
 Over 8 billion URL requests per day 
 Hundreds of new features per quarter 
 Roughly 10% of items are listed or ended every day 
 In 39 countries and 10 languages 
 24x7x365 
 70 billion read / write operations / day 
 Processes 50TB of new, incremental data per day 
 Analyzes 50PB of data per day 
   10 Lessons  
The presentation does a good job explaining each lesson, but the list is.</p><p>6 0.81202173 <a title="167-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-01-Moving_Beyond_End-to-End_Path_Information_to_Optimize_CDN_Performance.html">712 high scalability-2009-10-01-Moving Beyond End-to-End Path Information to Optimize CDN Performance</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Film buffs will recognize Django as a classic 1966 spaghetti western that
spawned hundreds of imitators. Web heads will certainly first think of Django
as the classic Python based Web framework that has also spawned hundreds of
imitators and has become the gold standard framework for the web.Mike Malone,
who worked on Pownce, a blogging tool now owned by Six Apart, tells in this
very informative EuroDjangoCon presentation how Pownce scaled using Django in
the real world.I was surprised to learn how large Pounce was: hundreds of
requests/sec, thousands of DB operations/sec, millions of user relationships,
millions of notes, and terabytes of static data. Django has a lot of
functionality in the box to help you scale, but if you want to scale large it
turns out Django has some limitations and Mike tells you what these are and
also provides some code to get around them.Mike's talk-although Django
specific--will really help anyone creating applications on the web. There's a
lot of useful Dj</p><p>5 0.13893752 <a title="116-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling_Twitter%3A_Making_Twitter_10000_Percent_Faster.html">639 high scalability-2009-06-27-Scaling Twitter: Making Twitter 10000 Percent Faster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 6:Some interesting changes from Twitter'sEvan Weaver: everything in RAM
now, database is a backup; peaks at 300 tweets/second; every tweet followed by
average 126 people; vector cache of tweet IDs; row cache; fragment cache; page
cache; keep separate caches; GC makes Ruby optimization resistant so went with
Scala; Thrift and HTTP are used internally; 100s internal requests for every
external request; rewrote MQ but kept interface the same; 3 queues are used to
load balance requests; extensive A/B testing for backwards capability;
switched to C memcached client for speed; optimize critical path; faster to
get the cached results from the network memory than recompute them
locally.Update 5:Twitter on Scala. A Conversation with Steve Jenson, Alex
Payne, and Robey Pointer by Bill Venners. A fascinating discussion of why
Twitter moved to the Java JVM for their server infrastructure (long lived

<p>Introduction: Twitter has a big hairy audacious goal of reaching one billion users by 2013.
Three forces stand against Twitter. The world will end in2012. But let's be
optimistic and assume we'll make it. Next is Facebook. Currently Facebook is
the user leader with over 400 million users. Will Facebook stumble or will
they rocket to one billion users before Twitter? And lastly, there's Twitter's
"low" starting point and "slow" growth rate. Twitter currently has106
millionregistered users and adds about 300,000 new users a day. That doesn't
add up to a billion in three years. Twitter needs to triple the number of
registered users they add per day. How will Twitter reach its goal of over one
billion users served?From recent infrastructure announcements and information
gleaned atChirp (videos) and other talks, it has become a little clearer how
they hope to reach their billion user goal: 1) Make a Big Hairy Audacious Goal
2) Hire Lots of Quality People 3) Hug Developers and Users 4) Drive the

<p>Introduction: Now that the internet has become defined as a mashup over a collection of
service APIs, we have a little problem: for clients using APIs is a lot like
drinking beer through a straw. You never get as much beer as you want and you
get a headache after. But what if I've been a good boy and deserve a bigger
straw? Maybe we can use game theory to model trust relationships over a life
time of interactions over many different services and then give more
capabilities/beer to those who have earned them?breakLet's say Twitter limits
me to downloading only 20 tweets at a time through their API. But I want more.
I may even want to do something so radical as download all my tweets. Of
course Twitter can't let everyone do that. They would be swamped serving all
this traffic and service would be denied. So Twitter does that rational thing
and limits API access as a means of self protection. As does Google,
Yahoo,Skynet, and everyone else.But when I hit the API limit I think, but hey

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's Tommy Reilly.  We
atNuoDBwere recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google
Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google
Developer Live Session by clickinghere.  In order to access the capabilities
of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General
Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we
demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our
private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million
transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that
NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don't call it a
cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the
faster the database</p><p>same-blog 3 0.88307077 <a title="116-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-08-Lessons_from_Pownce_-_The_Early_Years.html">116 high scalability-2007-10-08-Lessons from Pownce - The Early Years</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pownce is a new social messaging application competing micromessage to
micromessage with the likes of Twitter and Jaiku. Still in closed beta, Pownce
has generously shared some of what they've learned so far. Like going to a
barrel tasting of a young wine and then tasting the same wine after some
aging, I think what will be really interesting is to follow Pownce and compare
the Pownce of today with the Pownce of tomorrow, after a few years spent in
the barrel. What lessons lie in wait for Pownce as they grow?Site:

<p>Introduction: Surgeis a conference put on by OmniTI targeting practical Scalability matters.
OmniTI specializes in helping people solve their scalability problems, as is
only natural, as it was founded by Theo Schlossnagle, author of the
canonicalScalable Internet Architectures. Now that Surge 2011 is on the
horizon, they've generously made available nearly all thevideos from the Surge
2010conference.  A pattern hopefully every conference will follow (only don't
wait a year please). We lose a lot of collective wisdom from events not being
available online in a timely manner.In truth, nearlyall the talksare on topic
and are worth watching, but here are a few that seem especially relevant:Going

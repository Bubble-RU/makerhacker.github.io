<p>Introduction: What's the cost of downtime to your business?  $100,000 per hour, $1,000,000
or more? The recent Volcanic ash that has grounded European flights is
estimated to be costing the airlines $200M a day. In the IT world, High
Availability (HA) architectures allow for disaster recovery as well as
uninterrupted business continuity during system failure.This post focuses on a
customer's backend, comprised of a business application stack supported by a
dozen Oracle databases. They wish to equip this infrastructure with HA
features and ensure that outages do not cost business. How do we address the
challenge of pricing the complete solution, with hardware, software, services
and annual support?Read more onBigDataMatters.com</p><p>4 0.14822486 <a title="117-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-20-VMware_to_bridge_a_DMZ.__.html">686 high scalability-2009-08-20-VMware to bridge a DMZ.  </a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hey guys,There is a renewed push at my organization to deploy
vmware...everywhere.I am rather excited as I know we have a lot of waste when
it comes to resources.What has pricked my ears up however, is the notion of
using this technology in our very busy public facing DMZ's.Today we get lots
of spikes of traffic and we are coping very well. 40x HP blades,
apache/php/perl/tomcat/ all in HA behind HA F5's and HA Checkpoint FW's. (20
servers in 2 datacentres).The idea is, we virtualise these machines, including
the firewalls onto hosts vmware clusters that span the public interface to our
internal networks. This is something that has gone against the #1 rule I have
ever lived by while working on the inet. No airgaps from the unknown to the
known!I am interested in feedback on this scenario.From a resource
perspective, our resource requirements in the DMZ will be lowered over time
due to business change and we still have a lot of head room in our capacity.Do
you think this is change for ch</p><p>5 0.14270447 <a title="117-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-10-Blog%3A_Esoteric_Curio_by_Theo_Schlossnagle.html">87 high scalability-2007-09-10-Blog: Esoteric Curio by Theo Schlossnagle</a></p>

<p>Introduction: InClient Side Load Balancing for Web 2.0 Applicationsauthor Lei Zhu suggests a
very interesting approach to load balancing: forget DNS round robbin, toss
your expensive load balancer, and make your client do the load balancing for
you. Your client maintains a list of possible servers and cycles through them.
All the details are explained in the article, but it's an intriguing idea,
especially for the budget conscious startup.</p><p>3 0.73635697 <a title="117-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-16-Product%3A_lbpool_-_Load_Balancing_JDBC_Pool.html">157 high scalability-2007-11-16-Product: lbpool - Load Balancing JDBC Pool</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From the website:Thelbpool projectprovides a load balancing JDBC driver for
use with DB connection pools. It wraps a normal JDBC driver providing
reconnect semantics in the event of additional hardware availability, partial
system failure, or uneven load distribution. It also evenly distributes all
new connections among slave DB servers in a given pool. Each time connect() is
called it will attempt to use the best server with the least system load.The
biggest scalability issue with large applications that are mostly READ bound
is the number of transactions per second that the disks in your cluster can
handle. You can generally solve this in two ways.1. Buy bigger and faster
disks with expensive RAID controllers.2. Buy CHEAP hardware on CHEAP disks but
lots of machines.We prefer the cheap hardware approach and lbpool allows you
to do this.Even if you *did* manage to use cheap hardware most load balancing
hardware is expensive, requires a redundant balancer (if it were to fail), and

<p>Introduction: Server farms achieve high scalability and high availability through server
load balancing, a technique that makes the server farm appear to clients as a
single server. In this two-part article, Gregor Roth explores server load
balancing architectures, with a focus on open source solutions. Part 1 covers
server load balancing basics and discusses the pros and cons of transport-
level server load balancing.The barrier to entry for many Internet companies
is low. Anyone with a good idea can develop a small application, purchase a
domain name, and set up a few PC-based servers to handle incoming traffic. The
initial investment is small, so the start-up risk is minimal. But a successful
low-cost infrastructure can become a serious problem quickly. A single server
that handles all the incoming requests may not have the capacity to handle
high traffic volumes once the business becomes popular. In such a situations
companies often start to scale up: they upgrade the existing infrastructure by</p><p>6 0.69661891 <a title="117-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-17-Load_Balancing_of_web_server_traffic.html">217 high scalability-2008-01-17-Load Balancing of web server traffic</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For some Friday Fun nerd style, I thought thisdemonstration from Bashoon the
difference between single master, sharding, and consistent smashing was really
clever. I love the use of safety glasses! And it's harder to crash a server
with a hammer than you might think...Recommended reading:http://labs.google.co

<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability
load balanced system using mod backhand andWackamole. The idea is you don't
need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of
the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-
based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read.
Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a
resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of
effect of keep-alives on performance.</p><p>3 0.84502816 <a title="117-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-18-Database_Design_101.html">281 high scalability-2008-03-18-Database Design 101</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I am working on the design for my database and can't seem to come up with a
firm schema. I am torn between normalizing the data and dealing with the
overhead of joins and denormalizing it for easy sharding. The data is
essentially music information per user: UserID, Artist, Album, Song. This
lends itself nicely to be normalized and have separate User, Artist, Album and
Song databases with a table full of INTs to tie them together. This will be in
a mostly read based environment and with about 80% being searches of data by
artist album or song. By the time I begin the query for artist, album or song
I will already have a list of UserID's to limit the search by. The problem is
that the tables can get unmanageably large pretty quickly and my plan was to
shard off users once it got too big. Given this simple data relationship what
are the pros and cons of normalizing the data vs denormalizing it? Should I go
with 4 separate, normalized tables or one 4 column table? Perhaps it might be
best</p><p>4 0.81945986 <a title="117-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-20-what_is_j2ee_stack.html">162 high scalability-2007-11-20-what is j2ee stack</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With BigData comes BigStorage costs. One way to store less is simplynot to
store the same data twice. That's the radically simple and powerful notion
behind data deduplication. If you are one of those who got a good laugh out of
the idea of eliminating SQL queries as a rather obvious scalability strategy,
you'll love this one, but it is a powerful feature and one I don't hear talked
about outside the enterprise. A parallel idea in programming is the once-and-
only-once principle of never duplicating code.Using deduplication technology,
for some upfront CPU usage, which is a plentiful resource in many systems that
are IO bound anyway, it's possible to reduce storage requirements by upto
20:1, depending on your data, which saves both money and disk write overhead.
This comes up because of really good article Robin Harris of StorageMojo
wrote, All de-dup works, on a paper,  A Study of Practical Deduplication by
Dutch Meyer and William Bolosky, For a great explanation of deduplication we

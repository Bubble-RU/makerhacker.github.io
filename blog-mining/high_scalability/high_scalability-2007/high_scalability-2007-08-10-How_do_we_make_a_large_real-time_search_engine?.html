Cormack, both of the University of Waterloo. The full table of contents is on-
line and looks to be really interesting:Information retrieval is the
foundation for modern search engines. This text offers an introduction to the
core topics underlying modern search technologies, including algorithms, data
structures, indexing, retrieval, and evaluation. The emphasis is on
implementation and experimentation; each chapter includes exercises and
suggestions for student projects.Currently available is the full text of
chapters: Introduction, Basic Techniques, Static Inverted Indices, Index

<p>Introduction: InCool spatial algos with Neo4j: Part 1 - Routing with A* in RubyPeter
Neubauer not only does a fantastic job explaining a complicated routing
algorithm using the graph databaseNeo4j, but he surfaces an interesting
architectural conundrum:make it really fast so work can be done on the reads
or do all the work on the writes so the reads are really fast.The money quote
pointing out the competing options is:[Being] able to do these calculations in
sub-second speeds on graphs of millions of roads and waypoints makes it
possible in many cases to abandon the normal approach ofprecomputing indexes
with K/V stores and be able to put routing into the critical path with the
possibility to adapt to the live conditions and build highly personalized and
dynamic spatial services.ďťżThe poster boys for the precompute strategy

geodata." Their strategy forhandling geodata is touse Cassandra and build two

like to execute search jobs asynchronously (with a job queuing system).But i
don't know if it is a good design... Why ?Search results can be large ! (eg:
100+ pages with 25 documents per page)With asynchronous sytem, I need to store
results for each search job.I can set a short expiration time (~5 min) for
each search result, but it's still large.What do you think about it ?Which

<p>Introduction: I have a table .This table has many columns but search performed based on 1
columns ,this table can have more than million rows.The data in these columns
is something like funny,new york,hollywoodUser can search with parameters as
funny hollywood .I need to take this 2 words and then search on column whether
that column contain this words and how many times .It is not possible to index
here .If the results return say 1200 results then without comparing each and
every column i can't determine no of results.I need to compare for each and
every column.This query is very frequent .How can i approach for this
problem.What type of architecture,tools is helpful.I just know that this can
be accomplished with distributed system but how can i make this system. I also
see in this website that LinkedIn uses Lucene for search .Is Lucene is helpful
in my case.My table has also lots of insertion ,however updation in not very
frequent.</p><p>3 0.77158946 <a title="64-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-28-Job_queue_and_search_engine.html">332 high scalability-2008-05-28-Job queue and search engine</a></p>

Representation technologies a new form of Web Search Engine that will unleash
a revolution of new possibilities. Introduction to Snippet SearchToday, The
Web Search Engine's is the Web getaway, especially to get specific
information. But unfortunately the search engines didn't changed mush as the
Web changed from 90's.Since the 90's the Web search engine still provide the
same kind of results: Links to documents. We in Kngine think that it's the
time to rethink abo</p><p>5 0.73080218 <a title="64-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-14-kngine_%27Knowledge_Engine%27_milestone_2.html">630 high scalability-2009-06-14-kngine 'Knowledge Engine' milestone 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Kngine is Knowledge Web search engine designed to provide meaningful search
results, such as: semantic information about the keywords/concepts, answer the
user's questions, discover the relations between the keywords/concepts, and
link the different kind of data together, such as: Movies, Subtitles, Photos,
Price at sale store, User reviews, and Influenced storyGoalsKngine long-term
goal is to make all human beings systematic knowledge and experience
accessible to everyone. I aim to collect and organize all objective data, and
make it possible and easy to access. Our goal is to build on the advances of
Web search engine, semantic web, data representation technologies a new form
of Web search engine that will unleash a revolution of new
possibilities.Kngine tries to combine the power of Web search engines with the
power of Semantic search and the data representation to provide meaningful
search results compromising user needs.StatusKngine starts as a research

<p>Introduction: The key (no pun intended) to understanding how to organize your dataset’s data
is to think of each shard not as an individual database, but as one large
singular database. Just as in a normal single server database setup where you
have a unique key for each row within a table, each row key within each
individual shard must be unique to the whole dataset partitioned across all

<p>Introduction: We're implementing a website which should be oriented to content and with
massive access by public and we would need a search engine to index and
execute queries on the indexes of contents (stored in a database, most likely
MySQL InnoDB or Oracle).The solution we found is to implement a separate
service to make index constantly the contents of the database at regular
intervals. Anyway, this is a complex and not optimal solution, since we would
like it to index in real time and make it searchable.Could you point me to
some examples or articles I could review to design asolution for such this
context?</p><p>3 0.91179264 <a title="64-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-29-Google_App_Engine_plus_Amazon_AWS%3A_Best_of_both_worlds.html">641 high scalability-2009-06-29-Google App Engine plus Amazon AWS: Best of both worlds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Google App Engine (GAE) is focused on making development easy, but limits your
options. Amazon Web Services is focused on making development flexible, but
complicates the development process. Real enterprise applications require both
of these paradigms to achieve successâ&euro;Ś What we really want is the flexibility
of AWS and the simplicity of GAE.For the rest of the post see

<p>Introduction: Hello everyone,I'm designing a website/widget that my business partner and I
expect to serve millions of hits daily. As such we must shard our database
(and we're designing with shards in mind right from the beginning). However,
the one thing I haven't been able to figure out from Googling is the best
hardware to go with for shards. I'm using exclusively InnoDB tables.We'll
(eventually) be running 3 groups of database servers:a) Session servers for
php sessions. These will have a very high write volume.b) ID servers. These
will match a couple primary indices (such as user ID) to a given shard. These
will have an intense read load, plus a moderate amount of writes.c) Shard
servers. These will hold the bulk of the data. These will have a high read
load and a lowish write load.Group A is done as a database instead of using
memcached so users aren't logged out if a memcached server goes down. As the
write load is high, a pair of high performance master-master servers seems
obvious. What's</p><p>5 0.90539497 <a title="64-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-22-SLAs_in_the_SaaS_space.html">475 high scalability-2008-12-22-SLAs in the SaaS space</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This may be a bit higher level then the general discussion here, but I think
this is an important issue in how it relates to reliability and uptime. What
kind of SLAs should we be expecting from SaaS services and platforms (e.g.
AWS, Google App Engine, Google Premium Apps, salesforce.com, etc.)? Up to
today, most SaaS services either have no SLAs or offer very weak penalties.
What will it take to get these services up to the point where they can offer
the SLAs that users (and more importantly, businesses) require? I presume most
of the members here want to see more movement into the cloud and to SaaS
services, and I'm thinking that until we see more substantial SLA guarantees,
most businesses will continue to shy away as long as they can.Would love to
hear what others think. Or am I totally off base?</p><p>6 0.90458786 <a title="64-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-04-28-PaaS_on_OpenStack_-_Run_Applications_on_Any_Cloud%2C_Any_Time_Using_Any_Thing.html">1031 high scalability-2011-04-28-PaaS on OpenStack - Run Applications on Any Cloud, Any Time Using Any Thing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: ThemBid provides a market where people needing work done broadcast their
request and accept bids from people competing for the job. Unlike many of the
sites profiled at HighScalability, ThemBid is not in the popular press as
often as Paris Hilton. It's not a media darling or a giant of the industry.
But what I like is they have a strategy, a point-of-view for building websites
and were gracious enough to share very detailed instructions on how to go
about building a website. They even delve into actual installation details of
the various software packages they use. Anyone can benefit by taking a look at
their work.Site: http://www.thembid.com/Information SourcesBuild Scalable Web

<p>Introduction: ThePort Network's Director of Engineering, TJ Muehleman was kind of enough to
share some of the architectural details for their white label social media
system. It currently runs about 50 social networks varying in size from less
than 1000 members to more than 300,000 members, all on a Microsoft stack. In
addition to their social networking platform, they offer Javascript APIs and
web service APIs (both REST and SOAP) which account for a significant
percentage of overall system usage.ThePort is an excellent example of a real
world in-the-trenches product offering real value to customers. One of the
most interesting problems they have to solve is multi-tenancy. How do you
provide good performance, complete customization, support, develop new
features, and provide individual search indexes for each customer? It's not an
easy problem to solve.How did they solve their problems and build a successful
system? Site: http://theport.comPlatformMicrosoft.NET 3.5C# / VB.NETSQL Server

<p>Introduction: This is a guest a post by Alvaro Videla describing their architecture
forPoppen.de, a popular German dating site. This site is very much NSFW, so be
careful before clicking on the link. What I found most interesting is how they
manage to sucessfully blend a little of the old with a little of the new,
using technologies like Nginx, MySQL, CouchDB, and Erlang, Memcached,
RabbitMQ, PHP, Graphite, Red5, and Tsung.What is Poppen.de?Poppen.de (NSFW) is
the top dating website in Germany, and while it may be a small site compared
to giants like Flickr or Facebook, we believe it's a nice architecture to
learn from if you are starting to get some scaling problems.The Stats2.000.000

<p>Introduction: GigaSpaces launchedOpenSpaces.org, a community web site for developers who
wish to utilize and contribute to the open sourceOpenSpaces development
framework.OpenSpaces extends the Spring Framework for enterprise Java
development, and leverages theGigaSpaces eXtreme Application Platform(XAP) for
data caching, messaging and as the container for application business logic.
It is designed for building highly-available, scale-out applications in
distributed environments, such as SOA, cloud computing, grids and commodity
servers. OpenSpaces is widely used in a variety of industries, including
financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing and retail -- and across
the web in e-commerce, Web 2.0 applications such as social networking sites,
search and more.breakOpenSpaces.org already lists more than two
dozenprojectssubmitted by the developer community, including GigaSpaces
customers, partners and employees. Innovative projects include an instant

<p>Introduction: How do you evaluate and decide which web technologies (and there are myriads
out there) to use for your new web application, which one potentially gives
you the best performance, which one will likely give you the shortest time-to-
market? The Apache incubator projectOliomight help.Olio is a is an open source
web 2.0 toolkit to help evaluate the suitability, functionality and
performance of web technologies. Olio defines an example web2.0 application
(an events site somewhat like yahoo.com/upcoming) and provides three initial
implementations : PHP, Java EE and RubyOnRails (ROR). The toolkit also defines
ways to drive load against the application in order to measure
performance.Apache Olio could be used toUnderstand how to use various web 2.0
technologies such as AJAX, memcached, mogileFS etc. Use the code in the
application to understand the subtle complexities involved and how to get
around issues with these technologies.Evaluate the differences in the three
implementations: php, ruby</p><p>5 0.67778701 <a title="31-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-30-Product%3A_Yslow_to_speed_up_your_web_pages.html">47 high scalability-2007-07-30-Product: Yslow to speed up your web pages</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's Tommy Reilly.  We
atNuoDBwere recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google
Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google
Developer Live Session by clickinghere.  In order to access the capabilities
of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General
Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we
demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our
private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million
transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that
NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don't call it a
cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the
faster the database</p><p>same-blog 5 0.83316118 <a title="31-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_Symfony_a_Web_Framework.html">31 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: Symfony a Web Framework</a></p>

development, thoroughly tried on several active websites, symfony aims to
speed up the creation and maintenance of web applications, and to replace the
repetitive coding tasks by power, control and pleasure.Symfony provides a lot

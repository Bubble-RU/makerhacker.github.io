<p>Introduction: Unlike Theo Schlossnagle, author ofScalable Internet Architectures, I am not a
stickler for semantics because I have an unswerving faith in the ultimate
unknowability of the world as experienced by others. That's why it is Theo who
bravely tackles the differences in his informative blog postPartitioning vs.
Federation vs. Sharding. Royans Tharakan also talks about it on hisblog.Is
there a difference and does it really matter to all our intrepid scalable
website builders?breakGenerally whatever Theo says is probably close to the
truth. Yet, in my mind I think of partitioning as abasic level categoryand
federation and sharding as more specific (subordinate) instances of
partitioning. And partitioning is a more specific instance of the more more
general (superordinate) category divide-and-conquer. Which isn't a useful way
to think about the topic at all.So, let's say federation is like Star Trek.

<p>Introduction: One of the top recommendations from the collective wisdom contained inReal
Life Architecturesis to addmonitoringto your system. Now! Loud is the lament
for not adding monitoring early and often. The reason is easy to understand.
Without monitoring you don't know what your system is doing which means you
can't fix it and you can't improve it. Feedback loops require data.Some
popular monitor options are Munin, Nagios, Cacti and Hyperic. A relatively new
entrant is a product called Reconnoiter from Theo Schlossnagle, President and
CEO of OmniTI, leading consultants on solving problems of scalability,
performance, architecture, infrastructure, and data management. Theo's name
might sound familiar. He gives lots of talks and is the author of the very
influentialScalable Internet Architecturesbook.So right away you know
Reconnoiter has a good pedigree. As Theo says, their products are born of
pain, from the fire of solving real-life problems and that's always a
harbinger of good things to co</p><p>5 0.14270447 <a title="87-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-08-Paper%3A_Understanding_and_Building_High_Availability-Load_Balanced_Clusters.html">117 high scalability-2007-10-08-Paper: Understanding and Building High Availability-Load Balanced Clusters</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A superb explanation by Theo Schlossnagle of how to deploy a high availability
load balanced system using mod backhand andWackamole. The idea is you don't
need to buy expensive redundant hardware load balancers, you can make use of
the hosts you already have to the same effect. The discussion of using peer-
based HA solutions versus a single front-end HA device is well worth the read.
Another interesting perspective in the document is to view load balancing as a
resource allocation problem. There's also a nice discussion of the negative of
effect of keep-alives on performance.</p><p>6 0.11979787 <a title="87-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-The_Implications_of_Punctuated_Scalabilium_for_Website_Architecture.html">533 high scalability-2009-03-11-The Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As a developer, you are aware of the increasing concern amongst developers and
site architects that websites be able to handle the vast number of visitors
that flood the Internet on a daily basis. Scalable Internet Architecture
addresses these concerns by teaching you both good and bad design
methodologies for building new sites and how to scale existing websites to
robust, high-availability websites. Primarily example-based, the book
discusses major topics in web architectural design, presenting existing
solutions and how they work. Technology budget tight? This book will work for
you, too, as it introduces new and innovative concepts to solving
traditionally expensive problems without a large technology budget. Using open
source and proprietary examples, you will be engaged in best practice design
methodologies for building new sites, as well as appropriately scaling both
growing and shrinking sites. Website development help has arrived in the form
of Scalable Internet Architecture.</p><p>6 0.62250787 <a title="87-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-09-10-Blog%3A_Scalable_Web_Architectures_by_Royans_Tharakan.html">88 high scalability-2007-09-10-Blog: Scalable Web Architectures by Royans Tharakan</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have two servers connected via Internet (NOT IN THE SAME LAN) serving the
same website (http://www.ourexample.com).The problem is files uploaded on
serverA and serverB cannot see each other immediately,thus rsync with certain
intervals is not a good solution.Can anybody give me some advice on the
following options?1.NFS over Internet for file sharing2.sshfs3.inotify(our
system's kernel does not support this and we donot want to risk upgrading our
kernel as well)4.drbd in active-active mode5 or any other solutionsAny
suggestions will be welcomed.Thank you in advance.</p><p>5 0.65662974 <a title="87-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-04-08-NuoDB%27s_First_Experience%3A_Google_Compute_Engine_-_1.8_Million_Transactions_Per_Second.html">1437 high scalability-2013-04-08-NuoDB's First Experience: Google Compute Engine - 1.8 Million Transactions Per Second</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a repost of the blog entry written by NuoDB's Tommy Reilly.  We
atNuoDBwere recently given the opportunity to kick the tires on the Google
Compute Engine by our friends over at Google. You can watch the entire Google
Developer Live Session by clickinghere.  In order to access the capabilities
of GCE we decided to run the same YCSB based benchmark we ran at our General
Availability Launch back in January. For those of you who missed it we
demonstrated running the YCSB benchmark on a 24 machine cluster running on our
private cloud in the NuoDB datacenter. The salient results were 1.7 million
transactions per second with sub-millisecond latencies.Public cloud
environments typically mean virtualization, inconsistent network performance
and potentially slow or low bandwidth disk access. It just so happens that
NuoDB was designed to work well in such harsh environments (we don't call it a
cloud database for nothing). Still, the faster the CPU, network and disk the
faster the database</p><p>6 0.6538353 <a title="87-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-26-Product%3A_Symfony_a_Web_Framework.html">31 high scalability-2007-07-26-Product: Symfony a Web Framework</a></p>

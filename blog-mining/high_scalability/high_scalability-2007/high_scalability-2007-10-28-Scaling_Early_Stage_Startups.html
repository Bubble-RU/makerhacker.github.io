<p>Introduction: One of the best projects I've ever worked on was creating a large scale web site publishing system that was almost entirely static. A large team of very talented creatives made the art work, writers penned the content, and designers generated templates. All assets were controlled in a database. Then all that was extracted, after applying many different filters, to a static site that was uploaded via ftp to dozens of web servers. It worked great. Reliable, fast, cheap, and simple. Updates were a bit of a pain as it required pushing a lot of files to a lot of servers, and that took time, but otherwise a solid system.
 
 Alas, this elegant system was replaced with a new fangled dynamic database based system. Content was pulled from a database using a dynamic language generated front-end. With a recent series of posts from Amazon's Werner Vogels, chronicling his experience of transforming his   All Things Distributed   blog into a static site using S3's ability to serve web pages, I get th</p><p>3 0.14932922 <a title="136-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-03-12-YouTube_Architecture.html">274 high scalability-2008-03-12-YouTube Architecture</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Update 2:   YouTube Reaches One Billion Views Per Day .  That’s at least 11,574 views per second, 694,444 views per minute, and 41,666,667 views per hour.     Update:   YouTube: The Platform . YouTube adds a new rich set of APIs in order to become your video platform leader--all for free. Upload, edit, watch, search, and comment on video from your own site without visiting YouTube. Compose your site internally from APIs because you'll need to expose them later anyway.   YouTube grew incredibly fast, to over 100 million video views per day, with only a handful of people responsible for scaling the site. How did they manage to deliver all that video to all those users? And how have they evolved since being acquired by Google?

<p>Introduction: I am in the design phase of getting a website up and running that will have scalability as a main concern.  I am looking for opinions on architecture and the like for this endeavor.     The site has a few unique characteristics that make scalability difficult.  Users will all have a pretty large amount of data that other users will be able to search.  The site will be entirely based around search.  The catch is that other users will be searching always with a stipulation of 'n' miles from me.  I imagine that fact will kill the possibility of query caching for most searches.     I have extensive experience with PHP and MYSQL, some experience with ASP.NET/C#, some experience with perl but can learn anything fast.  The site will start out on a single server but I want to be 100% certain that I architect the code and databases such that scaling will be simple.     What language should I code the site in?  What DB would you use: Postgres, MYSQL, MSSQL, BerkelyDB?  Should we shard the databa</p><p>5 0.13257048 <a title="136-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-02-13-What%27s_your_scalability_plan%3F.html">248 high scalability-2008-02-13-What's your scalability plan?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you plan to scale your system as you reach predictable milestones? This topic came up in another venue and it reminded me about a great comment an Anonymous wrote a while ago and I wanted to make sure that comment didn't get lost.      The Anonymous scaling plan was relatively simple and direct:    My two cents on what I'm using to start a website from scratch using a single server for now. Later, I'll scale out horizontally when the need arises.   Phase 1            Single Server, Dual Quad-Core 2.66, 8gb RAM, 500gb Disk Raid 10   OS: Fedora 8. You could go with pretty much any Linux though. I like Fedora 8 best for servers.   Proxy Cache: Varnish - it is way faster than Squid per my own benchmarks. Squid chokes bigtime.   Web Server: Lighttpd - faster than Apache 2 and easier to configure for me.   Object Cache: Memcached. Very scalable.   PHP Cache: APC. Easy to configure and seems to work fine.   Language: PHP 5 - no bloated frameworks, waste of time for me. You spend too mu</p><p>6 0.12737282 <a title="136-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-07-12-Creating_Scalable_Digital_Libraries.html">856 high scalability-2010-07-12-Creating Scalable Digital Libraries</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the article  The  Onion Uses Django, And Why It Matters To Us , a lot of interesting points are made about their ambitious infrastructure move from Drupal/PHP to Django/Python: the move wasn't that hard, it just took time and work because of their previous experience moving the A.V. Club website; churn in core framework APIs make it more attractive to move than stay; supporting the structure of older versions of the site is an unsolved problem; the built-in Django admin saved a lot of work; group development is easier with "fewer specialized or hacked together pieces"; they use IRC for distributed development; sphinx for full-text search; nginx is the media server and reverse proxy; haproxy made the launch process a 5  second procedure; capistrano for deployment; clean component separation makes moving easier; Git for version control; ORM with complicated querysets is a performance problem; memcached for caching rendered pages; the CDN checks for updates every 10 minutes; videos, ar</p><p>3 0.79863417 <a title="136-lsi-3" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-06-Super_Bowl_Advertisers_Ready_for_the_Traffic%3F_Nope..It%27s_Lights_Out..html">1401 high scalability-2013-02-06-Super Bowl Advertisers Ready for the Traffic? Nope..It's Lights Out.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Advertising for the Super Bowl is bigger than the game for many viewers. So you gotta figure advertisers are ready for the traffic bursts generated by their expensive ads? Not exactly...
 
Yottaa  reports an amazing 13 advertiser websites crashed  during the Super Bowl. Coke was interactively au currant, asking viewers to vote for the ending of a commercial, but load times went to 62 seconds. SodaStream, Calvin Klein, Axe, Got Milk? The Walking Dead, many movie sites, and many car sites, all were flagged with delay of fame penalties.
 
Lots of time, money, and creative energy is spent lovingly perfecting every detail of these commercials. It won't be a surprise to any programmer that this can't usually be said of the follow through on the backend.
 
So what can you do? Yottaa has some good tips and Michael Hamrah has a wonderful post on dealing with the Super Bowl Burst Problem:

<p>Introduction: This is what  Mike Peters says he can do : make your site run 10 times faster. His test bed is "half a dozen servers parsing 200,000 pages per hour over 40 IP addresses, 24 hours a day." Before optimization CPU spiked to 90% with 50 concurrent connections. After optimization each machine "was effectively handling 500 concurrent connections per second with CPU at 8% and no degradation in performance."  Mike identifies six major bottlenecks:
   Database write access (read is cheaper)    Database read access    PHP, ASP, JSP and any other server side scripting    Client side JavaScript    Multiple/Fat Images, scripts or css files from different domains on your page    Slow keep-alive client connections, clogging your available sockets   Mike's solutions:      Switch all database writes to offline processing    Minimize number of database read access to the bare minimum.

 Alas, this elegant system was replaced with a new fangled dynamic database based system. Content was pulled from a database using a dynamic language generated front-end.

<p>Introduction: Snooze   is an open-source, scalable, autonomic, and energy-efficient  virtual machine (VM) management framework for private clouds. Similarly  to other VM management frameworks such as Nimbus, OpenNebula,  Eucalyptus, and OpenStack it allows to build compute infrastructures  from virtualized resources. Particularly, once installed and configured  users can submit and control the life-cycle of a large number of VMs.  However, contrary to existing frameworks for scalability and fault  tolerance, Snooze employs a self-organizing and healing (based on Apache ZooKeeper) hierarchical  architecture. Moreover, it performs distributed VM management and is  designed to be energy efficient. Therefore, it implements features to  monitor and estimate VM resource (CPU, memory, network Rx, network Tx)  demands, detect and resolve overload/underload situations, perform  dynamic VM consolidation through live migration, and finally power  management to save energy. Last but not least, it integrates a g</p><p>2 0.91912669 <a title="136-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-26-Paper%3A_Wikipedia%27s_Site_Internals%2C_Configuration%2C_Code_Examples_and_Management_Issues.html">134 high scalability-2007-10-26-Paper: Wikipedia's Site Internals, Configuration, Code Examples and Management Issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Wikipedia and  Wikimedia  have some of the best, most complete real-world documentation on how to build highly scalable systems. This paper by Domas Mituzas covers a lot of details about how Wikipedia works, including: an overview of the different packages used (Linux, PowerDNS, LVS, Squid, lighttpd, Apache, PHP5, Lucene, Mono, Memcached), how they use their CDN,   how caching works, how they profile their code, how they store their media, how they structure their database access, how they handle search, how they handle load balancing and administration. All with real code examples and examples of configuration files. This is a really useful resource.

<p>Introduction: These are from  Laura Thomson of OmniTi :  
  Profile early, profile often.  Pick a profiling tool and learn it in and out.  
  Dev-ops cooperation is essential.  The most critical difference in organizations that handles crises well. 
  Test on production data.  Code behavior (especially performance) is often data driven. 
  Track and trend.  Understanding your historical performance characteristics is essential for spotting emerging problems. 
  Assumptions will burn you.  Systems are complex and often break in unexpected ways. 
  Decouple.  Isolate performance failures. 
  Cache.  Caching is the core of most optimizations. 
  Federate.  Data federation is taking a single data set and spreading it across multiple database/application servers. 
  Replicate.  Replication is making synchronized copies of data available in more than one place. 
  Avoid straining hard-to-scale resources.  Some resources are inherently hard to scale: Uncacheable’ data, Data with a very high read+write rate</p><p>4 0.90524673 <a title="136-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-04-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_February_4%2C_2010.html">771 high scalability-2010-02-04-Hot Scalability Links for February 4, 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lots of cool stuff happening this week...
  
  Voldemort gets rebalancing.  It's one thing to shard data to scale, it's a completely different level of functionality to manage those shards intelligently. Voldemort has stepped up by adding advanced rebalancing functionality: Dynamic addition of new nodes to the cluster; Deletion of nodes from cluster; Load balancing of data inside a cluster. 
  Microsoft Finally Opens Azure for Business.   Out of the blue Microsoft opens up their platform as a service service. Good to have more competition and we'll keep an eye out for experience reports. 
  New details on LinkedIn architecture  by Greg Linden.  LinkedIn appears to only use caching minimally, preferring to spend their efforts and machine resources on making sure they can recompute computations quickly than on hiding poor performance behind caching layers .

<p>Introduction: With the  Google IO Developer Conference  completed there are  dozens and dozens  of information packed videos now available. While you won't get any of the nifty free swag the attendees rake in, it's great of Google to make these videos available so quickly after the conference. 
 
Let's say you don't want to watch all the videos on the pretense you have a life, here are just a dozen scalability and architecture related videos you might find interesting:
  
  App Engine Backends  by Justin Haugh, Greg Darke. One of this biggest complaints about GAE are the request deadlines. Those are now gone when you rent a new Backend node.

Good discussion of scaling and why it's hard; 10,000 queries per second is a large app that needs good architecting; a good discussion of GAE's predictive scaling formula of how it decides w</p><p>6 0.90118331 <a title="136-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-04-30-Masstree_-_Much_Faster_than_MongoDB%2C_VoltDB%2C_Redis%2C_and_Competitive_with_Memcached.html">1236 high scalability-2012-04-30-Masstree - Much Faster than MongoDB, VoltDB, Redis, and Competitive with Memcached</a></p>

</p><p>6 By the looks of the full plates and the sounds of energetic chatter, it was likely a bit of both. [sent-9, score-0.16]
</p><p>7 My take on OpenSocial: code social application once, run anywhere. [sent-14, score-0.344]
</p><p>8 Code your social app using Google's gadget model and the social API and it will run on any conforming social network container. [sent-15, score-1.373]
</p><p>9 It's kind of like a concurrency model based on mobile threads instead of the more traditional message passing model. [sent-16, score-0.277]
</p><p>10 Interestingly, there's a layer of indirection the social network container has to locally interpret what things like friends are. [sent-18, score-0.898]

</p><p>14 OpenSocial is a group of companies so you hear a lot of things like "we'll have to meet and decide that. [sent-26, score-0.165]
</p><p>15 What I don't quite understand is how social networks will distinguish themselves from each other with a common API? [sent-30, score-0.43]
</p><p>16 Using the standard your app will run anywhere so why should I choose a particular social graph provider? [sent-31, score-0.484]
</p><p>17 They were already talking about using reflection so you could discover what capabilities a container had. [sent-33, score-0.376]
</p><p>18 On the bright side there was a properties like data store you could use to store data in. [sent-39, score-0.177]
</p><p>19 The amount of data, types, query model, transaction model, locking model, SLAs, etc seemed open, but not managing state is a big win. [sent-40, score-0.108]
</p><p>20 From a scalable development POV, I can't help but think the drive towards differentiation will require special coding for each target container and you'll have to pick just a few containers to develop for (think browser wars times 100), but we'll see. [sent-41, score-0.266]

<p>Introduction: One of the premier scaling strategies is always: get someone else to do the work for you.  But unlike Huckleberry Finn in  Tom Sawyer , you won't have to trick anyone into whitewashing a fence for you. Times have changed. Companies like  Ning ,  Facebook , and  Salesforce  are more than happy to help. Their price: lock-in.   Previously you had few options when building a "real" website. You needed to do everything yourself. Infrastructure and application were all yours. Then companies stepped in by commoditizing parts of the infrastructure, but the application was still yours. The next step is full on Borg take no prisoners assimilation where the infrastructure and application are built as one collective. What you have to decide as someone faced with building a scalable website is if these new options are worth the price.
 
Feeding this explosion of choice is one of the new strategy games on the intertubes: the Internet Platform Game. Ning's Marc Andreessen defines a  platform  as:  a</p><p>5 0.18503782 <a title="183-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-10-13-Why_are_Facebook%2C_Digg%2C_and_Twitter_so_hard_to_scale%3F.html">721 high scalability-2009-10-13-Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Real-time social graphs (connectivity between people, places, and things). That's why scaling Facebook is hard  says Jeff Rothschild , Vice President of Technology at Facebook. Social networking sites like Facebook, Digg, and Twitter are simply harder than traditional websites to scale. Why is that? Why would social networking sites be any more difficult to scale than traditional web sites? Let's find out.
 
Traditional websites are easier to scale than social networking sites for two reasons:
  
 They usually access only their own data and common cached data. 
 Only 1-2% of users are active on the site at one time. 
  
Imagine a huge site like Yahoo. When you come to Yahoo they can get your profile record with one get and that's enough to build your view of the website for you. It's relatively straightforward to scale systems based around single records using  distributed hashing schemes . And since only a few percent of the people are on the site at once it takes comparatively little</p><p>6 0.14292598 <a title="183-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-05-02-Friends_for_Sale_Architecture_-_A_300_Million_Page_View-Month_Facebook_RoR_App.html">313 high scalability-2008-05-02-Friends for Sale Architecture - A 300 Million Page View-Month Facebook RoR App</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We saw in  Why are Facebook, Digg, and Twitter so hard to scale?  scaling social networks is a lot harder than you might think. This paper,  Scaling Online Social Networks without Pains , from a team at Telefonica Research in Spain hopes to meet the challenge of status distribution, user generated content distribution, and managing the social graph through a technique they call  One-Hop Replication  (OHR). OHR  abstracts and delegates the complexity of scaling up from the social network application . The abstract:   
 Online Social Networks (OSN) face serious scalability challenges due to their rapid growth and popularity. To address this issue we present a novel approach to scale up OSN called One Hop Replication (OHR). Our system combines partitioning and replication in a middleware to transparently scale up a centralized OSN design, and therefore, avoid the OSN application to undergo the costly transition to a fully distributed system to meet its scalability needs. OHR exploits some</p><p>5 0.72609407 <a title="183-lsi-5" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-08-09-NoSQL%3A_If_Only_It_Was_That_Easy.html">677 high scalability-2009-08-09-NoSQL: If Only It Was That Easy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Forrester released their new wave report:  T he Forrester Wave™: Elastic Caching Platforms, Q2 2010  where they listed GigaSpaces, IBM, Oracle, and Terracotta as leading vendors in the field. In this post I'd like to take some time to explain what some of these terms mean, and why they’re important to you. I’ll start with a definition of Elastic Data Grid (Elastic Caching), how it is different then other caching and NoSQL alternatives, and more importantly -- I'll illustrate how it works through some real code examples.

<p>Introduction: Software design patterns are an emerging tool for guiding and documenting system design. Patterns usually describe software abstractions used by advanced designers and programmers in their software. Patterns can provide guidance for designing highly scalable distributed systems. Let's see how!     Patterns are in essence solutions to problems. Most of them are expressed in a format called   Alexandrian form which draws on constructs used by Christopher Alexander. There are variants but most look like this:     The pattern name   The problem the pattern is trying to solve     Context   Solution   Examples   Design rationale: This tells where the pattern came from, why it works, and why experts use it       Patterns rarely stand alone. Each pattern works on a context, and transforms the system in that context to produce a new system in a new context. New problems arise in the new system and context, and the next ‘‘layer’’ of patterns can be applied.

<p>Introduction: Update: Facebook pulls a Microsoft and embraces and extends by opening their platform to other social sites like Bebo. Very smart and unexpected. More info at  Facebook to let other sites access platform code .      This month's regular Facebook   Meetup   was held at Google and the topic of the day was   OpenSocial  . For those of you with real lives, OpenSocial "provides a common set of APIs for social applications across multiple websites." Over 200 excited people, hoping to do very exciting things, and dreaming of making an exciting pile of money, watched an OpenSocial presentation put on by a couple of appropriately knowledgeable evangelists. I could feel my social graph being more successfully monetized with each passing minute.      Normally the meetings are much smaller, but Google puts on a very nice spread, so I think people may have showed up to dine :-) Or they could have showed up to learn why and how they should code to the new uber social API.

<p>Introduction: In many posts, such as:  The Future of the Parallelism and its Challenges  I mentioned that synchronization the access to the shared resource is the major challenge to write parallel code.
 
The synchronization and coordination take long time from the overall execution time, which reduce the benefits of the parallelism; the synchronization and coordination also reduce the scalability.
 
There are many forms of synchronization and coordination, such as:
  
 Create Task object in frameworks such as: Microsoft TPL, Intel TDD, and Parallel Runtime Library. Create and enqueue task objects require synchronization that it’s takes long time especially if we create it into recursive work such as: Quick Sort algorithm. 
 Synchronization the access to shared data. 
  
But there are a few techniques to avoid these issues, such as: Shared-Nothing, Actor Model, and Hyper Object (A.K.A. Combinable Object). Simply if we reduce the shared data by re-architect our code this will gives us a huge benefits</p><p>6 0.88689315 <a title="183-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-06-01-Why_is_your_network_so_slow%3F_Your_switch_should_tell_you..html">1051 high scalability-2011-06-01-Why is your network so slow?

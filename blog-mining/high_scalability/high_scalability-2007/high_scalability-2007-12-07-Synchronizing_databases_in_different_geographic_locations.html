<p>Introduction: We build web applications…and there are plenty of them around. Now, if we hit
the jackpot and our application becomes very popular, traffic goes up, and our
servers are brought down by the hordes of people coming to our website. What
do we do in that situation?Of course, I am not talking here about the kind of
traffic Digg, Yahoo Buzz or other social media sites can bring to a website,
which is temporary overnight traffic, or a website which uses cloud computing
like Amazon EC2 service, MediaTemple Grid Service or Mosso Hosting Cloud
service.I am talking about traffic that consistently increases over time as
the service achieves success. Google.com, Yahoo.com, Myspace.com,
Facebook.com, Plentyoffish.com, Linkedin.com, Youtube.com and others are
examples of services which have constant high traffic.Knowing that users want
speed from their applications, these services will always use a Content

<p>Introduction: Like many other media content providers, libraries and museums are
increasingly moving their content onto the Web.  While the move itself is no
easy process (with digitization, web development, and training costs), being
able to successfully deliver content to a wide audience is an ongoing concern,
particularly for large libraries.Much of the concern is financial, as most
libraries do not have the internal budget or outside investors that for-profit
businesses enjoy.  Even large university libraries will face serious budget
constraints that even other university departments, such as science and
technology would not face.Creating a scalable infrastructure and also
distributing a large digital collection that can handle multiple requests,
requires planning that many librarians have not even imagined.  They must stop
thinking in terms of "one-item-per-customer" and start thinking in terms of
numerous users accessing the same information simultaneously.Content Delivery

<p>Introduction: Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to store millions of images?
Currently images are stored in a MS SQL database which performance wise isn't
ideal. We'd like to migrate the images over to a file system structure but I'd
assume we don't just want to dump millions of images into a single directory.
Besides having to contend with naming collisions, the windows filesystem might
not perform optimally with that many files.I'm assuming one approach may be to
assign each user a unique CSLID, create a folder based on the CSLID and then
place one users files in that particular folder. Even so, this could result in
hundreds of thousands of folders. Whats the best organizational
scheme/heirachy for doing this?</p><p>6 0.75424927 <a title="176-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2013/high_scalability-2013-02-07-Ask_HighScalability%3A_Web_asset_server_concept_-_3rd_party_software_available%3F.html">1402 high scalability-2013-02-07-Ask HighScalability: Web asset server concept - 3rd party software available?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Constructing a scalablerisk analysis solution is a fascinating architectural
challenge. If you come from Financial Services you are sure to appreciate
that. But even architects from other domains are bound to find the challenges
fascinating, and the architectural patterns of my suggested solution highly
useful in other domains.Recently I held an interesting webinar around
architecting solutions for scalable and near-real-time risk analysis solutions
based on experience gathered with Financial Services customers. Seeing the
vast interest in the webinar, I would like to share the highlights with you
here.From an architectural point of view, risk analysis is a data-intensive
and a compute-intensive process, which also has an elaborate orchestration
logic. volumes in this domain are massive and ever-increasing, together with
an ever-increasing demand to reduce response time. These trends are aggravated
by global financial regulatory reforms set following the late-2000s financial
crisis, wh</p><p>same-blog 2 0.92120981 <a title="176-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-07-Synchronizing_databases_in_different_geographic_locations.html">176 high scalability-2007-12-07-Synchronizing databases in different geographic locations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Our company offers a web service that is provided to users from several
different hosting centers across the globe.The content and functionality at
each of the servers is almost exactly the same, and we could have based them
all in a single location. However, we chose to distribute the servers
geographically to offer our users the best performance, regardless where they
might be.Up until now, the only content on the servers that has had to be
synchronized is the server software itself. The features and functionality of
our service are being updated regularly, so every week or two we push updates
out to all the servers at basically the same time. We use a relatively manual
approach to do the updating, but it works fine.Sometime soon, however, our
synchronization needs are going to get a bit more complex.In particular, we'll
soon start offering a feature at our site that will involve a database with
content that will change on an almost second-by-second basis, based on user
input and act</p><p>3 0.90546674 <a title="176-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2011/high_scalability-2011-01-20-75%25_Chance_of_Scale_-_Leveraging_the_New_Scaleogenic_Environment_for_Growth.html">976 high scalability-2011-01-20-75% Chance of Scale - Leveraging the New Scaleogenic Environment for Growth</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "I'll never need to scale so why bother? We aren't Twitter or Facebook or
Google after all." This is the most common email I get, a question in the form
of a thinly disguised rationalization for not having to worry about scaling.
And in these days of giant transformer-like machines they are probably right.
But what if there areBarry Bonds enhancing type forces at work that argue for
the chances of your needing to scale being higher than you think?And if that
happens, how will you cross the scalability chasm? Will you want to completely
change your architecture or evolve it from a tool-chain that was meant to
scale from the start? Architecturally, that's the question you have to answer.
Today's tool-chains are making it possible to grow a system from small to
large without needing to implement complete architectural phase changes at
various scale inflection points, but that's a different topic. We're trying to
think about why you may actually need to scale, that is the question.Tumblr i</p><p>4 0.90272534 <a title="176-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-08-30-Pomegranate_-_Storing_Billions_and_Billions_of_Tiny_Little_Files.html">889 high scalability-2010-08-30-Pomegranate - Storing Billions and Billions of Tiny Little Files</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pomegranateis a novel distributed file system built over distributed tabular
storage that acts an awful lot like a NoSQL system. It's targeted at
increasing the performance of tiny object access in order to support
applications like online photo and micro-blog services, which require high
concurrency, high throughput, and low latency. Their tests seem to indicate it
works:We have demonstrate that file system over tabular storage performs well
for highly concurrent access. In our test cluster, we observedlinearly
increased more than100,000aggregate read and write requests served per second
(RPS). Rather than sitting atop the file system like almost every other K-V
store, Pomegranate is baked into file system. The idea is that the file system
API is common to every platform so it wouldn't require a separate API to use.
Every application could use it out of the box.The features of Pomegranate
are:It handles billions of small files efficiently, even in one directory;It

had to build out boxes just to handle the load? Amazing. We don't know how

still, that's cool.

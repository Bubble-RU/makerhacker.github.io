<p>Introduction: I was looking at the pingdom infrastructure matrix
(http://royal.pingdom.com/royalfiles/0702_infrastructure_matrix.pdf) and I saw
that no sites are using Postgresql, and then I searched through
highscalability.com and saw very few mentions of postgresql. Are there any
examples of high-traffic sites that use postgresql? Does anyone have any
experience with it? I'm having trouble finding good, recent studies of
postgres (and postgres compared w/ mysql) online.</p><p>4 0.096413083 <a title="171-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-16-Paper%3A_The_Clustered_Storage_Revolution.html">20 high scalability-2007-07-16-Paper: The Clustered Storage Revolution</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I am in the design phase of getting a website up and running that will have
scalability as a main concern. I am looking for opinions on architecture and
the like for this endeavor.The site has a few unique characteristics that make
scalability difficult. Users will all have a pretty large amount of data that
other users will be able to search. The site will be entirely based around
search. The catch is that other users will be searching always with a
stipulation of 'n' miles from me. I imagine that fact will kill the
possibility of query caching for most searches.I have extensive experience
with PHP and MYSQL, some experience with ASP.NET/C#, some experience with perl
but can learn anything fast. The site will start out on a single server but I
want to be 100% certain that I architect the code and databases such that
scaling will be simple.What language should I code the site in? What DB would
you use: Postgres, MYSQL, MSSQL, BerkelyDB? Should we shard the database by
location? by user</p><p>6 0.087900251 <a title="171-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-27-Starting_a_website_from_scratch_-_what_technologies_should_I_use%3F.html">167 high scalability-2007-11-27-Starting a website from scratch - what technologies should I use?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It is widely recognized that MySQL is the most popular database software in
the world. Since its inception in 1995, there have been 11 million product
installations around the world in a wide variety of markets. There are more
installations of MySQL in use today than any other database architecture. From
startup companies hoping to be the next Web2.0 poster child to large global
enterprises, the MySQL database architecture has proven to be flexible,
extendable, scalable, and more than capable of filling high-capacity database
roles in very different venues.</p><p>4 0.47700781 <a title="171-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad_Architecture.html">68 high scalability-2007-08-20-TypePad Architecture</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Me and my partner are making a blueprint for an online webshop service. The
purpose of this project is to make webshops available for small company's/
individuals automatically just by creating an account with us. Our webapp can
be used to add products/pages/... to the store and we'll handle secure
checkout by paypal.Our app should be scalable and manageable. Because we also
want to offer free webshops, the amount of webshops could be +10.000 within a
few years. We are building on the Zend framework and are using mysql for
database.From the start we want to build our application for optimal and easy
scalability in the future, to avoid a lot changes to our app/database in the
future.Now our questions are:Should we use?:* one database for all shops (or
limited to X shops );* one database for each new shop (each having products,
orders... tables);I think both approaches have PRO/CONS. What do you think ?
Does anyone has experience with this kind of structure ?PRO:one database:

<p>Introduction: The new version of a8cjdbc finished some limitations. Now Clobs and Blobs are
supported, and some fixes using binary data. The version was also fully tested
with Postgres and mySQL.Since Version 1.3 there is also a free trail version
for download available. Check it out and test yourself...Take a look at:
http://www.activ8.at/homepage/en/a8cjdbc.phpI've downloaded the latest version
and setup a environment with one virtual database and two database backends.I
tried to make a "non real life szenario": The first backend was a Postgres
node, the second was a mySQL node.Everything works fine - failover -
recoverylog, etc... with to different backend database types.So check out the
trial version and test yourself the clustered driver and give me some results
about your experience with a8cjdbc.As I only tested mySQL and Postgres (and
the non real life szenario with two different backend types) - maybe someone
else have experiences with out databases?greetingsWolfgang</p><p>same-blog 2 0.92120481 <a title="171-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-02-a8cjdbc_-_update_verision_1.3.html">171 high scalability-2007-12-02-a8cjdbc - update verision 1.3</a></p>

<p>Introduction: ArchCamp: Scalable Databasess (NoSQL)The ArchCamp unconference was held this
past Friday at HackerDojo in Mountain View, CA.  There was plenty of pizza,
beer, and great conversation.  This session started out free-form, but shaped
up pretty quickly into a discussion of the popular open source scalable NoSQL

<p>Introduction: This is a question everyone must struggle with when building out their
datacenter. Storage choices are always the ones I have the least confidence
in. David Marks in his blogYou Can Change It Later!asks the questionShould I
get a SAN to scale my site architecture?and answers no. A better solution is
to use commodity hardware, directly attach storage on servers, and partition
across servers to scale and for greater availability.David's reasoning is
interesting:A SAN creates a SPOF (single point of failure) that is dependent
on a vendor to fly and fix when there's a problem. This can lead to long down
times during this outage you have no access to your data at all.Using easily
available commodity hardware minimizes risks to your company, it's not just
about saving money. Zooming over to Fry's to buy emergency equipment provides
the kind of agility startups need in order to respond quickly to ever changing
situations.It's hard to beat the power and flexibility (backups, easy to add

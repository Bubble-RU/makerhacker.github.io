<p>Introduction: "Data is everywhere, never be at a single location. Not scalable, not
maintainable."-Alex SzalayWhile Galileo played life and death doctrinal games
over the mysteries revealed by the telescope, another revolution went
unnoticed, the microscope gave up mystery after mystery and nobody yet
understood how subversive would be what it revealed. For the first time these
new tools of perceptual augmentation allowed humans to peek behind the veil of
appearance. A new new eye driving human invention and discovery for hundreds
of years.Data is anothermaterialthat hides, revealing itself only when we look
at different scales and investigate its underlying patterns. If the universe
is trulymade of information, then we are looking into truly primal stuff. A
new eye is needed for Data and an ambitious project calledData-scopeaims to be
the lens.A detailedpaperon the Data-Scope tells more about what it is:The

<p>Introduction: From the website:Thelbpool projectprovides a load balancing JDBC driver for
use with DB connection pools. It wraps a normal JDBC driver providing
reconnect semantics in the event of additional hardware availability, partial
system failure, or uneven load distribution. It also evenly distributes all
new connections among slave DB servers in a given pool. Each time connect() is
called it will attempt to use the best server with the least system load.The
biggest scalability issue with large applications that are mostly READ bound
is the number of transactions per second that the disks in your cluster can
handle. You can generally solve this in two ways.1. Buy bigger and faster
disks with expensive RAID controllers.2. Buy CHEAP hardware on CHEAP disks but
lots of machines.We prefer the cheap hardware approach and lbpool allows you
to do this.Even if you *did* manage to use cheap hardware most load balancing
hardware is expensive, requires a redundant balancer (if it were to fail), and

<p>Introduction: This a guest post byRajkumar Iyer, a Member of Technical Staff at
Aerospike.About a year ago, Aerospike embarked upon a quest to increase in-
memory database performance - 1 Million TPS on a single inexpensive commodity
server. NoSQL has the reputation of speed, and we saw great benefit from
improving latency and throughput of cacheless architectures. At that time, we
took a version of Aerospike delivering about 200K TPS, improved a few things -
performance went to 500k TPS - and published the Aerospike 2.0 Community
Edition. We then used kernel tuning techniques and published therecipefor how
we achieved 1 M TPS on $5k of hardware.This year we continued the quest. Our
goal was to achieve 1 Million database transactions per second per server;
more than doubling previous performance. This compares to Cassandra's boast of
1M TPS on over 300 servers in Google Compute Engine - at a cost of $2 million
dollars per year. Weachieved thiswithout kernel tuning. This article describes

<p>Introduction: This is the third guest post (part 1,part 2) of a series by Greg Lindahl, CTO
of blekko, the spam free search engine. Previously, Greg was Founder and
Distinguished Engineer at PathScale, at which he was the architect of the
InfiniPath low-latency InfiniBand HCA, used to build tightly-coupled
supercomputing clusters.blekko's home-grown NoSQL database was designed from
the start to support a web-scale search engine, with 1,000s of servers and
petabytes of disk. Data replication is a very important part of keeping the
database up and serving queries. Like many NoSQL database authors, we decided
to keep R=3 copies of each piece of data in the database, and not use RAID to
improve reliability. The key goal we were shooting for was a database which
degrades gracefully when there are many small failures over time, without
needing human intervention.Why don't we like RAID for big NoSQL databases?Most
big storage systems use RAID levels like 3, 4, 5, or 10 to improve
reliability. A conservativ</p><p>6 0.11181126 <a title="182-tfidf-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-06-06-Graph_server.html">621 high scalability-2009-06-06-Graph server</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byBrian Bulkowski, CTO and co-founder ofAerospike, a
leading clustered NoSQL database, has worked in the area of high performance
commodity systems since 1989.This blog post will tell you exactly how to build
a multi-terabyte high throughput datacenter server. A fast, reliable multi-
terrabyte data tier can be used for recent behavior (messages, tweets, plays,
actions), or anywhere that today you use Redis or Memcache.You need to

SATA solutions - combined with a high capacity storage server like the Dell
R720xd and a host bus adapter based on the LSI 2208, and a Flash optimized
database likeAerospike, enables high throughput and low latency.In a wide
configuration, with 12 to 20 drives per 2U server, individual servers can
cost-effectively serve at high throughput with 16T at $2.50 per GB with the

<p>Introduction: TypePad is considered the largest paid blogging service in the world. After
experience problems because of their meteoric growth, they eventually
transitioned to an architecture patterned after their sister company,

<p>Introduction: This is a question everyone must struggle with when building out their
datacenter. Storage choices are always the ones I have the least confidence
in. David Marks in his blogYou Can Change It Later!asks the questionShould I
get a SAN to scale my site architecture?and answers no. A better solution is
to use commodity hardware, directly attach storage on servers, and partition
across servers to scale and for greater availability.David's reasoning is
interesting:A SAN creates a SPOF (single point of failure) that is dependent
on a vendor to fly and fix when there's a problem. This can lead to long down
times during this outage you have no access to your data at all.Using easily
available commodity hardware minimizes risks to your company, it's not just
about saving money. Zooming over to Fry's to buy emergency equipment provides
the kind of agility startups need in order to respond quickly to ever changing
situations.It's hard to beat the power and flexibility (backups, easy to add

<p>Introduction: Video is hot on the Internet and people are really interested in knowing how
to make it work. Dan Rayburnhas a post pointing to a fascinating paper: An
Experimental Investigation of the Akamai Adaptive Video Streaming, which talks
in some detail about the protocols big players like YouTube, Skype and Akamai
use to serve video over on an inherently video unfriendly medium like the
Internet. For Akamai they found:Each video is encoded in five versions at
different bit rates and stored in separate files.The client sends commands to
the server with an average inter departure time of about 2 s, i.e. the control
algorithm is executed on average each 2 seconds. Akamai uses only the video
level to adapt the video source to the available bandwidth, whereas the frame
rate of the video is kept constant.When a sudden drop in the available
bandwidth occurs, short interruptions of the video playback can occur due to
the a large actuation delay.For a sudden increase of the available bandwidth,

<p>Introduction: A recent study showed that over 92 percent of executives from leading
retailers are focusing their marketing efforts on Facebook and subsequent
applications. Furthermore, over 71 percent of users have confirmed they are
more likely to make a purchase after "liking" a brand they find online.

they built a Social Ecommerce solution for Sears.com that can handle complex
relationship quires in real time. Tomer goes through:the architectural
considerations behind their solutionwhy they chose memory over diskhow they
partitioned the data to gain scalabilitywhy they chose to execute code with
the data using GigaSpaces Map/Reduce execution frameworkhow they integrated
with Facebookwhy they chose GigaSpaces over Coherence and Terracotta for in-

<p>Introduction: As users come to depend on MySQL, they find that they have to deal with issues
of reliability, scalability, and performance--issues that are not well
documented but are critical to a smoothly functioning site. This book is an
insider's guide to these little understood topics. Author Jeremy Zawodny has
managed large numbers of MySQL servers for mission-critical work at Yahoo!,
maintained years of contacts with the MySQL AB team, and presents regularly at
conferences. Jeremy and Derek have spent months experimenting, interviewing
major users of MySQL, talking to MySQL AB, benchmarking, and writing some of
their own tools in order to produce the information in this book. In High
Performance MySQL you will learn about MySQL indexing and optimization in
depth so you can make better use of these key features. You will learn
practical replication, backup, and load-balancing strategies with information
that goes beyond available tools to discuss their effects in real-life
environments. And you</p><p>same-blog 6 0.86303705 <a title="182-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-12-12-Oracle_Can_Do_Read-Write_Splitting_Too.html">182 high scalability-2007-12-12-Oracle Can Do Read-Write Splitting Too</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Being an authentic human being is difficult and apparently authenticating all
those S3 requests can be a bit overwhelming as well. Amazon fingered a lot of
processor heavy authentication requests as the reason for their
downtime:breakEarly this morning, at 3:30am PST, we started seeing elevated
levels of authenticated requests from multiple users in one of our locations.
While we carefully monitor our overall request volumes and these remained
within normal ranges, we had not been monitoring the proportion of
authenticated requests. Importantly, these cryptographic requests consume more
resources per call than other request types.Shortly before 4:00am PST, we
began to see several other users significantly increase their volume of
authenticated calls. The last of these pushed the authentication service over
its maximum capacity before we could complete putting new capacity in place.

<p>Introduction: For solutions take a look at:7 Life Saving Scalability Defenses Against Load
Monster Attacks.This is a look at all the bad things that can happen to your
carefully crafted program as loads increase: all hell breaks lose. Sure, you
can scale out or scale up, but you can also choose to program better. Make
your system handle larger loads. This saves money because fewer boxes are
needed and it will make the entire application more reliable and have better
response times. And it can be quite satisfying as a programmer.Large Number Of
ObjectsWe usually get into scaling problems when the number of objects gets
larger. Clearly resource usage of all types is stressed as the number of
objects grow.Continuous Failures Makes An Infinite Event StreamDuring large
network failure scenarios there is never time for the system recover. We are
in a continual state of stress.Lots of High Priority WorkFor example,

<p>Introduction: Skypeuses PostgreSQL as their backend database. PostgreSQL doesn't get enough
run in the database world so I was excited to see how PostgreSQL is used "as
the main DB for most of [Skype's] business needs." Their approach is to use a
traditional stored procedure interface for accessing data and on top of that
layer proxy servers which hash SQL requests to a set of database servers that
actually carry out queries. The result is a horizontally partitioned system
that they think will scale to handle 1 billion users.Skype's goal is an
architecture that can handle 1 billion plus users. This level of scale isn't
practically solvable with one really big computer, so our masked superhero
horizontal scaling comes to the rescue.Hardware is dual or quad Opterons with
SCSI RAID.Followed common database progression: Start with one DB. Add new
databases partitioned by functionality. Replicate read-mostly data for better
read access. Then horizontally partition data across multiple nodes..In a

<p>Introduction: A thoughtful reader recently suggested creating a series of posts based on
real-life problems people have experienced and the solutions they've created
to slay the little beasties. It's a great idea. Often we learn best from great
trials and tribulations. I'll start off the new "Problem Report"feature with a
diabolical little problem I dubbed the "Mobbing the Least Used Resource
Error." Please post your own. And if you know someone with an interesting
problem report, please tag them too. It could be a lot of fun. Of course, feel
free to scrub your posts of all embarrassing details, but be sure to keep the
heroic parts in :-)The ProblemThere's an unexpected and frequently fatal type
of error that can happen when new resources are added to a horizontally scaled
architecture. Because the new resource has the least of something, load or
connections or whatever, a load balancer configured with a least metric will
instantaneously direct all new traffic to that new resource. And bam! Your

<p>Introduction: Skype's 220 millions users lost service for a stunning two days. The primary
cause for Skype's nightmare (can you imagine the beeper storm that went off?)
was a massive global roll-out of aWindow's patchtriggering the simultaneous
reboot of millions of machines across the globe. The secondary cause was a bug
in Skype's software that prevented "self-healing" in the face of such attacks.
The flood of log-in requests and a lack of "peer-to-peer resources" melted
their system.breakWho's fault is it? Is Skype to blame? Is Microsoft to blame?
Or is the peer-to-peer model itself fundamentally flawed in some way?Let's be
real, how could Skype possibly test booting 220 million servers over a random
configuration of resources? Answer: they can't. Yes, it's Skype's
responsibility, but they are in a bit of a pickle on this one.The boot
scenario is one of the most basic and one of the most difficult scalability
scenarios to plan for and test. You can't simulate the viciousness of real-

Switch to get the job done more quickly.Here's a great impassioned overview

target is 1 million writes/sec and > 10 million reads/sec on top of an
architecture similar to that, on a single box, to our fully transactional,
MVCC database (write do not block reads, and vice versa) that runs in the same
process (a la SQLite), which we've also merged with our application code and
our caching tier, so we're down to--literally--a single process for what would
have been at least three separate tiers in a traditional setup.The result is
that we had to move to measuring request latency in microseconds exclusively.

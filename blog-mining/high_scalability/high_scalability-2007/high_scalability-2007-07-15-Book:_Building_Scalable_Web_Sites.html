<p>Introduction: As a developer, you are aware of the increasing concern amongst developers and
site architects that websites be able to handle the vast number of visitors
that flood the Internet on a daily basis. Scalable Internet Architecture
addresses these concerns by teaching you both good and bad design
methodologies for building new sites and how to scale existing websites to
robust, high-availability websites. Primarily example-based, the book
discusses major topics in web architectural design, presenting existing
solutions and how they work. Technology budget tight? This book will work for
you, too, as it introduces new and innovative concepts to solving
traditionally expensive problems without a large technology budget. Using open
source and proprietary examples, you will be engaged in best practice design
methodologies for building new sites, as well as appropriately scaling both
growing and shrinking sites. Website development help has arrived in the form
of Scalable Internet Architecture.</p><p>5 0.13298692 <a title="10-tfidf-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-01-29-When_things_aren%27t_scalable.html">232 high scalability-2008-01-29-When things aren't scalable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: OK,I know this site is for scalable web site design. But as there aren't any
sites I can find for graceful failure under "slashdotted" like pressure I'll
ask here.Does anyone have a sensible way, once you have a "web application"
that either won't scale, or can't scale, that you can give some users a good
consistent experience and bounce other users to a busy site page. I have seen
sites do this to varying degrees, some of which work better than others, but
no explanations beyond simply bouncing requests to a "we're busy page server"
when you have more than a given number of connections. This is obviously
useless as a web page likely requires multiple connection (ignoring keep-
alive, pipelining etc) multiple connection to completely render properly.The
normal problem is users getting a page and not the "furniture" for that page
like images or css. Other problems are having to wait ages to get the busy
page or the site being slow even if you do "get in". And some site let a user

(which has a community edition) and backed up by a DB2 database.I guess you
all know about usopen.org so here's the story:breakWhile the re-emergence of
35-year-old Andre Agassi and the continued dominance of wunderkind Maria
Sharapova have highlighted the on-court headlines at this year's U.S. Open
Tennis Championships in Flushing Meadows, N.Y., IBM is hoping its new Power5
chip-based IT support for USOpen.org can make news among those more interested
in .NET than tennis nets.Big Blue has partnered with the U.S. Tennis
Association and the U.S. Open -- the most prestigious tennis tournament in the
U.S. -- since 1992. Together, they launched USOpen.org in 1995 so racket heads
could follow the matches online.The iSeries' role this year is in powering a

<p>Introduction: Building, scaling, and optimizing the next generation of web applications.
Learn the tricks of the trade so you can build and architect applications that
scale quickly--without all the high-priced headaches and service-level
agreements associated with enterprise app servers and proprietary programming
and database products. Culled from the experience of the Flickr.com lead
developer, Building Scalable Web Sites offers techniques for creating fast
sites that your visitors will find a pleasure to use.Creating popular sites
requires much more than fast hardware with lots of memory and hard drive
space. It requires thinking about how to grow over time, how to make the same
resources accessible to audiences with different expectations, and how to have
a team of developers work on a site without creating new problems for visitors
and for each other.Presenting information to visitors from all over the world*

<p>Introduction: Hi,We're looking for a highly scalable way of scanning documents being
uploaded and downloaded from our web application. I believe services like
gmail and hotmail are using bespoke solutions from companies like Trend, but
are there some quality "off the shelf" products out there that can easily be
scaled out and have a "loose" API (HTTP based) for application
integration?Once again, thanks for any input.</p><p>5 0.96218997 <a title="10-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-05-06-Going_global_on_EC2.html">824 high scalability-2010-05-06-Going global on EC2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since its inception,Amazon EC2has enabled companies to run highly scalable
infrastructure with minimal overhead.  Over the years, Amazon Web Services has
expanded with new offerings and additional regions around the world.All this
growth has made establishing a global footprint easier than ever.  And yet,
most EC2 customers still choose to operate in a single region.  While this is
fine for many applications, customers with significant web infrastructure are
depriving users of drastically improved performance.  Deploying infrastructure
in EC2's new regions cuts out one of the biggest sources of latency:
distance.Inthis post, I describe howBizosignificantly reduced load times by
implementing Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) to distribute traffic across
all Amazon regions.Click here to read more on Bizo's dev blog</p><p>6 0.96208304 <a title="10-lda-6" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-17-World_of_Warcraft%27s_Lead_designer_Rob_Pardo_on_the_Role_of_the_Cloud_in_Games.html">1342 high scalability-2012-10-17-World of Warcraft's Lead designer Rob Pardo on the Role of the Cloud in Games</a></p>

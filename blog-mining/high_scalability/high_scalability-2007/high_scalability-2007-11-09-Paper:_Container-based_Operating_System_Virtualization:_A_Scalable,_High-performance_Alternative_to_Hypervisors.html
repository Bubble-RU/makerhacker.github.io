<p>Introduction: With all the attention being paid these days to VDI (virtual desktop
infrastructure) and application virtualization and server virtualization andvirtualization it's easy to forget about network-based
application virtualization. But it's the one virtualization technique
youshouldn'tforget because it is a foundational technology upon which myriad
other solutions will be enabled.WHAT IS NETWORK-BASED APPLICATION
VIRTUALIZATION?This term may not be familiar to you but that's because since
its inception oh, more than a decade ago, it's always just been called "server
virtualization". After the turn of the century (I love saying that, by the
way) it was always referred to asservice virtualizationinSOAand XML circles.
With the rise of the likes of VMware and Citrix and Microsoft server
virtualization solutions, it's become impossible to just use the term "server
virtualization" and "service virtualization" is just as ambiguous so it seems
appropriate to give it a few more modif</p><p>3 0.18764994 <a title="147-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-03-11-The_Implications_of_Punctuated_Scalabilium_for_Website_Architecture.html">533 high scalability-2009-03-11-The Implications of Punctuated Scalabilium for Website Architecture</a></p>

GigaSpaces XAP, Scalr, RightScale and FreedomOSS can be used to handle peak

inDissecting today's surgeshow the nature of internet traffic has evolved over
time. Traffic now spikes like a heart attack, larger and more quickly than
ever from traffic inflow sources like Digg and The New York Times. Theo
relates howAt least eight times in the past month, we've experienced from 100%

<p>Introduction: Virtualization offers a lot of benefits, but it also comes with acost(memory,
CPU, network, IO, licensing). If you are in or running a cloud then some form
of virtualization may not even be an option. But if you are running your own
string of servers you can choose to go without. Free will and all that. Should
you or shouldn't you?In a detailed comparison the folks at37signalsfound
thatrunning their Rails application servers without virtualizationresulted inA
66% reduction in the response time while handling multiples of the traffic is
beyond what I expected.As is common 37signals runs their big database servers
without virtualization. They use a scale-up approach at the database tier so
extracting every bit of performance out of those servers is key. Application
servers typically use a scale-out approach for scalability, which is
virtualization friendly, but that says nothing about performance.Finding
performance increases, especially when you are running on a dynamic language

<p>Introduction: Update 2: Rumor no more.Google Jumps Head First Into Web Services With Google
App Engine. The quick and dirty of it: developers simply upload their Python
code to Google, launch the application, and can monitor usage and other
metrics via a multi-platform desktop application. There were 10,000 developer
slots open and of course I was too late. More as the cobra strikes.Update:
TechCrunch reportsGoogle To Launch BigTable As Web Servicenext week. It
competes with Amazon's SimpleDB. Though it won't be truly comparable until
they also release an EC2 and S3 equivalent. An internet hit for each data
access is a little painful. As Jimmy says in Goodfellas, "That's the way. You
don't take no sh*t from nobody. "FirstDave Winerhallucinates a pig on the mean

<p>Introduction: This and the next post will discuss how virtualization and cloud computing, as
we know it today, is only a small part of the solution for today's IT
inefficiencies. While new technologies and delivery models have made it much
simpler to manage the infrastructure, this is not where our core
inefficiencies lie. Virtualization principles must be extended to higher
levels of the application stack, to make it easier for all of us to manage,
tune and integrate applications. Otherwise we will continue to spend most of
our time on things that don't provide real value to the business.Read the full

<p>Introduction: Are long VM instance spin-up times in the cloud costing you money? That's the
question that immediately came to mind whenJames Urquhart, in an interview at
the Stata Conference, made this thought provoking comment:the faster you can
get the resources into the hands of the people who use them, the more money
you save overall.One of the many super powers of the cloud iselasticity, the
ability to dynamically acquire and release resources in response to demand.
But like any good superhero, their strength must also form the basis of a not
quite fatal flaw. Years and years of angsty episodes are usually required to
explore this contradiction.In the case of the cloud, the weakness reveals
itself in slow VM spin-up times. Spinning up a VM in EC2 can take a little as
1-3 minutes, or can average 5-10 minutes, or it can take much longer if
there's heavy usage in your availability zone. EC2 is not alone. A common
complaint about Google App Engine is thecold-start problem. When a request
comes in,</p><p>4 0.68863517 <a title="147-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-10-21-Machine_VM_%2B_Cloud_API_-_Rewriting_the_Cloud_from_Scratch.html">923 high scalability-2010-10-21-Machine VM + Cloud API - Rewriting the Cloud from Scratch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Write a little "Hello World" program these days and it runs inside a
bewildering Russian Doll of nested environments, each layer adding its own
special performance and complexity tax. First, a language executes in its own
environment of data structure libraries, memory management, and so on. That,
more often than not, will run inside a language VM like the JVM, CLR, or V8.
The language VM will in-turn run inside a process that runs inside an OS. An
application will run in one or more threads inside a process. And the whole
thing will run inside a machine sharing VM layer like Xen. And across all of
that are frameworks for monitoring, elasticity, storage, and so on. That's a
lot of overhead for a such a little program.What if we could remove all these
taxes and run directly on the new bare metal, which some consider to be a
combination of Machine VM + Cloud API? That's exactly what a system
calledMirage, described in the paperTurning down the LAMP: Software

<p>Introduction: When you're looking to add new tank mates to an existing aquarium ecosystem,
one of the concerns you must have is whether a particular breed of fish is
amenable to conspecific cohabitants. Many species are not, which means if you
put them together in a confined space, they're going to fight. Viciously. To
the death. Responsible aquarists try to avoid such situations, so careful
attention to theconspecificityof animals is a must.Now, while in many respects
the data center ecosystem correlates well to an aquarium ecosystem, in this
case it does not. It's what you usually get, today, but its not actually the
best model. That's because what you want in the data center ecosystem -
particularly when it extends to include publiccloud computingresources - is
conspecificity in infrastructure.This desire and practice is being seen both
in enterprise data center decision making as well as in startups suddenly
dealing with massive growth and increasingly encountering performance

<p>Introduction: i didnt find a nearly good solution for this problem yet:imagine, you're
responsible for a small CDN network (static images), with two different
datacenter. the balancing for the two DC is done with a anycast nameservice (a
nameserver in every DC, user gets on nearest location). so, one of the
scenario is that one of the datacenters goes down completly. you can do a
monitoring on the nameserver and only route to the dc which is still alive, no
problem. But what about the TTL from the DNS-Records? Tiny TTLs like 2 min.
are often ignored by several ISP (e.g. AOL). so, the client doesn't get the IP
from the other Datacenter. what could be a solution in this scenario?</p><p>same-blog 2 0.86075574 <a title="147-lda-2" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-11-09-Paper%3A_Container-based_Operating_System_Virtualization%3A_A_Scalable%2C_High-performance_Alternative_to_Hypervisors.html">147 high scalability-2007-11-09-Paper: Container-based Operating System Virtualization: A Scalable, High-performance Alternative to Hypervisors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One stumbling block of the the great march towards virtualization is the
relatively poor performance of resource hungry applications like databases. We
are told to develop and test using VMs, but deploy without them. Which kind of
sucks IMHO. Maybe better virtualization technology can remove this split. This
paper talks about a different approach to virtualization called "container-
based" virtualization that can reportedly double the performance of
traditional hypervisor systems like Xen. It does this by trading isolation for
efficiency. Rather than maintaining complete isolation between VMs the
container approach shares resources between VMs and thus gives higher
performance while still guaranteeing strong fault, resource, and security
isolation. It's yet another battle in computing's endless war of creating and
destroying abstraction layers. I learned a lot from from this paper because of
how it compared and contrasted traditional hypervisor and container based
virtualization strate</p><p>3 0.84193975 <a title="147-lda-3" href="../high_scalability-2012/high_scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler%2C_Cheaper%2C_Faster%3A_Playtomic%27s_Move_from_.NET_to_Node_and_Heroku.html">1340 high scalability-2012-10-15-Simpler, Cheaper, Faster: Playtomic's Move from .NET to Node and Heroku</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a guest post by Ben Lowry, CEO ofPlaytomic. Playtomic is a game
analytics service implemented in about 8000 mobile, web and downloadable games
played by approximately 20 million people daily.Here's a good summary quote by
Ben Lowry on Hacker News:Just over 20,000,000 people hit my API yesterday
700,749,252 times, playing the ~8,000 games my analytics platform is
integrated in for a bit under 600 years in total play time. That's just
yesterday. There are lots of different bottlenecks waiting for people
operating at scale. Heroku and NodeJS, for my use case, eventually alleviated
a whole bunch of them very cheaply.Playtomic began with an almost exclusively
Microsoft.NET and Windows architecture which held up for 3 years before being
replaced with a complete rewrite using NodeJS.  During its lifetime the entire
platform grew from shared space on a single server to a full dedicated, then
spread to second dedicated, then the API server was offloaded to a VPS
provider and 4 - 6 fairl</p><p>4 0.80101579 <a title="147-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-03-19-Hot_Scalability_Links_for_March_19%2C_2010.html">797 high scalability-2010-03-19-Hot Scalability Links for March 19, 2010</a></p>

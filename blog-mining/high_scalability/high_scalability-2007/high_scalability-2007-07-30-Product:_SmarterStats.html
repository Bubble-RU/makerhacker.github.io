<p>Introduction: Hello everybody!I am a developer of a website with a lot of traffic. Right now
we are managing the whole website using perl + postgresql + fastcgi +
memcached + mogileFS + lighttpd + roundrobin DNS distributed over 5 servers
and I must say it works like a charm, load is stable and everything works very
fast and we are recording about 8 million pageviews per day.The only problem
is with postgres database since we have it installed only on one server and if
this server goes down, the whole "cluster" goes down. That's why we have a
master2slave replication so we still have a backup database except that when
the master goes down, all inserts/updates are disabled so the whole website is
just read only.But this is not a problem since this configuration is working
for us and we don't have any problems with it.Right now we are planning to
build our own analytics service that would be customized for our needs. We
tried various different software packages but were not satisfied with any of
them.</p><p>3 0.089204833 <a title="45-tfidf-3" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_Web_Log_Storming.html">37 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: Web Log Storming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Web Log Stormingis an interactive, desktop-based Web Log Analyzer for Windows.
The whole new concept of log analysis makes it clearly different from any
other web log analyzer. Browse through statistics to get into details - down
to individual visitor's session. Check individual visitor behavior pattern and
how it fits into your desired scenario.Web Log Storming does far more than
just generate common reports - it displays detailed web site statistics with
interactive graphs and reports. Very complete detailed log analysis of
activity from every visitor to your web site is only a mouse-click away.In
other words, analyze your web logs like never before!It's easy to track
sessions, hits, page views, downloads, or whatever metric is most important to
each user. You can look at referring pages and see which search engines and
keywords were used to bring visitors to the site. Web site behavior, from the
top entry and exit pages, to the paths that users follow, can be analyzed. You
can learn</p><p>4 0.087712713 <a title="45-tfidf-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-10-01-Statistics_Logging_Scalability.html">105 high scalability-2007-10-01-Statistics Logging Scalability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: My company is developing a centralized web platform to service our clients. We
currently use about 3Mb/s on our uplink at our ISP serving web pages for about
100 clients. We'd like to offer them statistics that mean something to their
businesses and have been contemplating writing our own statistics code to
handle the task.All statistics would be gathered at the page view level and
we're implementing a HttpModule in ASP.Net 2.0 to handle the gather of the
data. That said, I'm curious to hear comments on writing this data (~500 bytes
of log data/page request). We need to write this data somewhere and then build
a process to aggregate the data into a warehouse application used in our
reporting system. Google Analytics is out of the question because we do not
want our hosting infrastructure dependant upon a remote server. Web Trends et
al. are too expensive for our clients.I'm thinking of a couple of options.1)

<p>Introduction: This is a guest post byGordon Worley, a Software Engineer atKorrelate, where
they correlate (see what they did there) online purchases to offline
purchases.Several weeks ago, we came into the office one morning to find every
server alarm going off. Pixel log processing was behind by 8 hours and not
making headway. Checking the logs, we discovered that a big client had come
online during the night and was giving us 10 times more traffic than we were
originally told to expect. I wouldn't say we panicked, but the office was
certainly more jittery than usual. Over the next several hours, though, thanks
both to foresight and quick thinking, we were able to scale up to handle the
added load and clear the backlog to return log processing to a steady state.At
Korrelate, we deploytracking pixels, also known beacons or web bugs, that our
partners use to send us information about their users. These tiny web objects
contain no visible content, but may include transparent 1 by 1 gifs or
Javascript,</p><p>4 0.64099211 <a title="45-lsi-4" href="../high_scalability-2007/high_scalability-2007-07-28-Product%3A_FastStats_Log_Analyzer_.html">35 high scalability-2007-07-28-Product: FastStats Log Analyzer </a></p>

streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer works
as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information your log
contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information file to be
able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files
from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF log
format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format) and a lot of
other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers and some ftp servers.</p><p>6 0.62483436 <a title="45-lsi-6" href="../high_scalability-2009/high_scalability-2009-04-03-Collectl_interface_to_Ganglia_-_any_interest%3F.html">553 high scalability-2009-04-03-Collectl interface to Ganglia - any interest?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Digg has been researching ways to scale our database infrastructure for some
time now. We've adopted a traditional vertically partitioned master-slave
configuration with MySQL, and also investigated sharding MySQL with IDDB.
Ultimately, these solutions left us wanting. In the case of the traditional
architecture, the lack of redundancy on the write masters is painful, and both
approaches have significant management overhead to keep running.Since it was
already necessary to abandon data normalization and consistency to make these
approaches work, we felt comfortable looking at more exotic, non-relational
data stores. After considering HBase, Hypertable, Cassandra, Tokyo
Cabinet/Tyrant, Voldemort, and Dynomite, we settled on Cassandra.Each system
has its own strengths and weaknesses, but Cassandra has a good blend of
everything. It offers column-oriented data storage, so you have a bit more
structure than plain key/value stores. It operates in a distributed, highly
available, peer-to-pee</p><p>4 0.6938976 <a title="45-lda-4" href="../high_scalability-2010/high_scalability-2010-02-16-Seven_Signs_You_May_Need_a_NoSQL_Database.html">779 high scalability-2010-02-16-Seven Signs You May Need a NoSQL Database</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While exploring deep into some dusty old library stacks, I dug up Nostradamus'
long lostNoSQLcodex. What are the chances? Strangely, it also gave the plot to
the next Dan Brown novel, but I left that out for reasons of sanity. About
NoSQL, here is what Nosty (his friends call him Nosty) predicted are the signs
you may need a NoSQL database...You noticed a lot of your database fields are
really serialized complex objects in disguise. Why bother with a RDBMS at all
then? Storing serialized objects in a relational database is like being on the
pill while trying to get pregnant, a bit counter productive. Just use a
schemaless database from the start.Using a standard query language has become
too confining. You just want to be free. SQL is so easy, so convenient, and so
standard, it's reallynot a challengeanymore. You need to be different. Then
NoSQL is for you. Each has their own completely differentquery mechanism.Your
toolbox only contains a hammer. Hammers while wonderfully versatile, c</p><p>5 0.67143166 <a title="45-lda-5" href="../high_scalability-2008/high_scalability-2008-12-29-Platform_virtualization_-_top_25_providers_%28software%2C_hardware%2C_combined%29.html">479 high scalability-2008-12-29-Platform virtualization - top 25 providers (software, hardware, combined)</a></p>

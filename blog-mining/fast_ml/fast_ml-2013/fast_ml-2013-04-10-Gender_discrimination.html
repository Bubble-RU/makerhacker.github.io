 Congratulations! You have spotted the ceiling cat. 
 
 
 
As  Sashi noticed on the forums , it’s not difficult to improve on the benchmarks a little bit. In particular, he mentioned feature selection, normalizing the data and using a regularized linear model. Here’s our version of the story.
 
Let’s start with normalizing. There’s a nice function for that in R,  scale() . The dataset is small, 1128 examples, so we can go ahead and use R.
 
Turns out that in its raw form, the data won’t scale. That’s because apparently there are some columns with zeros only. That makes it difficult to divide.
 
Fortunately, we know just the right tool for the task. We learned about it on Kaggle forums too. It’s a function in   caret  package  called  nearZeroVar() . It will give you indexes of all the columns which have near zero var</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 They want to be able to discriminate men from women based on handwriting.

<p>Introduction: We’re back to Kaggle competitions. This time we will attempt to predict advertised salaries from job ads and of course beat the benchmark. The benchmark is, as usual, a random forest result. For starters, we’ll use a linear model without much preprocessing. Will it be enough?
   
  
 Congratulations! You have spotted the ceiling cat. 
 
A linear model better than a random forest - how so? Well, to train a random forest on data this big, the benchmark code extracts only 100 most common words as features, and we will use all. This approach is similiar to the one we applied in  Merck challenge . More data beats a cleverer algorithm, especially when a cleverer algorithm is unable to handle all of data (on your machine, anyway).
 
The competition is about predicting salaries from job adverts. Of course the figures usually appear in the text, so they were removed. An error metric is mean absolute error (MAE) - how refreshing to see so intuitive one.

<p>Introduction: Lately we’ve been working with the Madelon dataset. It was originally prepared for a feature selection challenge, so while we’re at it, let’s select some features. Madelon has 500 attributes, 20 of which are real, the rest being noise. Hence the ideal scenario would be to select just those 20 features.
   
Fortunately we know just the right software for this task. It’s called  mRMR , for  minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance , and is available in C and Matlab versions for various platforms. mRMR expects a CSV file with labels in the first column and feature names in the first row. So the game plan is:
  
 combine training and validation sets into a format expected by mRMR 
 run selection 
 filter the original datasets, discarding all features but the selected ones 
 evaluate the results on the validation set 
 if all goes well, prepare and submit files for  the competition  
  
We’ll use  R scripts  for all the steps but feature selection. Now a few words about mRMR. It will show you p</p><p>4 0.133012 <a title="25-tfidf-4" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-07-05-Processing_large_files%2C_line_by_line.html">32 fast ml-2013-07-05-Processing large files, line by line</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perhaps the most common format of data for machine learning is text files. Often data is too large to fit in memory; this is sometimes referred to as big data. But do you need to load the whole data into memory? Maybe you could at least pre-process it line by line. We show how to do this with Python. Prepare to read and possibly write some code.
   
The most common format for text files is probably CSV. For sparse data,  libsvm  format is popular. Both can be processed using csv module in Python.
   import csv

i_f = open( input_file, 'r' )
reader = csv.reader( i_f )
   
For  libsvm  you just set the delimiter to space:
   reader = csv.reader( i_f, delimiter = ' ' )
   
Then you go over the file contents. Each line is a list of strings:
   for line in reader:

    # do something with the line, for example:
    label = float( line[0] )
    # ....

    writer.writerow( line )
   
If you need to do a second pass, you just rewind the input file:
   i_f.seek( 0 )

<p>Introduction: This time we enter the  Stack Overflow challenge , which is about predicting a status of a given question on SO. There are five possible statuses, so it’s a multi-class classification problem.
 
We would prefer a tool able to perform multiclass classification by itself. It can be done by hand by constructing five datasets, each with binary labels (one class against all others), and then combining predictions, but it might be a bit tricky to get right - we tried. Fortunately, nice people at Yahoo, excuse us, Microsoft, recently relased a new version of  Vowpal Wabbit , and this new version supports multiclass classification.
   
In case you’re wondering, Vowpal Wabbit is a fast linear learner. We like the “fast” part and “linear” is OK for dealing with lots of words, as in this contest. In any case, with more than three million data points it wouldn’t be that easy to train a kernel SVM, a neural net or what have you.

<p>Introduction: The promise  
What’s attractive in machine learning? That a machine is learning, instead of a human. But an operator still has a lot of work to do. First, he has to learn how to teach a machine, in general. Then, when it comes to a concrete task, there are two main areas where a human needs to do the work (and remember, laziness is a virtue, at least for a programmer, so we’d like to minimize amount of work done by a human):
  
 data preparation 
 model tuning 
  
This story is about model tuning.
   

 
Typically, to achieve satisfactory results, first we need to convert raw data into format accepted by the model we would like to use, and then tune a few hyperparameters of the model.
 
For example, some hyperparams to tune for a random forest may be a number of trees to grow and a number of candidate features at each split ( mtry  in R randomForest). For a neural network, there are quite a lot of hyperparams: number of layers, number of neurons in each layer (specifically, in each hid</p><p>4 0.2368509 <a title="25-lsi-4" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-01-14-Feature_selection_in_practice.html">17 fast ml-2013-01-14-Feature selection in practice</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There’s a contest at Kaggle held by Qatar University. They want to be able to discriminate men from women based on handwriting. For a thousand bucks, well, why not?
   
  
 Congratulations! You have spotted the ceiling cat. 
 
 
 
As  Sashi noticed on the forums , it’s not difficult to improve on the benchmarks a little bit. In particular, he mentioned feature selection, normalizing the data and using a regularized linear model. Here’s our version of the story.
 
Let’s start with normalizing. There’s a nice function for that in R,  scale() . The dataset is small, 1128 examples, so we can go ahead and use R.
 
Turns out that in its raw form, the data won’t scale. That’s because apparently there are some columns with zeros only. That makes it difficult to divide.
 
Fortunately, we know just the right tool for the task. We learned about it on Kaggle forums too. It’s a function in   caret  package  called  nearZeroVar() . It will give you indexes of all the columns which have near zero var</p><p>2 0.37702295 <a title="25-lda-2" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-07-05-Processing_large_files%2C_line_by_line.html">32 fast ml-2013-07-05-Processing large files, line by line</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perhaps the most common format of data for machine learning is text files. Often data is too large to fit in memory; this is sometimes referred to as big data. But do you need to load the whole data into memory? Maybe you could at least pre-process it line by line. We show how to do this with Python. Prepare to read and possibly write some code.
   
The most common format for text files is probably CSV. For sparse data,  libsvm  format is popular. Both can be processed using csv module in Python.
   import csv

i_f = open( input_file, 'r' )
reader = csv.reader( i_f )
   
For  libsvm  you just set the delimiter to space:
   reader = csv.reader( i_f, delimiter = ' ' )
   
Then you go over the file contents. Each line is a list of strings:
   for line in reader:

    # do something with the line, for example:
    label = float( line[0] )
    # ....

    writer.writerow( line )
   
If you need to do a second pass, you just rewind the input file:
   i_f.seek( 0 )

<p>Introduction: Let’s step back from forays into cutting edge topics and look at a random forest, one of the most popular machine learning techniques today. Why is it so attractive?
   
First of all, decision tree ensembles have been found by  Caruana et al.  as the best overall approach for a variety of problems. Random forests, specifically, perform well both in low dimensional and high dimensional tasks.
 
There are basically two kinds of tree ensembles: bagged trees and boosted trees. Bagging means that when building each subsequent tree, we don’t look at the earlier trees, while in boosting we consider the earlier trees and strive to compensate for their weaknesses (which may lead to overfitting).
 
Random forest is an example of the bagging approach, less prone to overfit. Gradient boosted trees (notably  GBM package  in R) represent the other one. Both are very successful in many applications. Trees are also relatively fast to train, compared to some more involved methods.
 
Besides effectivnes</p><p>4 0.36870518 <a title="25-lda-4" href="../fast_ml-2014/fast_ml-2014-05-08-Impute_missing_values_with_Amelia.html">61 fast ml-2014-05-08-Impute missing values with Amelia</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the ways to deal with missing values in data is to impute them. We use Amelia R package on  The Analytics Edge competition  data. Since one typically gets many imputed sets, we bag them with good results. So good that it seems we would have won the contest if not for a bug in our code.
    The competition  
Much to our surprise, we ranked 17th out of almost 1700 competitors - from the public leaderboard score we expected to be in top 10%, barely. The contest turned out to be one with huge overfitting possibilities, and people overfitted badly - some preliminary leaders ended up down the middle of the pack, while we soared up the ranks.
 
But wait! There’s more. When preparing this article, we discovered a bug - apparently we used only 1980 points for training:
   points_in_test = 1980
train = data.iloc[:points_in_test,]     # should be [:-points_in_test,]
test = data.iloc[-points_in_test:,]
   
If not for this little bug, we would have won, apparently.

<p>Introduction: We’re back to Kaggle competitions. This time we will attempt to predict advertised salaries from job ads and of course beat the benchmark. The benchmark is, as usual, a random forest result. For starters, we’ll use a linear model without much preprocessing. Will it be enough?
   
  
 Congratulations! You have spotted the ceiling cat. 
 
A linear model better than a random forest - how so? Well, to train a random forest on data this big, the benchmark code extracts only 100 most common words as features, and we will use all. This approach is similiar to the one we applied in  Merck challenge . More data beats a cleverer algorithm, especially when a cleverer algorithm is unable to handle all of data (on your machine, anyway).
 
The competition is about predicting salaries from job adverts. Of course the figures usually appear in the text, so they were removed. An error metric is mean absolute error (MAE) - how refreshing to see so intuitive one.

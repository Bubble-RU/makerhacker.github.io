<p>Introduction: The Black Box challenge has just ended. We were thoroughly thrilled to learn that the winner,  doubleshot , used sparse filtering, apparently following our cue. His score in terms of accuracy is 0.702, ours 0.645, and the best benchmark 0.525.

    Not-so-deep learning  
The difference to our previous, beating-the-benchmark attempt is twofold:
  
 one layer instead of two 
 for supervised learning, VW instead of a random forest 
  
Somewhat suprisingly, one layer works better than two. Even more surprisingly, with enough units you can get 0.634 using a linear model (Vowpal Wabbit, of course, One-Against-All). In our understanding, that’s the point of overcomplete representations*, which Stanford people seem to care much about.

<p>Introduction: It seems that quite a few people with interest in deep learning think of it in terms of unsupervised pre-training, autoencoders, stacked RBMs and deep belief networks. It’s easy to get into this groove by watching one of  Geoff Hinton’s videos  from a few years ago, where he bashes backpropagation in favour of unsupervised methods that are able to discover the structure in data by themselves, the same way as human brain does. Those videos, papers and tutorials linger. They were state of the art once, but things have changed since then.
   
These days supervised learning is the king again. This has to do with the fact that you can look at data from many different angles and usually you’d prefer  representation that is useful for the discriminative task at hand . Unsupervised learning will find some angle, but will it be the one you want? In case of the MNIST digits, sure. Otherwise probably not. Or maybe it will find a lot of angles while you only need one.

<p>Introduction: Geoff Hinton  is a living legend. He almost single-handedly invented backpropagation for training feed-forward neural networks. Despite in theory being universal function approximators, these networks turned out to be pretty much useless for more complex problems, like computer vision and speech recognition. Professor Hinton responded by creating deep networks and deep learning, an ultimate form of machine learning. Recently we’ve been fortunate to ask Geoff a few questions and have him answer them.
   
   Geoff, thanks so much for talking to us. You’ve had a long and fruitful career. What drives you these days? 
 
Well, after a man hits a certain age, his priorities change. Back in the 80s I was happy when I was able to train a network with eight hidden units. Now I can finally have thousands and possibly millions of them. So I guess the answer is scale.
 
Apart from that, I like people at Google and I like making them a ton of money. They happen to pay me well, so it’s a win-win situ</p><p>6 0.13884594 <a title="27-tfidf-6" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-12-28-Regularizing_neural_networks_with_dropout_and_with_DropConnect.html">48 fast ml-2013-12-28-Regularizing neural networks with dropout and with DropConnect</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Out of 215 contestants, we placed 8th in the Cats and Dogs competition at Kaggle. The top ten finish gave us the master badge. The competition was about discerning the animals in images and here’s how we did it.
   
We extracted the features using pre-trained deep convolutional networks, specifically  decaf  and  OverFeat . Then we trained some classifiers on these features. The whole thing was inspired by Kyle Kastner’s  decaf  +  pylearn2  combo and we expanded this idea. The classifiers were linear models from  scikit-learn  and a neural network from  Pylearn2 . At the end we created a voting ensemble of the individual models.
  OverFeat features  
 
 
We touched on OverFeat in  Classifying images with a pre-trained deep network . A better way to use it in this competition’s context is to extract the features from the layer before the classifier, as Pierre Sermanet suggested in the comments.

<p>Introduction: As usual, there’s an interesting competition at Kaggle: The Black Box. It’s connected to ICML 2013 Workshop on Challenges in Representation Learning, held by the deep learning guys from Montreal.
 
There are a couple benchmarks for this competition and the best one is unusually hard to beat 1  - only less than a fourth of those taking part managed to do so. We’re among them. Here’s how.
   
The key ingredient in our success is a recently developed secret Stanford technology for deep unsupervised learning:  sparse filtering  by  Jiquan Ngiam  et al. Actually, it’s not secret. It’s  available at Github , and has one or two very appealling properties. Let us explain.
 
The main idea of deep unsupervised learning, as we understand it, is feature extraction. One of the most common applications is in  multimedia. The reason for that is that multimedia tasks, for example object recognition, are easy for humans, but difficult for computers 2 .
 
Geoff Hinton from Toronto talks about  two ends</p><p>2 0.98860502 <a title="27-lda-2" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-01-04-Madelon%3A_Spearmint%27s_revenge.html">14 fast ml-2013-01-04-Madelon: Spearmint's revenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Little Spearmint couldn’t sleep that night.  I was so close…  - he was thinking. It seemed that he had found a better than default value for one of the random forest hyperparams, but it turned out to be false. He made a decision as he fell asleep:  Next time, I will show them! 
   
The way to do this is to use a dataset that is known to produce lower error with high  mtry  values, namely previously mentioned  Madelon  from NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge. Among 500 attributes, only 20 are informative, the rest are noise. That’s the reason why high  mtry  is good here: you have to consider a lot of features to find a meaningful one.
 
The dataset consists of a train, validation and test parts, with labels being available for train and validation. We will further split the training set into our train and validation sets, and use the original validation set as a test set to evaluate final results of parameter tuning.
 
As an error measure we use  Area Under Curve , or AUC, which was</p><p>3 0.98641056 <a title="27-lda-3" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-08-09-What_you_wanted_to_know_about_Mean_Average_Precision.html">1 fast ml-2012-08-09-What you wanted to know about Mean Average Precision</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let’s say that there are some users and some items, like movies, songs or jobs. Each user might be interested in some items. The client asks us to recommend a few items (the number is x) for each user. They will evaluate the results using mean average precision, or MAP, metric. Specifically MAP@x - this means they ask us to recommend x items for each user. So what is this MAP?
   
First, we will get M out of the way. MAP is just an average of APs, or average precision, for all users. In other words, we take the mean for Average Precision, hence Mean Average Precision. If we have 1000 users, we sum APs for each user and divide the sum by 1000. This is MAP.
 
So now, what is AP, or average precision? It may be that we don’t really need to know. But we probably need to know this:
  
 we can recommend at most x items for each user 
 it pays to submit all x recommendations, because we are not penalized for bad guesses 
 order matters, so it’s better to submit more certain recommendations fi</p><p>4 0.96299994 <a title="27-lda-4" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-12-27-Spearmint_with_a_random_forest.html">13 fast ml-2012-12-27-Spearmint with a random forest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now that we have  Spearmint basics  nailed, we’ll try tuning a random forest, and specifically two hyperparams: a number of trees ( ntrees ) and a number of candidate features at each split ( mtry ). Here’s  some code .
 
We’re going to use a red  wine quality  dataset. It has about 1600 examples and our goal will be to predict a rating for a wine given all the other properties.   This is a regression* task, as ratings are in (0,10) range.
 
We will split the data 80/10/10 into train, validation and test set, and use the first two to establish optimal hyperparams and then predict on the test set. As an error measure we will use RMSE.
 
At first, we will try  ntrees  between 10 and 200 and  mtry  between 3 and 11 (there’s eleven features total, so that’s the upper bound). Here are the results of two Spearmint runs with 71 and 95 tries respectively. Colors denote a validation error value:
  
  green : RMSE < 0.57 
  blue : RMSE < 0.58 
  black : RMSE >= 0.58 
  
Turns out that some diffe</p><p>5 0.87628585 <a title="27-lda-5" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-11-02-Maxing_out_the_digits.html">43 fast ml-2013-11-02-Maxing out the digits</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently we’ve been investigating the  basics of Pylearn2 . Now it’s time for a more advanced example: a multilayer perceptron with dropout and maxout activation for the MNIST digits.
    Maxout explained  
If you’ve been following developments in deep learning, you know that Hinton’s most recent recommendation for supervised learning, after a few years of bashing backpropagation in favour of unsupervised pretraining, is to use classic multilayer perceptrons with dropout and rectified linear units. For us, this breath of simplicity is a welcome change.
 
 
 
Rectified linear is  f(x) = max( 0, x ) . This makes backpropagation trivial: for x > 0, the derivative is one, else zero.
 
Note that ReLU consists of two linear functions. But why stop at two? Let’s take max. out of three, or four, or five linear functions…  And so maxout is a generalization of ReLU. It can approximate any convex function.
 
 
 
Now backpropagation is easy and dropout prevents overfitting, so we can train a deep</p><p>6 0.85691702 <a title="27-lda-6" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-12-21-Tuning_hyperparams_automatically_with_Spearmint.html">12 fast ml-2012-12-21-Tuning hyperparams automatically with Spearmint</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Let’s step back from forays into cutting edge topics and look at a random forest, one of the most popular machine learning techniques today. Why is it so attractive?
   
First of all, decision tree ensembles have been found by  Caruana et al.  as the best overall approach for a variety of problems. Random forests, specifically, perform well both in low dimensional and high dimensional tasks.
 
There are basically two kinds of tree ensembles: bagged trees and boosted trees. Bagging means that when building each subsequent tree, we don’t look at the earlier trees, while in boosting we consider the earlier trees and strive to compensate for their weaknesses (which may lead to overfitting).
 
Random forest is an example of the bagging approach, less prone to overfit. Gradient boosted trees (notably  GBM package  in R) represent the other one. Both are very successful in many applications. Trees are also relatively fast to train, compared to some more involved methods.

<p>Introduction: Last time we explored dimensionality reduction in practice using Gensim’s LSI and LDA. Now, having spent some time researching the subject matter, we will give an overview of other options.
   
 UPDATE : We now consider the topic quite irrelevant, because sparse high-dimensional data is precisely where linear models shine. See  Amazon aspires to automate access control ,  Predicting advertised salaries  and  Predicting closed questions on Stack Overflow .
 
And the few most popular methods are:
  
 LSI/LSA - a multinomial PCA 
 LDA - Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
 matrix factorization, in particular non-negative variants: NMF 
 ICA, or Independent Components Analysis 
 mixtures of Bernoullis 
 stacked RBMs 
 correlated topic models, an extension of LDA 
  
We  tried the first two  before.
 
As regards matrix factorization, you do the same stuff as with movie recommendations (think Netflix challenge).

<p>Introduction: Are you interested in linear models, or K-means clustering? Probably not much. These are very basic techniques with fancier alternatives. But here’s the bomb: when you combine those two methods for supervised learning, you can get better results than from a random forest. And maybe even faster.
   
We have already written about  Vowpal Wabbit , a fast linear learner from Yahoo/Microsoft.  Google’s response (or at least, a Google’s guy response) seems to be  Sofia-ML . The software consists of two parts: a linear learner and K-means clustering. We found Sofia a while ago and wondered about K-means: who needs K-means?
 
Here’s a clue:
  
This package can be used for learning cluster centers (…) and for mapping a given data set onto a new feature space based on the learned cluster centers.
  
Our eyes only opened when we read a certain paper, namely  An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning  ( PDF ).

<p>Introduction: To celbrate the first 100 followers on Twitter, we asked them what would they like to read about here. One of the responders, Itamar Berger, suggested a topic: how to choose a ML algorithm for a task at hand. Well, what do we now?
   
Three things come to mind:
  
 
We’d try fast things first. In terms of speed, here’s how we imagine the order:

 
 linear models 
 trees, that is  bagged or boosted trees  
 everything else* 
 
 
 
We’d use something we are comfortable with. Learning new things is very exciting, however we’d ask ourselves a question: do we want to learn a new technique, or do we want a result?
 
 
We’d prefer something with fewer hyperparameters to set. More params means more tuning, that is training and re-training over and over, even if automatically. Random forests are hard to beat in this department. Linear models are pretty good too.

<p>Introduction: Let’s step back from forays into cutting edge topics and look at a random forest, one of the most popular machine learning techniques today. Why is it so attractive?
   
First of all, decision tree ensembles have been found by  Caruana et al.  as the best overall approach for a variety of problems. Random forests, specifically, perform well both in low dimensional and high dimensional tasks.
 
There are basically two kinds of tree ensembles: bagged trees and boosted trees. Bagging means that when building each subsequent tree, we don’t look at the earlier trees, while in boosting we consider the earlier trees and strive to compensate for their weaknesses (which may lead to overfitting).
 
Random forest is an example of the bagging approach, less prone to overfit. Gradient boosted trees (notably  GBM package  in R) represent the other one. Both are very successful in many applications. Trees are also relatively fast to train, compared to some more involved methods.

<p>Introduction: Much of data in machine learning is sparse, that is mostly zeros, and often binary. The phenomenon may result from converting categorical variables to one-hot vectors, and from converting text to bag-of-words representation. If each feature is binary - either zero or one - then it holds exactly one bit of information. Surely we could somehow compress such data to fewer real numbers.
   
To do this, we turn to topic models, an area of research with roots in natural language processing. In NLP, a training set is called a corpus, and each document is like a row in the set. A document might be three pages of text, or just a few words, as in a tweet.
 
The idea of topic modelling is that you can group words in your corpus into relatively few topics and represent each document as a mixture of these topics. It’s attractive because you can interpret the model by looking at words that form the topics. Sometimes they seem meaningful, sometimes not. A meaningful topic might be, for example: “cric</p><p>4 0.33244604 <a title="22-lda-4" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-01-17-A_very_fast_denoising_autoencoder.html">18 fast ml-2013-01-17-A very fast denoising autoencoder</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Once upon a time we were browsing machine learning papers and software. We were interested in autoencoders and found a rather unusual one. It was called  marginalized Stacked Denoising Autoencoder  and the author claimed that it  preserves the strong feature learning capacity of Stacked Denoising Autoencoders, but is orders of magnitudes faster.  We like all things fast, so we were hooked.
    About autoencoders  
 Wikipedia says  that  an autoencoder is an artificial neural network and its aim is to learn a compressed representation for a set of data. This means it is being used for dimensionality reduction . In other words, an autoencoder is a neural network meant to replicate the input. It would be trivial with a big enough number of units in a hidden layer: the network would just find an identity mapping. Hence dimensionality reduction: a hidden layer size is typically smaller than input layer.

<p>Introduction: Are you interested in linear models, or K-means clustering? Probably not much. These are very basic techniques with fancier alternatives. But here’s the bomb: when you combine those two methods for supervised learning, you can get better results than from a random forest. And maybe even faster.
   
We have already written about  Vowpal Wabbit , a fast linear learner from Yahoo/Microsoft.  Google’s response (or at least, a Google’s guy response) seems to be  Sofia-ML . The software consists of two parts: a linear learner and K-means clustering. We found Sofia a while ago and wondered about K-means: who needs K-means?
 
Here’s a clue:
  
This package can be used for learning cluster centers (…) and for mapping a given data set onto a new feature space based on the learned cluster centers.

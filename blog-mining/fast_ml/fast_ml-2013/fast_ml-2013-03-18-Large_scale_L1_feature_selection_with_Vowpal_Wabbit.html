<p>Introduction: This time we enter the  Stack Overflow challenge , which is about predicting a status of a given question on SO. There are five possible statuses, so it’s a multi-class classification problem.
 
We would prefer a tool able to perform multiclass classification by itself. It can be done by hand by constructing five datasets, each with binary labels (one class against all others), and then combining predictions, but it might be a bit tricky to get right - we tried. Fortunately, nice people at Yahoo, excuse us, Microsoft, recently relased a new version of  Vowpal Wabbit , and this new version supports multiclass classification.
   
In case you’re wondering, Vowpal Wabbit is a fast linear learner. We like the “fast” part and “linear” is OK for dealing with lots of words, as in this contest. In any case, with more than three million data points it wouldn’t be that easy to train a kernel SVM, a neural net or what have you.

<p>Introduction: We’re back to Kaggle competitions. This time we will attempt to predict advertised salaries from job ads and of course beat the benchmark. The benchmark is, as usual, a random forest result. For starters, we’ll use a linear model without much preprocessing. Will it be enough?
   
  
 Congratulations! You have spotted the ceiling cat. 
 
A linear model better than a random forest - how so? Well, to train a random forest on data this big, the benchmark code extracts only 100 most common words as features, and we will use all. This approach is similiar to the one we applied in  Merck challenge . More data beats a cleverer algorithm, especially when a cleverer algorithm is unable to handle all of data (on your machine, anyway).
 
The competition is about predicting salaries from job adverts. Of course the figures usually appear in the text, so they were removed. An error metric is mean absolute error (MAE) - how refreshing to see so intuitive one.

<p>Introduction: Vowpal Wabbit now supports a few modes of non-linear supervised learning. They are:
  
 a neural network with a single hidden layer 
 automatic creation of polynomial, specifically quadratic and cubic, features 
 N-grams 
  
We describe how to use them, providing examples from the Kaggle Amazon competition and for the  kin8nm  dataset.
    Neural network  
The original motivation for creating  neural network code in VW   was to win some Kaggle competitions using only vee-dub , and that goal becomes much more feasible once you have a strong non-linear learner.
 
The network seems to be a classic multi-layer perceptron with one sigmoidal hidden layer. More interestingly, it has dropout. Unfortunately, in a few tries we haven’t had much luck with the dropout.
 
Here’s an example of how to create a network with 10 hidden units:

<p>Introduction: This is about  Amazon access control challenge  at Kaggle. Either we’re getting smarter, or the competition is easy. Or maybe both. You can beat the benchmark quite easily and with AUC of 0.875 you’d be comfortably in the top twenty percent at the moment. We scored fourth in our first attempt - the model was quick to develop and back then there were fewer competitors.
   
 
 
Traditionally we use  Vowpal Wabbit . Just simple binary classification with the logistic loss function and 10 passes over the data.
 
It seems to work pretty well even though the classes are very unbalanced: there’s only a handful of negatives when compared to positives. Apparently Amazon employees usually get the access they request, even though sometimes they are refused.
 
Let’s look at the data. First a label and then a bunch of IDs.

<p>Introduction: The promise  
What’s attractive in machine learning? That a machine is learning, instead of a human. But an operator still has a lot of work to do. First, he has to learn how to teach a machine, in general. Then, when it comes to a concrete task, there are two main areas where a human needs to do the work (and remember, laziness is a virtue, at least for a programmer, so we’d like to minimize amount of work done by a human):
  
 data preparation 
 model tuning 
  
This story is about model tuning.
   

 
Typically, to achieve satisfactory results, first we need to convert raw data into format accepted by the model we would like to use, and then tune a few hyperparameters of the model.
 
For example, some hyperparams to tune for a random forest may be a number of trees to grow and a number of candidate features at each split ( mtry  in R randomForest). For a neural network, there are quite a lot of hyperparams: number of layers, number of neurons in each layer (specifically, in each hid</p><p>6 0.18829854 <a title="23-lsi-6" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-02-27-Dimensionality_reduction_for_sparse_binary_data.html">21 fast ml-2013-02-27-Dimensionality reduction for sparse binary data</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The job salary prediction contest at Kaggle  offers a highly-dimensional dataset: when you convert categorical values to binary features and text columns to a bag of words, you get roughly 240k features, a number very similiar to the number of examples.
 
We present a way to select a few thousand relevant features using L1 (Lasso) regularization. A linear model seems to work just as well with those selected features as with the full set. This means we get roughly 40 times less features for a much more manageable, smaller data set.
   
  
  What you wanted to know about Lasso and Ridge  
L1 and L2 are both ways of regularization sometimes called  weight decay . Basically, we include parameter weights in a cost function. In effect, the model will try to minimize those weights by going “down the slope”. Example weights: in a linear model or in a neural network.
 
L1 is known as Lasso and L2 is known as Ridge. These names may be confusing, because a chart of Lasso looks like a ridge and a</p><p>2 0.36158615 <a title="23-lda-2" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-02-18-Predicting_advertised_salaries.html">20 fast ml-2013-02-18-Predicting advertised salaries</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We’re back to Kaggle competitions. This time we will attempt to predict advertised salaries from job ads and of course beat the benchmark. The benchmark is, as usual, a random forest result. For starters, we’ll use a linear model without much preprocessing. Will it be enough?
   
  
 Congratulations! You have spotted the ceiling cat. 
 
A linear model better than a random forest - how so? Well, to train a random forest on data this big, the benchmark code extracts only 100 most common words as features, and we will use all. This approach is similiar to the one we applied in  Merck challenge . More data beats a cleverer algorithm, especially when a cleverer algorithm is unable to handle all of data (on your machine, anyway).
 
The competition is about predicting salaries from job adverts. Of course the figures usually appear in the text, so they were removed. An error metric is mean absolute error (MAE) - how refreshing to see so intuitive one.

<p>Introduction: Are you interested in linear models, or K-means clustering? Probably not much. These are very basic techniques with fancier alternatives. But here’s the bomb: when you combine those two methods for supervised learning, you can get better results than from a random forest. And maybe even faster.
   
We have already written about  Vowpal Wabbit , a fast linear learner from Yahoo/Microsoft.  Google’s response (or at least, a Google’s guy response) seems to be  Sofia-ML . The software consists of two parts: a linear learner and K-means clustering. We found Sofia a while ago and wondered about K-means: who needs K-means?
 
Here’s a clue:
  
This package can be used for learning cluster centers (…) and for mapping a given data set onto a new feature space based on the learned cluster centers.
  
Our eyes only opened when we read a certain paper, namely  An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning  ( PDF ).

<p>Introduction: The promise  
What’s attractive in machine learning? That a machine is learning, instead of a human. But an operator still has a lot of work to do. First, he has to learn how to teach a machine, in general. Then, when it comes to a concrete task, there are two main areas where a human needs to do the work (and remember, laziness is a virtue, at least for a programmer, so we’d like to minimize amount of work done by a human):

<p>Introduction: We continue with CIFAR-10-based competition at Kaggle to get to know DropConnect. It’s supposed to be an improvement over dropout. And dropout is certainly one of the bigger steps forward in neural network development. Is DropConnect really better than dropout?
   
 TL;DR  DropConnect seems to offer results similiar to dropout. State of the art scores reported in the paper come from model ensembling.
  Dropout  
 Dropout , by Hinton et al., is perhaps a biggest invention in the field of neural networks in recent years. It adresses the main problem in machine learning, that is overfitting. It does so by “dropping out” some unit activations in a given layer, that is setting them to zero.  Thus it prevents co-adaptation of units and can also be seen as a method of ensembling many networks sharing the same weights. For each training example a different set of units to drop is randomly chosen.

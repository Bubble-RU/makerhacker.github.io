<p>Introduction: What do you get when you mix one part brilliant and one part daft? You get Pylearn2, a cutting edge neural networks library from Montreal that’s rather hard to use. Here we’ll show how to get through the daft part with your mental health relatively intact.
   
 Pylearn2  comes from the  Lisa Lab  in  Montreal , led by Yoshua Bengio. Those are pretty smart guys and they concern themselves with deep learning. Recently they published a paper entitled  Pylearn2: a machine learning research library   [arxiv] . Here’s a quote:
  
 Pylearn2 is a machine learning research library - its users are researchers . This means (…) it is acceptable to assume that the user has some technical sophistication and knowledge of machine learning.
  
The word  research  is possibly the most common word in the paper. There’s a reason for that: the library is certainly not production-ready. OK, it’s not that bad. There are only two difficult things:
  
 getting your data in 
  getting predictions out

<p>Introduction: It seems that quite a few people with interest in deep learning think of it in terms of unsupervised pre-training, autoencoders, stacked RBMs and deep belief networks. It’s easy to get into this groove by watching one of  Geoff Hinton’s videos  from a few years ago, where he bashes backpropagation in favour of unsupervised methods that are able to discover the structure in data by themselves, the same way as human brain does. Those videos, papers and tutorials linger. They were state of the art once, but things have changed since then.
   
These days supervised learning is the king again. This has to do with the fact that you can look at data from many different angles and usually you’d prefer  representation that is useful for the discriminative task at hand . Unsupervised learning will find some angle, but will it be the one you want? In case of the MNIST digits, sure. Otherwise probably not. Or maybe it will find a lot of angles while you only need one.

<p>Introduction: As usual, there’s an interesting competition at Kaggle: The Black Box. It’s connected to ICML 2013 Workshop on Challenges in Representation Learning, held by the deep learning guys from Montreal.
 
There are a couple benchmarks for this competition and the best one is unusually hard to beat 1  - only less than a fourth of those taking part managed to do so. We’re among them. Here’s how.
   
The key ingredient in our success is a recently developed secret Stanford technology for deep unsupervised learning:  sparse filtering  by  Jiquan Ngiam  et al. Actually, it’s not secret. It’s  available at Github , and has one or two very appealling properties. Let us explain.
 
The main idea of deep unsupervised learning, as we understand it, is feature extraction. One of the most common applications is in  multimedia. The reason for that is that multimedia tasks, for example object recognition, are easy for humans, but difficult for computers 2 .
 
Geoff Hinton from Toronto talks about  two ends</p><p>5 0.13454224 <a title="43-tfidf-5" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-01-04-Madelon%3A_Spearmint%27s_revenge.html">14 fast ml-2013-01-04-Madelon: Spearmint's revenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Little Spearmint couldn’t sleep that night.  I was so close…  - he was thinking. It seemed that he had found a better than default value for one of the random forest hyperparams, but it turned out to be false. He made a decision as he fell asleep:  Next time, I will show them! 
   
The way to do this is to use a dataset that is known to produce lower error with high  mtry  values, namely previously mentioned  Madelon  from NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge. Among 500 attributes, only 20 are informative, the rest are noise. That’s the reason why high  mtry  is good here: you have to consider a lot of features to find a meaningful one.
 
The dataset consists of a train, validation and test parts, with labels being available for train and validation. We will further split the training set into our train and validation sets, and use the original validation set as a test set to evaluate final results of parameter tuning.
 
As an error measure we use  Area Under Curve , or AUC, which was</p><p>6 0.12880133 <a title="43-tfidf-6" href="../fast_ml-2014/fast_ml-2014-03-06-PyBrain_-_a_simple_neural_networks_library_in_Python.html">54 fast ml-2014-03-06-PyBrain - a simple neural networks library in Python</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We’re back to Kaggle competitions. This time we will attempt to predict advertised salaries from job ads and of course beat the benchmark. The benchmark is, as usual, a random forest result. For starters, we’ll use a linear model without much preprocessing. Will it be enough?
   
  
 Congratulations! You have spotted the ceiling cat. 
 
A linear model better than a random forest - how so? Well, to train a random forest on data this big, the benchmark code extracts only 100 most common words as features, and we will use all. This approach is similiar to the one we applied in  Merck challenge . More data beats a cleverer algorithm, especially when a cleverer algorithm is unable to handle all of data (on your machine, anyway).
 
The competition is about predicting salaries from job adverts. Of course the figures usually appear in the text, so they were removed. An error metric is mean absolute error (MAE) - how refreshing to see so intuitive one.

<p>Introduction: Recently we’ve been investigating the  basics of Pylearn2 . Now it’s time for a more advanced example: a multilayer perceptron with dropout and maxout activation for the MNIST digits.
    Maxout explained  
If you’ve been following developments in deep learning, you know that Hinton’s most recent recommendation for supervised learning, after a few years of bashing backpropagation in favour of unsupervised pretraining, is to use classic multilayer perceptrons with dropout and rectified linear units. For us, this breath of simplicity is a welcome change.
 
 
 
Rectified linear is  f(x) = max( 0, x ) . This makes backpropagation trivial: for x > 0, the derivative is one, else zero.
 
Note that ReLU consists of two linear functions. But why stop at two? Let’s take max. out of three, or four, or five linear functions…  And so maxout is a generalization of ReLU. It can approximate any convex function.
 
 
 
Now backpropagation is easy and dropout prevents overfitting, so we can train a deep</p><p>2 0.48115665 <a title="43-lda-2" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-05-01-Deep_learning_made_easy.html">27 fast ml-2013-05-01-Deep learning made easy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As usual, there’s an interesting competition at Kaggle: The Black Box. It’s connected to ICML 2013 Workshop on Challenges in Representation Learning, held by the deep learning guys from Montreal.
 
There are a couple benchmarks for this competition and the best one is unusually hard to beat 1  - only less than a fourth of those taking part managed to do so. We’re among them. Here’s how.
   
The key ingredient in our success is a recently developed secret Stanford technology for deep unsupervised learning:  sparse filtering  by  Jiquan Ngiam  et al. Actually, it’s not secret. It’s  available at Github , and has one or two very appealling properties. Let us explain.
 
The main idea of deep unsupervised learning, as we understand it, is feature extraction. One of the most common applications is in  multimedia. The reason for that is that multimedia tasks, for example object recognition, are easy for humans, but difficult for computers 2 .

<p>Introduction: Now that we have  Spearmint basics  nailed, we’ll try tuning a random forest, and specifically two hyperparams: a number of trees ( ntrees ) and a number of candidate features at each split ( mtry ). Here’s  some code .
 
We’re going to use a red  wine quality  dataset. It has about 1600 examples and our goal will be to predict a rating for a wine given all the other properties.   This is a regression* task, as ratings are in (0,10) range.
 
We will split the data 80/10/10 into train, validation and test set, and use the first two to establish optimal hyperparams and then predict on the test set. As an error measure we will use RMSE.
 
At first, we will try  ntrees  between 10 and 200 and  mtry  between 3 and 11 (there’s eleven features total, so that’s the upper bound). Here are the results of two Spearmint runs with 71 and 95 tries respectively. Colors denote a validation error value:
  
  green : RMSE < 0.57 
  blue : RMSE < 0.58 
  black : RMSE >= 0.58

<p>Introduction: The promise  
What’s attractive in machine learning? That a machine is learning, instead of a human. But an operator still has a lot of work to do. First, he has to learn how to teach a machine, in general. Then, when it comes to a concrete task, there are two main areas where a human needs to do the work (and remember, laziness is a virtue, at least for a programmer, so we’d like to minimize amount of work done by a human):
  
 data preparation 
 model tuning 
  
This story is about model tuning.
   

 
Typically, to achieve satisfactory results, first we need to convert raw data into format accepted by the model we would like to use, and then tune a few hyperparameters of the model.
 
For example, some hyperparams to tune for a random forest may be a number of trees to grow and a number of candidate features at each split ( mtry  in R randomForest). For a neural network, there are quite a lot of hyperparams: number of layers, number of neurons in each layer (specifically, in each hid</p><p>5 0.4603855 <a title="43-lda-5" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-01-04-Madelon%3A_Spearmint%27s_revenge.html">14 fast ml-2013-01-04-Madelon: Spearmint's revenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Little Spearmint couldn’t sleep that night.  I was so close…  - he was thinking. It seemed that he had found a better than default value for one of the random forest hyperparams, but it turned out to be false. He made a decision as he fell asleep:  Next time, I will show them! 
   
The way to do this is to use a dataset that is known to produce lower error with high  mtry  values, namely previously mentioned  Madelon  from NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge. Among 500 attributes, only 20 are informative, the rest are noise. That’s the reason why high  mtry  is good here: you have to consider a lot of features to find a meaningful one.
 
The dataset consists of a train, validation and test parts, with labels being available for train and validation. We will further split the training set into our train and validation sets, and use the original validation set as a test set to evaluate final results of parameter tuning.
 
As an error measure we use  Area Under Curve , or AUC, which was</p><p>6 0.45976153 <a title="43-lda-6" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-08-09-What_you_wanted_to_know_about_Mean_Average_Precision.html">1 fast ml-2012-08-09-What you wanted to know about Mean Average Precision</a></p>

We’re going to use a red  wine quality  dataset. It has about 1600 examples and our goal will be to predict a rating for a wine given all the other properties.   This is a regression* task, as ratings are in (0,10) range.

<p>Introduction: The promise  
What’s attractive in machine learning? That a machine is learning, instead of a human. But an operator still has a lot of work to do. First, he has to learn how to teach a machine, in general. Then, when it comes to a concrete task, there are two main areas where a human needs to do the work (and remember, laziness is a virtue, at least for a programmer, so we’d like to minimize amount of work done by a human):
  
 data preparation 
 model tuning 
  
This story is about model tuning.
   

 
Typically, to achieve satisfactory results, first we need to convert raw data into format accepted by the model we would like to use, and then tune a few hyperparameters of the model.
 
For example, some hyperparams to tune for a random forest may be a number of trees to grow and a number of candidate features at each split ( mtry  in R randomForest). For a neural network, there are quite a lot of hyperparams: number of layers, number of neurons in each layer (specifically, in each hid</p><p>4 0.15769172 <a title="14-tfidf-4" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-01-17-A_very_fast_denoising_autoencoder.html">18 fast ml-2013-01-17-A very fast denoising autoencoder</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Once upon a time we were browsing machine learning papers and software. We were interested in autoencoders and found a rather unusual one. It was called  marginalized Stacked Denoising Autoencoder  and the author claimed that it  preserves the strong feature learning capacity of Stacked Denoising Autoencoders, but is orders of magnitudes faster.  We like all things fast, so we were hooked.
    About autoencoders  
 Wikipedia says  that  an autoencoder is an artificial neural network and its aim is to learn a compressed representation for a set of data. This means it is being used for dimensionality reduction . In other words, an autoencoder is a neural network meant to replicate the input. It would be trivial with a big enough number of units in a hidden layer: the network would just find an identity mapping. Hence dimensionality reduction: a hidden layer size is typically smaller than input layer.

<p>Introduction: Let’s step back from forays into cutting edge topics and look at a random forest, one of the most popular machine learning techniques today. Why is it so attractive?
   
First of all, decision tree ensembles have been found by  Caruana et al.  as the best overall approach for a variety of problems. Random forests, specifically, perform well both in low dimensional and high dimensional tasks.
 
There are basically two kinds of tree ensembles: bagged trees and boosted trees. Bagging means that when building each subsequent tree, we don’t look at the earlier trees, while in boosting we consider the earlier trees and strive to compensate for their weaknesses (which may lead to overfitting).
 
Random forest is an example of the bagging approach, less prone to overfit. Gradient boosted trees (notably  GBM package  in R) represent the other one. Both are very successful in many applications. Trees are also relatively fast to train, compared to some more involved methods.

<p>Introduction: Recently we’ve been investigating the  basics of Pylearn2 . Now it’s time for a more advanced example: a multilayer perceptron with dropout and maxout activation for the MNIST digits.
    Maxout explained  
If you’ve been following developments in deep learning, you know that Hinton’s most recent recommendation for supervised learning, after a few years of bashing backpropagation in favour of unsupervised pretraining, is to use classic multilayer perceptrons with dropout and rectified linear units. For us, this breath of simplicity is a welcome change.
 
 
 
Rectified linear is  f(x) = max( 0, x ) . This makes backpropagation trivial: for x > 0, the derivative is one, else zero.
 
Note that ReLU consists of two linear functions. But why stop at two? Let’s take max. out of three, or four, or five linear functions…  And so maxout is a generalization of ReLU. It can approximate any convex function.
 
 
 
Now backpropagation is easy and dropout prevents overfitting, so we can train a deep</p><p>5 0.28645065 <a title="14-lsi-5" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-01-12-Intro_to_random_forests.html">16 fast ml-2013-01-12-Intro to random forests</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Little Spearmint couldn’t sleep that night.  I was so close…  - he was thinking. It seemed that he had found a better than default value for one of the random forest hyperparams, but it turned out to be false. He made a decision as he fell asleep:  Next time, I will show them! 
   
The way to do this is to use a dataset that is known to produce lower error with high  mtry  values, namely previously mentioned  Madelon  from NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge. Among 500 attributes, only 20 are informative, the rest are noise. That’s the reason why high  mtry  is good here: you have to consider a lot of features to find a meaningful one.
 
The dataset consists of a train, validation and test parts, with labels being available for train and validation. We will further split the training set into our train and validation sets, and use the original validation set as a test set to evaluate final results of parameter tuning.
 
As an error measure we use  Area Under Curve , or AUC, which was</p><p>2 0.99751526 <a title="14-lda-2" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-08-09-What_you_wanted_to_know_about_Mean_Average_Precision.html">1 fast ml-2012-08-09-What you wanted to know about Mean Average Precision</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let’s say that there are some users and some items, like movies, songs or jobs. Each user might be interested in some items. The client asks us to recommend a few items (the number is x) for each user. They will evaluate the results using mean average precision, or MAP, metric. Specifically MAP@x - this means they ask us to recommend x items for each user. So what is this MAP?
   
First, we will get M out of the way. MAP is just an average of APs, or average precision, for all users. In other words, we take the mean for Average Precision, hence Mean Average Precision. If we have 1000 users, we sum APs for each user and divide the sum by 1000. This is MAP.
 
So now, what is AP, or average precision? It may be that we don’t really need to know. But we probably need to know this:
  
 we can recommend at most x items for each user 
 it pays to submit all x recommendations, because we are not penalized for bad guesses 
 order matters, so it’s better to submit more certain recommendations fi</p><p>3 0.98693818 <a title="14-lda-3" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-05-01-Deep_learning_made_easy.html">27 fast ml-2013-05-01-Deep learning made easy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As usual, there’s an interesting competition at Kaggle: The Black Box. It’s connected to ICML 2013 Workshop on Challenges in Representation Learning, held by the deep learning guys from Montreal.
 
There are a couple benchmarks for this competition and the best one is unusually hard to beat 1  - only less than a fourth of those taking part managed to do so. We’re among them. Here’s how.
   
The key ingredient in our success is a recently developed secret Stanford technology for deep unsupervised learning:  sparse filtering  by  Jiquan Ngiam  et al. Actually, it’s not secret. It’s  available at Github , and has one or two very appealling properties. Let us explain.
 
The main idea of deep unsupervised learning, as we understand it, is feature extraction. One of the most common applications is in  multimedia. The reason for that is that multimedia tasks, for example object recognition, are easy for humans, but difficult for computers 2 .

<p>Introduction: Now that we have  Spearmint basics  nailed, we’ll try tuning a random forest, and specifically two hyperparams: a number of trees ( ntrees ) and a number of candidate features at each split ( mtry ). Here’s  some code .
 
We’re going to use a red  wine quality  dataset. It has about 1600 examples and our goal will be to predict a rating for a wine given all the other properties.   This is a regression* task, as ratings are in (0,10) range.
 
We will split the data 80/10/10 into train, validation and test set, and use the first two to establish optimal hyperparams and then predict on the test set. As an error measure we will use RMSE.
 
At first, we will try  ntrees  between 10 and 200 and  mtry  between 3 and 11 (there’s eleven features total, so that’s the upper bound). Here are the results of two Spearmint runs with 71 and 95 tries respectively. Colors denote a validation error value:
  
  green : RMSE < 0.57 
  blue : RMSE < 0.58 
  black : RMSE >= 0.58

<p>Introduction: Recently we’ve been investigating the  basics of Pylearn2 . Now it’s time for a more advanced example: a multilayer perceptron with dropout and maxout activation for the MNIST digits.
    Maxout explained  
If you’ve been following developments in deep learning, you know that Hinton’s most recent recommendation for supervised learning, after a few years of bashing backpropagation in favour of unsupervised pretraining, is to use classic multilayer perceptrons with dropout and rectified linear units. For us, this breath of simplicity is a welcome change.
 
 
 
Rectified linear is  f(x) = max( 0, x ) . This makes backpropagation trivial: for x > 0, the derivative is one, else zero.
 
Note that ReLU consists of two linear functions. But why stop at two? Let’s take max. out of three, or four, or five linear functions…  And so maxout is a generalization of ReLU. It can approximate any convex function.
 
 
 
Now backpropagation is easy and dropout prevents overfitting, so we can train a deep</p><p>6 0.84612674 <a title="14-lda-6" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-01-14-Feature_selection_in_practice.html">17 fast ml-2013-01-14-Feature selection in practice</a></p>

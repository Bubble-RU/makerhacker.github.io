</p><p>6 Data   The Kaggle competition features 25000 training images and 12500 testing images of dogs and cats. [sent-12, score-0.718]

</p><p>9 OverFeat   When classifying, you give OverFeat an image and it outputs five (by default) most probable classes and a probability for each. [sent-16, score-0.279]

</p><p>11 00105476     One small hurdle we need to clear is that these are ImageNet labels,way more detailed than simply “cat” and “dog”. [sent-25, score-0.048]

</p><p>14 OverFeat has a script for batch classification, but it stops working when the number of images is large. [sent-30, score-0.245]

<p>Introduction: Out of 215 contestants, we placed 8th in the Cats and Dogs competition at Kaggle. The top ten finish gave us the master badge. The competition was about discerning the animals in images and here’s how we did it.
   
We extracted the features using pre-trained deep convolutional networks, specifically  decaf  and  OverFeat . Then we trained some classifiers on these features. The whole thing was inspired by Kyle Kastner’s  decaf  +  pylearn2  combo and we expanded this idea. The classifiers were linear models from  scikit-learn  and a neural network from  Pylearn2 . At the end we created a voting ensemble of the individual models.
  OverFeat features  
 
 
We touched on OverFeat in  Classifying images with a pre-trained deep network . A better way to use it in this competition’s context is to extract the features from the layer before the classifier, as Pierre Sermanet suggested in the comments.

<p>Introduction: Object recognition in images is where deep learning, and specifically convolutional neural networks, are often applied and benchmarked these days. To get a piece of the action, we’ll be using Alex Krizhevsky’s  cuda-convnet , a shining diamond of machine learning software, in a Kaggle competition.
   
Continuing to run things on a GPU, we turn to applying  convolutional neural networks  for object recognition. This kind of network was developed by Yann LeCun and it’s powerful, but a bit complicated:

A typical convolutional network has two parts. The first is responsible for feature extraction and consists of one or more pairs of convolution and subsampling/max-pooling layers, as you can see above. The second part is just a classic fully-connected multilayer perceptron taking extracted features as input. For a detailed explanation of all this see unit 9 in Hugo LaRochelle’s  neural networks course .

<p>Introduction: A while ago we’ve shown how to  get predictions  from a Pylearn2 model. It is a little tricky, partly because of splitting data into batches. If you’re able to fit your data in memory, you can strip the batch handling code and it becomes easier to see what’s going on. We exercise the concept to distinguish cats from dogs again, with superior results.
    Step by step  
You have a pickled model from Pylearn2. Let’s load it:
   from pylearn2.utils import serial

model_path = 'model.pkl'
model = serial.load( model_path )
   
Next, some Theano weirdness.  Theano  is a compiler for symbolic expressions and with these expressions we deal when predicting. We need to define expressions for X and Y:
   X = model.get_input_space().make_theano_batch()
Y = model.fprop( X )
   
Mind you, these are not variables, but rather descriptions of how to get variables. Y is easy to understand: just feed the data to the model and forward-propagate.

<p>Introduction: As usual, there’s an interesting competition at Kaggle: The Black Box. It’s connected to ICML 2013 Workshop on Challenges in Representation Learning, held by the deep learning guys from Montreal.
 
There are a couple benchmarks for this competition and the best one is unusually hard to beat 1  - only less than a fourth of those taking part managed to do so. We’re among them. Here’s how.
   
The key ingredient in our success is a recently developed secret Stanford technology for deep unsupervised learning:  sparse filtering  by  Jiquan Ngiam  et al. Actually, it’s not secret. It’s  available at Github , and has one or two very appealling properties. Let us explain.
 
The main idea of deep unsupervised learning, as we understand it, is feature extraction. One of the most common applications is in  multimedia. The reason for that is that multimedia tasks, for example object recognition, are easy for humans, but difficult for computers 2 .

<p>Introduction: On May 15th Yann LeCun answered “ask me anything” questions on  Reddit . We hand-picked some of his thoughts and grouped them by topic for your enjoyment.
    Toronto, Montreal and New York  
All three groups are strong and complementary.
 
Geoff (who spends more time at Google than in Toronto now) and Russ Salakhutdinov like RBMs and deep Boltzmann machines. I like the idea of Boltzmann machines (it’s a beautifully simple concept) but it doesn’t scale well. Also, I totally hate sampling.
 
Yoshua and his colleagues have focused a lot on various unsupervised learning, including denoising auto-encoders, contracting auto-encoders. They are not allergic to sampling like I am. On the application side, they have worked on text, not so much on images.

<p>Introduction: Recently at least two research teams made their pre-trained deep convolutional networks available, so you can classify your images right away. We’ll see how to go about it, with data from the Cats & Dogs competition at Kaggle as an example.
   
We’ll be using  OverFeat , a classifier and feature extractor from the New York guys lead by  Yann LeCun  and Rob Fergus. The principal author, Pierre Sermanet, is currently first on the  Dogs vs. Cats leaderboard .
 
The other available implementation we know of comes from Berkeley. It’s called  Caffe  and is a successor to  decaf .  Yangqing Jia , the main author of these, is also near the top of the leaderboard.
 
Both networks were trained on  ImageNet , which is  an image database organized according to the  WordNet  hierarchy . It was the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 in which Alex Krizhevsky  crushed the competition  with his network. His error was 16%, the second best - 26%.

<p>Introduction: Out of 215 contestants, we placed 8th in the Cats and Dogs competition at Kaggle. The top ten finish gave us the master badge. The competition was about discerning the animals in images and here’s how we did it.
   
We extracted the features using pre-trained deep convolutional networks, specifically  decaf  and  OverFeat . Then we trained some classifiers on these features. The whole thing was inspired by Kyle Kastner’s  decaf  +  pylearn2  combo and we expanded this idea. The classifiers were linear models from  scikit-learn  and a neural network from  Pylearn2 . At the end we created a voting ensemble of the individual models.
  OverFeat features  
 
 
We touched on OverFeat in  Classifying images with a pre-trained deep network . A better way to use it in this competition’s context is to extract the features from the layer before the classifier, as Pierre Sermanet suggested in the comments.
 
Concretely, in the larger OverFeat model ( -l ) layer 24 is the softmax, at least  in the</p><p>3 0.63265938 <a title="49-lda-3" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-11-17-The_Facebook_challenge_HOWTO.html">10 fast ml-2012-11-17-The Facebook challenge HOWTO</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last time we wrote about  the Facebook challenge . Now it’s time for some more details. The main concept is this: in its original state, the data is useless. That’s because there are many names referring to the same entity. Precisely, there are about 350k unique names, and the total number of entities is maybe 20k. So cleaning the data is the first and most important step.
    Data cleaning  
That’s the things we do, in order:
  
 extract all the names, including numbers, from the graph files and the paths file 
 compute a fingerprint for each name. We used fingerprints similar to  ones in Google Refine . Ours not only had sorted tokens (words) in a name, but also sorted letters in a token. 
  
Names with the same fingerprint are very likely the same. Remaining distortions are mostly in the form of word combinations:
   a name
a longer name
a still longer name
    
 this can be dealt with by checking if a given name is a subset of any other name. If it is a subset of only one other</p><p>4 0.46531391 <a title="49-lda-4" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-11-27-Object_recognition_in_images_with_cuda-convnet.html">45 fast ml-2013-11-27-Object recognition in images with cuda-convnet</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Object recognition in images is where deep learning, and specifically convolutional neural networks, are often applied and benchmarked these days. To get a piece of the action, we’ll be using Alex Krizhevsky’s  cuda-convnet , a shining diamond of machine learning software, in a Kaggle competition.
   
Continuing to run things on a GPU, we turn to applying  convolutional neural networks  for object recognition. This kind of network was developed by Yann LeCun and it’s powerful, but a bit complicated:

A typical convolutional network has two parts. The first is responsible for feature extraction and consists of one or more pairs of convolution and subsampling/max-pooling layers, as you can see above. The second part is just a classic fully-connected multilayer perceptron taking extracted features as input. For a detailed explanation of all this see unit 9 in Hugo LaRochelle’s  neural networks course .

<p>Introduction: Good news, everyone! There’s a new contest on Kaggle -  Facebook is looking for talent . They won’t pay, but just might interview.
 
This post is in a way a bonus for active readers because most visitors of fastml.com originally come from Kaggle forums. For this competition the forums are disabled to encourage  own work . To honor this, we won’t publish any code. But  own work  doesn’t mean  original work , and we wouldn’t want to reinvent the wheel, would we?
   
The contest differs substantially from a Kaggle stereotype, if there is such a thing, in three major ways:
  
 there’s no money prizes, as mentioned above 
 it’s not a real world problem, but rather an assignment to screen job candidates (this has important consequences, described below) 
 it’s not a typical machine learning project, but rather a broader AI exercise

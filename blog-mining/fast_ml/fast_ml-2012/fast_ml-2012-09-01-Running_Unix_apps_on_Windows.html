Back in the day, you re-partitioned your hard drive and installed Linux alongside Windows. The added thrill was, if something went wrong, your computer wouldn’t boot.
 
Now it’s easier. You just run Linux inside Windows, using what’s called a virtual machine. You need virtualization software and a machine image to do so.
 
Most popular software seems to be VMware. There is also VirtualBox - it is able to run VMware images. We have experience with WMware mostly, so this is what we’ll refer to.  VMware player  is free to download and use.

<p>Introduction: RStudio  is an IDE for R. It gives the language a bit of a slickness factor it so badly needs. The nice thing about the software, beside good looks, is that it integrates console, help pages, plots and editor (if you want it) in one place.
   
For example, instead of switching for help to a web browser, you have it right next to the console. The same thing with plots: in place of the usual overlapping windows, all plots go to one pane where you can navigate back and forth between them with arrows. You can save a plot as an image or as a PDF. While saving as image you are presented with a preview and you get to choose the image format and size. That’s the kind of detail that shows how RStudio makes working with R better.
 
You can have up to four panes on the screen:
  
 console 
 source / data 
 plots / help / files 
 history and workspace 
  
 
 
Arrange them in any way you like.

<p>Introduction: Recently we proposed to pre-process large files line by line. Now it’s time to introduce  phraug *, a set of Python scripts based on this idea. The scripts mostly deal with format conversion (CSV, libsvm, VW) and with few other tasks common in machine learning.
   
With  phraug  you currently can convert from one format to another:
  
 csv to libsvm 
 csv to Vowpal Wabbit 
 libsvm to csv 
 libsvm to Vowpal Wabbit 
 tsv to csv 
  
And perform some other file operations:
  
 count lines in a file 
 sample lines from a file 
 split a file into two randomly 
 split a file into a number of similiarly sized chunks 
 save a continuous subset of lines from a file (for example, first 100) 
 delete specified columns from a csv file 
 normalize (shift and scale) columns in a csv file 
  
Basically, there’s always at least one input file and usually one or more output files. An input file always stays unchanged.

<p>Introduction: Out of 215 contestants, we placed 8th in the Cats and Dogs competition at Kaggle. The top ten finish gave us the master badge. The competition was about discerning the animals in images and here’s how we did it.
   
We extracted the features using pre-trained deep convolutional networks, specifically  decaf  and  OverFeat . Then we trained some classifiers on these features.

At the end we created a voting ensemble of the individual models.
  OverFeat features  
 
 
We touched on OverFeat in  Classifying images with a pre-trained deep network . A better way to use it in this competition’s context is to extract the features from the layer before the classifier, as Pierre Sermanet suggested in the comments.

A typical convolutional network has two parts. The first is responsible for feature extraction and consists of one or more pairs of convolution and subsampling/max-pooling layers, as you can see above. The second part is just a classic fully-connected multilayer perceptron taking extracted features as input. For a detailed explanation of all this see unit 9 in Hugo LaRochelle’s  neural networks course .

<p>Introduction: When it comes to machine learning, most software seems to be in either Python, Matlab or R. Plus native apps, that is, compiled C/C++. These are fastest. Most of them is written for Unix environments, for example Linux or MacOS. So how do you run them on your computer if you have Windows installed?
   
Back in the day, you re-partitioned your hard drive and installed Linux alongside Windows. The added thrill was, if something went wrong, your computer wouldn’t boot.
 
Now it’s easier. You just run Linux inside Windows, using what’s called a virtual machine. You need virtualization software and a machine image to do so.
 
Most popular software seems to be VMware. There is also VirtualBox - it is able to run VMware images. We have experience with WMware mostly, so this is what we’ll refer to.  VMware player  is free to download and use.
 
There are also  many images  available, of various flavours of Linux and other operating systems. In fact, you can run Windows inside Linux if you wish</p><p>2 0.12918322 <a title="3-lda-2" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-07-05-Processing_large_files%2C_line_by_line.html">32 fast ml-2013-07-05-Processing large files, line by line</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perhaps the most common format of data for machine learning is text files. Often data is too large to fit in memory; this is sometimes referred to as big data. But do you need to load the whole data into memory? Maybe you could at least pre-process it line by line. We show how to do this with Python. Prepare to read and possibly write some code.
   
The most common format for text files is probably CSV. For sparse data,  libsvm  format is popular. Both can be processed using csv module in Python.
   import csv

i_f = open( input_file, 'r' )
reader = csv.reader( i_f )
   
For  libsvm  you just set the delimiter to space:
   reader = csv.reader( i_f, delimiter = ' ' )
   
Then you go over the file contents. Each line is a list of strings:
   for line in reader:

    # do something with the line, for example:
    label = float( line[0] )
    # ....

    writer.writerow( line )
   
If you need to do a second pass, you just rewind the input file:
   i_f.seek( 0 )

<p>Introduction: Good news, everyone! There’s a new contest on Kaggle -  Facebook is looking for talent . They won’t pay, but just might interview.
 
This post is in a way a bonus for active readers because most visitors of fastml.com originally come from Kaggle forums. For this competition the forums are disabled to encourage  own work . To honor this, we won’t publish any code. But  own work  doesn’t mean  original work , and we wouldn’t want to reinvent the wheel, would we?
   
The contest differs substantially from a Kaggle stereotype, if there is such a thing, in three major ways:
  
 there’s no money prizes, as mentioned above 
 it’s not a real world problem, but rather an assignment to screen job candidates (this has important consequences, described below) 
 it’s not a typical machine learning project, but rather a broader AI exercise

You are also given a bunch of paths in this graph, which  a</p><p>4 0.12335549 <a title="3-lda-4" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-02-18-Predicting_advertised_salaries.html">20 fast ml-2013-02-18-Predicting advertised salaries</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We’re back to Kaggle competitions. This time we will attempt to predict advertised salaries from job ads and of course beat the benchmark. The benchmark is, as usual, a random forest result. For starters, we’ll use a linear model without much preprocessing. Will it be enough?
   
  
 Congratulations! You have spotted the ceiling cat. 
 
A linear model better than a random forest - how so? Well, to train a random forest on data this big, the benchmark code extracts only 100 most common words as features, and we will use all. This approach is similiar to the one we applied in  Merck challenge . More data beats a cleverer algorithm, especially when a cleverer algorithm is unable to handle all of data (on your machine, anyway).
 
The competition is about predicting salaries from job adverts. Of course the figures usually appear in the text, so they were removed. An error metric is mean absolute error (MAE) - how refreshing to see so intuitive one.

<p>Introduction: Out of 215 contestants, we placed 8th in the Cats and Dogs competition at Kaggle. The top ten finish gave us the master badge. The competition was about discerning the animals in images and here’s how we did it.
   
We extracted the features using pre-trained deep convolutional networks, specifically  decaf  and  OverFeat . Then we trained some classifiers on these features. The whole thing was inspired by Kyle Kastner’s  decaf  +  pylearn2  combo and we expanded this idea. The classifiers were linear models from  scikit-learn  and a neural network from  Pylearn2 . At the end we created a voting ensemble of the individual models.
  OverFeat features  
 
 
We touched on OverFeat in  Classifying images with a pre-trained deep network . A better way to use it in this competition’s context is to extract the features from the layer before the classifier, as Pierre Sermanet suggested in the comments.
 
Concretely, in the larger OverFeat model ( -l ) layer 24 is the softmax, at least  in the</p><p>6 0.12152379 <a title="3-lda-6" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-07-09-Introducing_phraug.html">33 fast ml-2013-07-09-Introducing phraug</a></p>

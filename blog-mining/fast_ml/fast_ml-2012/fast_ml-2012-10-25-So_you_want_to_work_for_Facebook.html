There’s a new contest on Kaggle -  Facebook is looking for talent . They won’t pay, but just might interview.
 
This post is in a way a bonus for active readers because most visitors of fastml.com originally come from Kaggle forums. For this competition the forums are disabled to encourage  own work . To honor this, we won’t publish any code. But  own work  doesn’t mean  original work , and we wouldn’t want to reinvent the wheel, would we?
   
The contest differs substantially from a Kaggle stereotype, if there is such a thing, in three major ways:
  
 there’s no money prizes, as mentioned above 
 it’s not a real world problem, but rather an assignment to screen job candidates (this has important consequences, described below) 
 it’s not a typical machine learning project, but rather a broader AI exercise

<p>Introduction: Last time we wrote about  the Facebook challenge . Now it’s time for some more details. The main concept is this: in its original state, the data is useless. That’s because there are many names referring to the same entity. Precisely, there are about 350k unique names, and the total number of entities is maybe 20k. So cleaning the data is the first and most important step.
    Data cleaning  
That’s the things we do, in order:
  
 extract all the names, including numbers, from the graph files and the paths file 
 compute a fingerprint for each name. We used fingerprints similar to  ones in Google Refine . Ours not only had sorted tokens (words) in a name, but also sorted letters in a token. 
  
Names with the same fingerprint are very likely the same. Remaining distortions are mostly in the form of word combinations:
   a name
a longer name
a still longer name
    
 this can be dealt with by checking if a given name is a subset of any other name. If it is a subset of only one other</p><p>3 0.041383885 <a title="9-tfidf-3" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-10-06-Pylearn2_in_practice.html">40 fast ml-2013-10-06-Pylearn2 in practice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What do you get when you mix one part brilliant and one part daft? You get Pylearn2, a cutting edge neural networks library from Montreal that’s rather hard to use. Here we’ll show how to get through the daft part with your mental health relatively intact.
   
 Pylearn2  comes from the  Lisa Lab  in  Montreal , led by Yoshua Bengio. Those are pretty smart guys and they concern themselves with deep learning. Recently they published a paper entitled  Pylearn2: a machine learning research library   [arxiv] . Here’s a quote:
  
 Pylearn2 is a machine learning research library - its users are researchers . This means (…) it is acceptable to assume that the user has some technical sophistication and knowledge of machine learning.
  
The word  research  is possibly the most common word in the paper. There’s a reason for that: the library is certainly not production-ready. OK, it’s not that bad. There are only two difficult things:
  
 getting your data in 
  getting predictions out

    Toronto, Montreal and New York  
All three groups are strong and complementary.
 
Geoff (who spends more time at Google than in Toronto now) and Russ Salakhutdinov like RBMs and deep Boltzmann machines. I like the idea of Boltzmann machines (it’s a beautifully simple concept) but it doesn’t scale well. Also, I totally hate sampling.
 
Yoshua and his colleagues have focused a lot on various unsupervised learning, including denoising auto-encoders, contracting auto-encoders. They are not allergic to sampling like I am. On the application side, they have worked on text, not so much on images.
 
In our lab at NYU (Rob Fergus, David Sontag, me and our students and postdocs), we have been focusing on sparse auto-encoders for unsupervised learning. They have the advantage of scaling well.

<p>Introduction: This time we enter the  Stack Overflow challenge , which is about predicting a status of a given question on SO. There are five possible statuses, so it’s a multi-class classification problem.
 
We would prefer a tool able to perform multiclass classification by itself. It can be done by hand by constructing five datasets, each with binary labels (one class against all others), and then combining predictions, but it might be a bit tricky to get right - we tried. Fortunately, nice people at Yahoo, excuse us, Microsoft, recently relased a new version of  Vowpal Wabbit , and this new version supports multiclass classification.
   
In case you’re wondering, Vowpal Wabbit is a fast linear learner. We like the “fast” part and “linear” is OK for dealing with lots of words, as in this contest. In any case, with more than three million data points it wouldn’t be that easy to train a kernel SVM, a neural net or what have you.
 
VW, being a well-polished tool, has a few very convenient features.</p><p>6 0.034236811 <a title="9-tfidf-6" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-09-17-Best_Buy_mobile_contest.html">4 fast ml-2012-09-17-Best Buy mobile contest</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There’s a contest on Kaggle called  ACM Hackaton . Actually, there are two, one based on small data and one on big data. Here we will be talking about small data contest - specifically, about beating the benchmark - but the ideas are equally applicable to both.
 
The deal is, we have a training set from Best Buy with search queries and items which users clicked after the query, plus some other data. Items are in this case Xbox games like “Batman” or “Rocksmith” or “Call of Duty”. We are asked to predict an item user clicked given the query. Metric is MAP@5 (see  an explanation of MAP ).
   
The problem isn’t typical for Kaggle, because it doesn’t really require using machine learning in traditional sense. To beat the benchmark, it’s enough to write a short script. Concretely ;), we’re gonna build a mapping from queries to items, using the training set. It will be just a Python dictionary looking like this:
 
 'forzasteeringwheel': {'2078113': 1},

<p>Introduction: We’re back to Kaggle competitions. This time we will attempt to predict advertised salaries from job ads and of course beat the benchmark. The benchmark is, as usual, a random forest result. For starters, we’ll use a linear model without much preprocessing. Will it be enough?
   
  
 Congratulations! You have spotted the ceiling cat. 
 
A linear model better than a random forest - how so? Well, to train a random forest on data this big, the benchmark code extracts only 100 most common words as features, and we will use all. This approach is similiar to the one we applied in  Merck challenge . More data beats a cleverer algorithm, especially when a cleverer algorithm is unable to handle all of data (on your machine, anyway).
 
The competition is about predicting salaries from job adverts. Of course the figures usually appear in the text, so they were removed. An error metric is mean absolute error (MAE) - how refreshing to see so intuitive one.

<p>Introduction: Good news, everyone! There’s a new contest on Kaggle -  Facebook is looking for talent . They won’t pay, but just might interview.
 
This post is in a way a bonus for active readers because most visitors of fastml.com originally come from Kaggle forums. For this competition the forums are disabled to encourage  own work . To honor this, we won’t publish any code. But  own work  doesn’t mean  original work , and we wouldn’t want to reinvent the wheel, would we?
   
The contest differs substantially from a Kaggle stereotype, if there is such a thing, in three major ways:
  
 there’s no money prizes, as mentioned above 
 it’s not a real world problem, but rather an assignment to screen job candidates (this has important consequences, described below) 
 it’s not a typical machine learning project, but rather a broader AI exercise 
  
You are given a graph of the internet, actually a snapshot of the graph for each of 15 time steps. You are also given a bunch of paths in this graph, which  a</p><p>2 0.4807823 <a title="9-lda-2" href="../fast_ml-2014/fast_ml-2014-02-02-Yesterday_a_kaggler%2C_today_a_Kaggle_master%3A_a_wrap-up_of_the_cats_and_dogs_competition.html">52 fast ml-2014-02-02-Yesterday a kaggler, today a Kaggle master: a wrap-up of the cats and dogs competition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Out of 215 contestants, we placed 8th in the Cats and Dogs competition at Kaggle. The top ten finish gave us the master badge. The competition was about discerning the animals in images and here’s how we did it.
   
We extracted the features using pre-trained deep convolutional networks, specifically  decaf  and  OverFeat . Then we trained some classifiers on these features. The whole thing was inspired by Kyle Kastner’s  decaf  +  pylearn2  combo and we expanded this idea. The classifiers were linear models from  scikit-learn  and a neural network from  Pylearn2 . At the end we created a voting ensemble of the individual models.
  OverFeat features  
 
 
We touched on OverFeat in  Classifying images with a pre-trained deep network . A better way to use it in this competition’s context is to extract the features from the layer before the classifier, as Pierre Sermanet suggested in the comments.
 
Concretely, in the larger OverFeat model ( -l ) layer 24 is the softmax, at least  in the</p><p>3 0.44367841 <a title="9-lda-3" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-11-17-The_Facebook_challenge_HOWTO.html">10 fast ml-2012-11-17-The Facebook challenge HOWTO</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last time we wrote about  the Facebook challenge . Now it’s time for some more details. The main concept is this: in its original state, the data is useless. That’s because there are many names referring to the same entity. Precisely, there are about 350k unique names, and the total number of entities is maybe 20k. So cleaning the data is the first and most important step.
    Data cleaning  
That’s the things we do, in order:
  
 extract all the names, including numbers, from the graph files and the paths file 
 compute a fingerprint for each name. We used fingerprints similar to  ones in Google Refine . Ours not only had sorted tokens (words) in a name, but also sorted letters in a token. 
  
Names with the same fingerprint are very likely the same. Remaining distortions are mostly in the form of word combinations:
   a name
a longer name
a still longer name
    
 this can be dealt with by checking if a given name is a subset of any other name. If it is a subset of only one other</p><p>4 0.43775755 <a title="9-lda-4" href="../fast_ml-2014/fast_ml-2014-01-10-Classifying_images_with_a_pre-trained_deep_network.html">49 fast ml-2014-01-10-Classifying images with a pre-trained deep network</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Recently at least two research teams made their pre-trained deep convolutional networks available, so you can classify your images right away. We’ll see how to go about it, with data from the Cats & Dogs competition at Kaggle as an example.
   
We’ll be using  OverFeat , a classifier and feature extractor from the New York guys lead by  Yann LeCun  and Rob Fergus. The principal author, Pierre Sermanet, is currently first on the  Dogs vs. Cats leaderboard .
 
The other available implementation we know of comes from Berkeley. It’s called  Caffe  and is a successor to  decaf .  Yangqing Jia , the main author of these, is also near the top of the leaderboard.
 
Both networks were trained on  ImageNet , which is  an image database organized according to the  WordNet  hierarchy . It was the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 in which Alex Krizhevsky  crushed the competition  with his network. His error was 16%, the second best - 26%.

<p>Introduction: We continue with CIFAR-10-based competition at Kaggle to get to know DropConnect. It’s supposed to be an improvement over dropout. And dropout is certainly one of the bigger steps forward in neural network development. Is DropConnect really better than dropout?
   
 TL;DR  DropConnect seems to offer results similiar to dropout. State of the art scores reported in the paper come from model ensembling.
  Dropout  
 Dropout , by Hinton et al., is perhaps a biggest invention in the field of neural networks in recent years. It adresses the main problem in machine learning, that is overfitting. It does so by “dropping out” some unit activations in a given layer, that is setting them to zero.  Thus it prevents co-adaptation of units and can also be seen as a method of ensembling many networks sharing the same weights. For each training example a different set of units to drop is randomly chosen.
 
The idea has a  biological inspiration .

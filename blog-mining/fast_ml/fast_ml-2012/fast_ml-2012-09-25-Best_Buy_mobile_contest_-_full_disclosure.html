As far as product names go, we will use product data available in XML format to extract SKU and name for each product:

2755149 Ace Combat: Assault Horizon

When we need to fill in some predictions, instead of taking them from the benchmark, we will search in names. If that is not enough, then we go to the benchmark.
 
But wait! There’s more. We will spell-correct test queries when looking in our  query -> sku  mapping. For example, we may have a SKU for  L.A. Noire  ( lanoire ), but not for  L.A. Noir  ( lanoir ).

<p>Introduction: There’s a contest on Kaggle called  ACM Hackaton . Actually, there are two, one based on small data and one on big data. Here we will be talking about small data contest - specifically, about beating the benchmark - but the ideas are equally applicable to both.
 
The deal is, we have a training set from Best Buy with search queries and items which users clicked after the query, plus some other data. Items are in this case Xbox games like “Batman” or “Rocksmith” or “Call of Duty”. We are asked to predict an item user clicked given the query. Metric is MAP@5 (see  an explanation of MAP ).
   
The problem isn’t typical for Kaggle, because it doesn’t really require using machine learning in traditional sense. To beat the benchmark, it’s enough to write a short script. Concretely ;), we’re gonna build a mapping from queries to items, using the training set. It will be just a Python dictionary looking like this:

<p>Introduction: Last time we wrote about  the Facebook challenge . Now it’s time for some more details. The main concept is this: in its original state, the data is useless. That’s because there are many names referring to the same entity. Precisely, there are about 350k unique names, and the total number of entities is maybe 20k. So cleaning the data is the first and most important step.
    Data cleaning  
That’s the things we do, in order:
  
 extract all the names, including numbers, from the graph files and the paths file 
 compute a fingerprint for each name. We used fingerprints similar to  ones in Google Refine . Ours not only had sorted tokens (words) in a name, but also sorted letters in a token. 
  
Names with the same fingerprint are very likely the same. Remaining distortions are mostly in the form of word combinations:
   a name
a longer name
a still longer name
    
 this can be dealt with by checking if a given name is a subset of any other name. If it is a subset of only one other</p><p>4 0.1658964 <a title="6-tfidf-4" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-09-19-Best_Buy_mobile_contest_-_big_data.html">5 fast ml-2012-09-19-Best Buy mobile contest - big data</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last time we talked about the   small data  branch of Best Buy contest . Now it’s time to tackle  the big boy . It is positioned as “cloud computing sized problem”, because there is 7GB of unpacked data, vs. younger brother’s 20MB. This is reflected in “cloud computing” and “cluster” and “Oracle” talk in  the forum , and also in small number of participating teams: so far, only six contestants managed to beat the benchmark.
 
But don’t be scared. Most of data mass is in XML product information. Training and test sets together are 378MB. Good news.
   
The really interesting thing is that we can  take the script we’ve used for small data and apply it to this contest, obtaining 0.355 in a few minutes  (benchmark is 0.304). Not impressed? With simple extension you can up the score to 0.55. Read below for details.
 
This is  the very same script , with one difference. In this challenge, benchmark recommendations differ from line to line, so we can’t just hard-code five item IDs like before</p><p>5 0.045751207 <a title="6-tfidf-5" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-02-07-The_secret_of_the_big_guys.html">19 fast ml-2013-02-07-The secret of the big guys</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Are you interested in linear models, or K-means clustering? Probably not much. These are very basic techniques with fancier alternatives. But here’s the bomb: when you combine those two methods for supervised learning, you can get better results than from a random forest. And maybe even faster.
   
We have already written about  Vowpal Wabbit , a fast linear learner from Yahoo/Microsoft.  Google’s response (or at least, a Google’s guy response) seems to be  Sofia-ML . The software consists of two parts: a linear learner and K-means clustering. We found Sofia a while ago and wondered about K-means: who needs K-means?
 
Here’s a clue:
  
This package can be used for learning cluster centers (…) and for mapping a given data set onto a new feature space based on the learned cluster centers.
  
Our eyes only opened when we read a certain paper, namely  An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning  ( PDF ).

<p>Introduction: Last time we talked about the   small data  branch of Best Buy contest . Now it’s time to tackle  the big boy . It is positioned as “cloud computing sized problem”, because there is 7GB of unpacked data, vs. younger brother’s 20MB. This is reflected in “cloud computing” and “cluster” and “Oracle” talk in  the forum , and also in small number of participating teams: so far, only six contestants managed to beat the benchmark.
 
But don’t be scared. Most of data mass is in XML product information. Training and test sets together are 378MB. Good news.
   
The really interesting thing is that we can  take the script we’ve used for small data and apply it to this contest, obtaining 0.355 in a few minutes  (benchmark is 0.304). Not impressed? With simple extension you can up the score to 0.55. Read below for details.
 
This is  the very same script , with one difference. In this challenge, benchmark recommendations differ from line to line, so we can’t just hard-code five item IDs like before</p><p>same-blog 2 0.97698534 <a title="6-lda-2" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-09-25-Best_Buy_mobile_contest_-_full_disclosure.html">6 fast ml-2012-09-25-Best Buy mobile contest - full disclosure</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s the final version of the script, with two ideas improving on our previous take: searching in product names and spelling correction.
   
As far as product names go, we will use product data available in XML format to extract SKU and name for each product:
   8564564 Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation Platinum Hits
2755149 Ace Combat: Assault Horizon
1208344 Adrenalin Misfits
   
Further, we will process the names in the same way we processed queries:
   8564564 acecombat6firesofliberationplatinumhits
2755149 acecombatassaulthorizon
1208344 adrenalinmisfits
   
When we need to fill in some predictions, instead of taking them from the benchmark, we will search in names. If that is not enough, then we go to the benchmark.
 
But wait! There’s more. We will spell-correct test queries when looking in our  query -> sku  mapping. For example, we may have a SKU for  L.A. Noire  ( lanoire ), but not for  L.A. Noir  ( lanoir ). It is easy to see that this is basically the same query, o</p><p>3 0.77553368 <a title="6-lda-3" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-09-17-Best_Buy_mobile_contest.html">4 fast ml-2012-09-17-Best Buy mobile contest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There’s a contest on Kaggle called  ACM Hackaton . Actually, there are two, one based on small data and one on big data. Here we will be talking about small data contest - specifically, about beating the benchmark - but the ideas are equally applicable to both.
 
The deal is, we have a training set from Best Buy with search queries and items which users clicked after the query, plus some other data. Items are in this case Xbox games like “Batman” or “Rocksmith” or “Call of Duty”. We are asked to predict an item user clicked given the query. Metric is MAP@5 (see  an explanation of MAP ).
   
The problem isn’t typical for Kaggle, because it doesn’t really require using machine learning in traditional sense. To beat the benchmark, it’s enough to write a short script. Concretely ;), we’re gonna build a mapping from queries to items, using the training set. It will be just a Python dictionary looking like this:
 
 'forzasteeringwheel': {'2078113': 1}, 
 'finalfantasy13': {'9461183': 3, '351</p><p>4 0.63954139 <a title="6-lda-4" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-01-12-Intro_to_random_forests.html">16 fast ml-2013-01-12-Intro to random forests</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let’s step back from forays into cutting edge topics and look at a random forest, one of the most popular machine learning techniques today. Why is it so attractive?
   
First of all, decision tree ensembles have been found by  Caruana et al.  as the best overall approach for a variety of problems. Random forests, specifically, perform well both in low dimensional and high dimensional tasks.
 
There are basically two kinds of tree ensembles: bagged trees and boosted trees. Bagging means that when building each subsequent tree, we don’t look at the earlier trees, while in boosting we consider the earlier trees and strive to compensate for their weaknesses (which may lead to overfitting).
 
Random forest is an example of the bagging approach, less prone to overfit. Gradient boosted trees (notably  GBM package  in R) represent the other one. Both are very successful in many applications. Trees are also relatively fast to train, compared to some more involved methods.

<p>Introduction: An overview of key points about big data. This post was inspired by a very good article about big data by Chris Stucchio (linked below). The article is about hype and technology. We hate the hype.
    Big data is hype  
Everybody talks about big data; nobody knows exactly what it is. That’s pretty much the definition of hype.  Google Trends  suggest that the term took off at the beginning of 2011 (and the searches are coming mainly from Asia, curiously).
 
 
 
Now, to put things in context:
 
 
 
Big data is right there (or maybe not quite yet?) with other slogans like  web 2.0 ,  cloud computing  and  social media .
In effect,  big data  is a generic term for:
  
 data science 
 machine learning 
 data mining 
 predictive analytics 
  
and so on. Don’t believe us? What about James Goodnight, the CEO of  SAS :
  
The term big data is being used today because computer analysts and journalists got tired of writing about cloud computing.

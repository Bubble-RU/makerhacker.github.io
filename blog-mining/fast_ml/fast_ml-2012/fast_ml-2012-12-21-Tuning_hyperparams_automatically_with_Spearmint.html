What’s attractive in machine learning? That a machine is learning, instead of a human. But an operator still has a lot of work to do. First, he has to learn how to teach a machine, in general. Then, when it comes to a concrete task, there are two main areas where a human needs to do the work (and remember, laziness is a virtue, at least for a programmer, so we’d like to minimize amount of work done by a human):
  
 data preparation 
 model tuning 
  
This story is about model tuning.
   

 
Typically, to achieve satisfactory results, first we need to convert raw data into format accepted by the model we would like to use, and then tune a few hyperparameters of the model.
 
For example, some hyperparams to tune for a random forest may be a number of trees to grow and a number of candidate features at each split ( mtry  in R randomForest). For a neural network, there are quite a lot of hyperparams: number of layers, number of neurons in each layer (specifically, in each hid</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 5) -p epsilon : set the epsilon in loss function of epsilon-SVR (default 0.

</p><p>3 There are two pieces to this puzzle: a  config file  and a  wrapper file . [sent-25, score-0.519]
</p><p>4 In the config file, you define the hyperparams you would like to optimize, and provide some data about the wrapper file, namely a name and a language. [sent-26, score-0.509]
</p><p>5 The wrapper file works as a black box: Spearmint will pass to it hyperparams values in a Python dictionary and expects to get back a single number, which is a measure of optimality of those hyperparams. [sent-30, score-0.465]
</p><p>6 An importal note: the format of params dictionary is not  name: value , it’s  name: [ value ]  - each key points to a list of values. [sent-31, score-0.371]
</p><p>7 That’s because you can have as many actual params as you want under one name (it’s the  size  variable in config), and they are passed as a list. [sent-32, score-0.267]
</p><p>8 No big deal here, the script receives a learning rate value as a command line argument and then calls the proper function with the received parameter. [sent-40, score-0.427]
</p><p>9 The output will contain a validation error value which we would like to be as low as possible. [sent-42, score-0.257]
</p><p>10 Notice that the error curve has a definitely convex shape and the software gets to the point pretty quickly. [sent-50, score-0.349]
</p><p>11 The chart above refers to optimizing log learning rate. [sent-67, score-0.313]
</p><p>12 First we tried optimizing the learning rate without taking a logartithm. [sent-68, score-0.38]
</p><p>13 Instead of exploring space to the left, where error is clearly lower, Spearmint focuses for some reason on 0. [sent-70, score-0.324]
</p><p>14 Only after switching to optimizing log rate everything went right. [sent-74, score-0.465]
</p><p>15 That poses a potential problem, because when optimizing multiple parameters you won’t be able to plot the error hyperplane to validate it visually. [sent-75, score-0.315]
</p><p>16 If you’re wondering, an apparent reason for this strange behaviour was a high error at the lower bound. [sent-76, score-0.475]
</p><p>17 A learning rate lies in a range of (0, 1), so we set the lower bound at 0. [sent-77, score-0.589]
</p><p>18 Spearmint tries extremes first, and at the lower bound the error is high. [sent-79, score-0.44]
</p><p>19 One hypotesis is that Spearmint is unwilling to explore the space to the left because at the bound the error is so high. [sent-81, score-0.39]
</p><p>20 However, in another experiment this wasn’t a problem:       An apparent difference is that the error is higher at the upper bound than at the lower bound, and also in the shape of the error curve, which is not linear here. [sent-82, score-0.756]

<p>Introduction: Little Spearmint couldn’t sleep that night.  I was so close…  - he was thinking. It seemed that he had found a better than default value for one of the random forest hyperparams, but it turned out to be false. He made a decision as he fell asleep:  Next time, I will show them! 
   
The way to do this is to use a dataset that is known to produce lower error with high  mtry  values, namely previously mentioned  Madelon  from NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge. Among 500 attributes, only 20 are informative, the rest are noise. That’s the reason why high  mtry  is good here: you have to consider a lot of features to find a meaningful one.
 
The dataset consists of a train, validation and test parts, with labels being available for train and validation. We will further split the training set into our train and validation sets, and use the original validation set as a test set to evaluate final results of parameter tuning.
 
As an error measure we use  Area Under Curve , or AUC, which was</p><p>3 0.24709208 <a title="12-tfidf-3" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-12-27-Spearmint_with_a_random_forest.html">13 fast ml-2012-12-27-Spearmint with a random forest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Now that we have  Spearmint basics  nailed, we’ll try tuning a random forest, and specifically two hyperparams: a number of trees ( ntrees ) and a number of candidate features at each split ( mtry ). Here’s  some code .
 
We’re going to use a red  wine quality  dataset. It has about 1600 examples and our goal will be to predict a rating for a wine given all the other properties.   This is a regression* task, as ratings are in (0,10) range.
 
We will split the data 80/10/10 into train, validation and test set, and use the first two to establish optimal hyperparams and then predict on the test set. As an error measure we will use RMSE.
 
At first, we will try  ntrees  between 10 and 200 and  mtry  between 3 and 11 (there’s eleven features total, so that’s the upper bound). Here are the results of two Spearmint runs with 71 and 95 tries respectively. Colors denote a validation error value:

<p>Introduction: Are you interested in linear models, or K-means clustering? Probably not much. These are very basic techniques with fancier alternatives. But here’s the bomb: when you combine those two methods for supervised learning, you can get better results than from a random forest. And maybe even faster.
   
We have already written about  Vowpal Wabbit , a fast linear learner from Yahoo/Microsoft.  Google’s response (or at least, a Google’s guy response) seems to be  Sofia-ML . The software consists of two parts: a linear learner and K-means clustering. We found Sofia a while ago and wondered about K-means: who needs K-means?
 
Here’s a clue:

<p>Introduction: Once upon a time we were browsing machine learning papers and software. We were interested in autoencoders and found a rather unusual one.

We like all things fast, so we were hooked.
    About autoencoders  
 Wikipedia says  that  an autoencoder is an artificial neural network and its aim is to learn a compressed representation for a set of data. This means it is being used for dimensionality reduction . In other words, an autoencoder is a neural network meant to replicate the input. It would be trivial with a big enough number of units in a hidden layer: the network would just find an identity mapping. Hence dimensionality reduction: a hidden layer size is typically smaller than input layer.

<p>Introduction: Vowpal Wabbit now supports a few modes of non-linear supervised learning. They are:
  
 a neural network with a single hidden layer 
 automatic creation of polynomial, specifically quadratic and cubic, features 
 N-grams 
  
We describe how to use them, providing examples from the Kaggle Amazon competition and for the  kin8nm  dataset.
    Neural network  
The original motivation for creating  neural network code in VW   was to win some Kaggle competitions using only vee-dub , and that goal becomes much more feasible once you have a strong non-linear learner.
 
The network seems to be a classic multi-layer perceptron with one sigmoidal hidden layer. More interestingly, it has dropout. Unfortunately, in a few tries we haven’t had much luck with the dropout.
 
Here’s an example of how to create a network with 10 hidden units:
 
 vw -d data.vw --nn 10 
  Quadratic and cubic features  
The idea of quadratic features is to create all possible combinations between original features, so that</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90475911 <a title="12-lda-2" href="../fast_ml-2012/fast_ml-2012-12-21-Tuning_hyperparams_automatically_with_Spearmint.html">12 fast ml-2012-12-21-Tuning hyperparams automatically with Spearmint</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The promise  
What’s attractive in machine learning? That a machine is learning, instead of a human. But an operator still has a lot of work to do. First, he has to learn how to teach a machine, in general. Then, when it comes to a concrete task, there are two main areas where a human needs to do the work (and remember, laziness is a virtue, at least for a programmer, so we’d like to minimize amount of work done by a human):
  
 data preparation 
 model tuning 
  
This story is about model tuning.
   

 
Typically, to achieve satisfactory results, first we need to convert raw data into format accepted by the model we would like to use, and then tune a few hyperparameters of the model.
 
For example, some hyperparams to tune for a random forest may be a number of trees to grow and a number of candidate features at each split ( mtry  in R randomForest). For a neural network, there are quite a lot of hyperparams: number of layers, number of neurons in each layer (specifically, in each hid</p><p>3 0.60403645 <a title="12-lda-3" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-01-14-Feature_selection_in_practice.html">17 fast ml-2013-01-14-Feature selection in practice</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lately we’ve been working with the Madelon dataset. It was originally prepared for a feature selection challenge, so while we’re at it, let’s select some features. Madelon has 500 attributes, 20 of which are real, the rest being noise. Hence the ideal scenario would be to select just those 20 features.
   
Fortunately we know just the right software for this task. It’s called  mRMR , for  minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance , and is available in C and Matlab versions for various platforms. mRMR expects a CSV file with labels in the first column and feature names in the first row. So the game plan is:
  
 combine training and validation sets into a format expected by mRMR 
 run selection 
 filter the original datasets, discarding all features but the selected ones 
 evaluate the results on the validation set 
 if all goes well, prepare and submit files for  the competition  
  
We’ll use  R scripts  for all the steps but feature selection. Now a few words about mRMR. It will show you p</p><p>4 0.59979731 <a title="12-lda-4" href="../fast_ml-2013/fast_ml-2013-01-17-A_very_fast_denoising_autoencoder.html">18 fast ml-2013-01-17-A very fast denoising autoencoder</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Once upon a time we were browsing machine learning papers and software. We were interested in autoencoders and found a rather unusual one. It was called  marginalized Stacked Denoising Autoencoder  and the author claimed that it  preserves the strong feature learning capacity of Stacked Denoising Autoencoders, but is orders of magnitudes faster.  We like all things fast, so we were hooked.
    About autoencoders  
 Wikipedia says  that  an autoencoder is an artificial neural network and its aim is to learn a compressed representation for a set of data. This means it is being used for dimensionality reduction . In other words, an autoencoder is a neural network meant to replicate the input. It would be trivial with a big enough number of units in a hidden layer: the network would just find an identity mapping. Hence dimensionality reduction: a hidden layer size is typically smaller than input layer.

<p>Introduction: Now that we have  Spearmint basics  nailed, we’ll try tuning a random forest, and specifically two hyperparams: a number of trees ( ntrees ) and a number of candidate features at each split ( mtry ). Here’s  some code .
 
We’re going to use a red  wine quality  dataset. It has about 1600 examples and our goal will be to predict a rating for a wine given all the other properties.   This is a regression* task, as ratings are in (0,10) range.
 
We will split the data 80/10/10 into train, validation and test set, and use the first two to establish optimal hyperparams and then predict on the test set. As an error measure we will use RMSE.
 
At first, we will try  ntrees  between 10 and 200 and  mtry  between 3 and 11 (there’s eleven features total, so that’s the upper bound). Here are the results of two Spearmint runs with 71 and 95 tries respectively. Colors denote a validation error value:
  
  green : RMSE < 0.57 
  blue : RMSE < 0.58 
  black : RMSE >= 0.58

<p>Introduction: The Gibbs-Jaynes theorem is a classical result that tells us that the highest
entropy distribution (most uncertain, least committed, etc.) subject to
expectation constraints on a set of features is an exponential family
distribution with the features as sufficient statistics. In math,argmax_p
H(p)s.t. E_p[f_i] = c_iis given by e^{\sum \lambda_i f_i}/Z. (Z here is the
necessary normalization constraint, and the lambdas are free parameters we set
to meet the expectation constraints).A great deal of statistical mechanics
flows from this result, and it has proven very fruitful in learning as well.
(Motivating work in models in text learning and Conditional Random Fields, for
instance. ) The result has been demonstrated a number of ways. One of the most
elegant is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“geometricÃ¢â‚¬Â versionhere.In the case when the
expectation constraints come from data, this tells us that the maximum entropy
distribution is exactly the maximum likelihood distribution in the exponential
family. ItÃ</p><p>3 0.09942878 <a title="493-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-21-Presentation_Preparation.html">249 hunch net-2007-06-21-Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference. Since many
people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial
challenge. Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about
preparing a presentation on research.Motivate. Talks which don't start by
describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out.Prioritize. It
is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many
presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much. This is an
easy-to-understand failure mode as it's very natural to want to include
everything. A basic fact is: you can't. Example of this are:Your slides are so
densely full of equations and words that you can't cover them.Your talk runs
over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off.You motor-mouth
through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience
prioritizes in some uncontrolled fashion.The rate of flow of concepts simply
exceeds the infor</p><p>4 0.09194044 <a title="493-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-28-Somebody%26%238217%3Bs_Eating_Your_Lunch.html">445 hunch net-2011-09-28-Somebody&#8217;s Eating Your Lunch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since we last discussedthe other online learning,Stanfordhas very visibly
started pushing mass teaching inAI,Machine Learning, andDatabases. In
retrospect, it's not too surprising that the next step up in serious online
teaching experiments are occurring at the computer science department of a
university embedded in the land of startups. Numbers on the order of100000are
quite significant--similar in scale to the number ofcomputer science
undergraduate students/yearin the US. Although these populations surely
differ, the fact that theycouldoverlap is worth considering for the
future.It's too soon to say how successful these classes will be and there are
many easy criticisms to make:Registration != Learning… but if only 1/10th

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example

<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4,
2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245
participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a
lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see
ourWIKIfor more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as
organizers to screw it up too bad. Also, since we have pretty good
infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and
Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it
was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this
two-week long party of machine learning.In the end of MLSS we distributed a
survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this
survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from
participants.The first question is designed to find out how our participants

<p>Introduction: Yann LeCunand I are coteaching a class onLarge Scale Machine Learningstarting
late Januaryat NYU. This class will cover many tricks to get machine learning
working well on datasets with many features, examples, and classes, along with
several elements of deep learning and support systems enabling the
previous.This is not a beginning class--you really need to have taken a basic
machine learning class previously to follow along. Students will be able to
run and experiment with large scale learning algorithms sinceYahoo!has donated
servers which are being configured into a small scaleHadoopcluster. We are
planning to cover the frontier of research in scalable learning algorithms, so
good class projects could easily lead to papers.For me, this is a chance to
teach on many topics of past research. In general, it seems like researchers
should engage in at least occasional teaching of research, both as a proof of
teachability and to see their own research through that lens. More generally,

<p>Introduction: The internet has recently made the research process much smoother: papers are
easy to obtain, citations are easy to follow, and unpublished "tutorials" are
often available. Yet, new research fields can look very complicated to
outsiders or newcomers. Every paper is like a small piece of an unfinished
jigsaw puzzle: to understand just one publication, a researcher without
experience in the field will typically have to follow several layers of
citations, and many of the papers he encounters have a great deal of repeated
information. Furthermore, from one publication to the next, notation and
terminology may not be consistent which can further confuse the reader.But the
internet is now proving to be an extremely useful medium for collaboration and
knowledge aggregation. Online forums allow users to ask and answer questions
and to share ideas. The recent phenomenon of Wikipedia provides a proof-of-
concept for the "anyone can edit" system. Can such models be used to
facilitate research and</p><p>6 0.56267077 <a title="493-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-28-Running_A_Machine_Learning_Summer_School.html">75 hunch net-2005-05-28-Running A Machine Learning Summer School</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahn'sPeekaboom projecthas yieldeddata(830MB).Peekaboom is the second
attempt (afterEspgame) to produce a dataset which is useful for learning to
solve vision problems based on voluntary game play. As a second attempt, it is
meant to address all of the shortcomings of the first attempt. In
particular:The locations of specific objects are provided by the data.The data
collection is far more complete and extensive.The data consists of:The source
images. (1 file per image, just short of 60K images.)The in-game events. (1
file per image, in a lispy syntax.)A description of the event language.There
is a great deal of very specific and relevant data here so the hope that this
will help solve vision problems seems quite reasonable.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.83182299 <a title="493-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2014/hunch_net-2014-02-16-Metacademy%3A_a_package_manager_for_knowledge.html">493 hunch net-2014-02-16-Metacademy: a package manager for knowledge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In recent years, there’s been an explosion of free educational resources that
make high-level knowledge and skills accessible to an ever-wider group of
people. In your own field, you probably have a good idea of where to look for
the answer to any particular question. But outside your areas of expertise,
sifting through textbooks, Wikipedia articles, research papers, and online
lectures can be bewildering (unless you’re fortunate enough to have a
knowledgeable colleague to consult). What are the key concepts in the field,
how do they relate to each other, which ones should you learn, and where
should you learn them?Courses are a major vehicle for packaging educational
materials for a broad audience. The trouble is that they’re typically meant to
be consumed linearly, regardless of your specific background or goals. Also,
unless thousands of other people have had the same background and learning
goals, there may not even be a course that fits your needs. Recently, we

<p>Introduction: I attendedALT("Algorithmic Learning Theory") for the first time this year. My
impression is ALT = 0.5 COLT, by attendance and also by some more intangible
"what do I get from it?" measure. There are many differences which can't quite
be described this way though. The program for ALT seems to be substantially
more diverse than COLT, which is both a weakness and a strength.One paper that
might interest people generally is:Alexey ChernovandVladimir Vovk,Prediction
with Expert Evaluators' Advice. The basic observation here is that in the
online learning with experts setting you can simultaneously compete with
several compatible loss functions simultaneously. Restated, debating between
competing with log loss and squared loss is a waste of breath, because it's
almost free to compete with them both simultaneously. This might interest
anyone who has run into "which loss function?" debates that come up
periodically.</p><p>4 0.71510804 <a title="493-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-11-Yahoo%26%238217%3Bs_Learning_Problems..html">156 hunch net-2006-02-11-Yahoo&#8217;s Learning Problems.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just visitedYahoo Researchwhich has several fundamental learning problems
near to (or beyond) the set of problems we know how to solve well. Here are 3
of them.RankingThis is the canonical problem of all search engines. It is made
extra difficult for several reasons.There is relatively little "good"
supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as
click through rates).The learning must occur in a partially adversarial
environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top
ofrankings.It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as
'ranking' or as 'regression' which is then used to produce
aranking.Collaborative filteringYahoo has a large number of recommendation
systems for music, movies, etcâ&euro;Ś In these sorts of systems, users specify how
they liked a set of things, and then the system can (hopefully) find some more
examples of things they might likeby reasoning across multiple such
sets.Exploration with Generalization</p><p>5 0.58406168 <a title="493-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-28-Programming_Languages_for_Machine_Learning_Implementations.html">210 hunch net-2006-09-28-Programming Languages for Machine Learning Implementations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning algorithms have a much better chance of being widely adopted
if they are implemented in some easy-to-use code. There are several important
concerns associated with machine learning which stress programming languages
on the ease-of-use vs. speed frontier.SpeedThe rate at which data sources are
growing seems to be outstripping the rate at which computational power is
growing, so it is important that we be able to eak out every bit of
computational power. Garbage collected languages (java,ocaml,perlandpython)
often have several issues here.Garbage collection often implies that floating
point numbers are "boxed": every float is represented by a pointer to a float.
Boxing can cause an order of magnitude slowdown because an extra nonlocalized
memory reference is made, and accesses to main memory can are many CPU cycles
long.Garbage collection often implies that considerably more memory is used
than is necessary. This has a variable effect. In some circumstances it
results in</p><p>6 0.57903576 <a title="493-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-03-All_Models_of_Learning_have_Flaws.html">235 hunch net-2007-03-03-All Models of Learning have Flaws</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since we last discussed  the other online learning ,  Stanford  has very visibly started pushing mass teaching in  AI ,  Machine Learning , and  Databases .  In retrospect, it’s not too surprising that the next step up in serious online teaching experiments are occurring at the computer science department of a university embedded in the land of startups.  Numbers on the order of  100000  are quite significant—similar in scale to the number of  computer science undergraduate students/year  in the US.  Although these populations surely differ, the fact that they  could  overlap is worth considering for the future.  
 
It’s too soon to say how successful these classes will be and there are many easy criticisms to make:
  
  Registration != Learning   … but if only 1/10th complete these classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of any traditional process.

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference.  Since many people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial challenge.  Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about preparing a presentation on research.
  
  Motivate .  Talks which don’t start by describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out. 
  Prioritize .  It is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much.  This is an easy-to-understand failure mode as it’s very natural to want to include everything.  A basic fact is: you can’t.  Example of this are:
 
 Your slides are so densely full of equations and words that you can’t cover them. 
 Your talk runs over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off. 
 You motor-mouth through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience prioritizes in some uncontrolled fashion. 
 The rate of flow of c</p><p>4 0.081355289 <a title="493-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time.

<p>Introduction: Watson  convincingly beat the best champion  Jeopardy!  players.  The apparent significance of this varies hugely, depending on your background knowledge about the related machine learning, NLP, and search technology.  For a random person, this might seem evidence of serious machine intelligence, while for people working on the system itself, it probably seems like a reasonably good assemblage of existing technologies with several twists to make the entire system work.
 
Above all, I think we should congratulate the people who managed to put together and execute this project—many years of effort by a diverse set of highly skilled people were needed to make this happen.  In academia, it’s pretty difficult for one professor to assemble that quantity of talent, and in industry it’s rarely the case that such a capable group has both a worthwhile project and the support needed to pursue something like this for several years before success.

<p>Introduction: Chicago ’05  ended a couple of weeks ago. This was the sixth  Machine Learning Summer School , and the second one that used a  wiki . (The first was Berder ’04, thanks to Gunnar Raetsch.) Wikis are relatively easy to set up, greatly aid social interaction, and should be used a lot more at summer schools and workshops. They can even be used as the meeting’s webpage, as a permanent record of its participants’ collaborations — see for example the wiki/website for last year’s  NVO Summer School .
 
A basic wiki is a collection of editable webpages, maintained by software called a   wiki engine . The engine used at both Berder and Chicago was  TikiWiki  — it is well documented and gets you something running fast. It uses PHP and MySQL, but doesn’t require you to know either. Tikiwiki has far more features than most wikis, as it is  really a full  Content Management System . (My thanks to Sebastian Stark for pointing this out.) Here are the features we found most useful:

<p>Introduction: Yann LeCun  and I are coteaching a class on  Large Scale Machine Learning  starting late January  at NYU .  This class will cover many tricks to get machine learning working well on datasets with many features, examples, and classes, along with several elements of deep learning and support systems enabling the previous.
 
This is not a beginning class—you really need to have taken a basic machine learning class previously to follow along.  Students will be able to run and experiment with large scale learning algorithms since  Yahoo!  has donated servers which are being configured into a small scale  Hadoop  cluster.   We are planning to cover the frontier of research in scalable learning algorithms, so good class projects could easily lead to papers.
 
For me, this is a chance to teach on many topics of past research.  In general, it seems like researchers should engage in at least occasional teaching of research, both as a proof of teachability and to see their own research through th</p><p>6 0.57633048 <a title="493-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-06-Machine_Learning_to_AI.html">352 hunch net-2009-05-06-Machine Learning to AI</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve been looking at some recent embeddings work, and am struck by how beautiful the theory and algorithms are. It also makes me wonder, what are embeddings good for?
 
A few things immediately come to mind:
 
(1) For visualization of high-dimensional data sets.
 
In this case, one would like good algorithms for embedding specifically into 2- and 3-dimensional Euclidean spaces.
 
(2) For nonparametric modeling.
 
The usual nonparametric models (histograms, nearest neighbor) often require resources which are exponential in the dimension. So if the data actually lie close to some low-dimensional 
surface, it might be a good idea to first identify this surface and embed the data before applying the model.
 
Incidentally, for applications like these, it’s important to have a functional mapping from high to low dimension, which some techniques do not yield up.
 
(3) As a prelude to classifier learning.
 
The hope here is presumably that learning will be easier in the low-dimensional space,</p><p>2 0.8918159 <a title="493-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-04-23-Jonathan_Chang_at_Slycoder.html">350 hunch net-2009-04-23-Jonathan Chang at Slycoder</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I would like to point out 3 graduates this season as having my confidence they are capable of doing great things. 
  
  Daniel Hsu  has diverse papers with diverse coauthors on {active learning, mulitlabeling, temporal learning, …} each covering new algorithms and methods of analysis.  He is also a capable programmer, having helped me with some nitty-gritty details of cluster parallel  Vowpal Wabbit  this summer.  He has an excellent tendency to just get things done. 
  Nicolas Lambert  doesn’t nominally work in machine learning, but I’ve found his work in  elicitation  relevant nevertheless.  In essence, elicitable properties are closely related to learnable properties, and the elicitation complexity is related to a notion of learning complexity.  See the  Surrogate regret bounds paper  for some related discussion.  Few people successfully work at such a general level that it crosses fields, but he’s one of them.

<p>Introduction: In recent years, there’s been an explosion of free educational resources that make high-level knowledge and skills accessible to an ever-wider group of people. In your own field, you probably have a good idea of where to look for the answer to any particular question. But outside your areas of expertise, sifting through textbooks, Wikipedia articles, research papers, and online lectures can be bewildering (unless you’re fortunate enough to have a knowledgeable colleague to consult). What are the key concepts in the field, how do they relate to each other, which ones should you learn, and where should you learn them?
 
Courses are a major vehicle for packaging educational materials for a broad audience. The trouble is that they’re typically meant to be consumed linearly, regardless of your specific background or goals. Also, unless thousands of other people have had the same background and learning goals, there may not even be a course that fits your needs. Recently, we ( Roger Grosse</p><p>5 0.73678732 <a title="493-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-22-Create_Your_Own_ICML_Workshop.html">234 hunch net-2007-02-22-Create Your Own ICML Workshop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As usual  ICML 2007  will be hosting a  workshop program  to be held this year on June 24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I’d like to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for details. 
 
Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your choosing. I’ve always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-conference on a particular ML sub-area.  Hope to see some interesting proposals rolling in.</p><p>6 0.64436126 <a title="493-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-01-07-NYU_Large_Scale_Machine_Learning_Class.html">478 hunch net-2013-01-07-NYU Large Scale Machine Learning Class</a></p>

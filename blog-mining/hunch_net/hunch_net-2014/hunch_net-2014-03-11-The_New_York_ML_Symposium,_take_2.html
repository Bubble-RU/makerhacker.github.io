<p>Introduction: A reminder that the  New York Academy of Sciences  will be hosting the  7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium  tomorrow from 9:30am.
 
The main program will feature invited talks from  Peter Bartlett ,  William Freeman , and  Vladimir Vapnik , along with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main program,  hackNY  and  Microsoft Research  are sponsoring a networking hour with talks from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups (specifically  bit.ly ,  Buzzfeed ,  Chartbeat , and  Sense Networks ,  Visual Revenue ).  This should be of great interest to everyone considering working in machine learning.</p><p>5 0.58656484 <a title="494-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-17-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">410 hunch net-2010-09-17-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is another  machine learning meetup  where I’ll be speaking.  Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as “the future of machine learning”.  In particular, it’s all about how to learn in an interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation, etc…
 
On Sept 24, abstracts for the  New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it’s a great way to have a conversation with other people.
 
On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually happens.  This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more time for posters.  In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:  David Blei ,  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Tommi Jaakkola , and  Yann LeCun .  After the meeting, a late  hackNY  related event is planned where students and startups can meet.
 
I’d also like to point out the related  CS/Econ symposium  as I have interests there as well.</p><p>6 0.5859617 <a title="494-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-28-NY_ML_Symposium_2010.html">415 hunch net-2010-10-28-NY ML Symposium 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Carla Vicens and  Eric Siegel  contacted me about  Predictive Analytics World  in San Francisco February 18&19, which I wasn’t familiar with.  A quick look at the  agenda  reveals several people I know working on applications of machine learning in businesses, covering deployed applications topics.  It’s interesting to see a business-focused machine learning conference, as it says that we are succeeding as a field.  If you are interested in deployed applications, you might attend.
 
Eric and I did a quick interview by email.

I’ve mostly published and participated in academic machine learning conferences like ICML, COLT, and NIPS.   When I look at the  set of speakers and subjects  for your conference  I think “machine learning for business”.  Is that your understanding of things? What I’m trying to ask is: what do you view as the primary goal for this conference?

<p>Introduction: The competitors for the  Netflix Prize  are tantalizingly close winning the million dollar prize.  This year,  BellKor  and  Commendo Research  sent a combined solution that won the  progress prize .  Reading the  writeups   2  is instructive.  Several aspects of solutions are taken for granted including stochastic gradient descent, ensemble prediction, and targeting residuals (a form of boosting).  Relatively to last year, it appears that many approaches have added parameterizations, especially for the purpose of modeling through time.
 
The big question is: will they make the big prize?  At this point, the level of complexity in entering the competition is prohibitive, so perhaps only the existing competitors will continue to try.  (This equation might change drastically if the teams open source their existing solutions, including parameter settings.) One fear is that the progress is asymptoting on the wrong side of the 10% threshold.  In the first year, the teams progressed through</p><p>5 0.53623724 <a title="494-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML_Open_Questions_and_ICML_Instructions.html">458 hunch net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML Open Questions and ICML Instructions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sasha  is the  open problems  chair for both  COLT   and   ICML .  Open problems will be presented in a joint session in the evening of the COLT/ICML overlap day.   COLT has a history of open sessions, but this is new for ICML.  If you have a difficult theoretically definable problem in machine learning, consider submitting it for review,  due March 16 .  You’ll benefit three ways: 
  
 The effort of writing down a precise formulation of what you want often helps you understand the nature of the problem. 
 Your problem will be officially published and citable. 
 You might have it solved by some very intelligent bored people. 
  
The general idea could easily be applied to any problem which can be crisply stated with an easily verifiable solution, and we may consider expanding this in later years, but for this year all problems need to be of a theoretical variety.

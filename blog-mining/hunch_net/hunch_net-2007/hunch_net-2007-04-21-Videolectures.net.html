<p>Introduction: The  large scale machine learning class  I taught with  Yann LeCun  has finished.  As I expected, it took quite a bit of time   .  We had about 25 people attending in person on average and 400 regularly watching the  recorded lectures  which is substantially more sustained interest than I expected for an advanced ML class.  We also had some fun with class projects—I’m hopeful that several will eventually turn into papers.
 
I expect there are a number of professors interested in lecturing on this and related topics.  Everyone will have their personal taste in subjects of course, but hopefully there will be some convergence to common course materials as well.  To help with this, I am making the  sources to my presentations available .

<p>Introduction: I just created  version 5.1  of  vowpal wabbit .  This almost entirely a bugfix release, so it’s an easy upgrade from v5.0.
 
In addition:
  
 There is now a  mailing list , which I and several other developers are subscribed to. 
 The main website has shifted to the wiki on github.  This means that anyone with a github account can now edit it. 
 I’m planning to give a tutorial tomorrow on it at  eHarmony / the LA machine learning meetup  at 10am.  Drop by if you’re interested. 
  
The status of VW amongst other open source projects has changed.  When VW first came out, it was relatively unique amongst existing projects in terms of features.  At this point, many other projects have started to appreciate the value of the design choices here.  This includes:
  
  Mahout , which now has an SGD implementation. 
  Shogun , where  Soeren  is keen on  incorporating features . 
  LibLinear , where they won the KDD best paper award for  out-of-core learning .

  Videos  will be posted with about a 1 day delay on  techtalks .  This is a side-by-side capture of video+slides from  Weyond .

<p>Introduction: A reminder that the  New York Academy of Sciences  will be hosting the  7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium  tomorrow from 9:30am.
 
The main program will feature invited talks from  Peter Bartlett ,  William Freeman , and  Vladimir Vapnik , along with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main program,  hackNY  and  Microsoft Research  are sponsoring a networking hour with talks from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups (specifically  bit.ly ,  Buzzfeed ,  Chartbeat , and  Sense Networks ,  Visual Revenue ).  This should be of great interest to everyone considering working in machine learning.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.92048442 <a title="240-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-21-Videolectures.net.html">240 hunch net-2007-04-21-Videolectures.net</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a difficult subject to talk about for many reasons, but a discussion may be helpful.
 
Bad reviewing is a problem in academia.  The first step in understanding this is admitting to the problem, so here is a short list of examples of bad reviewing. 
  
 Reviewer disbelieves theorem proof (ICML),  or disbelieve theorem with a trivially false counterexample. (COLT)  
 Reviewer internally swaps quantifiers in a theorem, concludes it has been done before and is trivial. (NIPS) 
 Reviewer believes a technique will not work despite experimental validation. (COLT) 
 Reviewers fail to notice flaw in theorem statement (CRYPTO).   
 Reviewer erroneously claims that it has been done before (NIPS, SODA, JMLR)—(complete with references!) 
 Reviewer inverts the message of a paper and concludes it says nothing important. (NIPS*2) 
 Reviewer fails to distinguish between a DAG and a tree (SODA). 
 Reviewer is enthusiastic about paper but clearly does not understand (ICML).

<p>Introduction: This is a very difficult post to write, because it is about a perenially touchy subject.  Nevertheless, it is an important one which needs to be thought about carefully.
 
There are a few things which should be understood:
  
 The system is changing and responsive.  We-the-authors are we-the-reviewers, we-the-PC, and even we-the-NIPS-board.  NIPS has implemented ‘secondary program chairs’, ‘author response’, and ‘double blind reviewing’ in the last few years to help with the decision process, and more changes may happen in the future. 
 Agreement creates a perception of correctness.  When any PC meets and makes a group decision about a paper, there is a strong tendency for the reinforcement inherent in a group decision to create the perception of correctness.  For the many people who have been on the NIPS PC it’s reasonable to entertain a healthy skepticism in the face of this reinforcing certainty.

<p>Introduction: Although I’m greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in reviews.  The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if the  Byzantine generals  limit has been exceeded.  For example, I’ve seen recent reviews where the given reasons for rejecting are:
  
 [ NIPS ] Theorem A is uninteresting because Theorem B is uninteresting. 
 [ UAI ] When you learn by memorization, the problem addressed is trivial. 
 [NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.  
 [NIPS] This has been done before.  (… but not giving any relevant citations)  
  
Just for the record I want to point out what’s wrong with these reviews.  A future world in which such reasons never come up again would be great, but I’m sure these errors will be committed many times more in the future.
  
 This is nonsense.  A theorem should be evaluated based on it’s merits, rather than the merits of another theorem.

<p>Introduction: Hal ,  Daniel , and I have been working on the algorithm  Searn  for structured prediction.  This was just conditionally accepted and then rejected from ICML, and we were quite surprised.  By any reasonable criteria, it seems this is an interesting algorithm.
  
 Prediction Performance: Searn performed better than any other algorithm on all the problems we tested against using the same feature set.  This is true even using the numbers reported by authors in their papers. 
 Theoretical underpinning.  Searn is a reduction which comes with a reduction guarantee: the good performance on a base classifiers implies good performance for the overall system.  No other theorem of this type has been made for other structured prediction algorithms, as far as we know. 
 Speed. Searn has no problem handling much larger datasets than other algorithms we tested against. 
 Simplicity.  Given code for a binary classifier and a problem-specific search algorithm, only a few tens of lines are necessary to</p><p>5 0.13031702 <a title="238-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-16-Representative_Reviewing.html">484 hunch net-2013-06-16-Representative Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some conception of what good reviewing is.  As far as I can tell, this is almost always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a “good paper” looks like for that area) rather than general principles.  Neither individual papers or areas are sufficiently general for a large conference—every paper differs in the details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?
 
An unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too large.  In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper which someone thinks might be of interest.  This reason for reviewing exists independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual conferences.  Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively meaningless over the long term — growing conferences simply use more rooms and/or change fo</p><p>6 0.12679435 <a title="238-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-26-The_SODA_Program_Committee.html">318 hunch net-2008-09-26-The SODA Program Committee</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections.  They always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections come to seem reasonable.  Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the topic just isn’t as important as was originally thought.  A few rejections do not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror stories, a great material for conversations.  I’ve decided to share three of mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.
  
  Prediction Theory for Classification Tutorial .  This is a tutorial about tight sample complexity bounds for classification that I submitted to  JMLR .  The first decision I heard was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me—for example one of the reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics books.  Upon further inquiry, several citations were given, none of which actually covered the content.  Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was accepted.

<p>Introduction: This is a rather long post, detailing the ICML 2012 review process. The goal is to make the process more transparent, help authors understand how we came to a decision, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this process for future conference organizers.
 
 Microsoft’s Conference Management Toolkit (CMT)  
We chose to use  CMT  over other conference management software mainly because of its rich toolkit. The interface is sub-optimal (to say the least!) but it has extensive capabilities (to handle bids, author response, resubmissions, etc.), good import/export mechanisms (to process the data elsewhere), excellent technical support (to answer late night emails, add new functionalities).  Overall, it was the right choice, although we hope a designer will look at that interface sometime soon!

<p>Introduction: … but only the little prize.  The  BellKor team  focused on integrating predictions from many different methods.  The base methods consist of:
  
 Nearest Neighbor Methods 
 Matrix Factorization Methods (asymmetric and symmetric) 
 Linear Regression on various feature spaces 
 Restricted Boltzman Machines 
  
The final predictor was an ensemble (as was reasonable to expect), although it’s a little bit more complicated than just a weighted average—it’s essentially a customized learning algorithm.  Base approaches (1)-(3) seem like relatively well-known approaches (although I haven’t seen the asymmetric factorization variant before).  RBMs are the new approach.
 
The  writeup  is pretty clear for more details.
 
The contestants are close to reaching the big prize, but the last 1.5% is probably at least as hard as what’s been done.  A few new structurally different methods for making predictions may need to be discovered and added into the mixture.  In other words, research may be require</p><p>2 0.9231773 <a title="238-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-26-Netflix_nearly_done.html">362 hunch net-2009-06-26-Netflix nearly done</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A $1M qualifying result was achieved on the  public Netflix test set  by a  3-way ensemble team .  This is just in time for  Yehuda ‘s presentation at  KDD , which I’m sure will be one of the best attended ever.  
 
This isn’t quite over—there are a few days for another super-conglomerate team to come together and there is some small chance that the performance is nonrepresentative of the final test set, but I expect not.  
 
Regardless of the final outcome, the biggest lesson for ML from the Netflix contest has been the formidable performance edge of ensemble methods.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90043366 <a title="238-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-13-What_to_do_with_an_unreasonable_conditional_accept.html">238 hunch net-2007-04-13-What to do with an unreasonable conditional accept</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Last year about this time, we received a conditional accept for the  searn paper , which asked us to reference a paper that was not reasonable to cite because there was strictly more relevant work by the same authors that we already cited.  We wrote a response explaining this, and didn’t cite it in the final draft, giving the SPC an excuse to  reject the paper , leading to unhappiness for all.
 
Later,  Sanjoy Dasgupta  suggested that an alternative was to talk to the PC chair instead, as soon as you see that a conditional accept is unreasonable.   William Cohen  and I spoke about this by email, the relevant bit of which is:
  

If an SPC asks for a revision that is inappropriate, the correct 
action is to contact the chairs as soon as the decision is made, 
clearly explaining what the problem is, so we can decide whether or 
not to over-rule the SPC.  As you say, this is extra work for us 
chairs, but that’s part of the job, and we’re willing to do that sort 
of work to improve the ov</p><p>4 0.83025873 <a title="238-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-18-Report_of_MLSS_2006_Taipei.html">203 hunch net-2006-08-18-Report of MLSS 2006 Taipei</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4, 2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245 participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see our  WIKI  for more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as organizers to screw it up too bad.  Also, since we have pretty good infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this two-week long party of machine learning.
 
In the end of MLSS we distributed a survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from participants.  
 
The first question is designed to find out how our participants learned about MLSS</p><p>5 0.63141257 <a title="238-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML.  I did manage to catch one interesting paper:
 
 Richard Socher ,  Cliff Lin ,  Andrew Y. Ng , and  Christopher D. Manning   Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks .
 
I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so hopefully we’ll hear from him soon.  In the meantime,  Paul  and  Hal  have posted some lists.
 
 the future 
 
 Joelle  and I are program chairs for ICML 2012 in  Edinburgh , which I previously enjoyed visiting in  2005 .  This is a huge responsibility, that we hope to accomplish well.  A part of this (perhaps the most fun part), is imagining how we can make ICML better.  A key and critical constraint is choosing things that can be accomplished.  So far we have:
  
  Colocation . The first thing we looked into was potential colocations.  We quickly discovered that many other conferences precomitted their location.

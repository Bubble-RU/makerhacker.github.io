<p>Introduction: Many people in machine learning take advantage of the notion of a proxy loss:
A loss function which is much easier to optimize computationally than the loss
function imposed by the world. A canonical example is when we want to learn a
weight vectorwand predict according to a dot productfw(x)= sumiwixiwhere
optimizing squared loss(y-fw(x))2over many samples is much more tractable than
optimizing 0-1 lossI(y = Threshold(fw(x) - 0.5)).While the computational
advantages of optimizing a proxy loss are substantial, we are curious: which
proxy loss is best? The answer of course depends on what the real loss imposed
by the world is. For 0-1 loss classification, there are adherents to many
choices:Log loss. If we confine the prediction to[0,1], we can treat it as a
predicted probability that the label is1, and measure loss according tolog
1/p'(y|x)wherep'(y|x)is the predicted probability of the observed label. A
standard method for confining the prediction to[0,1]islogistic regressionwhich

<p>Introduction: A loss function is some function which, for any example, takes a prediction
and the correct prediction, and determines how much loss is incurred. (People
sometimes attempt to optimize functions of more than one example such as "area
under the ROC curve" or "harmonic mean of precision and recall".) Typically we
try to find predictors that minimize loss.There seems to be a strong dichotomy
between two views of what "loss" means in learning.Loss is determined by the
problem.Loss is a part of the specification of the learning problem. Examples
of problems specified by the loss function include "binary classification",

<p>Introduction: Some loss functions have a meaning, which can be understood in a manner
independent of the loss function itself.Optimizing squared
losslsq(y,y')=(y-y')2means predicting the (conditional) mean ofy.Optimizing
absolute value losslav(y,y')=|y-y'|means predicting the (conditional) median
ofy. Variants canhandle other quantiles. 0/1 loss for classification is a
special case.Optimizing log lossllog(y,y')=log (1/Prz~y'(z=y))means minimizing
the description length ofy.The semantics (= meaning) of the loss are made
explicit by a theorem in each case. For squared loss, we can prove a theorem
of the form:For all distributionsDoverY, ify' = arg miny'Ey ~ Dlsq(y,y')theny'
= Ey~DySimilar theorems hold for the other examples above, and they can all be
extended to predictors ofy'for distributionsDover a contextXand a valueY.There
are 3 points to this post.Everyone doing general machine learning should be
aware of the laundry list above. They form a handy toolkit which can match

<p>Introduction: TheNew York Machine Learning Symposiumis October 19 with a 2 page abstract
deadline due September 13 via email with subject "Machine Learning Poster
Submission" sent to physicalscience@nyas.org. Everyone is welcome to submit.
Last year's attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.The primary
experiment forICML 2013is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling
review cycles. The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15. This
is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and
reduce peak load. The "not for proceedings" experiment from this year's ICML
is not continuing.Edit: Fixed second ICML deadline.</p><p>3 0.78258294 <a title="245-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-18-SVM_Adaptability.html">103 hunch net-2005-08-18-SVM Adaptability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several recent papers have shown that SVM-like optimizations can be used to
handle several large family loss functions.This is a good thing because it is
implausible that thelossfunction imposed by the world can not be taken into
account in the process of solving a prediction problem. Even people used to
the hard-coreBayesianapproach to learning often note that some approximations
are almost inevitable in specifying apriorand/or integrating to achieve a
posterior. Taking into account how the system will be evaluated can allow both
computational effort and design effort to be focused so as to improve
performance.A current laundry list of capabilities includes:2002multiclass SVM

<p>Introduction: Many people in machine learning take advantage of the notion of a proxy loss:
A loss function which is much easier to optimize computationally than the loss
function imposed by the world. A canonical example is when we want to learn a
weight vectorwand predict according to a dot productfw(x)= sumiwixiwhere
optimizing squared loss(y-fw(x))2over many samples is much more tractable than
optimizing 0-1 lossI(y = Threshold(fw(x) - 0.5)).While the computational
advantages of optimizing a proxy loss are substantial, we are curious: which
proxy loss is best? The answer of course depends on what the real loss imposed
by the world is. For 0-1 loss classification, there are adherents to many
choices:Log loss. If we confine the prediction to[0,1], we can treat it as a
predicted probability that the label is1, and measure loss according tolog
1/p'(y|x)wherep'(y|x)is the predicted probability of the observed label. A
standard method for confining the prediction to[0,1]islogistic regressionwhich

</p><p>6 This blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from about 13K unique sites per month. [sent-14, score-1.027]
</p><p>7 This number of visitors is large enough that it scares me somewhat—having several thousand people read a post is more attention than almost all papers published in academia get. [sent-15, score-0.626]
</p><p>8 The internet has a huge untapped capacity to support content, so one of the traditional reasons for editorial control (limited space) simply no longer exists. [sent-19, score-0.391]
</p><p>9 Nevertheless, the time of readers is important and there is a focus-of-attention issue since one blog with all posts on all topics would be virtually useless. [sent-20, score-0.991]
</p><p>10 In an ideal world, the need for explicit content control would disappear and be replaced by a massive cooperative collaborative filtering process. [sent-21, score-0.556]
</p><p>11 This shift is already well underway since anyone can start their own blog and read anything they choose. [sent-22, score-0.658]
</p><p>12 Expending the effort to write clearly about them in a post is not too difficult from expending the effort to write clearly about them in a paper, which is the traditional mechanism of publishing. [sent-28, score-0.985]
</p><p>13 There is no simply way around this problem, although changing people’s expectations may be helpful. [sent-29, score-0.299]
</p><p>14 For the record, I’m always happy to consider posts by others. [sent-32, score-0.295]
</p><p>15 If you are considering your own blog, trying a guest post or two is a great way to experiment. [sent-33, score-0.495]
</p><p>16 Many people don’t have the time or inclination to run their own blog, so guest posts are essential. [sent-34, score-0.571]
</p><p>17 A blog strongly encourages otherwise since the backgrounds of readers are very diverse. [sent-39, score-0.677]

<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-issues for the moment.
 
The number of posts is a bit over 20. 
The number of people speaking up in discussions is about 10. 
The number of people viewing the site is somewhat more than 100.
 
I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many things.
  
 Many of the  potential uses  haven’t been realized.  This is partly a matter of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no open problems because it’s hard to give them up), and partly a matter of tradition.  In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get everything perfectly right before presentation.  This is somewhat contradictory to the nature of making many posts, and it’s definitely contradictory to the idea of doing “public research”.  If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to continue experimenting, I’m going to use the next week as “open problems we</p><p>3 0.2645365 <a title="225-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’d like to point out  Inherent Uncertainty , which I’ve added to the ML blog post scanner on the right.

<p>Introduction: At the one year (+5 days) anniversary, the natural question is: “Was it helpful for research?”
 
Answer: Yes, and so it shall continue.
 
Some evidence is provided by noticing that I am about a factor of 2 more overloaded with paper ideas than I’ve ever previously been.  It is always hard to estimate counterfactual worlds, but I expect that this is also a factor of 2 more than “What if I had not started the blog?”
 
As for “Why?”, there seem to be two primary effects.
  
 A blog is a mechanism for connecting with people who either think like you or are interested in the same problems.  This allows for concentration of thinking which is very helpful in solving problems. 
 The process of stating things you don’t understand publicly is very helpful in understanding them.  Sometimes you are simply forced to express them in a way which aids understanding.  Sometimes someone else says something which helps.  And sometimes you discover that someone else has already solved the problem.

<p>Introduction: This is the  6 month point  in the “run a research blog” experiment, so it seems like a good point to take stock and assess.  
 
One fundamental question is: “Is it worth it?”  The idea of running a research blog will never become widely popular and useful unless it actually aids research.  On the negative side, composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount of time.  On the positive side, the process might yield better research because there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster thinking.
 
My answer at the moment is a provisional “yes”.  Running the blog has been incidentally helpful in several ways:
  
 It is sometimes educational.  example  
 More often, the process of composing thoughts well enough to post simply aids thinking.  This has resulted in a couple solutions to problems of  interest  (and perhaps more over time).

<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time. 
  Feedback failure .  This blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from</p><p>2 0.86518651 <a title="225-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-18-Decision_by_Vetocracy.html">343 hunch net-2009-02-18-Decision by Vetocracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Few would mistake the process of academic paper review for a fair process, but sometimes the unfairness seems particularly striking.  This is most easily seen by comparison:
  
 
 Paper 
  Banditron  
  Offset Tree  
 Notes 
 
 
 Problem Scope 
 Multiclass problems where only the loss of one choice can be probed. 
 Strictly greater: Cost sensitive multiclass problems where only the loss of one choice can be probed. 
 Often generalizations don’t matter.  That’s not the case here, since every plausible application I’ve thought of involves loss functions substantially different from 0/1.

  As far as I know, the essence of the more general problem was first stated and analyzed with the  EXP4 algorithm (page 16)  (1998).  It’s also the time horizon 1 simplification of the Reinforcement Learning setting for the  random trajectory method (page 15)  (2002).

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML.  I did manage to catch one interesting paper:
 
 Richard Socher ,  Cliff Lin ,  Andrew Y. Ng , and  Christopher D. Manning   Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks .
 
I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so hopefully we’ll hear from him soon.  In the meantime,  Paul  and  Hal  have posted some lists.
 
 the future 
 
 Joelle  and I are program chairs for ICML 2012 in  Edinburgh , which I previously enjoyed visiting in  2005 .  This is a huge responsibility, that we hope to accomplish well.  A part of this (perhaps the most fun part), is imagining how we can make ICML better.  A key and critical constraint is choosing things that can be accomplished.  So far we have:
  
  Colocation . The first thing we looked into was potential colocations.  We quickly discovered that many other conferences precomitted their location.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people .  Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs, this is serious for  Yahoo! Research .  
 
We had advanced warning from  Prabhakar  through the  simple act of leaving .  Yahoo! Research was a world class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave.  My first thought when I saw the news was “Uhoh,  Rob  said that he knew it was serious when the head of ATnT Research left.”  In this case it was even more significant, because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high engagement with the company.  Prabhakar’s departure is a clear end to that experiment.
 
The result is ambiguous from a business perspective.  Y!R clearly was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses.  I’m not privy to the internal accounting of impact and this is the kind of subject where there c</p><p>6 0.85744792 <a title="225-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-15-NIPS_workshops_extended_to_3_days.html">266 hunch net-2007-10-15-NIPS workshops extended to 3 days</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This
blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from about 13K unique
sites p</p><p>4 0.072220668 <a title="246-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-21-Six_Months.html">96 hunch net-2005-07-21-Six Months</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is the6 month pointin the "run a research blog" experiment, so it seems
like a good point to take stock and assess.One fundamental question is: "Is it
worth it?" The idea of running a research blog will never become widely
popular and useful unless it actually aids research. On the negative side,
composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount
of time. On the positive side, the process might yield better research because
there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster
thinking.My answer at the moment is a provisional "yes". Running the blog has
been incidentally helpful in several ways:It is sometimes
educational.exampleMore often, the process of composing thoughts well enough
to post simply aids thinking. This has resulted in a couple solutions to
problems ofinterest(and perhaps more over time). If you really want to solve a
problem, letting the world know is helpful. This isn't necessarily because the
world will help you s</p><p>5 0.071158201 <a title="246-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-14-Who_is_Responsible_for_a_Bad_Review%3F.html">320 hunch net-2008-10-14-Who is Responsible for a Bad Review?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Although I'm greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be
admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in
reviews. The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if theByzantine
generalslimit has been exceeded. For example, I've seen recent reviews where
the given reasons for rejecting are:[NIPS] Theorem A is uninteresting because
Theorem B is uninteresting.[UAI] When you learn by memorization, the problem
addressed is trivial.[NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.[NIPS] This has been
done before. (â&euro;Ś but not giving any relevant citations)Just for the record I
want to point out what's wrong with these reviews. A future world in which
such reasons never come up again would be great, but I'm sure these errors
will be committed many times more in the future.This is nonsense. A theorem
should be evaluated based on it's merits, rather than the merits of another
theorem.Learning by memorization requires an exponentially larger sample
complexity than man</p><p>6 0.069272429 <a title="246-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-04-The_Health_of_COLT.html">89 hunch net-2005-07-04-The Health of COLT</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The hunch.net server has been updated. I've taken the opportunity to upgrade
the version of wordpress which caused cascading changes.Old threaded comments
are now flattened. The system we used to use (Brian's threaded comments)
appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress. I
haven't yet figured out a workaround.I setup afeedburner account.I added an
RSS aggregator for both Machine Learning and other research blogs that I like
to follow. This is something that I've wanted to do for awhile.Many other
minor changes in font and format, with some help fromAlina.If you have any
suggestions for site tweaks, please speak up.</p><p>5 0.47730368 <a title="246-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-21-The_Science_2.0_article.html">296 hunch net-2008-04-21-The Science 2.0 article</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found the article aboutscience using modern tools interesting, especially
the part about 'blogophobia', which in my experience is often a substantial
issue: many potential guest posters aren't quite ready, because of the fear of
a permanent public mistake, because it is particularly hard to write about the
unknown (the essence of research), and because the system for public credit
doesn't yet really handle blog posts.So far, science has been relatively
resistant to discussing research on blogs. Some things need to change to get
there. Public tolerance of the occasional mistake is essential, as is a
willingness to cite (and credit) blogs as freely as papers.I've often run into
another reason for holding back myself: I don't want to overtalk my own
research. Nevertheless, I'm slowly changing to the opinion that I'm holding
back too much: the real power of a blog in research is that it can be used to
confer with many people, and that just makes research work better.</p><p>6 0.46027428 <a title="246-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-02-Retrospective.html">225 hunch net-2007-01-02-Retrospective</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Makc asked a goodquestionin comments--"Why bother to make a paper, at all?"
There are several reasons for writing papers which may not be immediately
obvious to people not in academia.The basic idea is that papers have
considerably more utility than the obvious "present an idea".Papers are a
formalized units of work. Academics (especially young ones) are often judged
on the number of papers they produce.Papers have a formalized method of citing
and crediting other--the bibliography. Academics (especially older ones) are
often judged on the number of citations they receive.Papers enable a "more
fair" anonymous review. Conferences receivemanypapers, from which a subset are
selected. Discussion forums are inherently not anonymous for anyone who wants
to build a reputation for good work.Papers are an excuse to meet your friends.
Papers are the content of conferences, but much of what you do is talk to
friends about interesting problems while there. Sometimes you even solve
them.Papers are</p><p>5 0.49552035 <a title="246-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-11-09-Graduates_and_Postdocs.html">490 hunch net-2013-11-09-Graduates and Postdocs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several strong graduates are on the job market this year.Alekh Agarwalmade
themost scalable public learning algorithmas an intern two years ago. He has a
deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning as well as the
ability and will to make things happen programming-wise. I've been privileged
to have Alekh visiting me in NY where he will be sorely missed.John
DuchicreatedAdagradwhich is a commonly helpful improvement over online
gradient descent that is seeing wide adoption, including inVowpal Wabbit. He
has a similarly deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning with
significant industry experience atGoogle. Alekh and John have often coauthored
together.Stephane Rossvisited me a year ago over the summer, implementing many
new algorithms and working out the firstscale free online update rulewhich is
now the default in Vowpal Wabbit. Stephane isnoton the market--Google robbed
the cradle successfullyI'm sure that he will do great things.Anna

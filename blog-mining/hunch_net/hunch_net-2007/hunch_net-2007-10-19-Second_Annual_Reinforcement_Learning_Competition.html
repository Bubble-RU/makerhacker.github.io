<p>Introduction: The  International Planning Competition  (IPC) is a biennial event organized in the context of the  International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling  (ICAPS). This year, for the first time, there will a learning track of the competition. For more information you can go to the competition  web-site . 
 
The competitions are typically organized around a number of planning domains that can vary from year to year, where a planning domain is simply a class of problems that share a common action schema—e.g. Blocksworld is a well-known planning domain that contains a problem instance each possible initial tower configuration and goal configuration. Some other domains have included Logistics, Airport, Freecell, PipesWorld, and many  others . For each domain the competition includes a number of problems (say 40-50) and the planners are run on each problem with a time limit for each problem (around 30 minutes). The problems are hard enough that many problems are not solved within th</p><p>3 0.22381079 <a title="268-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-07-2008_Summer_Machine_Learning_Conference_Schedule.html">283 hunch net-2008-01-07-2008 Summer Machine Learning Conference Schedule</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 2012 was a tumultuous year for me, but it was undeniably a great year for deep learning efforts.  Signs of this include:
  
 Winning a  Kaggle competition . 
 Wide adoption of  deep learning for speech recognition . 
 Significant  industry support . 
 Gains in  image   recognition . 
  
This is a rare event in research: a significant capability breakout.  Congratulations are definitely in order for those who managed to achieve it.  At this point, deep learning algorithms seem like a choice undeniably worth investigating for real applications with significant data.</p><p>5 0.11265998 <a title="268-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks_for_RL.html">148 hunch net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks for RL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, Drew Bagnell and I started the  RLBench project  to setup a suite of reinforcement learning benchmark problems.  We haven’t been able to touch it (due to lack of time) for a year so the project is on hold.  Luckily, there are several other projects such as  CLSquare  and  RL-Glue  with a similar goal, and we strongly endorse their continued development.
 
I would like to explain why, especially in the context of criticism of other learning benchmarks.   For example, sometimes the  UCI Machine Learning Repository  is criticized.  There are two criticisms I know of:
  
 Learning algorithms have overfit to the problems in the repository.  It is easy to imagine a mechanism for this happening unintentionally.  Strong evidence of this would be provided by learning algorithms which perform great on the UCI machine learning repository but very badly (relative to other learning algorithms) on non-UCI learning problems.  I have seen little evidence of this but it remains a po</p><p>6 0.10904682 <a title="268-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-07-Pittsburgh_Mind_Reading_Competition.html">155 hunch net-2006-02-07-Pittsburgh Mind Reading Competition</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Francisco Pereira  points out a fun  Prediction Competition .   Francisco says:
 
DARPA is sponsoring a competition to analyze data from an unusual functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiment. Subjects watch videos inside the scanner while fMRI data are acquired. Unbeknownst to these subjects, the videos have been seen by a panel of other subjects that labeled each instant with labels in categories such as representation (are there tools, body parts, motion, sound), location, presence of actors, emotional content, etc.
 
The challenge is to predict all of these different labels on an instant-by-instant basis from the fMRI data. A few reasons why this is particularly interesting:
  
  This is beyond the current state of the art, but not inconceivably hard. 
  This is a new type of experiment design current analysis methods cannot deal with. 
  This is an opportunity to work with a heavily examined and preprocessed neuroimaging dataset. 
  DARPA is offering prizes!</p><p>4 0.52012897 <a title="268-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-07-2008_Summer_Machine_Learning_Conference_Schedule.html">283 hunch net-2008-01-07-2008 Summer Machine Learning Conference Schedule</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Larry Jackal has set up the  LAGR  (“Learning Applied to Ground Robotics”) project (and competition) which seems to be quite well designed.  Features include:
  
 Many participants (8 going on 12?) 
 Standardized hardware.  In the  DARPA grand challenge  contestants entering with motorcycles are at a severe disadvantage to those entering with a Hummer.  Similarly, contestants using more powerful sensors can gain huge advantages. 
 Monthly contests, with full feedback (but since the hardware is standardized, only code is shipped).  One of the premises of the program is that robust systems are desired.  Monthly evaluations at different locations can help measure this and provide data.

<p>Introduction: as of last night, late.
 
When the reviewing deadline passed Wednesday night 15% of reviews were still missing, much higher than I expected.  Between late reviews coming in, ACs working overtime through the weekend, and people willing to help in the pinch another ~390 reviews came in, reducing the missing mass to 0.2%.  Nailing that last bit and a similar quantity of papers with uniformly low confidence reviews is what remains to be done in terms of basic reviews.  We are trying to make all of those happen this week so authors have some chance to respond.
 
I was surprised by the quantity of late reviews, and I think that’s an area where ICML needs to improve in future years.  Good reviews are not done in a rush—they are done by setting aside time (like an afternoon), and carefully reading the paper while thinking about implications.  Many reviewers do this well but a significant minority aren’t good at scheduling their personal time.  In this situation there are several ways to fail:</p><p>3 0.2065917 <a title="268-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a quick reference for summer ML-related conferences sorted by due date:

Geographically, this is greatly dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.
 
Machine Learning conferences are triannual now, between  NIPS ,  AIStat , and  ICML .  This has not always been the case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April conference.  
 
However, the first claim is not quite correct.  NIPS and AIStat have few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other conf</p><p>4 0.20562106 <a title="268-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research.  They provide many roles including “announcing research”, “meeting people”, and  “point of reference”.  Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: “to what extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?”  This question is very difficult to answer in any satisfying way.  What we can do is compare details of the process across multiple conferences.
  
  Comments   The average quality of comments across conferences can vary dramatically.  At one extreme, the tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback.  At the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing detailed constructive feedback.  Detailed feedback can give authors significant guidance about how to improve research.  This is the most subjective entry. 
  Blind  Virtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors do not know reviewers.  Some also provide  double blind  review where rev</p><p>5 0.20205039 <a title="268-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-26-Compassionate_Reviewing.html">395 hunch net-2010-04-26-Compassionate Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Most long conversations between academics seem to converge on the topic of reviewing where almost no one is happy.  A basic question is: Should most people be happy?
 
The case against is straightforward.  Anyone who watches the flow of papers realizes that most papers amount to little in the longer term.  By it’s nature research is brutal, where the second-best method is worthless, and the second person to discover things typically gets no credit.  If you think about this for a moment, it’s very different from most other human endeavors.  The second best migrant laborer, construction worker, manager, conductor, quarterback, etc… all can manage quite well. If a reviewer has even a vaguely predictive sense of what’s important in the longer term, then most people submitting papers will be unhappy.
 
But this argument unravels, in my experience.  Perhaps half of reviews are thoughtless or simply wrong with a small part being simply malicious.  And yet, I’m sure that most reviewers genuine</p><p>6 0.20093456 <a title="268-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-02-The_Machine_Learning_Award_goes_to_%26%238230%3B.html">270 hunch net-2007-11-02-The Machine Learning Award goes to &#8230;</a></p>

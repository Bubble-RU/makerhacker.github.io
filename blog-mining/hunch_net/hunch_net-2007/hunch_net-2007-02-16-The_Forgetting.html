<p>Introduction: Makc asked a goodquestionin comments--"Why bother to make a paper, at all?"
There are several reasons for writing papers which may not be immediately
obvious to people not in academia.The basic idea is that papers have
considerably more utility than the obvious "present an idea".Papers are a
formalized units of work. Academics (especially young ones) are often judged
on the number of papers they produce.Papers have a formalized method of citing
and crediting other--the bibliography. Academics (especially older ones) are
often judged on the number of citations they receive.Papers enable a "more
fair" anonymous review. Conferences receivemanypapers, from which a subset are
selected. Discussion forums are inherently not anonymous for anyone who wants
to build a reputation for good work.Papers are an excuse to meet your friends.
Papers are the content of conferences, but much of what you do is talk to
friends about interesting problems while there. Sometimes you even solve
them.Papers are</p><p>3 0.1528184 <a title="233-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-10-ICML_Reviewing_Criteria.html">325 hunch net-2008-11-10-ICML Reviewing Criteria</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael LittmanandLeon Bottouhave decided to use a franchise program chair
approach toreviewing at ICMLthis year. I'll be one of the area chairs, so I
wanted to mention a few things if you are thinking about naming me.I take
reviewing seriously. That means papers to be reviewed are read, the
implications are considered, and decisions are only made after that. I do my
best to be fair, and there are zero subjects that I consider categorical
rejects. I don't consider severalarguments for rejection-not-on-the-merits
reasonable.I am generally interested in papers that (a) analyze new models of
machine learning, (b) provide new algorithms, and (c) show that they work
empirically on plausibly real problems. If a paper has the trifecta, I'm
particularly interested. With 2 out of 3, I might be interested. I often find
papers with only one element harder to accept, including papers with just
(a).I'm a bit tough. I rarely jump-up-and-down about a paper, because I
believe that great progress is ra</p><p>4 0.15054627 <a title="233-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>5 0.1425302 <a title="233-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-03-Bidding_Problems.html">315 hunch net-2008-09-03-Bidding Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers
is via bidding, which has steps something like:Invite people to reviewAccept
papersReviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are
interested in reviewing.Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get
approximately the papers they bid for.At the ICML business meeting,Andrew
McCallumsuggested getting rid of bidding for papers. A couple reasons were
given:PrivacyThe title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to
every participating reviewer. Some authors might be uncomfortable about this
for submitted papers. I'm not sympathetic to this reason: the point of
submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not
publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited.CliquesA bidding
system is gameable. If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your
submissions, you can each bid for your friend's papers and express a
disinterest in others. There</p><p>6 0.14230359 <a title="233-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-01-The_Webscience_Future.html">134 hunch net-2005-12-01-The Webscience Future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the enduring stereotypes of academia is that people spend a great deal
of intelligence, time, and effort finding complexity rather than simplicity.
This is at least anecdotally true in my experience.Math++Several people have
found that adding useless math makes their paper more publishable as evidenced
by a reject-add-accept sequence.8 page minimumWho submitted a paper
toICMLviolating the 8 page minimum? Every author fears that the reviewers
won't take their work seriously unless the allowed length is fully used. The
best minimum violation I know isAdam's paper at SODA ongenerating random
factored numbers, but this is deeply exceptional. It's a fair bet that 90% of
papers submitted are exactly at the page limit. We could imagine that this is
because papers naturally take more space, but few people seem to be clamoring
for more space.JournalongHas anyone been asked to review a 100 page journal
paper? I have. Journal papers can be nice, because they give an author the
opportunity</p><p>4 0.76804441 <a title="233-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-27-Not_goal_metrics.html">98 hunch net-2005-07-27-Not goal metrics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the confusing things about research is that progress is very hard to
measure. One of the consequences of being in a hard-to-measure environment is
that the wrong things are often measured.Lines of CodeThe classical example of
this phenomenon is the old lines-of-code-produced metric for programming. It
is easy to imagine systems for producing many lines of code with very little
work that accomplish very little.Paper countIn academia, a "paper count" is an
analog of "lines of code", and it suffers from the same failure modes. The
obvious failure mode here is that we end up with a large number of
uninteresting papers since people end up spending a lot of time optimizing
this metric.ComplexityAnother metric, is "complexity" (in the eye of a
reviewer) of a paper. There is a common temptation to make a method appear
more complex than it is in order for reviewers to judge it worthy of
publication. The failure mode here is unclean thinking. Simple effective
methods are often overlooked</p><p>5 0.754381 <a title="233-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-04-Grounds_for_Rejection.html">52 hunch net-2005-04-04-Grounds for Rejection</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's reviewing season right now, so I thought I would list (at a high level)
the sorts of problems which I see in papers. Hopefully, this will help us all
write better papers.The following flaws are fatal to any paper:Incorrect
theorem or lemma statementsA typo might be "ok", if it can be understood. Any
theorem or lemma which indicates an incorrect understanding of reality must be
rejected. Not doing so would severely harm the integrity of the conference. A
paper rejected for this reason must be fixed.Lack of UnderstandingIf a paper
is understood by none of the (typically 3) reviewers then it must be rejected
for the same reason. This is more controversial than it sounds because there
are some people who maximize paper complexity in the hope of impressing the
reviewer. The tactic sometimes succeeds with some reviewers (but not with
me).As a reviewer, I sometimes get lost for stupid reasons. This is why an
anonymizedcommunication channelwith the author can be very helpful.Bad

<p>Introduction: How many papers do you remember from 2006? 2005? 2002? 1997? 1987? 1967? One
way to judge this would be to look at the citations of the papers you write--
how many came from which year? For myself, the answers on recent papers
are:year200620052002199719871967count4105100This spectrum is fairly typical of
papers in general. There are many reasons that citations are focused on recent
papers.The number of papers being published continues to grow. This is not a
very significant effect, because the rate of publication has not grown nearly
as fast.Dead men don't reject your papers for not citing them. This reason
seems lame, because it's a distortion from the ideal of science. Nevertheless,
it must be stated because the effect can be significant.In 1997, I started as
a PhD student. Naturally, papers after 1997 are better remembered because they
were absorbed in real time. A large fraction of people writing papers and
attending conferences haven't been doing it for 10 years.Old papers aren't</p><p>2 0.90426165 <a title="233-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-06-Interesting_thing_at_UAI_2011.html">440 hunch net-2011-08-06-Interesting thing at UAI 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I had a chance to attendUAIthis year, where several papers interested me,
including:Hoifung PoonandPedro DomingosSum-Product Networks: A New Deep
Architecture. We'vealready discussed this one, but in a nutshell, they
identify a large class of efficiently normalizable distributions and do
learning with it.Yao-Liang YuandDale Schuurmans,Rank/norm regularization with
closed-form solutions: Application to subspace clustering. This paper is about
matrices, and in particular they prove that certain matrices are the solution
of matrix optimizations. I'm not matrix inclined enough to fully appreciate
this one, but I believe many others may be, and anytime closed form solutions
come into play, you get 2 order of magnitude speedups, as they show
experimentally.Laurent Charlin,Richard ZemelandCraig Boutilier,A Framework for
Optimizing Paper Matching. This is about what works in matching papers to
reviewers, as has been tested at several previous NIPS. We are looking into

<p>Introduction: I want to expand onthis postwhich describes one of the core tricks for
makingVowpal Wabbitfast and easy to use when learning from text.The central
trick is converting a word (or any other parseable quantity) into a number via
a hash function.Kishoretells me this is a relatively old trick in NLP land,
but it has some added advantages when doing online learning, because you can
learn directly from the existing data without preprocessing the data to create
features (destroying the online property) or using an expensive hashtable
lookup (slowing things down).A central concern for this approach is
collisions, which create a loss of information. If you usemfeatures in an
index space of sizenthe birthday paradox suggests a collision ifm > n0.5,
essentially because there arem2pairs. This is pretty bad, because it says that
with a vocabulary of105features, you might need to have1010entries in your
table.It turns out that redundancy is great for dealing with
collisions.Alexand I worked out a cou</p><p>4 0.84125823 <a title="233-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-12-Online_learning_or_online_preservation_of_learning%3F.html">163 hunch net-2006-03-12-Online learning or online preservation of learning?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the online learning with experts setting, you observe a set of predictions,
make a decision, and then observe the truth. This process repeats
indefinitely. In this setting, it is possible to prove theorems of the
sort:master algorithm error count < = k* best predictor error count +
c*log(number of predictors)Is this a statement about learning or about
preservation of learning? We did some experiments to analyze the newBinning
algorithmwhich works in this setting. For several UCI datasets, we reprocessed
them so that features could be used as predictors and then applied several
master algorithms. The first graph confirms that Binning is indeed a better
algorithm according to the tightness of the upper bound.Here, "Best" is the
performance of the best expert. "V. Bound" is the bound forVovk's algorithm
(the previous best). "Bound" is the bound for the Binning algorithm. "Binning"
is the performance of the Binning algorithm. The Binning algorithm clearly has
a tighter bound, and the pe</p><p>5 0.74768513 <a title="233-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-18-Decision_by_Vetocracy.html">343 hunch net-2009-02-18-Decision by Vetocracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Few would mistake the process of academic paper review for a fair process, but
sometimes the unfairness seems particularly striking. This is most easily seen
by comparison:PaperBanditronOffset TreeNotesProblem ScopeMulticlass problems
where only the loss of one choice can be probed.Strictly greater: Cost
sensitive multiclass problems where only the loss of one choice can be
probed.Often generalizations don't matter. That's not the case here, since
every plausible application I've thought of involves loss functions
substantially different from 0/1.What's newAnalysis and ExperimentsAlgorithm,
Analysis, and ExperimentsAs far as I know, the essence of the more general
problem was first stated and analyzed with theEXP4 algorithm (page 16)(1998).
It's also the time horizon 1 simplification of the Reinforcement Learning
setting for therandom trajectory method (page 15)(2002). The Banditron
algorithm itself is functionally identical toOne-Step RL with Traces (page
122)(2003) inBianca's thesis</p><p>6 0.74697268 <a title="233-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-01-The_Producer-Consumer_Model_of_Research.html">51 hunch net-2005-04-01-The Producer-Consumer Model of Research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired. 
  
In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,  ATnT Research  and  Lucent  had one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the remainder of  Bell Labs , triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine learning group there.  As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.
 
There are a couple positives to the recession as well.
  
 Both the implosion of Wall Street (which siphoned off smart people) and the general difficulty of getting a job coming out of an undergraduate education s</p><p>4 0.069762565 <a title="241-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-05-Funding_Research.html">36 hunch net-2005-03-05-Funding Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: I attended the  IBM research 60th anniversary .  IBM research is, by any reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the most value to it’s parent company over the long term.  This can be seen by simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab which has not gone through a period of massive firing.  (Note that there are also  new research labs .)
 
Despite this impressive record, IBM research has failed, by far, to achieve it’s potential.  Examples which came up in this meeting include:
  
 It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented in the lab.  (In fact, Intel produced it first.) 
 Relational databases and SQL were invented and then languished.  It was only under external competition that IBM released it’s own relational database.  Why didn’t IBM grow an  Oracle division ? 
 An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing a  Cisco division .  Why not?

<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of “mechanism design”: setting up the structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane things (rather than obviously counterproductive things).  Application of this principle to academic research may be fruitful.
 
What is misdesigned about academic research?
  
 The  JMLG  guides give many hints. 
 The common nature of  bad reviewing  also suggests the system isn’t working optimally. 
 There are many ways to experimentally  “cheat” in machine learning . 
  Funding Prisoner’s Delimma.  Good researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing research.  Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written.  This is essentially a “prisoner’s delimma”: anyone not writing grant proposals loses, but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction.  If everyone wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution</p><p>3 0.64639747 <a title="241-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-04-Science_in_the_Government.html">106 hunch net-2005-09-04-Science in the Government</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found the article on “ Political Science ” at the  New York Times  interesting.  Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been systematically distorting scientific views.   With a  petition  by some  7000+ scientists  alleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.
 
One thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the world.  In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued.  This value is achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms.  One example of a formal mechanism is peer review.
 
In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value is agreement.  It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be passed or other actions can be taken.  Since Science (with a capitol ‘S’) has accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.  This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mec</p><p>4 0.62406236 <a title="241-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many people in computer science believe that patents are problematic.  The truth is even worse—the patent system in the US is fundamentally broken in ways that will require much more significant reform than  is being considered now .
 
The myth of the patent is the following: Patents are a mechanism for inventors to be compensated according to the value of their inventions while making the invention available to all.  This myth sounds pretty desirable, but the reality is a strange distortion slowly leading towards collapse.
 
There are many problems associated with patents, but I would like to focus on just two of them: 
  
  Patent Trolls   The way that patents have generally worked over the last several decades is that they were a tool of large companies.  Large companies would amass a large number of patents and then cross-license each other’s patents—in effect saying “we agree to owe each other nothing”.  Smaller companies would sometimes lose in this game, essentially because they</p><p>2 0.71156341 <a title="241-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Maximum_Margin_Mismatch%3F.html">77 hunch net-2005-05-29-Maximum Margin Mismatch?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John makes a fascinating point about structured classification (and slightly scooped my post!). Maximum Margin Markov Networks (M3N) are an interesting example of the second class of structured classifiers (where the classification of one label depends on the others), and one of my favorite papers. I’m not alone: the paper won the best student paper award at NIPS in 2003. 
 
There are some things I find odd about the paper. For instance, it says of probabilistic models 
  
“cannot handle high dimensional feature spaces and lack strong theoretical guarrantees.” 
  
I’m aware of no such limitations. Also: 
  

“Unfortunately, even probabilistic graphical models that are trained discriminatively do not achieve the same level of performance as SVMs, especially when kernel features are used.”

  
This is quite interesting and contradicts my own experience as well as that of a number of people  I   greatly  
 respect . I wonder what the root cause is: perhaps there is something different abo</p><p>3 0.50011903 <a title="241-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-05-Funding_Research.html">36 hunch net-2005-03-05-Funding Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: Yann LeCun  and I are coteaching a class on  Large Scale Machine Learning  starting late January  at NYU .  This class will cover many tricks to get machine learning working well on datasets with many features, examples, and classes, along with several elements of deep learning and support systems enabling the previous.
 
This is not a beginning class—you really need to have taken a basic machine learning class previously to follow along.  Students will be able to run and experiment with large scale learning algorithms since  Yahoo!  has donated servers which are being configured into a small scale  Hadoop  cluster.   We are planning to cover the frontier of research in scalable learning algorithms, so good class projects could easily lead to papers.
 
For me, this is a chance to teach on many topics of past research.  In general, it seems like researchers should engage in at least occasional teaching of research, both as a proof of teachability and to see their own research through th</p><p>5 0.49345151 <a title="241-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-03-Learning_Theory%2C_by_assumption.html">12 hunch net-2005-02-03-Learning Theory, by assumption</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One way to organize learning theory is by assumption (in the  assumption = axiom sense ), from no assumptions to many assumptions.   As you travel down this list, the statements become stronger, but the scope of applicability decreases.
  
   No assumptions 
 
  Online learning  There exist a meta prediction algorithm which compete well with the best element of any set of prediction algorithms. 
  Universal Learning  Using a “bias” of 2 - description length of turing machine  in learning is equivalent to all other computable biases up to some constant. 
  Reductions  The ability to predict well on classification problems is equivalent to the ability to predict well on many other learning problems.
 
 
 
  Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) Data 
 
  Performance Prediction  Based upon past performance, you can predict future performance. 
  Uniform Convergence  Performance prediction works even after choosing classifiers based on the data from large sets of classifiers.</p><p>6 0.49336052 <a title="241-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-14-Clever_Methods_of_Overfitting.html">19 hunch net-2005-02-14-Clever Methods of Overfitting</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>5 0.072626948 <a title="241-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-03-Microsoft_Research%2C_New_York_City.html">464 hunch net-2012-05-03-Microsoft Research, New York City</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people. Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs,
this is serious forYahoo! Research.We had advanced warning
fromPrabhakarthrough thesimple act of leaving. Yahoo! Research was a world
class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is
deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave. My first
thought when I saw the news was "Uhoh,Robsaid that he knew it was serious when
the head of ATnT Research left." In this case it was even more significant,
because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in
how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high
engagement with the company. Prabhakar's departure is a clear end to that
experiment.The result is ambiguous from a business perspective. Y!R clearly
was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses. I'm not privy to the
internal accounting of impact and this is the kind of subject where there can
easily be great disagreemen</p><p>6 0.063682914 <a title="241-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-23-Machine_Learning_Jobs_are_Growing_on_Trees.html">250 hunch net-2007-06-23-Machine Learning Jobs are Growing on Trees</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I attended theIBM research 60th anniversary. IBM research is, by any
reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the
most value to it's parent company over the long term. This can be seen by
simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab
which has not gone through a period of massive firing. (Note that there are
alsonew research labs.)Despite this impressive record, IBM research has
failed, by far, to achieve it's potential. Examples which came up in this
meeting include:It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented
in the lab. (In fact, Intel produced it first.)Relational databases and SQL
were invented and then languished. It was only under external competition that
IBM released it's own relational database. Why didn't IBM grow anOracle
division?An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing
aCisco division. Why not?And remember â&euro;Ś IBM research is a stark success story

<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of "mechanism design": setting up the
structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane
things (rather than obviously counterproductive things). Application of this
principle to academic research may be fruitful.What is misdesigned about
academic research?TheJMLGguides give many hints.The common nature ofbad
reviewingalso suggests the system isn't working optimally.There are many ways
to experimentally"cheat" in machine learning.Funding Prisoner's Delimma. Good
researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing
research. Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant
proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written. This is
essentially a "prisoner's delimma": anyone not writing grant proposals loses,
but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction. If everyone
wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution of funding
would occur, and time w</p><p>6 0.6564045 <a title="241-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-04-Science_in_the_Government.html">106 hunch net-2005-09-04-Science in the Government</a></p>

now.The myth of the patent is the following: Patents are a mechanism for
inventors to be compensated according to the value of their inventions while
making the invention available to all. This myth sounds pretty desirable, but
the reality is a strange distortion slowly leading towards collapse.There are
many problems associated with patents, but I would like to focus on just two
of them:Patent TrollsThe way that patents have generally worked over the last
several decades is that they were a tool of large companies. Large companies
would amass a large number of patents and then cross-license each other's
patents--in effect saying "we agree to owe each other nothing". Smaller
companies would sometimes lose in this game, essentially because they didn't
have enough p</p><p>2 0.80491793 <a title="241-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-19-Netflix_prize_within_epsilon.html">336 hunch net-2009-01-19-Netflix prize within epsilon</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The competitors for theNetflix Prizeare tantalizingly close winning the
million dollar prize. This year,BellKorandCommendo Researchsent a combined
solution that won theprogress prize. Reading thewriteups2is instructive.
Several aspects of solutions are taken for granted including stochastic
gradient descent, ensemble prediction, and targeting residuals (a form of
boosting). Relatively to last year, it appears that many approaches have added
parameterizations, especially for the purpose of modeling through time.The big
question is: will they make the big prize? At this point, the level of
complexity in entering the competition is prohibitive, so perhaps only the
existing competitors will continue to try. (This equation might change
drastically if the teams open source their existing solutions, including
parameter settings.) One fear is that the progress is asymptoting on the wrong
side of the 10% threshold. In the first year, the teams progressed through
84.3% of the 10% gap, and in the</p><p>3 0.78958946 <a title="241-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-24-ICML%2B50%25.html">456 hunch net-2012-02-24-ICML+50%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheICMLpaper deadline has passed.Joelleand I were surprised to see the number
of submissions jump from last year by about 50% to around 900 submissions. A
tiny portion of these are immediate rejects(*), so this is a much larger set
of papers than expected. The number of workshop submissions also doubled
compared to last year, so ICML may grow significantly this year, if we can
manage to handle the load well. The prospect of making 900 good decisions is
fundamentally daunting, and success will rely heavily on theprogram
committeeandarea chairsat this point.For those who want to rubberneck a bit
more, here's a breakdown of submissions by primary topic of submitted

<p>Introduction: This title is a lie, but it is a special lie which has a bit of
truth.Ifnplayers each play each other, you have a tournament. How do you order
the players from weakest to strongest?The standard first attempt is "find the
ordering which agrees with the tournament on as many player pairs as
possible". This is called the "minimum feedback arcset" problem in the CS
theory literature and it is a well known NP-hard problem. A basic guarantee
holds for the solution to this problem: if there is some "true" intrinsic
ordering, and the outcome of the tournament disagreesktimes (due to noise for
instance), then the output ordering will disagree with the original ordering
on at most2kedges (and no solution can be better).One standard approach to
tractably solving an NP-hard problem is to find another algorithm with an
approximation guarantee. For example,Don Coppersmith,Lisa FleischerandAtri
Rudraproved thatordering players according to the number of wins is a
5-approximation to the NP-hard proble</p><p>5 0.71939635 <a title="241-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-03-15-COLT_Open_Problems.html">292 hunch net-2008-03-15-COLT Open Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: COLT has acall for open problemsdue March 21. I encourage anyone with a
specifiable open problem to write it down and send it in. Just the effort of
specifying an open problem precisely and concisely has been very helpful for
my own solutions, and there is a substantial chance others will solve it. To
increase the chance someone will take it up, you can even put a bounty on the
solution. (Perhaps I should raise the$500 bountyon theK-fold cross-validation

<p>Introduction: Many people in machine learning take advantage of the notion of a proxy loss:
A loss function which is much easier to optimize computationally than the loss
function imposed by the world. A canonical example is when we want to learn a
weight vectorwand predict according to a dot productfw(x)= sumiwixiwhere
optimizing squared loss(y-fw(x))2over many samples is much more tractable than
optimizing 0-1 lossI(y = Threshold(fw(x) - 0.5)).While the computational
advantages of optimizing a proxy loss are substantial, we are curious: which
proxy loss is best? The answer of course depends on what the real loss imposed
by the world is. For 0-1 loss classification, there are adherents to many
choices:Log loss. If we confine the prediction to[0,1], we can treat it as a
predicted probability that the label is1, and measure loss according tolog
1/p'(y|x)wherep'(y|x)is the predicted probability of the observed label. A
standard method for confining the prediction to[0,1]islogistic regressionwhich

<p>Introduction: "Deep learning" is used to describe learning architectures which have
significant depth (as a circuit).One claimis that shallow architectures (one
or two layers) can not concisely represent some functions while a circuit with
more depth can concisely represent these same functions. Proving lower bounds
on the size of a circuit is substantially harder than upper bounds (which are
constructive), but some results are known.Luca Trevisan'sclass notesdetail how
XOR is not concisely representable by "AC0â&euro;ł (= constant depth unbounded fan-in
AND, OR, NOT gates). This doesn't quite prove that depth is necessary for the
representations commonly used in learning (such as a thresholded weighted
sum), but it is strongly suggestive that this is so.Examples like this are a
bit disheartening because existing algorithms for deep learning (deep belief
nets, gradient descent on deep neural networks, and a perhaps decision trees
depending on who you ask) can't learn XOR very easily. Evidence so far

<p>Introduction: Accountability is a social problem. When someone screws up, do you fire them?
Or do you accept the error and let them continue? This is a very difficult
problem and we all know of stories where the wrong decision was made.Online
learning(as meant here), is a subfield of learning theory which analyzes the
online learning model.In the online learning model, there are a set of
hypotheses or "experts". On any instantancex, each expert makes a predictiony.
A master algorithmAuses these predictions to form it's own predictionyAand
then learns the correct predictiony*. This process repeats.The goal of online
learning is to find a master algorithmAwhich uses the advice of the experts to
make good predictions. In particular, we typically want to guarantee that the
master algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert. IfL(e)is the loss
of experteandL(A)is the loss of the master algorithm, it is often possible to
prove:L(A) less than mineL(e) + log(number of experts)over all sequences.In

<p>Introduction: One of the basic observations from theatomic learning workshopis that
gradient-based optimization is pervasive. For example, at least 7 (of 12)
speakers used the word 'gradient' in their talk and several others may be
approximating a gradient. The essential useful quality of a gradient is that
it decouples local updates from global optimization. Restated: Given a
gradient, we can determine how to change individual parameters of the system
so as to improve overall performance.It's easy to feel depressed about this
and think "nothing has happened", but that appears untrue. Many of the talks
were about clever techniques for computing gradients where your calculus
textbook breaks down.Sometimes there are clever approximations of the
gradient. (Simon Osindero)Sometimes we can compute constrained gradients via
iterated gradient/project steps. (Ben Taskar)Sometimes we can compute
gradients anyways over mildly nondifferentiable functions. (Drew Bagnell)Even
given a gradient, the choice of upda</p><p>6 0.61115605 <a title="258-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-06-To_Dual_or_Not.html">308 hunch net-2008-07-06-To Dual or Not</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TheExponentiated Gradientalgorithm byManfred WarmuthandJyrki Kivinencame out
just as I was starting graduate school, so I missed it both at a conference
and in class. It's a fine algorithm which has a remarkable theoretical
statement accompanying it.The essential statement holds in the "online
learning with an adversary" setting. Initially, there are of set ofnweights,
which might have values(1/n,â&euro;Ś,1/n), (or any other values from a probability
distribution). Everything happens in a round-by-round fashion. On each round,
the following happens:The world reveals a set of featuresx in {0,1}n. In the
online learning with an adversary literature, the features are called
"experts" and thought of as subpredictors, but this interpretation isn't
necessary--you can just use feature values as experts (or maybe the feature
value and the negation of the feature value as two experts).EG makes a
prediction according toy' = w . x(dot product).The world reveals the truthy in
[0,1].EG updates the weights</p><p>2 0.7958371 <a title="258-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-11-26-Giving_Thanks.html">449 hunch net-2011-11-26-Giving Thanks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and
giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.As a researcher, I am
most thankful for my education, without which I could not function. I want to
share this, because it provides some sense of how a researcher starts.My long
term memory seems to function particularly well, which makes any education I
get is particularly useful.I am naturally obsessive, which makes me chase down
details until I fully understand things. Natural obsessiveness can go wrong,
of course, but it's a great ally when you absolutely must get things right.My
childhood was all in one hometown, which was a conscious sacrifice on the part
of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated. I'm not
sure how important this was since travel has it's own benefits, but it bears
thought.I had several great teachers in grade school, and naturally gravitated
towards teachers over classmates, as they seemed more interesting. I</p><p>3 0.78600121 <a title="258-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-10-26-NIPS_workshops.html">375 hunch net-2009-10-26-NIPS workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many of theNIPS workshopshave a deadline about now, and the NIPSearly
registration deadline is Nov. 6. Several interest me:Adaptive Sensing, Active
Learning, and Experimental Designdue 10/27.Discrete Optimization in Machine
Learning: Submodularity, Sparsity & Polyhedra, due Nov. 6.Large-Scale Machine
Learning: Parallelism and Massive Datasets, due 10/23 (i.e. past)Analysis and
Design of Algorithms for Interactive Machine Learning, due 10/30.And I'm sure
many of the others interest others. Workshops are great as a mechanism for
research, so take a look if there is any chance you might be interested.</p><p>4 0.77923948 <a title="258-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-23-What_is_the_best_regret_transform_reduction_from_multiclass_to_binary%3F.html">181 hunch net-2006-05-23-What is the best regret transform reduction from multiclass to binary?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.BackgroundA
reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there
arekpossible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2
possible labels. On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary
classifier with some error ratee. After subtracting the minimum possible
(Bayes) error rateb, we get a regretr = e - b. ThePECOC(Probabilistic Error
Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regretrimplies
multiclass regret at most4r0.5.The problemThis is not the "rightest" answer.
Consider thek=2case, where we reduce binary to binary. There exists a
reduction (the identity) with the property that regretrimplies regretr. This
is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which
suggests that a better reduction may exist for generalk. For example, we can
not rule out the possibility that a reductionRexists with regret transform
guaranteeing binary regretrimp</p><p>5 0.75226295 <a title="258-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-12-It_Doesn%26%238217%3Bt_Stop.html">295 hunch net-2008-04-12-It Doesn&#8217;t Stop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've enjoyed theTerminatormovies and show. Neglecting the whacky aspects (time
travel and associated paradoxes), there is an enduring topic of discussion:
how do people deal with intelligent machines (and vice versa)?In Terminator-
land, the primary method for dealing with intelligent machines is to prevent
them from being made. This approach works pretty badly, because a new angle on
building an intelligent machine keeps coming up. This is partly a ploy for
writer's to avoid writing themselves out of a job, but there is a fundamental
truth to it as well: preventing progress in research is hard.The United
States, has been experimenting with trying to stop research onstem cells. It
hasn't worked very well--the net effect has been retarding research programs a
bit, and exporting some research to other countries. Another less recent
example was encryption technology, for which the United States generally did
not encourage early public research and evendiscouraged as a munition. This

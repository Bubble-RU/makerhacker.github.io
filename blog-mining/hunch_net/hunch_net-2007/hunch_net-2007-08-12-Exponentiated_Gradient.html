<p>Introduction: Nic Schaudolph  has been developing a fast gradient descent algorithm called  Stochastic Meta-Descent  (SMD).
 
Gradient descent is currently untrendy in the machine learning community, but there remains a large number of people using gradient descent on neural networks or other architectures from when it was trendy in the early 1990s.  There are three problems with gradient descent.
  
 Gradient descent does not necessarily produce easily reproduced results.  Typical algorithms start with “set the initial parameters to small random values”. 
 The design of the representation that gradient descent is applied to is often nontrivial.  In particular, knowing exactly how to build a large neural network so that it will perform well requires knowledge which has not been made easily applicable.

<p>Introduction: “Deep learning” is used to describe learning architectures which have significant depth (as a circuit).  
 
 One claim  is that shallow architectures (one or two layers) can not concisely represent some functions while a circuit with more depth can concisely represent these same functions.  Proving lower bounds on the size of a circuit is substantially harder than upper bounds (which are constructive), but some results are known.   Luca Trevisan ‘s  class notes  detail how XOR is not concisely representable by “AC0″ (= constant depth unbounded fan-in AND, OR, NOT gates).  This doesn’t quite prove that depth is necessary for the representations commonly used in learning (such as a thresholded weighted sum), but it is strongly suggestive that this is so.
 
Examples like this are a bit disheartening because existing algorithms for deep learning (deep belief nets, gradient descent on deep neural networks, and a perhaps decision trees depending on who you ask) can’t learn XOR very easily.</p><p>4 0.16335315 <a title="258-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-04-Optimal_Proxy_Loss_for_Classification.html">341 hunch net-2009-02-04-Optimal Proxy Loss for Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in machine learning take advantage of the notion of a proxy loss: A loss function which is much easier to optimize computationally than the loss function imposed by the world.  A canonical example is when we want to learn a weight vector  w  and predict according to a dot product  f w (x)= sum i  w i x i   
where optimizing squared loss  (y-f w (x)) 2   over many samples is much more tractable than optimizing 0-1 loss  I(y = Threshold(f w (x) – 0.5)) .
 
While the computational advantages of optimizing a proxy loss are substantial, we are curious: which proxy loss is best?  The answer of course depends on what the real loss imposed by the world is.  For 0-1 loss classification, there are adherents to many choices:
  
 Log loss.  If we confine the prediction to  [0,1] , we can treat it as a predicted probability that the label is  1 , and measure loss according to  log 1/p’(y|x)  where  p’(y|x)  is the predicted probability of the observed label.

<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given framework or mathematical model.  It turns out that all of these models are significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning.  I’ve created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of machine learning.
 
The point here is not simply “woe unto us”.  There are several implications which seem important.
  
 The multitude of models is a point of continuing confusion.  It is common for people to learn about machine learning within one framework which often becomes there “home framework” through which they attempt to filter all machine learning.  (Have you met people who can only think in terms of kernels?  Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)  Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help resolve the confusion.  This is particularly important when reviewing and particularly important for students.

<p>Introduction: One of the basic observations from the  atomic learning workshop  is that gradient-based optimization is pervasive.   For example, at least 7 (of 12) speakers used the word ‘gradient’ in their talk and several others may be approximating a gradient.  The essential useful quality of a gradient is that it decouples local updates from global optimization.  Restated: Given a gradient, we can determine how to change individual parameters of the system so as to improve overall performance.
 
It’s easy to feel depressed about this and think “nothing has happened”, but that appears untrue.  Many of the talks were about clever techniques for computing gradients where your calculus textbook breaks down.
  
 Sometimes there are clever approximations of the gradient. ( Simon Osindero ) 
 Sometimes we can compute constrained gradients via iterated gradient/project steps. ( Ben Taskar ) 
 Sometimes we can compute gradients anyways over mildly nondifferentiable functions. ( Drew Bagnell )

<p>Introduction: Yoram  and  Shai ‘s  online learning tutorial  at  ICML  brings up a question for me, “Why use the  dual ?”
 
The basic setting is learning a weight vector  w i   so that the function  f(x)= sum i  w i  x i   optimizes some convex loss function.
 
The functional view of the dual is that instead of (or in addition to) keeping track of  w i   over the feature space, you keep track of a vector  a j   over the examples and define  w i  = sum j  a j  x ji  .
 
The above view of duality makes operating in the dual appear unnecessary, because in the end a weight vector is always used.  The tutorial suggests that thinking about the dual gives a unified algorithmic font for deriving online learning algorithms.  I haven’t worked with the dual representation much myself, but I have seen a few examples where it appears helpful.
  
  Noise  When doing online optimization (i.e. online learning where you are allowed to look at individual examples multiple times), the dual representation may be helpfu</p><p>5 0.67549551 <a title="258-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-16-The_value_of_the_orthodox_view_of_Boosting.html">179 hunch net-2006-05-16-The value of the orthodox view of Boosting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The term “boosting” comes from the idea of using a meta-algorithm which takes “weak” learners (that may be able to only barely predict slightly better than random) and turn them into strongly capable learners (which predict very well).    Adaboost  in 1995 was the first widely used (and useful) boosting algorithm, although there were theoretical boosting algorithms floating around since 1990 (see the bottom of  this page ).
 
Since then, many different interpretations of why boosting works have arisen.  There is significant discussion about these different views in the  annals of statistics , including a  response  by  Yoav Freund  and  Robert Schapire .
 
I believe there is a great deal of value to be found in the original view of boosting (meta-algorithm for creating a strong learner from a weak learner).  This is not a claim that one particular viewpoint obviates the value of all others, but rather that no other viewpoint seems to really capture important properties.

<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.
 
As a researcher, I am most thankful for my education, without which I could not function.  I want to share this, because it provides some sense of how a researcher starts.
  
 My long term memory seems to function particularly well, which makes any education I get is particularly useful. 
 I am naturally obsessive, which makes me chase down details until I fully understand things.  Natural obsessiveness can go wrong, of course, but it’s a great ally when you absolutely must get things right. 
 My childhood was all in one hometown, which was a conscious sacrifice on the part of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated.  I’m not sure how important this was since travel has it’s own benefits, but it bears thought. 
 I had several great teachers in grade school, and naturally gravitated towards teachers over classmates, as they seemed</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90855616 <a title="258-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated_Gradient.html">258 hunch net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  Exponentiated Gradient  algorithm by  Manfred Warmuth  and  Jyrki Kivinen  came out just as I was starting graduate school, so I missed it both at a conference and in class.  It’s a fine algorithm which has a remarkable theoretical statement accompanying it.
 
The essential statement holds in the “online learning with an adversary” setting.  Initially, there are of set of  n  weights, which might have values  (1/n,…,1/n) , (or any other values from a probability distribution).  Everything happens in a round-by-round fashion.  On each round, the following happens:
  
 The world reveals a set of features  x in {0,1} n  .  In the online learning with an adversary literature, the features are called “experts” and thought of as subpredictors, but this interpretation isn’t necessary—you can just use feature values as experts (or maybe the feature value and the negation of the feature value as two experts). 
 EG makes a prediction according to  y’ = w . x  (dot product).

<p>Introduction: Muthu  invited me to the workshop on  algorithms in the field , with the goal of providing a sense of where near-term research should go.  When the time came though, I bargained for a post instead, which provides a chance for many other people to comment.
 
There are several things I didn’t fully understand when I went to Yahoo! about 5 years ago.  I’d like to repeat them as people in academia may not yet understand them intuitively.
  
 Almost all the big impact algorithms operate in pseudo-linear or better time.  Think about caching, hashing, sorting, filtering, etc… and you have a sense of what some of the most heavily used algorithms are.  This matters quite a bit to Machine Learning research, because people often work with superlinear time algorithms and languages.  Two very common examples of this are graphical models, where inference is often a superlinear operation—think about the  n 2   dependence on the number of states in a  Hidden Markov Model  and Kernelized  Support Vecto</p><p>4 0.85402757 <a title="258-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-26-Machine_Learning_is_too_easy.html">347 hunch net-2009-03-26-Machine Learning is too easy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is.  The viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etc… share little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.
 
There are two fundamental reasons why this is possible.
  
 For many problems, many approaches work in the sense that they do something useful.  This is true empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor.  It’s also true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples. 
 There is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field.  In many other areas there</p><p>5 0.85314852 <a title="258-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-03-All_Models_of_Learning_have_Flaws.html">235 hunch net-2007-03-03-All Models of Learning have Flaws</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given framework or mathematical model.  It turns out that all of these models are significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning.  I’ve created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of machine learning.
 
The point here is not simply “woe unto us”.  There are several implications which seem important.
  
 The multitude of models is a point of continuing confusion.  It is common for people to learn about machine learning within one framework which often becomes there “home framework” through which they attempt to filter all machine learning.  (Have you met people who can only think in terms of kernels?  Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)  Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help resolve the confusion.  This is particularly important when reviewing and particularly important for students.

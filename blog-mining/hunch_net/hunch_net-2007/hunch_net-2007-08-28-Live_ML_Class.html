<p>Introduction: There will be two  machine learning summer schools  in 2006.  
 
One is in  Canberra, Australia  from February 6 to February 17 (Aussie summer).  The webpage is fully ‘live’ so you should actively consider it now.
 
The other is in  Taipei, Taiwan  from July 24 to August 4.  This one is still in the planning phase, but that should be settled soon.

<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4, 2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245 participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see our  WIKI  for more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as organizers to screw it up too bad.  Also, since we have pretty good infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this two-week long party of machine learning.
 
In the end of MLSS we distributed a survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from participants.  
 
The first question is designed to find out how our participants learned about MLSS</p><p>5 0.0796149 <a title="261-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-24-2011_ML_symposium_and_the_bears.html">448 hunch net-2011-10-24-2011 ML symposium and the bears</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  New York ML symposium  was last Friday.  Attendance was 268, significantly larger than  last year .  My impression was that the event mostly still fit the space, although it was crowded.  If anyone has suggestions for next year, speak up.
 
The best student paper award went to  Sergiu Goschin  for a cool video of how his system learned to play video games (I can’t find the paper online yet).  Choosing amongst the submitted talks was pretty difficult this year, as there were many similarly good ones.
 
By coincidence all the invited talks were (at least potentially) about faster learning algorithms.   Stephen Boyd  talked about  ADMM .  Leon Bottou  spoke on single pass online learning via  averaged SGD .   Yoav Freund  talked about  parameter-free hedging .  In Yoav’s case the talk was mostly about a better theoretical learning algorithm, but it has the potential to unlock an exponential computational complexity improvement via oraclization of experts algorithms… but some serious</p><p>6 0.058659844 <a title="261-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-29-To_Vidoelecture_or_not.html">416 hunch net-2010-10-29-To Vidoelecture or not</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yann and I have arranged so that people who are interested in our  large scale machine learning class  and not able to attend in person can follow along via two methods.
  
  Videos  will be posted with about a 1 day delay on  techtalks .  This is a side-by-side capture of video+slides from  Weyond . 
 We are experimenting with  Piazza  as a discussion forum.  Anyone is welcome to subscribe to Piazza and ask questions there, where I will be monitoring things.   update2 : Sign up  here . 
  
The first lecture is up now, including the  revised version of the slides  which fixes a few typos and rounds out references.</p><p>4 0.48328352 <a title="261-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-10-The_Large_Scale_Learning_class_notes.html">483 hunch net-2013-06-10-The Large Scale Learning class notes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  large scale machine learning class  I taught with  Yann LeCun  has finished.  As I expected, it took quite a bit of time   .  We had about 25 people attending in person on average and 400 regularly watching the  recorded lectures  which is substantially more sustained interest than I expected for an advanced ML class.  We also had some fun with class projects—I’m hopeful that several will eventually turn into papers.
 
I expect there are a number of professors interested in lecturing on this and related topics.  Everyone will have their personal taste in subjects of course, but hopefully there will be some convergence to common course materials as well.  To help with this, I am making the  sources to my presentations available .  Feel free to use/improve/embelish/ridicule/etc… in the pursuit of the perfect course.</p><p>5 0.46435419 <a title="261-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-16-MLSS_2006.html">130 hunch net-2005-11-16-MLSS 2006</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Weâ&euro;&trade;d like to invite hunch.net readers to participate in the NIPS 2008 workshop on kernel learning.  While the main focus is on automatically learning kernels from data, we are also also looking at the broader questions of feature selection, multi-task learning and multi-view learning. There are no restrictions on the learning problem being addressed (regression, classification, etc), and both theoretical and applied work will be considered. The deadline for submissions is  October 24 .

<p>Introduction: It’s reviewing season right now, so I thought I would list (at a high level) the sorts of problems which I see in papers.  Hopefully, this will help us all write better papers.
 
The following flaws are fatal to any paper:
  
  Incorrect theorem or lemma statements  A typo might be “ok”, if it can be understood.  Any theorem or lemma which indicates an incorrect understanding of reality must be rejected.  Not doing so would severely harm the integrity of the conference.  A paper rejected for this reason must be fixed. 
  Lack of Understanding  If a paper is understood by none of the (typically 3) reviewers then it must be rejected for the same reason.  This is more controversial than it sounds because there are some people who maximize paper complexity in the hope of impressing the reviewer.  The tactic sometimes succeeds with some reviewers (but not with me).

As a reviewer, I sometimes get lost for stupid reasons.  This is why an anonymized  communication channel  with the author can</p><p>4 0.46781883 <a title="261-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-04-Watchword%3A_model.html">135 hunch net-2005-12-04-Watchword: model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In everyday use a model is a system which explains the behavior of some system, hopefully at the level where some alteration of the model predicts some alteration of the real-world system.   In machine learning “model” has several variant definitions.
  
  Everyday .  The common definition is sometimes used. 
  Parameterized . Sometimes model is a short-hand for “parameterized model”.  Here, it refers to a model with unspecified free parameters.  In the Bayesian learning approach, you typically have a prior over (everyday) models. 
  Predictive .  Even further from everyday use is the predictive model.  Examples of this are “my model is a decision tree” or “my model is a support vector machine”.  Here, there is no real sense in which an SVM explains the underlying process.  For example, an SVM tells us nothing in particular about how alterations to the real-world system would create a change. 
  
Which definition is being used at any particular time is important information.  For examp</p><p>5 0.33139193 <a title="261-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-15-The_Machine_Learning_Department.html">228 hunch net-2007-01-15-The Machine Learning Department</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Carnegie Mellon   School of Computer Science  has the first academic  Machine Learning department .  This department already existed as the  Center for Automated Learning and Discovery , but recently changed it’s name.  
 
The reason for changing the name is obvious: very few people think of themselves as “Automated Learner and Discoverers”, but there are number of people who think of themselves as “Machine Learners”.  Machine learning is both more succinct and recognizable—good properties for a name.
 
A more interesting question is “Should there be a Machine Learning Department?”.    Tom Mitchell  has a relevant  whitepaper  claiming that machine learning  is answering a different question than other fields or departments.  The fundamental debate here is “Is machine learning different from statistics?”

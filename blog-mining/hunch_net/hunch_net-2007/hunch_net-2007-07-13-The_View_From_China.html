<p>Introduction: There are at least3summer schools related to machine learning this summer.The
firstis atUniversity of ChicagoJune 1-11 organized byMisha Belkin,Partha
Niyogi, andSteve Smale. Registration is closed for this one, meaning they met
their capacity limit. The format is essentially an extended Tutorial/Workshop.
I was particularly interested to seeValiantamongst the speakers. I'm also
presenting Saturday June 6, on logarithmic time prediction.Praveen
Srinivasanpoints out the second atPeking Universityin Beijing, China, July
20-27.This onediffers substantially, as it is about vision, machine learning,
and their intersection. The deadline for applications is June 10 or 15. This
is also another example of the growth of research in China, with active
support fromNSF.The third one is atCambridge, England, August 29-September 10.
It's in theMLSS series. Compared to the Chicago one, this one is more about
the Bayesian side of ML, although effort has been made to create a good cross

<p>Introduction: In the quest to understand what good reviewing is, perhaps it's worthwhile to
think about what good research is. One way to think about good research is in
terms of a producer/consumer model.In the producer/consumer model of research,
for any element of research there are producers (authors and coauthors of
papers, for example) and consumers (people who use the papers to make new
papers or code solving problems). An produced bit of research is judged as
"good" if it is used by many consumers. There are two basic questions which
immediately arise:Is this a good model of research?Are there alternatives?The
producer/consumer model has some difficulties which can be (partially)
addressed.Disconnect.A group of people doing research on some subject may
become disconnected from the rest of the world. Each person uses the research
of other people in the group so it appears good research is being done, but
the group has no impact on the rest of the world. One way to detect this is by
looking at</p><p>4 0.089114152 <a title="255-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>6 0.078839011 <a title="255-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-24-The_Role_of_Workshops.html">46 hunch net-2005-03-24-The Role of Workshops</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Al Gore'sfilmand gradually more assertive and thorough science has managed to
mostly shift the debate on climate change from "Is it happening?" to "What
should be done?" In that context, it's worthwhile to think a bit about what
can be done within computer science research.There are two things we can think
about:Doing ResearchAt a cartoon level, computer science research consists of
some combination of commuting to&from; work, writing programs, running them on
computers, writing papers, and presenting them at conferences. A typical
computer has a power usage on the order of 100 Watts, which works out to 2.4
kiloWatt-hours/day. Looking upDavid MacKay'sreference on power usage per
person, it becomes clear that this is a relatively minor part of the
lifestyle, although it could become substantial if many more computers are
required. Much larger costs are associated with commuting (which is in common
with many people) and attending conferences. Since local commuting is common

<p>Introduction: Many of the large machine learning conferences were in the US this summer. A
common problem which students from abroad encounter is visa issues.Just
getting a visa to visit can be pretty rough: you stand around in lines,
sometimes for days. Even worse is the timing with respect to ticket buying.
Airplane tickets typically need to be bought well in advance on nonrefundable
terms to secure a reasonable rate for air travel. When a visa is denied, as
happens reasonably often, a very expensive ticket is burnt.A serious effort is
under way to raise this as in issue in need of fixing. Over the long term,
effectively driving research conferences to locate outside of the US seems an
unwise policy.Robert Schapireis planning to talk to a congressman.Sally
Goldmansuggested putting together a list of problem cases, andPhil Longsetup

this year is Europe. This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the
general internationalization of science over the last few years. Withcuts to
basic sciencein the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside
the US become more attractive. Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the
immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english
in place. China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>2 0.92748761 <a title="255-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-17-Rexa_is_live.html">173 hunch net-2006-04-17-Rexa is live</a></p>

(Tweaked thanks toFei Sha.)Location: Vancouver (main program) Dec. 5-8 and
Whistler (workshops) Dec 9-10, BC, CanadaNIPS is larger than all of the other
learning conferences, partly because it's the only one at that time of year. I
recommend the workshops which are often quite interesting and energetic.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.89757758 <a title="255-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-07-13-The_View_From_China.html">255 hunch net-2007-07-13-The View From China</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm visiting Beijing for thePao-Lu Hsu Statistics Conferenceon Machine
Learning.I had several discussions about the state of Chinese research. Given
the large population and economy, you might expect substantial research--more
than has been observed at international conferences. The fundamental problem
seems to be theCultural Revolutionwhich lobotimized higher education, and the
research associated with it. There has been a process of slow recovery since
then, which has begun to be felt in the research world via increased
participation in international conferences and (now) conferences in China.The
amount of effort going into construction in Beijing is very impressive--people
are literally building a skyscraper at night outside the window of the hotel
I'm staying at (and this is not unusual). If a small fraction of this effort
is later focused onto supporting research, the effect could be very
substantial. General growth in China's research portfolio should be expected.</p><p>5 0.81820792 <a title="255-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-11-More_NIPS_Papers.html">139 hunch net-2005-12-11-More NIPS Papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let me add to John's post with a few of my own favouritesfrom this year's
conference. First, let me say thatSanjoy's talk,Coarse Sample Complexity
Bounds for ActiveLearningwas also one of my favourites, as was theForgettron
paper.I also really enjoyed the last third ofChristos'talkon the complexity of
finding Nash equilibria.And, speaking of tagging, I thinkthe U.Mass Citeseer
replacement systemRexafrom the demo track is very cool.Finally, let me add my
recommendations for specific papers:Z. Ghahramani, K. Heller:Bayesian Sets[no
preprint](A very elegant probabilistic information retrieval style modelof
which objects are "most like" a given subset of objects.)T. Griffiths, Z.
Ghahramani:Infinite Latent Feature Models andthe Indian Buffet

withbeautiful exchangeability properties.)K. Weinberger, J. Blitzer, L.

<p>Introduction: There will be two  machine learning summer schools  in 2006.  
 
One is in  Canberra, Australia  from February 6 to February 17 (Aussie summer).  The webpage is fully ‘live’ so you should actively consider it now.
 
The other is in  Taipei, Taiwan  from July 24 to August 4.  This one is still in the planning phase, but that should be settled soon.  
 
Attending an MLSS is probably the quickest and easiest way to bootstrap yourself into a reasonable initial understanding of the field of machine learning.</p><p>4 0.16943486 <a title="273-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-03-15-COLT_Open_Problems.html">292 hunch net-2008-03-15-COLT Open Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: COLT has a  call for open problems  due March 21.  I encourage anyone with a specifiable open problem to write it down and send it in.  Just the effort of specifying an open problem precisely and concisely has been very helpful for my own solutions, and there is a substantial chance others will solve it.  To increase the chance someone will take it up, you can even put a bounty on the solution.  (Perhaps I should raise the  $500 bounty  on the  K-fold cross-validation problem  as it hasnâ&euro;&trade;t yet been solved).</p><p>5 0.14852531 <a title="273-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2014/hunch_net-2014-03-11-The_New_York_ML_Symposium%2C_take_2.html">494 hunch net-2014-03-11-The New York ML Symposium, take 2</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The 20 13 14 is  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is finally happening on March 28th at the  New York Academy of Science .  Every invited speaker interests me personally.  They are:
  
  Rayid Ghani  (Chief Scientist at Obama 2012) 
  Brian Kingsbury  (Speech Recognition @ IBM) 
  Jorge Nocedal  (who did LBFGS) 
  
Weâ&euro;&trade;ve been somewhat disorganized in advertising this.  As a consequence, anyone who has not submitted an abstract but would like to do so may send one directly to me (jl@hunch.net title NYASMLS) by Friday March 14.  I will forward them to the rest of the committee for consideration.</p><p>6 0.14195289 <a title="273-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-02-25-Yahoo%21_Machine_Learning_grant_due_March_11.html">425 hunch net-2011-02-25-Yahoo!

<p>Introduction: 2012 was a tumultuous year for me, but it was undeniably a great year for deep learning efforts.  Signs of this include:
  
 Winning a  Kaggle competition . 
 Wide adoption of  deep learning for speech recognition . 
 Significant  industry support . 
 Gains in  image   recognition . 
  
This is a rare event in research: a significant capability breakout.  Congratulations are definitely in order for those who managed to achieve it.  At this point, deep learning algorithms seem like a choice undeniably worth investigating for real applications with significant data.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.79663587 <a title="273-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-16-MLSS_2008.html">273 hunch net-2007-11-16-MLSS 2008</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We are releasing the  Vowpal Wabbit (Fast Online Learning) code  as open source under a BSD (revised) license.  This is a  project at Yahoo! Research  to build a useful large scale learning algorithm which  Lihong Li ,  Alex Strehl , and I have been working on.
 
To appreciate the meaning of “large”, it’s useful to define “small” and “medium”.  A “small” supervised learning problem is one where a human could use a labeled dataset and come up with a reasonable predictor.  A “medium” supervised learning problem dataset fits into the RAM of a modern desktop computer.  A “large” supervised learning problem is one which does not fit into the RAM of a normal machine.  VW tackles large scale learning problems by this definition of large.  I’m not aware of any other open source Machine Learning tools which can handle this scale (although they may exist).  A few close ones are:
  
  IBM’s Parallel Machine Learning Toolbox   isn’t quite open source .  The approach used by this toolbox is essenti</p><p>5 0.38556683 <a title="273-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-02-The_Machine_Learning_Award_goes_to_%26%238230%3B.html">270 hunch net-2007-11-02-The Machine Learning Award goes to &#8230;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perhaps the biggest CS prize for research is the  Turing Award , which has a $0.25M cash prize associated with it.  It appears none of the prizes so far have been for anything like machine learning (the closest are perhaps database awards).
 
In CS theory, there is the  GÃƒÂ¶del Prize  which is smaller and newer, offering a $5K prize along and perhaps (more importantly) recognition.  One such award has been given for Machine Learning, to  Robert Schapire  and  Yoav Freund  for Adaboost.
 
In Machine Learning, there seems to be no equivalent of these sorts of prizes.  There are several plausible reasons for this:
  
 
 There is no coherent community. 
  People drift in and out of the central conferences all the time.  Most of the author names from 10 years ago do not occur in the conferences of today.  In addition, the entire subject area is fairly new. 
 There are at least a core group of people who have stayed around.

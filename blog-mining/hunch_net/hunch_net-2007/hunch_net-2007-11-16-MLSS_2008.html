<p>Introduction: Thelarge scale machine learning classI taught withYann LeCunhas finished. As I
expected, it took quite a bit of time. We had about 25 people attending in
person on average and 400 regularly watching therecorded lectureswhich is
substantially more sustained interest than I expected for an advanced ML
class. We also had some fun with class projects--I'm hopeful that several will
eventually turn into papers.I expect there are a number of professors
interested in lecturing on this and related topics. Everyone will have their
personal taste in subjects of course, but hopefully there will be some
convergence to common course materials as well. To help with this, I am making
thesources to my presentations available. Feel free to

<p>Introduction: Rajat Rainapresented a paper on the technique they used for
thePASCALRecognizing Textual Entailmentchallenge."Text entailment" is the
problem of deciding if one sentence implies another. For example the previous
sentence entails:Text entailment is a decision problem.One sentence can imply
another.The challenge was of the form: given an original sentence and another
sentence predict whether there was an entailment. All current techniques for
predicting correctness of an entailment are at the "flail" stage--accuracies
of around 58% where humans could achieve near 100% accuracy, so there is much
room to improve. Apparently, there may be another PASCAL challenge on this
problem in the near future.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.75633812 <a title="273-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-16-MLSS_2008.html">273 hunch net-2007-11-16-MLSS 2008</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I only managed to make it out to the NIPS workshops this year soI'll give my
comments on what I saw there.The Learing and Robotics workshops lives again. I
hope itcontinues and gets more high quality papers in the future. Themost
interesting talk for me was Larry Jackel's on the LAGRprogram (see John's
previous post on said program). I got someideas as to what progress has been
made. Larry really explainedthe types of benchmarks and the tradeoffs that had
to be made tomake the goals achievable but challenging.Hal Daume gave a very
interesting talk about structuredprediction using RL techniques, something
near and dear to my ownheart. He achieved rather impressive results using only
a verygreedy search.The non-parametric Bayes workshop was great. I enjoyed the
entiremorning session I spent there, and particularly (the usuallydesultory)
discussion periods. One interesting topic was theGibbs/Variational inference
divide. I won't try to summarizeespecially as no conclusion was reached. It</p><p>5 0.6247983 <a title="273-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-20-New_York%26%238217%3Bs_ML_Day.html">322 hunch net-2008-10-20-New York&#8217;s ML Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm not as naturally exuberant asMuthu2orDavidaboutCS/Econday, but I believe
it andML daywere certainly successful.At the CS/Econ day, I particularly
enjoyedToumas Sandholm'stalk which showed a commanding depth of understanding
and application in automated auctions.For the machine learning day, I enjoyed
several talks and posters (I better, I helped pick them.). What stood out to
me was number of people attending: 158 registered, a level qualifying as
"scramble to find seats". My rule of thumb for workshops/conferences is that
the number of attendees is often something like the number of submissions.
That isn't the case here, where there were just 4 invited speakers and 30-or-
so posters. Presumably, the difference is due to a critical mass of Machine
Learning interested people in the area and the ease of their attendance.Are
there other areas where a local Machine Learning day would fly? It's easy to
imagine something working out in the San Francisco bay area and possibly

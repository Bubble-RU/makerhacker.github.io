<p>Introduction: Here are a few of the papers I enjoyed at ICML.Steffen Bickel, Michael
BrÃƒÂ¼eckner,Tobias Scheffer,Discriminative Learning for Differing Training
and Test DistributionsThere is a nice trick in this paper: they predict the
probability that an unlabeled sample is in the training set vs. the test set,
and then use this prediction to importance weight labeled samples in the
training set. This paper uses a specific parametric model, but the approach is
easily generalized.Steve HannekeA Bound on the Label Complexity of Agnostic
Active LearningThis paper bounds the number of labels required by the
A2algorithm for active learning in the agnostic case. Last year we figured out
agnostic active learning was possible. This year, it's quantified. Hopefull
soon, it will be practical.Sylvian Gelly,David SilverCombining Online and

<p>Introduction: A little over 4 years ago,Sanjoymade a postsaying roughly "we should study
active learning theoretically, because not much is understood".At the time, we
did not understand basic things such as whether or not it was possible to PAC-
learn with an active algorithm without making strong assumptions about the
noise rate. In other words, the fundamental question was "can we do it?"The
nature of the question has fundamentally changed in my mind. The answer is to
the previous question is "yes", both information theoretically and
computationally, most places where supervised learning could be applied.In
many situation, the question has now changed to: "is it worth it?" Is the
programming and computational overhead low enough to make the label cost
savings of active learning worthwhile? Currently, there are situations where
this question could go either way. Much of the challenge for the future is in
figuring out how to make active learning easier or more worthwhile.At

<p>Introduction: We are releasing theVowpal Wabbit (Fast Online Learning) codeas open source
under a BSD (revised) license. This is aproject at Yahoo! Researchto build a
useful large scale learning algorithm whichLihong Li,Alex Strehl, and I have
been working on.To appreciate the meaning of "large", it's useful to define
"small" and "medium". A "small" supervised learning problem is one where a
human could use a labeled dataset and come up with a reasonable predictor. A
"medium" supervised learning problem dataset fits into the RAM of a modern
desktop computer. A "large" supervised learning problem is one which does not
fit into the RAM of a normal machine. VW tackles large scale learning problems
by this definition of large. I'm not aware of any other open source Machine
Learning tools which can handle this scale (although they may exist). A few
close ones are:IBM's Parallel Machine Learning Toolboxisn't quite open source.
The approach used by this toolbox is essentially map-reduce style computation,</p><p>6 0.16642995 <a title="279-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-24-Interesting_papers_at_UAICMOLT_2009.html">361 hunch net-2009-06-24-Interesting papers at UAICMOLT 2009</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are a few papers fromCOLT 2008that I found interesting.Maria-Florina
Balcan,Steve Hanneke, andJenn Wortman,The True Sample Complexity of Active
Learning. This paper shows that in an asymptotic setting, active learning
isalwaysbetter than supervised learning (although the gap may be small). This
is evidence that the only thing in the way of universal active learning is us
knowing how to do it properly.Nir AilonandMehryar Mohri,An Efficient Reduction
of Ranking to Classification. This paper shows how to robustly ranknobjects
withn log(n)classifications using a quicksort based algorithm. The result is
applicable to many ranking loss functions and has implications for
others.Michael KearnsandJennifer Wortman.Learning from Collective Behavior.
This is about learning in a new model, where the goal is to predict how a
collection of interacting agents behave. One claim is that learning in this
setting can be reduced to IID learning.Due to the relation withMetric-E3, I

<p>Introduction: Several papers at NIPS caught my attention.Elad HazanandSatyen Kale,Online
Submodular OptimizationThey define an algorithm for online optimization of
submodular functions with regret guarantees. This places submodular
optimization roughly on par with online convex optimization as tractable
settings for online learning.Elad HazanandSatyen KaleOn Stochastic and Worst-
Case Models of Investing. At it's core, this is yet another example of
modifying worst-case online learning to deal with variance, but the
application to financial models is particularly cool and it seems plausibly
superior other common approaches for financial modeling.Mark Palatucci,Dean
Pomerlau,Tom Mitchell, andGeoff HintonZero Shot Learning with Semantic Output
CodesThe goal here is predicting a label in a multiclass supervised setting
where the label never occurs in the training data. They have some basic
analysis and also a nice application to FMRI brain reading.Shobha

<p>Introduction: A $1M qualifying result was achieved on thepublic Netflix test setby a3-way
ensemble team. This is just in time forYehuda's presentation atKDD, which I'm
sure will be one of the best attended ever.This isn't quite over--there are a
few days for another super-conglomerate team to come together and there is
some small chance that the performance is nonrepresentative of the final test
set, but I expect not.Regardless of the final outcome, the biggest lesson for
ML from the Netflix contest has been the formidable performance edge of
ensemble methods.</p><p>2 0.92977214 <a title="279-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-04-Research_Budget_Changes.html">154 hunch net-2006-02-04-Research Budget Changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is
encouraging. There is some discussion of this at theComputing Research
Policyblog.One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time,
presumably in dollar budgets. I don't believe that dollar budgets are the
right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers. A better way
to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a
measure of the relative emphasis on research.This graph was assembled by
dividing theNSF budgetby theUS GDP. For 2005 GDP, I used thecurrent
estimateand for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per
year. The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to
change.This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding
emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row. The reality has been significantly
more severe due toDARPA decreasing fundingand industrial research labs (ATnT

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>same-blog 5 0.88462842 <a title="279-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-19-Cool_and_interesting_things_seen_at_NIPS.html">279 hunch net-2007-12-19-Cool and interesting things seen at NIPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I learned a number of things atNIPS.The financial people were there in greater
force than previously.Two Sigmasponsored NIPS whileDRW Tradinghad a
booth.Theadversarial machine learning workshophad a number of talks about
interesting applications where an adversary really is out to try and mess up
your learning algorithm. This is very different from the situation we often
think of where the world is oblivious to our learning. This may present new
and convincing applications for the learning-against-an-adversary work common
atCOLT.There were several interesing papers.Sanjoy Dasgupta,Daniel Hsu,
andClaire Monteleonihad a paper onGeneral Agnostic Active Learning. The basic
idea is that active learning can be done via reduction to a form of supervised
learning problem. This is great, because we have many supervised learning
algorithms from which the benefits of active learning may be derived.Joseph

<p>Introduction: This is a summary of the  workshop on Learning Problem Design  which  Alina  and I ran at  NIPS  this year.
 
The first question many people have is “What is learning problem design?”  This workshop is about admitting that solving learning problems does not start with labeled data, but rather somewhere before.  When humans are hired to produce labels, this is usually not a serious problem because you can tell them precisely what semantics you want the labels to have, and we can fix some set of features in advance.

<p>Introduction: Often, unlabeled data is easy to come by but labels are expensive. For instance, if you’re building a speech recognizer, it’s easy enough to get raw speech samples — just walk around with a microphone — but labeling even one of these samples is a tedious process in which a human must examine the speech signal and carefully segment it into phonemes. In the field of active learning, the goal is as usual to construct an accurate classifier, but the labels of the data points are initially hidden and there is a charge for each label you want revealed. The hope is that by intelligent adaptive querying, you can get away with significantly fewer labels than you would need in a regular supervised learning framework.
 
Here’s an example. Suppose the data lie on the real line, and the classifiers are simple thresholding functions, H = {h w }: 
  h w (x) = 1 if x > w, and 0 otherwise.

<p>Introduction: At NIPS,  Andrew Ng  asked me what should be in a large scale learning class.  After some discussion with him and  Nando  and mulling it over a bit, these are the topics that I think should be covered.
 
There are many different kinds of scaling.
  
  Scaling in examples   This is the most basic kind of scaling.
 
  Online Gradient Descent  This is an old algorithm—I’m not sure if anyone can be credited with it in particular.  Perhaps the  Perceptron  is a good precursor, but substantial improvements come from the notion of a loss function of which  squared loss ,  logistic loss , Hinge Loss, and  Quantile Loss  are all worth covering.  It’s important to cover the  semantics  of these loss functions as well.   Vowpal Wabbit  is a reasonably fast codebase implementing these. 
  Second Order Gradient Descent methods  For some problems, methods taking into account second derivative information can be more effective.  I’ve seen preconditioned conjugate gradient work well, for which  Jonath</p><p>4 0.13054655 <a title="277-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-26-NIPS_2010.html">420 hunch net-2010-12-26-NIPS 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I enjoyed attending  NIPS  this year, with several things interesting me.  For the conference itself:
  
  Peter Welinder ,  Steve  Branson ,  Serge Belongie , and  Pietro Perona ,  The Multidimensional Wisdom of Crowds .  This paper is about using  mechanical turk  to get label information, with results superior to a majority vote approach. 
  David McAllester ,  Tamir Hazan , and  Joseph Keshet   Direct Loss Minimization for Structured Prediction .  This is about another technique for directly optimizing the loss in structured prediction, with an application to speech recognition.  
  Mohammad Saberian  and  Nuno Vasconcelos   Boosting Classifier Cascades .  This is about an algorithm for simultaneously optimizing loss and computation in a classifier cascade construction.  There were several other papers on cascades which are worth looking at if interested.

<p>Introduction: At  KDD  I enjoyed  Stephen Boyd ‘s invited talk about optimization quite a bit.  However, the most interesting talk for me was  David Haussler ‘s.  His talk started out with a formidable load of biological complexity.  About half-way through you start wondering, “can this be used to help with cancer?”  And at the end he connects it directly to use with a call to arms for the audience: cure cancer.  The core thesis here is that cancer is a complex set of diseases which can be distentangled via genetic assays, allowing attacking the specific signature of individual cancers.  However, the data quantity and complex dependencies within the data require systematic and relatively automatic prediction and analysis algorithms of the kind that we are best familiar with.

<p>Introduction: This is a proposal for a workshop.  It may or may not happen depending on the level of interest.  If you are interested, feel free to indicate so (by email or comments).
 
Description: 
Assume(*) that any system for solving large difficult learning problems must decompose into repeated use of basic elements (i.e. atoms).  There are many basic questions which remain:
  
  What are the viable basic elements? 
  What makes a basic element viable? 
  What are the viable principles for the composition of these basic elements? 
  What are the viable principles for learning in such systems? 
  What problems can this approach handle? 
  
Hal Daume adds:
  
 Can composition of atoms be (semi-) automatically constructed[?] 
 When atoms are constructed through reductions, is there some notion of the “naturalness” of the created leaning problems? 
 Other than Markov fields/graphical models/Bayes nets, is there a good language for representing atoms and their compositions?

<p>Introduction: One of the common trends in machine learning has been an emphasis on the use of unlabeled data.  The argument goes something like “there aren’t many labeled web pages out there, but there are a  huge  number of web pages, so we must find a way to take advantage of them.”  There are several standard approaches for doing this:
  
  Unsupervised Learning .  You use only unlabeled data.  In a typical application, you cluster the data and hope that the clusters somehow correspond to what you care about. 
 Semisupervised Learning.  You use both unlabeled and labeled data to build a predictor.  The unlabeled data influences the learned predictor in some way. 
  Active Learning . You have unlabeled data and access to a labeling oracle.  You interactively choose which examples to label so as to optimize prediction accuracy. 
  
It seems there is a fourth approach worth serious investigation—automated labeling.  The approach goes as follows:

<p>Introduction: Francisco Pereira  points out a fun  Prediction Competition .   Francisco says:
 
DARPA is sponsoring a competition to analyze data from an unusual functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiment. Subjects watch videos inside the scanner while fMRI data are acquired. Unbeknownst to these subjects, the videos have been seen by a panel of other subjects that labeled each instant with labels in categories such as representation (are there tools, body parts, motion, sound), location, presence of actors, emotional content, etc.
 
The challenge is to predict all of these different labels on an instant-by-instant basis from the fMRI data. A few reasons why this is particularly interesting:
  
  This is beyond the current state of the art, but not inconceivably hard. 
  This is a new type of experiment design current analysis methods cannot deal with. 
  This is an opportunity to work with a heavily examined and preprocessed neuroimaging dataset.

<p>Introduction: Ron Bekkerman  initiated an effort to create an  edited book on parallel machine learning  that  Misha  and I have been helping with.  The breadth of efforts to parallelize machine learning surprised me: I was only aware of a small fraction initially.
 
This put us in a unique position, with knowledge of a wide array of different efforts, so it is natural to put together a  survey tutorial on the subject of parallel learning  for  KDD , tomorrow.  This tutorial is  not  limited to the book itself however, as several interesting new algorithms have come out since we started inviting chapters.  
 
This tutorial should interest anyone trying to use machine learning on significant quantities of data, anyone interested in developing algorithms for such, and of course who has bragging rights to the fastest learning algorithm on planet earth   
 
(Also note the Modeling with Hadoop tutorial just before ours which deals with one way of trying to speed up learning algorithms.

<p>Introduction: Machine learning algorithms have a much better chance of being widely adopted if they are implemented in some easy-to-use code.  There are several important concerns associated with machine learning which stress programming languages on the ease-of-use vs. speed frontier.
  
  Speed   The rate at which data sources are growing seems to be outstripping the rate at which computational power is growing, so it is important that we be able to eak out every bit of computational power.  Garbage collected languages ( java ,  ocaml ,  perl  and  python ) often have several issues here.
 
 Garbage collection often implies that floating point numbers are “boxed”: every float is represented by a pointer to a float.  Boxing can cause an order of magnitude slowdown because an extra nonlocalized memory reference is made, and accesses to main memory can are many CPU cycles long. 
 Garbage collection often implies that considerably more memory is used than is necessary.   This has a variable effect.

<p>Introduction: This is a summary of the  workshop on Learning Problem Design  which  Alina  and I ran at  NIPS  this year.
 
The first question many people have is “What is learning problem design?”  This workshop is about admitting that solving learning problems does not start with labeled data, but rather somewhere before.  When humans are hired to produce labels, this is usually not a serious problem because you can tell them precisely what semantics you want the labels to have, and we can fix some set of features in advance.  However, when other methods are used this becomes more problematic.  This focus is important for Machine Learning because there are very large quantities of data which are not labeled by a hired human.
 
The title of the workshop was a bit ambitious, because a workshop is not long enough to synthesize a diversity of approaches into a coherent set of principles.  For me, the posters at the end of the workshop were quite helpful in getting approaches to gel.

<p>Introduction: I enjoyed attending  NIPS  this year, with several things interesting me.  For the conference itself:
  
  Peter Welinder ,  Steve  Branson ,  Serge Belongie , and  Pietro Perona ,  The Multidimensional Wisdom of Crowds .  This paper is about using  mechanical turk  to get label information, with results superior to a majority vote approach. 
  David McAllester ,  Tamir Hazan , and  Joseph Keshet   Direct Loss Minimization for Structured Prediction .  This is about another technique for directly optimizing the loss in structured prediction, with an application to speech recognition.  
  Mohammad Saberian  and  Nuno Vasconcelos   Boosting Classifier Cascades .  This is about an algorithm for simultaneously optimizing loss and computation in a classifier cascade construction.  There were several other papers on cascades which are worth looking at if interested.

I’ve always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so large, and very low compared to the benefits.

<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult.  As a conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good papers—enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to (generally) to grow the conference.  For someone choosing to participate in a new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work out?  Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you are sure will work?
 
The conference founding problem is a joint agreement problem with a very significant barrier.  Workshops are a way around this problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective means for this.  A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available.  Presenting work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a confe</p><p>4 0.18323334 <a title="234-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-24-The_Role_of_Workshops.html">46 hunch net-2005-03-24-The Role of Workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.  This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.  Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention.  Roughly speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your interest.  The main conference program consists of elements related to someoneâ&euro;&trade;s interest (which is rarely your own).  Workshops are more about doing research while conferences are more about presenting research.  
 
Several conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due shortly.

Anyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops and see if any are of interest.

<p>Introduction: Alekh ,  John ,  Ofer , and I are organizing a  workshop  at  NIPS  this year on learning in parallel and distributed environments.  The general interest level in parallel learning seems to be growing rapidly, so I expect quite a bit of attendance.  Please join us if you are parallel-interested.
 
And, if you are working in the area of parallel learning, please consider  submitting an abstract  due Oct. 17 for presentation at the workshop.</p><p>6 0.16588773 <a title="234-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-10-Workshops_are_not_Conferences.html">80 hunch net-2005-06-10-Workshops are not Conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: … and you should use that fact.
 
A workshop differs from a conference in that it is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic.  It also differs in that a workshop is typically a “one-time affair” rather than a series.  (The  Snowbird learning workshop  counts as a conference in this respect.)  
 
A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop is to treat it as a conference.  This is “ok”, but it is not really taking advantage of the situation.  Here are some things I’ve learned:
  
 For speakers: A smaller audience means it can be more interactive.  Interactive means a better chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation (because you can adapt to your audience).  Greater focus amongst the participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and discuss tradeoffs more carefully.  Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued than newness. 
 For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference st</p><p>4 0.61448038 <a title="234-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-01-NIPS_2008_workshop_on_%26%238216%3BLearning_over_Empirical_Hypothesis_Spaces%26%238217%3B.html">319 hunch net-2008-10-01-NIPS 2008 workshop on &#8216;Learning over Empirical Hypothesis Spaces&#8217;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This workshop asks for insights how far we may/can push the theoretical boundary of using data in the design of learning machines. Can we express our classification rule in terms of the sample, or do we have to stick to a core assumption of classical statistical learning theory, namely that the hypothesis space is to be defined independent from the sample? This workshop is particularly interested in – but not restricted to – the ‘luckiness framework’ and the recently introduced  notion of ‘compatibility functions’ in a semi-supervised learning context (more information can be found at  http://www.kuleuven.be/wehys ).</p><p>5 0.59015399 <a title="234-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-19-NIPS_2008_workshop_on_Kernel_Learning.html">321 hunch net-2008-10-19-NIPS 2008 workshop on Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Weâ&euro;&trade;d like to invite hunch.net readers to participate in the NIPS 2008 workshop on kernel learning.  While the main focus is on automatically learning kernels from data, we are also also looking at the broader questions of feature selection, multi-task learning and multi-view learning. There are no restrictions on the learning problem being addressed (regression, classification, etc), and both theoretical and applied work will be considered. The deadline for submissions is  October 24 .

<p>Introduction: As usual  ICML 2007  will be hosting a  workshop program  to be held this year on June 24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I’d like to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for details. 
 
Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your choosing. I’ve always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-conference on a particular ML sub-area.  Hope to see some interesting proposals rolling in.</p><p>2 0.7167182 <a title="234-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-25-Embeddings%3A_what_are_they_good_for%3F.html">61 hunch net-2005-04-25-Embeddings: what are they good for?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve been looking at some recent embeddings work, and am struck by how beautiful the theory and algorithms are. It also makes me wonder, what are embeddings good for?
 
A few things immediately come to mind:
 
(1) For visualization of high-dimensional data sets.
 
In this case, one would like good algorithms for embedding specifically into 2- and 3-dimensional Euclidean spaces.
 
(2) For nonparametric modeling.
 
The usual nonparametric models (histograms, nearest neighbor) often require resources which are exponential in the dimension. So if the data actually lie close to some low-dimensional 
surface, it might be a good idea to first identify this surface and embed the data before applying the model.
 
Incidentally, for applications like these, it’s important to have a functional mapping from high to low dimension, which some techniques do not yield up.
 
(3) As a prelude to classifier learning.
 
The hope here is presumably that learning will be easier in the low-dimensional space,</p><p>3 0.69419789 <a title="234-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-24-Top_graduates_this_season.html">384 hunch net-2009-12-24-Top graduates this season</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I would like to point out 3 graduates this season as having my confidence they are capable of doing great things. 
  
  Daniel Hsu  has diverse papers with diverse coauthors on {active learning, mulitlabeling, temporal learning, …} each covering new algorithms and methods of analysis.  He is also a capable programmer, having helped me with some nitty-gritty details of cluster parallel  Vowpal Wabbit  this summer.  He has an excellent tendency to just get things done. 
  Nicolas Lambert  doesn’t nominally work in machine learning, but I’ve found his work in  elicitation  relevant nevertheless.  In essence, elicitable properties are closely related to learnable properties, and the elicitation complexity is related to a notion of learning complexity.  See the  Surrogate regret bounds paper  for some related discussion.  Few people successfully work at such a general level that it crosses fields, but he’s one of them.

<p>Introduction: In recent years, there’s been an explosion of free educational resources that make high-level knowledge and skills accessible to an ever-wider group of people. In your own field, you probably have a good idea of where to look for the answer to any particular question. But outside your areas of expertise, sifting through textbooks, Wikipedia articles, research papers, and online lectures can be bewildering (unless you’re fortunate enough to have a knowledgeable colleague to consult). What are the key concepts in the field, how do they relate to each other, which ones should you learn, and where should you learn them?
 
Courses are a major vehicle for packaging educational materials for a broad audience. The trouble is that they’re typically meant to be consumed linearly, regardless of your specific background or goals. Also, unless thousands of other people have had the same background and learning goals, there may not even be a course that fits your needs. Recently, we ( Roger Grosse</p><p>6 0.63002825 <a title="234-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-20-Both_new%3A_STOC_workshops_and_NEML.html">462 hunch net-2012-04-20-Both new: STOC workshops and NEML</a></p>

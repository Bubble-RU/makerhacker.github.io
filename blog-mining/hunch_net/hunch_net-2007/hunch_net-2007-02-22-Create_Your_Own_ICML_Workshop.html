<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>3 0.24890101 <a title="234-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-25-Upcoming_conference.html">198 hunch net-2006-07-25-Upcoming conference</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.
This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.
Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance
can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention. Roughly
speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your
interest. The main conference program consists of elements related to
someone's interest (which is rarely your own). Workshops are more about doing
research while conferences are more about presenting research.Several
conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due
shortly.ICML workshopsDue April 1IJCAI workshopsDeadlines VaryKDD workshopsNot

and see if any are of interest. (If none are, then maybe you should organize
one next year.)</p><p>5 0.17263274 <a title="234-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-10-Workshops_are_not_Conferences.html">80 hunch net-2005-06-10-Workshops are not Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś and you should use that fact.A workshop differs from a conference in that it
is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic. It also
differs in that a workshop is typically a "one-time affair" rather than a
series. (TheSnowbird learning workshopcounts as a conference in this
respect.)A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop
is to treat it as a conference. This is "ok", but it is not really taking
advantage of the situation. Here are some things I've learned:For speakers: A
smaller audience means it can be more interactive. Interactive means a better
chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation
(because you can adapt to your audience). Greater focus amongst the
participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and
discuss tradeoffs more carefully. Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued
than newness.For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference style

<p>Introduction: This workshop asks for insights how far we may/can push the theoretical
boundary of using data in the design of learning machines. Can we express our
classification rule in terms of the sample, or do we have to stick to a core
assumption of classical statistical learning theory, namely that the
hypothesis space is to be defined independent from the sample? This workshop
is particularly interested in - but not restricted to - the 'luckiness
framework' and the recently introduced notion of 'compatibility functions' in
a semi-supervised learning context (more information can be found
athttp://www.kuleuven.be/wehys).</p><p>5 0.62234396 <a title="234-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yesterday, there was a discussion aboutfuture publication models at
NIPS.YannandZoubinhave specific detailed proposals which I'll add links to
when I get them (Yann's proposalandZoubin's proposal).What struck me about the
discussion is that there are many simultaneous concerns as well as many
simultaneous proposals, which makes it difficult to keep all the distinctions
straight in a verbal conversation. It also seemed like people were serious
enough about this that we may see some real movement. Certainly, my personal
experience motivates that as I'veposted many timesabout the substantial flaws
in our review process, including some very poor personal experiences.Concerns
include the following:(Several) Reviewers are overloaded, boosting the noise
in decision making.(Yann) A new system should run with as little built-in
delay and friction to the process of research as possible.(Hanna

<p>Introduction: (I'm channeling forJean-Yves Audiberthere, with some minor tweaking for
clarity.)SinceNemirovski'sSaint Flour lecture notes, numerous researchers have
studied the following problem in least squares regression: predict as well
as(MS) the best of d given functions (like in prediction with expert advice;
model = finite set of d functions)(C) the best convex combination of these
functions (i.e., model = convex hull of the d functions)(L) the best linear
combination of these functions (i.e., model = linear span of the d
functions)It is now well known (see, e.g., Sacha Tsybakov's COLT'03 paper)
that these tasks can be achieved since there exist estimators having an excess
risk of order (log d)/n for (MS), min( sqrt((log d)/n), d/n ) for (C) and d/n
for (L), where n is the training set size. Here, "risk" is amount of extra
loss per example which may be suffered due to the choice of random sample.The
practical use of these results seems rather limited to trivial statements
like: do not use the</p><p>4 0.60469967 <a title="234-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-07-The_State_of_the_Reduction.html">14 hunch net-2005-02-07-The State of the Reduction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What?Reductions are machines which turn solvers for one problem into solvers
for another problem.Why?Reductions are useful for several reasons.Laziness.
Reducing a problem to classification make at least 10 learning algorithms
available to solve a problem. Inventing 10 learning algorithms is quite a bit
of work. Similarly, programming a reduction is often trivial, while
programming a learning algorithm is a great deal of work.Crystallization. The
problems we often want to solve in learning are worst-case-impossible, but
average case feasible. By reducing all problems onto one or a few primitives,
we can fine tune these primitives to perform well on real-world problems with
greater precision due to the greater number of problems to validate
on.Theoretical Organization. By studying what reductions are easy vs. hard vs.
impossible, we can learn which problems are roughly equivalent in difficulty
and which are much harder.What we know now.Typesafe reductions. In the
beginning, there was th</p><p>5 0.53801095 <a title="234-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-10-ICML_Reviewing_Criteria.html">325 hunch net-2008-11-10-ICML Reviewing Criteria</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael LittmanandLeon Bottouhave decided to use a franchise program chair
approach toreviewing at ICMLthis year. I'll be one of the area chairs, so I
wanted to mention a few things if you are thinking about naming me.I take
reviewing seriously. That means papers to be reviewed are read, the
implications are considered, and decisions are only made after that. I do my
best to be fair, and there are zero subjects that I consider categorical
rejects. I don't consider severalarguments for rejection-not-on-the-merits
reasonable.I am generally interested in papers that (a) analyze new models of
machine learning, (b) provide new algorithms, and (c) show that they work
empirically on plausibly real problems. If a paper has the trifecta, I'm
particularly interested. With 2 out of 3, I might be interested. I often find
papers with only one element harder to accept, including papers with just
(a).I'm a bit tough. I rarely jump-up-and-down about a paper, because I
believe that great progress is ra</p><p>6 0.53656328 <a title="234-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-18-Decision_by_Vetocracy.html">343 hunch net-2009-02-18-Decision by Vetocracy</a></p>

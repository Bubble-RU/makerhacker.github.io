<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple. Viewed
representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear
separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or
perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural
networks or kernelized SVMs). Should we go beyond this, and start using "deep"
representations?What is deep learning?Intuitively, deep learning is about
learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the
input (observed) features.Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be
rather difficult. Consider the following cases:SVM with Gaussian Kernel. This
is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can't
succinctly represent certain decision surfaces. One ofYann LeCun's examples is
recognizing objects based on pixel values. An SVM will need a new support

solve these sorts of problems is probably the best objective definition of a
deep learning algorithm we have. I'm not that surprised. In my experience, if
you can accept the computational drawbacks of a boosted decision tree, they
can achieve pretty good performance.Geoff Hintononce told me that the great

<p>Introduction: There are a number of learning algorithms which explicitly incorporate
randomness into their execution. This includes at amongst others:Neural
Networks. Neural networks use randomization to assign initial
weights.Boltzmann Machines/Deep Belief Networks. Boltzmann machines are
something like a stochastic version of multinode logistic regression. The use
of randomness is more essential in Boltzmann machines, because the predicted
value at test time also uses randomness.Bagging. Bagging is a process where a
learning algorithm is run several different times on several different
datasets, creating a final predictor which makes a majority vote.Policy
descent. Several algorithms in reinforcement learning such asConservative
Policy Iterationuse random bits to create stochastic policies.Experts
algorithms. Randomized weighted majority use random bits as a part of the
prediction process to achieve better theoretical guarantees.A basic question
is: "Should there be explicit randomization in learn</p><p>5 0.16110852 <a title="227-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated_Gradient.html">258 hunch net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheExponentiated Gradientalgorithm byManfred WarmuthandJyrki Kivinencame out
just as I was starting graduate school, so I missed it both at a conference
and in class. It's a fine algorithm which has a remarkable theoretical
statement accompanying it.The essential statement holds in the "online
learning with an adversary" setting. Initially, there are of set ofnweights,
which might have values(1/n,â&euro;Ś,1/n), (or any other values from a probability
distribution). Everything happens in a round-by-round fashion. On each round,
the following happens:The world reveals a set of featuresx in {0,1}n. In the
online learning with an adversary literature, the features are called
"experts" and thought of as subpredictors, but this interpretation isn't
necessary--you can just use feature values as experts (or maybe the feature
value and the negation of the feature value as two experts).EG makes a
prediction according toy' = w . x(dot product).The world reveals the truthy in
[0,1].EG updates the weights</p><p>6 0.15193634 <a title="227-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-18-Is_Multitask_Learning_Black-Boxable%3F.html">149 hunch net-2006-01-18-Is Multitask Learning Black-Boxable?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, a scheduling failure meant I missed all ofAIStatand most of
thelearning workshop, otherwise known as Snowbird, when it's atSnowbird.At
snowbird, the talk onSum-Productnetworks byHoifung Poonstood out to me (Pedro
Domingosis a coauthor.). The basic point was that by appropriately
constructing networks based on sums and products, the normalization problem in
probabilistic models is eliminated, yielding a highly tractable yet flexible
representation+learning algorithm. As an algorithm, this is noticeably cleaner
than deep belief networks with a claim to being an order of magnitude faster
and working better on an image completion task.Snowbird doesn't have real
papers--just the abstract above. I look forward to seeing the paper. (added:

<p>Introduction: Maybe it's too early to call, but with four separate Neural Network sessions
at this year'sICML, it looks like Neural Networks are making a comeback. Here
are my highlights of these sessions. In general, my feeling is that these
papers both demystify deep learning and show its broader applicability.The
first observation I made is that the once disreputable "Neural" nomenclature
is being used againin lieu of"deep learning". Maybe it's because Adam Coates
et al. showed that single layer networks can work surprisingly well.An

<p>Introduction: "Deep learning" is used to describe learning architectures which have
significant depth (as a circuit).One claimis that shallow architectures (one
or two layers) can not concisely represent some functions while a circuit with
more depth can concisely represent these same functions. Proving lower bounds
on the size of a circuit is substantially harder than upper bounds (which are
constructive), but some results are known.Luca Trevisan'sclass notesdetail how
XOR is not concisely representable by "AC0â&euro;ł (= constant depth unbounded fan-in
AND, OR, NOT gates). This doesn't quite prove that depth is necessary for the
representations commonly used in learning (such as a thresholded weighted
sum), but it is strongly suggestive that this is so.Examples like this are a
bit disheartening because existing algorithms for deep learning (deep belief
nets, gradient descent on deep neural networks, and a perhaps decision trees
depending on who you ask) can't learn XOR very easily. Evidence so far

<p>Introduction: Centmailis a scheme which makes charity donations have a secondary value, as a
stamp for email. When discussed onnewscientist,slashdot, and others, some of
the comments make the academic review process appear thoughtful. Some
prominent fallacies are:Costing money fallacy. Some commenters appear to
believe the system charges money per email. Instead, the basic idea is that
users get an extra benefit from donations to a charity and participation is
strictly voluntary. The solution to this fallacy is simply readingthe
details.Single solution fallacy. Some commenters seem to think this is
proposed as a complete solution to spam, and since not everyone will opt to
participate, it won't work. But a complete solution is not at all necessary or
even possible given theflag-day problem. Deployed machine learning systems for
fighting spam are great at taking advantage of a partial solution. The
solution to this fallacy is learning about machine learning. In the current
state of affairs, informed</p><p>3 0.95530152 <a title="227-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-02-Retrospective.html">225 hunch net-2007-01-02-Retrospective</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This
blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from about 13K unique
sites p</p><p>4 0.92914712 <a title="227-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-19-Choice_of_Metrics.html">259 hunch net-2007-08-19-Choice of Metrics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we judge success in Machine Learning? AsAaronnotes, the best way is to
use the loss imposed on you by the world. This turns out to be infeasible
sometimes for various reasons. The ones I've seen are:The learned prediction
is used in some complicated process that does not give the feedback necessary
to understand the prediction's impact on the loss.The prediction is used by
some other system which expects some semantics to the predicted value. This is
similar to the previous example, except that the issue is design modularity
rather than engineering modularity.The correct loss function is simply unknown
(and perhaps unknowable, except by experimentation).In these situations, it's
unclear what metric for evaluation should be chosen. This post has some design
advice for this murkier case. I'm using the word "metric" here to distinguish
the fact that we are considering methods forevaluatingpredictive systems
rather than a loss imposed by the real world or a loss which is optimized b</p><p>5 0.92652816 <a title="227-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-03-19-The_Ideal_Large_Scale_Learning_Class.html">426 hunch net-2011-03-19-The Ideal Large Scale Learning Class</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At NIPS,Andrew Ngasked me what should be in a large scale learning class.
After some discussion with him andNandoand mulling it over a bit, these are
the topics that I think should be covered.There are many different kinds of
scaling.Scaling in examplesThis is the most basic kind of scaling.Online
Gradient DescentThis is an old algorithm--I'm not sure if anyone can be
credited with it in particular. Perhaps thePerceptronis a good precursor, but
substantial improvements come from the notion of a loss function of

covering. It's important to cover thesemanticsof these loss functions as
well.Vowpal Wabbitis a reasonably fast codebase implementing these.Second

second derivative information can be more effective. I've seen preconditioned
conjugate gradient work well, for whichJonathan Shewchuck'swriteupis

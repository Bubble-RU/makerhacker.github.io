ICML continues to experiment with the reviewing process, although perhaps less so than last year.  
 
The S “sort-of” for COLT is because author feedback occurs only after decisions are made.  
 
KDD is notable for being the most comprehensive in terms of {Tutorials, Workshops, Challenges, Panels, Papers (two tracks), Demos}.  The S for KDD is because there is sometimes author feedback at the decision of the SPC.

Reviewer targeting is new this year.  The idea is that many poor decisions happen because the papers go to reviewers who are unqualified, and the hope is that allowing authors to point out who is qualified results in better decisions.  In my experience, this is a reasonable idea to test.
 
Both UAI and COLT are experimenting this year as well with double blind and author feedback, respectively.  Of the two, I believe author feedback is more important, as I’ve seen it make a difference.  However, I still consider double blind reviewing a net wi</p><p>5 0.34658018 <a title="226-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-02-Paper_Deadlines.html">11 hunch net-2005-02-02-Paper Deadlines</a></p>

The geowinner this year is the west coast of North America.   Last year ‘s geowinner was the Northeastern US, and the  year before  it was mostly Europe.  It’s notable how tightly the conferences cluster, even when they don’t colocate.</p><p>2 0.83373249 <a title="226-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-23-ICML_workshops_due.html">433 hunch net-2011-04-23-ICML workshops due</a></p>

ICML continues to experiment with the reviewing process, although perhaps less so than last year.  
 
The S “sort-of” for COLT is because author feedback occurs only after decisions are made.  
 
KDD is notable for being the most comprehensive in terms of {Tutorials, Workshops, Challenges, Panels, Papers (two tracks), Demos}.  The S for KDD is because there is sometimes author feedback at the decision of the SPC.

Reviewer targeting is new this year.  The idea is that many poor decisions happen because the papers go to reviewers who are unqualified, and the hope is that allowing authors to point out who is qualified results in better decisions.  In my experience, this is a reasonable idea to test.
 
Both UAI and COLT are experimenting this year as well with double blind and author feedback, respectively.  Of the two, I believe author feedback is more important, as I’ve seen it make a difference.  However, I still consider double blind reviewing a net wi</p><p>5 0.44110787 <a title="226-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-11-COLT_CFP.html">326 hunch net-2008-11-11-COLT CFP</a></p>

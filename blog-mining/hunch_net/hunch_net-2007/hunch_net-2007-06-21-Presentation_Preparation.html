<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś and you should use that fact.A workshop differs from a conference in that it
is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic. It also
differs in that a workshop is typically a "one-time affair" rather than a
series. (TheSnowbird learning workshopcounts as a conference in this
respect.)A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop
is to treat it as a conference. This is "ok", but it is not really taking
advantage of the situation. Here are some things I've learned:For speakers: A
smaller audience means it can be more interactive. Interactive means a better
chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation
(because you can adapt to your audience). Greater focus amongst the
participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and
discuss tradeoffs more carefully. Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued
than newness.For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference style

<p>Introduction: In recent years, there’s been an explosion of free educational resources that
make high-level knowledge and skills accessible to an ever-wider group of
people. In your own field, you probably have a good idea of where to look for
the answer to any particular question. But outside your areas of expertise,
sifting through textbooks, Wikipedia articles, research papers, and online
lectures can be bewildering (unless you’re fortunate enough to have a
knowledgeable colleague to consult). What are the key concepts in the field,
how do they relate to each other, which ones should you learn, and where
should you learn them?Courses are a major vehicle for packaging educational
materials for a broad audience. The trouble is that they’re typically meant to
be consumed linearly, regardless of your specific background or goals. Also,
unless thousands of other people have had the same background and learning
goals, there may not even be a course that fits your needs. Recently, we

<p>Introduction: (update:cross-postedonCACM)For the first time in several years,ICML 2010did
not havevideolecturesattending. Luckily, thetutorial on exploration and
learningwhichAlinaand I put together canbe viewed, since we also presented
atKDD 2010, which included videolecture support.ICML didn't cover the cost of
a videolecture, becausePASCALdidn't provide a grant for it this year. On the
other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs. The cost of
videolectures isn't cheap. Fora workshopthe baseline quote we have is 270 euro
per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman's travel and accomodation.
This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle
the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a
quoted 216 euro per hour.Youtubeis the most predominant free video site with a
cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.15 minute upload
limitsdo not match typical talk lengths. Videolectures also have side-by-side

<p>Introduction: One thing common to much research is that the researcher must be the first
personeverto have some thought. How do you think of something that has never
been thought of? There seems to be no methodical manner of doing this, but
there are some tricks.The easiest method is to just have some connection come
to you. There is a trick here however: you should write it down and fill out
the idea immediately because it can just as easily go away.A harder method is
to set aside a block of time and simply think about an idea. Distraction
elimination is essential here because thinking about the unthought is hard
work which your mind will avoid.Another common method is in conversation.
Sometimes the process of verbalizing implies new ideas come up and sometimes
whoever you are talking to replies just the right way. This method is
dangerous though--you must speak to someone who helps you think rather than
someone who occupies your thoughts.Try to rephrase the problem so the answer
is simple. This is</p><p>5 0.62148702 <a title="249-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-18-Report_of_MLSS_2006_Taipei.html">203 hunch net-2006-08-18-Report of MLSS 2006 Taipei</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4,
2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245
participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a
lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see
ourWIKIfor more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as
organizers to screw it up too bad. Also, since we have pretty good
infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and
Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it
was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this
two-week long party of machine learning.In the end of MLSS we distributed a
survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this
survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from
participants.The first question is designed to find out how our participants
learned about MLSS 2006 Taipei.</p><p>6 0.61477357 <a title="249-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-09-Use_of_Notation.html">162 hunch net-2006-03-09-Use of Notation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference. Since many
people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial
challenge. Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about
preparing a presentation on research.Motivate. Talks which don't start by
describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out.Prioritize. It
is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many
presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much. This is an
easy-to-understand failure mode as it's very natural to want to include
everything. A basic fact is: you can't. Example of this are:Your slides are so
densely full of equations and words that you can't cover them.Your talk runs
over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off.You motor-mouth
through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience
prioritizes in some uncontrolled fashion.The rate of flow of concepts simply
exceeds the infor</p><p>4 0.71806288 <a title="249-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-05-02-What%26%238217%3Bs_the_difference_between_gambling_and_rewarding_good_prediction%3F.html">397 hunch net-2010-05-02-What&#8217;s the difference between gambling and rewarding good prediction?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After amajor financial crisis, there is much discussion about howfinance has
become a casinogambling with other's money, keeping the winnings, and walking
away when the money is lost.When thinking about financial reform, all the many
losers in the above scenario are apt to take the view that this activity
should be completely, or nearly completely curtailed. But, a more thoughtful
view is that sometimes there is a real sense in which there are right and
wrong decisions, and we as a society would really prefer that the people most
likely to make right decisions are making them. A crucial question then is:
"What is the difference between gambling and rewarding good
prediction?"Wediscussed this before the financial crisis. The cheat-sheet
sketch is that the online learning against an adversary problem, algorithm,
and theorems, provide a good mathematical model for thinking about this
question. What I would like to do here is map this onto various types of
financial transactions. The basic</p><p>5 0.65243214 <a title="249-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-22-Explicit_Randomization_in_Learning_algorithms.html">219 hunch net-2006-11-22-Explicit Randomization in Learning algorithms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a number of learning algorithms which explicitly incorporate
randomness into their execution. This includes at amongst others:Neural
Networks. Neural networks use randomization to assign initial
weights.Boltzmann Machines/Deep Belief Networks. Boltzmann machines are
something like a stochastic version of multinode logistic regression. The use
of randomness is more essential in Boltzmann machines, because the predicted
value at test time also uses randomness.Bagging. Bagging is a process where a
learning algorithm is run several different times on several different
datasets, creating a final predictor which makes a majority vote.Policy
descent. Several algorithms in reinforcement learning such asConservative
Policy Iterationuse random bits to create stochastic policies.Experts
algorithms. Randomized weighted majority use random bits as a part of the
prediction process to achieve better theoretical guarantees.A basic question
is: "Should there be explicit randomization in learn</p><p>6 0.64458156 <a title="249-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-17-Learning_Research_Programs.html">21 hunch net-2005-02-17-Learning Research Programs</a></p>

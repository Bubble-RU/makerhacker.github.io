This is an easy-to-understand failure mode as it’s very natural to want to include everything.  A basic fact is: you can’t.  Example of this are:
 
 Your slides are so densely full of equations and words that you can’t cover them.

  The problem .  Presentations which don’t describe the problem almost immediately lose people, because the context is missing to understand the detail. 
  Prior relevant work .  In many cases, a paper builds on some previous bit of work which must be understood in order to understand what the paper does.  A common failure mode seems to be spending too much time on prior work.  Discuss just the relevant aspects of prior work in the language of your work.  Sometimes this is missing when unneeded.

<p>Introduction: … and you should use that fact.
 
A workshop differs from a conference in that it is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic.  It also differs in that a workshop is typically a “one-time affair” rather than a series.  (The  Snowbird learning workshop  counts as a conference in this respect.)  
 
A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop is to treat it as a conference.  This is “ok”, but it is not really taking advantage of the situation.  Here are some things I’ve learned:
  
 For speakers: A smaller audience means it can be more interactive.  Interactive means a better chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation (because you can adapt to your audience).  Greater focus amongst the participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and discuss tradeoffs more carefully.  Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued than newness.

<p>Introduction: One thing common to much research is that the researcher must be the first person  ever  to have some thought.  How do you think of something that has never been thought of?  There seems to be no methodical manner of doing this, but there are some tricks.
  
 The easiest method is to just have some connection come to you.  There is a trick here however: you should write it down and fill out the idea immediately because  it can just as easily go away. 
 A harder method is to set aside a block of time and simply think about an idea.  Distraction elimination is essential here because thinking about the unthought is hard work which your mind will avoid. 
 Another common method is in conversation.  Sometimes the process of verbalizing implies new ideas come up and sometimes whoever you are talking to replies just the right way.  This method is dangerous though—you must speak to someone who helps you think rather than someone who occupies your thoughts.

<p>Introduction: In recent years, there’s been an explosion of free educational resources that make high-level knowledge and skills accessible to an ever-wider group of people. In your own field, you probably have a good idea of where to look for the answer to any particular question. But outside your areas of expertise, sifting through textbooks, Wikipedia articles, research papers, and online lectures can be bewildering (unless you’re fortunate enough to have a knowledgeable colleague to consult). What are the key concepts in the field, how do they relate to each other, which ones should you learn, and where should you learn them?
 
Courses are a major vehicle for packaging educational materials for a broad audience. The trouble is that they’re typically meant to be consumed linearly, regardless of your specific background or goals. Also, unless thousands of other people have had the same background and learning goals, there may not even be a course that fits your needs.

<p>Introduction: When presenting part of the  Reinforcement Learning theory tutorial  at  ICML 2006 , I was forcibly reminded of this.
 
There are several difficulties.
  
  When creating the presentation, the correct level of detail is tricky.  With too much detail, the proof takes too much time and people may be lost to boredom.  With too little detail, the steps of the proof involve too-great a jump. This is very difficult to judge.
 
 What may be an easy step in the careful thought of a quiet room is not so easy when you are occupied by the process of presentation. 
 What may be easy after having gone over this (and other) proofs is not so easy to follow in the first pass by a viewer. 
 

  These problems seem only correctable by process of repeated test-and-revise.
 
 When presenting the proof, simply speaking with sufficient precision is substantially harder than in normal conversation (where precision is not so critical).  Practice can help here. 
 When presenting the proof, going at the right p</p><p>4 0.66763347 <a title="249-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-10-Workshops_are_not_Conferences.html">80 hunch net-2005-06-10-Workshops are not Conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference.  Since many people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial challenge.  Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about preparing a presentation on research.
  
  Motivate .  Talks which don’t start by describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out. 
  Prioritize .  It is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much.  This is an easy-to-understand failure mode as it’s very natural to want to include everything.  A basic fact is: you can’t.  Example of this are:
 
 Your slides are so densely full of equations and words that you can’t cover them. 
 Your talk runs over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off. 
 You motor-mouth through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience prioritizes in some uncontrolled fashion. 
 The rate of flow of c</p><p>2 0.71635485 <a title="249-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-05-10-Aggregation_of_estimators%2C_sparsity_in_high_dimension_and_computational_feasibility.html">398 hunch net-2010-05-10-Aggregation of estimators, sparsity in high dimension and computational feasibility</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (I’m channeling for  Jean-Yves Audibert  here, with some minor tweaking for clarity.)
 
Since  Nemirovski’s   Saint Flour lecture notes , numerous researchers have studied the following problem in least squares regression: predict as well as 
  (MS) the best of d given functions (like in prediction with expert advice; model = finite set of d functions) 
  (C) the best convex combination of these functions (i.e., model = convex hull of the d functions) 
  (L) the best linear combination of these functions (i.e., model = linear span of the d functions) 
It is now well known (see, e.g., Sacha Tsybakov’s COLT’03 paper) that these tasks can be achieved since there exist estimators having an excess risk of order (log d)/n for (MS), min( sqrt((log d)/n), d/n ) for (C) and d/n for (L), where n is the training set size.  Here, “risk” is amount of extra loss per example which may be suffered due to the choice of random sample.
 
The practical use of these results seems rather limited to trivial</p><p>3 0.58337688 <a title="249-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-18-ICML_%26%23038%3B_COLT_2010.html">403 hunch net-2010-07-18-ICML &#038; COLT 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The papers which interested me most at  ICML  and  COLT  2010 were:
  
  Thomas Walsh ,  Kaushik Subramanian ,  Michael Littman  and  Carlos Diuk   Generalizing Apprenticeship Learning across Hypothesis Classes .  This paper formalizes and provides algorithms with guarantees for mixed-mode apprenticeship and traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, allowing RL algorithms that perform better than for either setting alone. 
  István Szita  and  Csaba Szepesvári   Model-based reinforcement learning with nearly tight exploration complexity bounds .  This paper and  another represent the frontier of best-known algorithm for Reinforcement Learning in a Markov Decision Process. 
  James Martens   Deep learning via Hessian-free optimization .  About a new not-quite-online second order gradient algorithm for learning deep functional structures.  Potentially this is very powerful because while people have often talked about end-to-end learning, it has rarely worked in practice.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Daniel Hsu and John Langford.
 
In selective sampling style active learning, a learning algorithm chooses which examples to label.  We now have an active learning algorithm that is:
  
  Efficient  in label complexity, unlabeled complexity, and computational complexity. 
  Competitive  with supervised learning anywhere that supervised learning works. 
  Compatible  with online learning, with any optimization-based learning algorithm, with any loss function, with offline testing, and even with changing learning algorithms. 
  Empirically  effective. 
  
The basic idea is to combine  disagreement region-based sampling  with  importance weighting : an example is selected to be labeled with probability proportional to how useful it is for distinguishing among near-optimal classifiers, and labeled examples are importance-weighted by the inverse of these probabilities.  The combination of these simple ideas removes the  sampling bias  problem that has plagued many previous he</p><p>5 0.49856168 <a title="249-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult.  As a conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good papers—enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to (generally) to grow the conference.  For someone choosing to participate in a new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work out?  Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you are sure will work?
 
The conference founding problem is a joint agreement problem with a very significant barrier.  Workshops are a way around this problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective means for this.  A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available.  Presenting work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a confe</p><p>6 0.49729711 <a title="249-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-10-Precision_is_not_accuracy.html">202 hunch net-2006-08-10-Precision is not accuracy</a></p>

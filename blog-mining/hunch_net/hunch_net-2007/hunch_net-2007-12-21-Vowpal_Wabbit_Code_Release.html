<p>Introduction: Thelarge scale learning challengefor ICML interests me a great deal, although
I have concerns about the way it is structured.From theinstructions page,
several issues come up:Large DefinitionMy personal definition of dataset size
is:smallA dataset is small if a human could look at the dataset and plausibly
find a good solution.mediumA dataset is mediumsize if it fits in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.largeA large dataset does not fit in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.By this definition, all of the datasets are medium
sized. This might sound like a pissing match over dataset size, but I believe
it is more than that.The fundamental reason for these definitions is that they
correspond to transitions in the sorts of approaches which are feasible. From
small to medium, the ability to use a human as the learning algorithm
degrades. From medium to large, it becomes essential to have learning
algorithms that don't require random access to examples.No Loading TimeThe

<p>Introduction: Nic Schaudolphhas been developing a fast gradient descent algorithm
calledStochastic Meta-Descent(SMD).Gradient descent is currently untrendy in
the machine learning community, but there remains a large number of people
using gradient descent on neural networks or other architectures from when it
was trendy in the early 1990s. There are three problems with gradient
descent.Gradient descent does not necessarily produce easily reproduced
results. Typical algorithms start with "set the initial parameters to small
random values".The design of the representation that gradient descent is
applied to is often nontrivial. In particular, knowing exactly how to build a
large neural network so that it will perform well requires knowledge which has
not been made easily applicable.Gradient descent can be slow. Obviously,
taking infinitesimal steps in the direction of the gradient would take
forever, so some finite step size must be used. What exactly this step size
should be is unclear. Many people</p><p>4 0.18732281 <a title="281-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-31-Vowpal_Wabbit_Open_Source_Project.html">365 hunch net-2009-07-31-Vowpal Wabbit Open Source Project</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Today brings a new release of theVowpal Wabbitfast online learning software.
This time, unlike the previous release, the project itself is going open
source, developing viagithub. For example, the lastest and greatest can be
downloaded via:git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.gitIf you
aren't familiar withgit, it's a distributed version control system which
supports quick and easy branching, as well as reconciliation.This version of
the code is confirmed to compile without complaint on at least some flavors of
OSX as well as Linux boxes.As much of the point of this project is pushing the
limits of fast and effective machine learning, let me mention a few datapoints
from my experience.The program can effectively scale up to batch-style
training on sparse terafeature (i.e. 1012sparse feature) size datasets. The
limiting factor is typically i/o.I started using the the real datasets from
thelarge-scale learningworkshop as a convenient benchmark. The largest dataset

<p>Introduction: I just releasedVowpal Wabbit 6.0. Since the last version:VW is now 2-3 orders
of magnitude faster at linear learning, primarily thanks toAlekh. Given the
baseline, this is loads of fun, allowing us to easily deal with terafeature
datasets, and dwarfing the scale of any other open source projects. The core
improvement here comes from effective parallelization over kilonode clusters
(eitherHadoopor not). This code is highly scalable, so it even helps with
clusters of size 2 (and doesn't hurt for clusters of size 1). The core
allreduce technique appears widely and easily reused--we've already used it to
parallelize Conjugate Gradient, LBFGS, and two variants of online learning.
We'll be documenting how to do this more thoroughly, but for now
"README_cluster" and associated scripts should provide a good starting

<p>Introduction: I've releasedversion 5.0of theVowpal Wabbitonline learning software. The major
number has changed since thelast releasebecause I regard all earlier versions
as obsolete--there are several new algorithms & features including substantial
changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.The biggest changes are
new algorithms:Nikosand I improved the default algorithm. The basic update
rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully
controlled so that it's impossible to overrun the label. In addition, the
normalization has changed. Computationally, these changes are virtually free
and yield better results, sometimes much better. Less careful updates can be
reenabled with -loss_function classic, although results are still not
identical to previous due to normalization changes.Nikos also implemented the
per-feature learning rates as per thesetwopapers. Often, this works better
than the default algorithm. It isn't the default because it isn't (yet) as
adaptable</p><p>5 0.67356008 <a title="281-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-30-Concerns_about_the_Large_Scale_Learning_Challenge.html">300 hunch net-2008-04-30-Concerns about the Large Scale Learning Challenge</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sham Kakadepoints out that we are missing a bound.Suppose we
havemsamplesxdrawn IID from some distributionD. Through the magic of
exponential moment method we know that:If the range ofxis bounded by an
interval of sizeI, aChernoff/Hoeffding style boundgives us a bound on the
deviations likeO(I/m0.5)(at least in crude form). A proof is on page 9here.If
the range ofxis bounded, and the variance (or a bound on the variance) is
known, thenBennett's boundcan give tighter results (*). This can be a huge
improvment when the true variance small.What's missing here is a bound that
depends on the observed variance rather than a bound on the variance. This
means that many people attempt to use Bennett's bound (incorrectly) by
plugging the observed variance in as the true variance, invalidating the bound
application. Most of the time, they get away with it, but this is a dangerous
move when doing machine learning. In machine learning, we are typically trying
to find a predictor with 0 expected los</p><p>2 0.89765286 <a title="281-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-21-Rob_Schapire_at_NYC_ML_Meetup.html">405 hunch net-2010-08-21-Rob Schapire at NYC ML Meetup</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is about a general technique for problem solving which I've never
seen taught (in full generality), but which I've found very useful.Many
problems in computer science turn out to be discretely difficult. The best
known version of such problems are NP-hard problems, but I mean 'discretely
difficult' in a much more general way, which I only know how to capture by
examples.ERMIn empirical risk minimization, you choose a minimum error rate
classifier from a set of classifiers. This is NP hard for common sets, but it
can be much harder, depending on the set.ExpertsIn the online learning with
experts setting, you try to predict well so as to compete with a set of
(adversarial) experts. Here the alternating quantifiers of you and an
adversary playing out a game can yield a dynamic programming problem that
grows exponentially.Policy IterationThe problem with policy iteration is that
you learn a new policy with respect to an old policy, which implies that

<p>Introduction: We are releasing theVowpal Wabbit (Fast Online Learning) codeas open source
under a BSD (revised) license. This is aproject at Yahoo! Researchto build a
useful large scale learning algorithm whichLihong Li,Alex Strehl, and I have
been working on.To appreciate the meaning of "large", it's useful to define
"small" and "medium". A "small" supervised learning problem is one where a
human could use a labeled dataset and come up with a reasonable predictor. A
"medium" supervised learning problem dataset fits into the RAM of a modern
desktop computer. A "large" supervised learning problem is one which does not
fit into the RAM of a normal machine. VW tackles large scale learning problems
by this definition of large. I'm not aware of any other open source Machine
Learning tools which can handle this scale (although they may exist). A few
close ones are:IBM's Parallel Machine Learning Toolboxisn't quite open source.
The approach used by this toolbox is essentially map-reduce style computation,</p><p>5 0.88007474 <a title="281-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-07-Interesting_Papers_at_SODA_2009.html">334 hunch net-2009-01-07-Interesting Papers at SODA 2009</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several talks seem potentially interesting to ML folks at this year's SODA
.Maria-Florina Balcan,Avrim Blum, andAnupam Gupta,Approximate Clustering
without the Approximation. This paper gives reasonable algorithms with
provable approximation guarantees for k-median and other notions of
clustering. It's conceptually interesting, because it's the second example
I've seen where NP hardness is subverted by changing the problem definition
subtle but reasonable way. Essentially, they show that if any near-
approximation to an optimal solution is good, then it's computationally easy
to find a near-optimal solution. This subtle shift bears serious thought. A
similar one occurred inour ranking paperwith respect to minimum feedback
arcset. With two known examples, it suggests that many more NP-complete
problems might be finessed into irrelevance in this style.Yury

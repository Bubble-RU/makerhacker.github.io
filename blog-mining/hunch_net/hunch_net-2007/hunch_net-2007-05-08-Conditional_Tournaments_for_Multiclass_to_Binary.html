<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.
 
 Background  A reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there are  k  possible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2 possible labels.   On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary classifier with some error rate  e .  After subtracting the minimum possible (Bayes) error rate  b , we get a regret  r = e – b .  The  PECOC (Probabilistic Error Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regret  r  implies multiclass regret at most  4r 0.5  .
 
 The problem  This is not the “rightest” answer.  Consider the  k=2  case, where we reduce binary to binary.  There exists a reduction (the identity) with the property that regret  r  implies regret  r .  This is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which suggests that a better reduction may exist for general  k .  For example, we can not rule out the possibility that a reduction</p><p>4 0.25128528 <a title="243-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-15-The_Efficient_Robust_Conditional_Probability_Estimation_Problem.html">391 hunch net-2010-03-15-The Efficient Robust Conditional Probability Estimation Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m offering a reward of $1000 for a solution to this problem.  This joins the  cross validation problem  which I’m offering a  $500 reward  for.  I believe both of these problems are hard but plausibly solvable, and plausibly with a solution of substantial practical value.  While it’s unlikely these rewards are worth your time on an hourly wage basis, the recognition for solving them definitely should be   
  The Problem  
The problem is finding a general, robust, and efficient mechanism for estimating a conditional probability  P(y|x)  where robustness and efficiency are measured using techniques from learning reductions. 
 
In particular, suppose we have access to a binary regression oracle  B  which has two interfaces—one for specifying training information and one for testing. Training information is specified as  B(x’,y’)  where  x’  is a feature vector and  y’  is a scalar in  [0,1]  with no value returned.  Testing is done according to  B(x’)  with a value in  [0,1]  returned.</p><p>5 0.17593291 <a title="243-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-07-The_State_of_the_Reduction.html">14 hunch net-2005-02-07-The State of the Reduction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What?  Reductions are machines which turn solvers for one problem into solvers for another problem. 
 Why?  Reductions are useful for several reasons.
  
  Laziness .  Reducing a problem to classification make at least 10 learning algorithms available to solve a problem.  Inventing 10 learning algorithms is quite a bit of work.  Similarly, programming a reduction is often trivial, while programming a learning algorithm is a great deal of work. 
  Crystallization .  The problems we often want to solve in learning are worst-case-impossible, but average case feasible.  By reducing all problems onto one or a few primitives, we can fine tune these primitives to perform well on real-world problems with greater precision due to the greater number of problems to validate on. 
  Theoretical Organization .  By studying what reductions are easy vs. hard vs. impossible, we can learn which problems are roughly equivalent in difficulty and which are much harder.

<p>Introduction: This title is a lie, but it is a special lie which has a bit of truth.
 
If  n  players each play each other, you have a tournament.   How do you order the players from weakest to strongest?
 
The standard first attempt is “find the ordering which agrees with the tournament on as many player pairs as possible”.  This is called the “minimum feedback arcset” problem in the CS theory literature and it is a well known NP-hard problem.  A basic guarantee holds for the solution to this problem: if there is some “true” intrinsic ordering, and the outcome of the tournament disagrees  k  times (due to noise for instance), then the output ordering will disagree with the original ordering on at most  2k  edges (and no solution can be better).
 
One standard approach to tractably solving an NP-hard problem is to find another algorithm with an approximation guarantee.  For example,  Don Coppersmith ,  Lisa Fleischer  and  Atri Rudra  proved that  ordering players according to the number of wins is</p><p>5 0.71896899 <a title="243-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-07-The_State_of_the_Reduction.html">14 hunch net-2005-02-07-The State of the Reduction</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This  problem  has been cracked (but not quite completely solved) by  Alina ,  Pradeep , and  I .  The problem is essentially finding a better way to reduce multiclass classification to binary classification.  The solution is to use a carefully crafted tournament,  the simplest version of which is a  single elimination tournament  where the “players” are the different classes.  An example of the structure is here: 
    
For the single elimination tournament, we can prove that: 
 For all multiclass problems  D , for all learned binary classifiers  c , the regret of an induced multiclass classifier is bounded by the regret of the binary classifier times  log 2  k .  Restated:  
  reg multiclass (D,Filter_tree_test(c)) <= reg binary  (Filter_tree_train(D),c)    
Here:
  
   Filter_tree_train(D)  is the induced binary classification problem 
   Filter_tree_test(c)  is the induced multiclass classifier.

<p>Introduction: A substantial difficulty with the 2009 and 2008  ICML discussion system  was a communication vacuum, where authors were not informed of comments, and commenters were not informed of responses to their comments without explicit monitoring.   Mark Reid  has setup a  new discussion system for 2010  with the goal of addressing this.

<p>Introduction: I want to expand on  this post  which describes one of the core tricks for making  Vowpal Wabbit  fast and easy to use when learning from text.  
 
The central trick is converting a word (or any other parseable quantity) into a number via a hash function.   Kishore  tells me this is a relatively old trick in NLP land, but it has some added advantages when doing online learning, because you can learn directly from the existing data without preprocessing the data to create features (destroying the online property) or using an expensive hashtable lookup (slowing things down).
 
A central concern for this approach is collisions, which create a loss of information.  If you use  m  features in an index space of size  n  the birthday paradox suggests a collision if  m > n 0.5  , essentially because there are  m 2   pairs.   This is pretty bad, because it says that with a vocabulary of  10 5   features, you might need to have  10 10   entries in your table.
 
It turns out that redundancy is gr</p><p>4 0.79024631 <a title="243-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-08-Incompatibilities_between_classical_confidence_intervals_and_learning..html">213 hunch net-2006-10-08-Incompatibilities between classical confidence intervals and learning.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Classical confidence intervals satisfy a theorem of the form: For some data sources  D , 
  Pr S ~ D (f(D) > g(S)) > 1-d   
where  f  is some function of the distribution (such as the mean) and  g  is some function of the observed sample  S .   The constraints on  D  can vary between “Independent and identically distributed (IID) samples from a gaussian with an unknown mean” to “IID samples from an arbitrary distribution  D “.  There are even some confidence intervals which do not require IID samples.
 
Classical confidence intervals often confuse people.  They do  not  say “with high probability, for my observed sample, the bounds holds”.   Instead, they tell you that if you reason according to the confidence interval in the future (and the constraints on  D  are satisfied), then you are not often wrong.  Restated, they tell you something about what a safe procedure is in a stochastic world where  d  is the safety parameter.

<p>Introduction: This, again, is something of a research direction rather than a single problem.
 
There are several metrics people care about which depend upon the relative ranking of examples and there are sometimes good reasons to care about such metrics.  Examples include  AROC , “F1″, the proportion of the time that the top ranked element is in some class, the proportion of the top 10 examples in some class ( google ‘s problem),  the lowest ranked example of some class, and the “sort distance” from a predicted ranking to a correct ranking.  See  here  for an example of some of these.  
 
 Problem  What does the ability to classify well imply about performance under these metrics?
 
 Past Work 
  
  Probabilistic classification under squared error  can be solved with a classifier.  A counterexample shows this does not imply a good AROC. 
 Sample complexity bounds for  AROC  (and  here ).

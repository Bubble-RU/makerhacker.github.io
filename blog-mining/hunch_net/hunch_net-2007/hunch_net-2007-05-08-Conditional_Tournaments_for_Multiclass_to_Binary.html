<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.BackgroundA
reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there
arekpossible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2
possible labels. On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary
classifier with some error ratee. After subtracting the minimum possible
(Bayes) error rateb, we get a regretr = e - b. ThePECOC(Probabilistic Error
Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regretrimplies
multiclass regret at most4r0.5.The problemThis is not the "rightest" answer.
Consider thek=2case, where we reduce binary to binary. There exists a
reduction (the identity) with the property that regretrimplies regretr. This
is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which
suggests that a better reduction may exist for generalk. For example, we can
not rule out the possibility that a reductionRexists with regret transform

<p>Introduction: I'm offering a reward of $1000 for a solution to this problem. This joins
thecross validation problemwhich I'm offering a$500 rewardfor. I believe both
of these problems are hard but plausibly solvable, and plausibly with a
solution of substantial practical value. While it's unlikely these rewards are
worth your time on an hourly wage basis, the recognition for solving them
definitely should beThe ProblemThe problem is finding a general, robust, and
efficient mechanism for estimating a conditional probabilityP(y|x)where
robustness and efficiency are measured using techniques from learning
reductions.In particular, suppose we have access to a binary regression
oracleBwhich has two interfaces--one for specifying training information and
one for testing. Training information is specified asB(x',y')wherex'is a
feature vector andy'is a scalar in[0,1]with no value returned. Testing is done
according toB(x')with a value in[0,1]returned.A learning reduction consists of

<p>Introduction: This title is a lie, but it is a special lie which has a bit of
truth.Ifnplayers each play each other, you have a tournament. How do you order
the players from weakest to strongest?The standard first attempt is "find the
ordering which agrees with the tournament on as many player pairs as
possible". This is called the "minimum feedback arcset" problem in the CS
theory literature and it is a well known NP-hard problem. A basic guarantee
holds for the solution to this problem: if there is some "true" intrinsic
ordering, and the outcome of the tournament disagreesktimes (due to noise for
instance), then the output ordering will disagree with the original ordering
on at most2kedges (and no solution can be better).One standard approach to
tractably solving an NP-hard problem is to find another algorithm with an
approximation guarantee. For example,Don Coppersmith,Lisa FleischerandAtri

<p>Introduction: Forlearning reductionswe have been concentrating on reducing various complex
learning problems to binary classification. This choice needs to be actively
questioned, because it was not carefully considered.Binary clasification is
learning a classifierc:X -> {0,1}so as to minimize the probability of being
wrong,Prx,y~D(c(x)y).The primary alternative candidate seems to be squared
error regression. In squared error regression, you learn a regressors:X ->
[0,1]so as to minimize squared error,Ex,y~D(s(x)-y)2.It is difficult to judge
one primitive against another. The judgement must at least partially be made
on nontheoretical grounds because (essentially) we are evaluating a choice
between two axioms/assumptions.These two primitives are significantly related.
Classification can be reduced to regression in the obvious way: you use the
regressor to predictD(y=1|x), then threshold at0.5. For this simple reduction
a squared error regret ofrimplies a classification regret of at mostr0.5.

<p>Introduction: AlinaandJakepoint out the COLTCall for Open Questionsdue May 11. In general,
this is cool, and worth doing if you can come up with a crisp question. In my
case, I particularly enjoyedcrafting an open questionwith precisely a form
such that acritic targeting my paperswould be forced to confront their fallacy
or make a case for the reward. But less esoterically, this is a way to get the
attention of some very smart people focused on a problem that really matters,
which is the real value.</p><p>2 0.98651987 <a title="243-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-12-29-Simons_Institute_Big_Data_Program.html">476 hunch net-2012-12-29-Simons Institute Big Data Program</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael Jordansends the below:The newSimons Institute for the Theory of
Computingwill begin organizing semester-long programs starting in 2013.One of
our first programs, set for Fall 2013, will be on the "Theoretical
Foundationsof Big Data Analysis". The organizers of this program are Michael
Jordan (chair),Stephen Boyd, Peter Buehlmann, Ravi Kannan, Michael Mahoney,
and Muthu
Muthukrishnan.Seehttp://simons.berkeley.edu/program_bigdata2013.htmlfor more
information onthe program.The Simons Institute has created a number of
"Research Fellowships" for youngresearchers (within at most six years of the
award of their PhD) who wish toparticipate in Institute programs, including
the Big Data program. Individualswho already hold postdoctoral positions or
who are junior faculty are welcometo apply, as are finishing PhDs.Please note
that the application deadline is January 15, 2013. Further detailsare

<p>Introduction: Thisproblemhas been cracked (but not quite completely solved) byAlina,Pradeep,
andI. The problem is essentially finding a better way to reduce multiclass
classification to binary classification. The solution is to use a carefully
crafted tournament, the simplest version of which is asingle elimination
tournamentwhere the "players" are the different classes. An example of the
structure is here:For the single elimination tournament, we can prove that:For
all multiclass problemsD, for all learned binary classifiersc, the regret of
an induced multiclass classifier is bounded by the regret of the binary
classifier timeslog2k. Restated:regmulticlass(D,Filter_tree_test(c)) <=
regbinary(Filter_tree_train(D),c)Here:Filter_tree_train(D)is the induced
binary classification problemFilter_tree_test(c)is the induced multiclass
classifier.regmulticlassis the multiclass regret (= difference between error
rate and minimum possible error rate)regbinaryis the binary regretThis result

<p>Introduction: There was apresentation at snowbirdabout parallelized support vector machines.
In many cases, people parallelize by ignoring serial operations, but that is
not what happened here--they parallelize with optimizations. Consequently,
this seems to be the fastest SVM in existence.There is a relatedpaper here.</p><p>5 0.93392342 <a title="243-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-06-Branch_Prediction_Competition.html">190 hunch net-2006-07-06-Branch Prediction Competition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alan Fernpoints out thesecond branch prediction challenge(due September 29)
which is a follow up to thefirst branch prediction competition. Branch
prediction is one of the fundamental learning problems of the computer age:
without it our computers might run an order of magnitude slower. This is a
tough problem since there are sharp constraints on time and space complexity
in an online environment. For machine learning, the "idealistic track" may fit
well. Essentially, they remove these constraints to gain a weak upper bound on
what might be done.</p><p>6 0.91099948 <a title="243-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-12-13-Vowpal_Wabbit_version_6.1_%26%23038%3B_the_NIPS_tutorial.html">451 hunch net-2011-12-13-Vowpal Wabbit version 6.1 &#038; the NIPS tutorial</a></p>

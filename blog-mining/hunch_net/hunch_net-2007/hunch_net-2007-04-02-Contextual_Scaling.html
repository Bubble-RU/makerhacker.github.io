<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on thispostand some of the previousproblems/research
directionsabout where learning theory might make large strides.Why theory?The
essential reason for theory is "intuition extension". A very good applied
learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the
best computer algorithms for solving that problem. A very good theory can take
the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend
them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion. To do this, we take
these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:Explains the
basic intuitions.Makes new testable predictions about how to learn.Succeeds in
so learning.This is "intuition extension": taking what we have learned
somewhere else and applying it in new domains. It is fundamentally useful to
everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving
problems.Where next for learning theory?I like the analogy with physics. Back

<p>Introduction: I don't consider myself a "Bayesian", but I do try hard to understand why
Bayesian learning works. For the purposes of this post, Bayesian learning is a
simple process of:Specify a prior over world models.Integrate using Bayes law
with respect to all observed information to compute a posterior over world
models.Predict according to the posterior.Bayesian learning has many
advantages over other learning programs:InterpolationBayesian learning methods
interpolate all the way to pure engineering. When faced with any learning
problem, there is a choice of how much time and effort a human vs. a computer
puts in. (For example, the mars rover pathfinding algorithms are almost
entirely engineered.) When creating an engineered system, you build a model of
the world and then find a good controller in that model. Bayesian methods
interpolate to this extreme because the Bayesian prior can be a delta function
on one model of the world. What this means is that a recipe of "think harder"

<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is. The
viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models,
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etc… share
little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within
one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.There are
two fundamental reasons why this is possible.For many problems, many
approaches work in the sense that they do something useful. This is true
empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different
approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor. It's also
true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in
a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors
does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples.There
is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field. In many other areas
there are unifying p</p><p>6 0.14014839 <a title="237-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-24-A_Fundamentalist_Organization_of_Machine_Learning.html">158 hunch net-2006-02-24-A Fundamentalist Organization of Machine Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is about a confusion of mine with respect to many commonly used
machine learning algorithms.A simple example where this comes up is Bayes net
prediction. A Bayes net where a directed acyclic graph over a set of nodes
where each node is associated with a variable and the edges indicate
dependence. The joint probability distribution over the variables is given by
a set of conditional probabilities. For example, a very simple Bayes net might
express:P(A,B,C) = P(A | B,C)P(B)P(C)What I don't understand is the mechanism
commonly used to estimateP(A | B, C). If we letN(A,B,C)be the number of
instances ofA,B,Cthen people sometimes form an estimate according to:P'(A |
B,C) = N(A,B,C) / N /[N(B)/N * N(C)/N] = N(A,B,C) N /[N(B) N(C)]â&euro;Ś in other
words, people just estimateP'(A | B,C)according to observed relative
frequencies. This is a reasonable technique when you have a large number of
samples compared to the size spaceA x B x C, but it (naturally) falls apart
when this is not the case</p><p>3 0.75876635 <a title="237-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-06-Data_Linkage_Problems.html">217 hunch net-2006-11-06-Data Linkage Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Data linkage is a problem which seems to come up in various applied machine
learning problems. I have heard it mentioned in various data mining contexts,
but it seems relatively less studied for systemic reasons.A very simple
version of the data linkage problem is a cross hospital patient record merge.
Suppose a patient (John Doe) is admitted to a hospital (General Health),
treated, and released. Later, John Doe is admitted to a second hospital
(Health General), treated, and released. Given a large number of records of
this sort, it becomes very tempting to try and predict the outcomes of
treatments. This is reasonably straightforward as a machine learning problem
if there is a shared unique identifier for John Doe used by General Health and
Health General along with time stamps. We can merge the records and create
examples of the form "Given symptoms and treatment, did the patient come back
to a hospital within the next year?" These examples could be fed into a
learning algorithm, and</p><p>4 0.7292732 <a title="237-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-03-All_Models_of_Learning_have_Flaws.html">235 hunch net-2007-03-03-All Models of Learning have Flaws</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Suppose we have a set of observations over timex1,x2,…,xtand want to predict
some future eventyt+1. An inevitable problem arises, because learning a
predictorh(x1,…,xt)ofyt+1is generically intractable due to the size of the
input. To make this problem tractable, what's necessary is a method for
summarizing the relevant information in past observations for the purpose of
prediction in the future. In other words, state is required.Existing
approaches for deriving state have some limitations.Hidden Markov
modelslearned with EM suffer from local minima, use tabular learning
approaches which provide dubious generalization ability, and often require
substantial a.priori specification of the observations.Kalman
FiltersandParticle Filtersare very parametric in the sense that substantial
information must be specified up front.Dynamic Bayesian Networks (graphical

<p>Introduction: Machine learning has a new kind of "scaling to larger problems" to worry
about: scaling with the amount of contextual information. The standard
development path for a machine learning application in practice seems to be
the following:Marginal. In the beginning, there was "majority vote". At this
stage, it isn't necessary to understand that you have a prediction problem.
People just realize that one answer is right sometimes and another answer
other times. In machine learning terms, this corresponds to making a
prediction without side information.First context. A clever person realizes
that some bit of informationx1could be helpful. Ifx1is discrete, they
condition on it and make a predictorh(x1), typically by counting. If they are
clever, then they also do some smoothing. Ifx1is some real valued parameter,
it's very common to make a threshold cutoff. Often, these tasks are simply
done by hand.Second. Another clever person (or perhaps the same one) realizes

<p>Introduction: Steve Smaleand I have a debate about goals of learning theory.Steve likes
theorems with a dependence on unobservable quantities. For example, ifDis a
distribution over a spaceX x [0,1], you can state a theorem about the error
rate dependent on the variance,E(x,y)~D(y-Ey'~D|x[y'])2.I dislike this,
because I want to use the theorems to produce code solving learning problems.
Since I don't know (and can't measure) the variance, a theorem depending on
the variance does not help me--I would not know what variance to plug into the
learning algorithm.Recast more broadly, this is a debate between "declarative"
and "operative" mathematics. A strong example of "declarative" mathematics
is"a new kind of science". Roughly speaking, the goal of this kind of approach
seems to be finding a way to explain the observations we make. Examples
include "some things are unpredictable", "a phase transition exists",
etcâ&euro;Ś"Operative" mathematics helps you make predictions about the world. A

<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on thispostand some of the previousproblems/research
directionsabout where learning theory might make large strides.Why theory?The
essential reason for theory is "intuition extension". A very good applied
learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the
best computer algorithms for solving that problem. A very good theory can take
the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend
them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion. To do this, we take
these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:Explains the
basic intuitions.Makes new testable predictions about how to learn.Succeeds in
so learning.This is "intuition extension": taking what we have learned
somewhere else and applying it in new domains. It is fundamentally useful to
everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving
problems.Where next for learning theory?I like the analogy with physics. Back

<p>Introduction: Consider the contextual bandit setting where, repeatedly:A contextxis
observed.An actionais taken given the contextx.A rewardris observed, dependent
onxanda.Where the goal of a learning agent is to find a policy for step 2
achieving a large expected reward.This setting is of obvious importance,
because in the real world we typically make decisions based on some set of
information and then get feedback only about the single action taken. It also
fundamentally differs from supervised learning settings because knowing the
value of one action is not equivalent to knowing the value of all actions.A
decade ago the best machine learning techniques for this setting where
implausibly inefficient.Dean Fosteronce told me he thought the area was a
research sinkhole with little progress to be expected. Now we are on the verge
of being able to routinely attack these problems, in almost exactly the same
sense that we routinely attack bread and butter supervised learning problems.

<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given
framework or mathematical model. It turns out that all of these models are
significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning. I've
created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of
machine learning.The point here is not simply "woe unto us". There are several
implications which seem important.The multitude of models is a point of
continuing confusion. It is common for people to learn about machine learning
within one framework which often becomes there "home framework" through which
they attempt to filter all machine learning. (Have you met people who can only
think in terms of kernels? Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)
Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help
resolve the confusion. This is particularly important when reviewing and
particularly important for students.Algorithms which conform to multiple
approaches can have substantial</p><p>6 0.8774749 <a title="237-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-18-Necessary_and_Sufficient_Research.html">370 hunch net-2009-09-18-Necessary and Sufficient Research</a></p>

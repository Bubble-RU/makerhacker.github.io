<p>Introduction: Machine learning algorithms have a much better chance of being widely adopted
if they are implemented in some easy-to-use code. There are several important
concerns associated with machine learning which stress programming languages
on the ease-of-use vs. speed frontier.SpeedThe rate at which data sources are
growing seems to be outstripping the rate at which computational power is
growing, so it is important that we be able to eak out every bit of
computational power. Garbage collected languages (java,ocaml,perlandpython)
often have several issues here.Garbage collection often implies that floating
point numbers are "boxed": every float is represented by a pointer to a float.
Boxing can cause an order of magnitude slowdown because an extra nonlocalized
memory reference is made, and accesses to main memory can are many CPU cycles
long.Garbage collection often implies that considerably more memory is used
than is necessary. This has a variable effect. In some circumstances it
results in</p><p>3 0.15615465 <a title="262-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-31-Vowpal_Wabbit_Open_Source_Project.html">365 hunch net-2009-07-31-Vowpal Wabbit Open Source Project</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Today brings a new release of theVowpal Wabbitfast online learning software.
This time, unlike the previous release, the project itself is going open
source, developing viagithub. For example, the lastest and greatest can be
downloaded via:git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.gitIf you
aren't familiar withgit, it's a distributed version control system which
supports quick and easy branching, as well as reconciliation.This version of
the code is confirmed to compile without complaint on at least some flavors of
OSX as well as Linux boxes.As much of the point of this project is pushing the
limits of fast and effective machine learning, let me mention a few datapoints
from my experience.The program can effectively scale up to batch-style
training on sparse terafeature (i.e. 1012sparse feature) size datasets. The
limiting factor is typically i/o.I started using the the real datasets from
thelarge-scale learningworkshop as a convenient benchmark. The largest dataset

<p>Introduction: There area handful of basic code patternsthat I wish I was more aware of when
I started research in machine learning. Each on its own may seem pointless,
but collectively they go a long way towards making the typical research
workflow more efficient. Here they are:Separate code from data.Separate input
data, working data and output data.Save everything to disk frequently.Separate
options from parameters.Do not use global variables.Record the options used to
generate each run of the algorithm.Make it easy to sweep options.Make it easy
to execute only portions of the code.Use checkpointing.Write demos and
tests.Clickherefor discussion and examples for each item. Also seeCharles
Sutton'sandHackerNews'thoughts on the same topic.My guess is that these
patterns will not only be useful for machine learning, but also any other
computational work that involves either a) processing large amounts of data,
or b) algorithms that take a significant amount of time to execute. Share this
list with you</p><p>5 0.12760866 <a title="262-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-12-02-Hadoop_AllReduce_and_Terascale_Learning.html">450 hunch net-2011-12-02-Hadoop AllReduce and Terascale Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Suppose you have a dataset with 2 terafeatures (we only count nonzero entries
in a datamatrix), and want to learn a good linear predictor in a reasonable
amount of time. How do you do it? As a learning theorist, the first thing you
do is pray that this is too much data for the number of parameters--but that's
not the case, there are around 16 billion examples, 16 million parameters, and
people really care about a high quality predictor, so subsampling is not a
good strategy.Alekhvisited us last summer, and we had a breakthrough
(seeherefor details), coming up with the first learning algorithm I've seen
that is provably faster thanany futuresingle machine learning algorithm. The
proof of this is simple: We can output a optimal-up-to-precision linear
predictor faster than the data can be streamed through the network interface
of any single machine involved in the computation.It is necessary but not
sufficient to have an effective communication infrastructure. It is necessary

<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied
machine learning using current technology. We just built a small one at TTI so
this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design
choices.ArchitectureThere are several architectural choices.AMD Athlon64 based
system. This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck. Maximum RAM is typically
2-3GB.AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to
buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB
of RAM. The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type.Intel PIV or
Xeon based system. The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the
above 2. Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit
hotter and be a bit more expensive.Dual core chips. Both Intel and AMD have
chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them.In the end, we decided
to go with option (2). Roughly speaking, the AMD system seemed like a bet</p><p>5 0.72438157 <a title="262-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-30-Concerns_about_the_Large_Scale_Learning_Challenge.html">300 hunch net-2008-04-30-Concerns about the Large Scale Learning Challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thelarge scale learning challengefor ICML interests me a great deal, although
I have concerns about the way it is structured.From theinstructions page,
several issues come up:Large DefinitionMy personal definition of dataset size
is:smallA dataset is small if a human could look at the dataset and plausibly
find a good solution.mediumA dataset is mediumsize if it fits in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.largeA large dataset does not fit in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.By this definition, all of the datasets are medium
sized. This might sound like a pissing match over dataset size, but I believe
it is more than that.The fundamental reason for these definitions is that they
correspond to transitions in the sorts of approaches which are feasible. From
small to medium, the ability to use a human as the learning algorithm
degrades. From medium to large, it becomes essential to have learning
algorithms that don't require random access to examples.No Loading TimeThe

<p>Introduction: Larry Jackal has set up theLAGR("Learning Applied to Ground Robotics") project
(and competition) which seems to be quite well designed. Features include:Many
participants (8 going on 12?)Standardized hardware. In theDARPA grand
challengecontestants entering with motorcycles are at a severe disadvantage to
those entering with a Hummer. Similarly, contestants using more powerful
sensors can gain huge advantages.Monthly contests, with full feedback (but
since the hardware is standardized, only code is shipped). One of the premises
of the program is that robust systems are desired. Monthly evaluations at
different locations can help measure this and provide data.Attacks a known
hard problem. (cross country driving)</p><p>2 0.92984635 <a title="262-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-14-Families_of_Learning_Theory_Statements.html">56 hunch net-2005-04-14-Families of Learning Theory Statements</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Virtually every discipline of significant human endeavor has a way explaining
itself as fundamental and important. In all the cases I know of, they are both
right (they are vital) and wrong (they are not solely vital).Politics. This is
the one that everyone is familiar with at the moment. "What could be more
important than the process of making decisions?"Science and Technology. This
is the one that we-the-academics are familiar with. "The loss of modern
science and technology would be catastrophic."Military. "Without the military,
a nation will be invaded and destroyed."(insert your favorite here)Within
science and technology, the same thing happens again.Mathematics. "What could
be more important than a precise language for establishing truths?"Physics.
"Nothing is more fundamental than the laws which govern the universe.
Understanding them is the key to understanding everything else."Biology.
"Without life, we wouldn't be here, so clearly the study of life is
fundamental."Computer S</p><p>same-blog 4 0.90545398 <a title="262-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-16-Optimizing_Machine_Learning_Programs.html">262 hunch net-2007-09-16-Optimizing Machine Learning Programs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning is often computationally bounded which implies that the
ability to write fast code becomes important if you ever want to implement a
machine learning algorithm. Basic tactical optimizations are covered
wellelsewhere, but I haven't seen a reasonable guide to higher level
optimizations, which are the most important in my experience. Here are some of
the higher level optimizations I've often found useful.Algorithmic Improvement
First. This is Hard, but it is the most important consideration, and typically
yields the most benefits. Good optimizations here are publishable. In the
context of machine learning, you should be familiar with the arguments for
online vs. batch learning.Choice of Language. There are many arguments about
thechoice of language. Sometimes you don't have a choice when interfacing with
other people. Personally, I favor C/C++ when I want to write fast code. This
(admittedly) makes me a slower programmer than when using higher level
languages. (Sometimes</p><p>5 0.88173622 <a title="262-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-17-A_Short_Guide_to_PhD_Graduate_Study.html">73 hunch net-2005-05-17-A Short Guide to PhD Graduate Study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Graduate study is a mysterious and uncertain process. This easiest way to see
this is by noting that a very old advisor/student mechanism is preferred.
There is no known succesful mechanism for "mass producing" PhDs as is done (in
some sense) for undergraduate and masters study. Here are a few hints that
might be useful to prospective or current students based on my own
experience.Masters or PhD(a) You want a PhD if you want to do research. (b)
You want a masters if you want to make money. People wanting (b) will be
manifestly unhappy with (a) because it typically means years of low pay.
People wanting (a) should try to avoid (b) because it prolongs an already long
process.Attitude.Manystudents struggle for awhile with the wrong attitude
towards research. Most students come into graduate school with 16-19 years of
schooling where the principle means of success is proving that you know
something via assignments, tests, etcâ&euro;Ś Research doesnotwork this way. Research
is what a PhD is about.</p><p>6 0.85378331 <a title="262-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-03-Carbon_in_Computer_Science_Research.html">366 hunch net-2009-08-03-Carbon in Computer Science Research</a></p>

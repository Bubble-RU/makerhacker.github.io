<p>Introduction: ByShieandNatiFollowing John's advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought
it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is
often the best place for theory papers. We would like to emphasize that we
both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs,
and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers. For
many papers, ICML is the best venue. But for many theory papers, COLT is a
better and more appropriate place.Why should you submit to COLT?By-and-large,
theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory
papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking
theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT
is more focused then ICML with a single track session. Unlike ICML, the norm
in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks
presented. There is also often a lively discussion following paper

few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other

<p>Introduction: For about 5 years, I've been the treasurer of the Association for
Computational Learning, otherwise known as COLT, taking over fromJohn
Casebefore me. A transfer of duties toPhil Longis now about complete. This
probably matters to almost no one, but I wanted to describe things a bit for
those interested.The immediate impetus for this decision was unhappiness over
reviewing decisions atCOLT 2009, one as an author and several as a member of
the program committee. I seem to have disagreements fairly often about what is
important work, partly because I'm focused on learning theory with practical
implications, partly because I define learning theory more broadly than is
typical amongst COLT members, and partly because COLT suffers a bit from
insider-clique issues. The degree to which these issues come up varies
substantially each year so last year is not predictive of this one. And, it's
important to understand that COLT remains healthy with these issues not nearly
so bad asthey were. Never</p><p>3 0.61391699 <a title="242-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-05-04-COLT_and_ICML_registration.html">482 hunch net-2013-05-04-COLT and ICML registration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeckpoints outCOLTregistrationwith a May 13 early registration
deadline. The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs
with a $300 registration fee.ICMLregistrationis also available, at about an x3
higher cost. My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a
larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as
long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference
organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>4 0.52923024 <a title="242-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-04-The_Health_of_COLT.html">89 hunch net-2005-07-04-The Health of COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The health ofCOLT(Conference on Learning Theory or Computational Learning
Theory depending on who you ask) has been questioned over the last few years.
Low points for the conference occurred whenEuroCOLTmerged with COLT in 2001,
and the attendance at the 2002 Sydney COLT fell to a new low. This occurred in
the general context of machine learning conferences rising in both number and
size over the last decade.Any discussion ofwhyCOLT has had difficulties is
inherently controversial as is any story about well-intentioned people making
the wrong decisions. Nevertheless, this may be worth discussing in the hope of
avoiding problems in the future and general understanding. In any such
discussion there is a strong tendency to identify with a conference/community
in a patriotic manner that is detrimental to thinking. Keep in mind that
conferences exist to further research.My understanding (I wasn't around) is
that COLT started as a subcommunity of the computer science theory community.

<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are
coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.It's entirely reasonable for
anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don't have a paper. For
students, visiting a conference is almost a 'must'--there is no where else
that a broad cross-section of research is on display.Workshops are also a very
good idea.ICML has 11,KDD has 9, andAAAI has 19. Workshops provide an
opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research. They
are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research
because they are so interactive.Tutorials are a good way to gain some
understanding of a long-standing direction of research. They are generally
more coherent than workshops.ICML has 7andAAAI has 15.</p><p>6 0.49758449 <a title="242-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-09-A_Healthy__COLT.html">324 hunch net-2008-11-09-A Healthy  COLT</a></p>

coverage.A formal winner hasn't been declared yet although Stanford completed
the course quickest.The Stanford and CMU teams deserve a large round of

<p>Introduction: Registration for COLT 2007 is now open.The conference will take place on 13-15
June, 2007, in San Diego, California, as part of the 2007 Federated Computing
Research Conference (FCRC), which includes STOC, Complexity, and EC.The
website for COLT: http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2007/index.htmlThe early
registration deadline is May 11, and the cutoff date for discounted hotel
rates is May 9.Before registering, take note that the fees are substantially
lower for members of ACM and/or SIGACT than for nonmembers. If you've been
contemplating joining either of these two societies (annual dues: $99 for ACM,
$18 for SIGACT), now would be a good time!</p><p>5 0.85764438 <a title="242-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-24-Alex_Smola_starts_a_blog.html">408 hunch net-2010-08-24-Alex Smola starts a blog</a></p>

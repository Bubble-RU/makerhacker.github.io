<p>Introduction: For about 5 years, I’ve been the treasurer of the Association for Computational Learning, otherwise known as COLT, taking over from  John Case  before me.  A transfer of duties to  Phil Long  is now about complete.  This probably matters to almost no one, but I wanted to describe things a bit for those interested.
 
The immediate impetus for this decision was unhappiness over reviewing decisions at  COLT 2009 , one as an author and several as a member of the program committee.  I seem to have disagreements fairly often about what is important work, partly because I’m focused on learning theory with practical implications, partly because I define learning theory more broadly than is typical amongst COLT members, and partly because COLT suffers a bit from insider-clique issues.  The degree to which these issues come up varies substantially each year so last year is not predictive of this one.  And, it’s important to understand that COLT remains healthy with these issues not nearly so bad</p><p>5 0.5624088 <a title="242-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-29-To_Vidoelecture_or_not.html">416 hunch net-2010-10-29-To Vidoelecture or not</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (update:  cross-posted  on  CACM )
 
For the first time in several years,  ICML 2010  did not have  videolectures  attending.  Luckily, the  tutorial on exploration and learning  which  Alina  and I put together can  be viewed , since we also presented at  KDD 2010 , which included videolecture support. 
 
ICML didn’t cover the cost of a videolecture, because  PASCAL  didn’t provide a grant for it this year.  On the other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs.  The cost of videolectures isn’t cheap.  For  a workshop  the baseline quote we have is 270 euro per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman’s travel and accomodation.  This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a quoted 216 euro per hour.
 
 Youtube  is the most predominant free video site with a cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.   15 minute upload limits  do not match typical talk lengths.</p><p>6 0.513192 <a title="242-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-09-A_Healthy__COLT.html">324 hunch net-2008-11-09-A Healthy  COLT</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’m visiting Beijing for the  Pao-Lu Hsu Statistics Conference  on Machine Learning.
 
I had several discussions about the state of Chinese research.  Given the large population and economy, you might expect substantial research—more than has been observed at international conferences.  The fundamental problem seems to be the  Cultural Revolution  which  lobotimized higher education, and the research associated with it.  There has been a process of slow recovery since then, which has begun to be felt in the research world via increased participation in international conferences and (now) conferences in China.
 
The amount of effort going into construction in Beijing is very impressive—people are literally building a skyscraper at night outside the window of the hotel I’m staying at (and this is not unusual).  If a small fraction of this effort is later focused onto supporting research, the effect could be very substantial.  General growth in China’s research portfolio should be expecte</p><p>3 0.69547737 <a title="242-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-02-2006_NIPS_workshops.html">216 hunch net-2006-11-02-2006 NIPS workshops</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is a (near) transcript of a talk that I gave at the  ICML 2013 Workshop on Peer Review and Publishing Models . Although there’s a  PDF available on my website , I’ve chosen to post a slightly modified version here as well in order to better facilitate discussion.
 
 Disclaimers and Context 
 
I want to start with a couple of disclaimers and some context.
 
First, I want to point out that although I’ve read a lot about double-blind review, this isn’t my research area and the research discussed in this post is not my own. As a result, I probably can’t answer super detailed questions about these studies.
 
I also want to note that I’m not opposed to open peer review — I was a free and open source software developer for over ten years and I care a great deal about openness and transparency. Rather, my motivation in writing this post is simply to create awareness of and to initiate discussion about the benefits of double-blind review.
 
Lastly, and most importantly, I think it’s e</p><p>5 0.51829052 <a title="242-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-06-Research_Political_Issues.html">282 hunch net-2008-01-06-Research Political Issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest.  The problem with discussing politics is that it’s customary for people to say much based upon little information.  Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa).  It’s primary election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the issues are not.
 
There are several policy decisions which substantially effect development of science and technology in the US.
  
  Education  The US has great contrasts in education.  The top universities are very good places, yet the grade school education system produces mediocre results.  For me, the contrast between a  public education  and  Caltech  was bracing.  For many others attending Caltech, it clearly was not.  Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about.  My own experience is that a basic attitude of “no child unrealized” i</p><p>6 0.48751473 <a title="242-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-04-The_Health_of_COLT.html">89 hunch net-2005-07-04-The Health of COLT</a></p>

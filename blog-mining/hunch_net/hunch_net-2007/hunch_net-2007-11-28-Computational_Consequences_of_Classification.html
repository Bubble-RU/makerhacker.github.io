<p>Introduction: For  learning reductions  we have been concentrating on reducing various complex learning problems to binary classification.  This choice needs to be actively questioned, because it was not carefully considered.
 
Binary clasification is learning a classifier  c:X -> {0,1}  so as to minimize the probability of being wrong,  Pr x,y~D (c(x)   y)  .
 
The primary alternative candidate seems to be squared error regression.  In squared error regression, you learn a regressor  s:X -> [0,1]  so as to minimize squared error,  E x,y~D  (s(x)-y) 2  .
 
It is difficult to judge one primitive against another.  The judgement must at least partially be made on nontheoretical grounds because (essentially) we are evaluating a choice between two axioms/assumptions.
 
These two primitives are significantly related.  Classification can be reduced to regression in the obvious way: you use the regressor to predict  D(y=1|x) , then threshold at  0.5 .   For this simple reduction a squared error regret of  r</p><p>3 0.38712731 <a title="274-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-04-Optimal_Proxy_Loss_for_Classification.html">341 hunch net-2009-02-04-Optimal Proxy Loss for Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in machine learning take advantage of the notion of a proxy loss: A loss function which is much easier to optimize computationally than the loss function imposed by the world.  A canonical example is when we want to learn a weight vector  w  and predict according to a dot product  f w (x)= sum i  w i x i   
where optimizing squared loss  (y-f w (x)) 2   over many samples is much more tractable than optimizing 0-1 loss  I(y = Threshold(f w (x) – 0.5)) .
 
While the computational advantages of optimizing a proxy loss are substantial, we are curious: which proxy loss is best?  The answer of course depends on what the real loss imposed by the world is.  For 0-1 loss classification, there are adherents to many choices:
  
 Log loss.  If we confine the prediction to  [0,1] , we can treat it as a predicted probability that the label is  1 , and measure loss according to  log 1/p’(y|x)  where  p’(y|x)  is the predicted probability of the observed label.  A standard method for confi</p><p>4 0.35988873 <a title="274-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-01-Watchword%3A_Loss.html">9 hunch net-2005-02-01-Watchword: Loss</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A loss function is some function which, for any example, takes a prediction and the correct prediction, and determines how much loss is incurred.  (People sometimes attempt to optimize functions of more than one example such as “area under the ROC curve” or “harmonic mean of precision and recall”.)  Typically we try to find predictors that minimize loss.  
 
There seems to be a strong dichotomy between two views of what “loss” means in learning.
  
  Loss is determined by the problem.  Loss is a part of the specification of the learning problem.  Examples of problems specified by the loss function include “binary classification”, “multiclass classification”, “importance weighted classification”, “l 2  regression”, etc…  This is the decision theory view of what loss means, and the view that I prefer. 
  Loss is determined by the solution.  To solve a problem, you optimize some particular loss function  not  given by the problem.  Examples of these loss functions are “hinge loss” (for SV</p><p>5 0.3286587 <a title="274-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-05-12-Loss_Function_Semantics.html">245 hunch net-2007-05-12-Loss Function Semantics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some loss functions have a meaning, which can be understood in a manner independent of the loss function itself.  
  
 Optimizing squared loss  l sq (y,y’)=(y-y’) 2   means predicting the (conditional) mean of  y . 
 Optimizing absolute value loss  l av (y,y’)=|y-y’|  means predicting the (conditional) median of  y .  Variants can  handle other quantiles .  0/1 loss for classification is a special case. 
 Optimizing log loss  l log (y,y’)=log (1/Pr z~y’ (z=y))  means minimizing the description length of  y . 
  
The semantics (= meaning) of the loss are made explicit by a theorem in each case.  For squared loss, we can prove a theorem of the form: 
For all distributions  D  over  Y , if    y’ = arg min y’  E y ~ D  l sq  (y,y’)   then   y’ = E y~D  y  
 
Similar theorems hold for the other examples above, and they can all be extended to predictors of  y’  for distributions  D  over a context  X  and a value  Y .

<p>Introduction: How do we judge success in Machine Learning?  As  Aaron   notes , the best way is to use the loss imposed on you by the world.  This turns out to be infeasible sometimes for various reasons.  The ones I’ve seen are:
  
 The learned prediction is used in some complicated process that does not give the feedback necessary to understand the prediction’s impact on the loss.  
 The prediction is used by some other system which expects some semantics to the predicted value.  This is similar to the previous example, except that the issue is design modularity rather than engineering modularity. 
 The correct loss function is simply unknown (and perhaps unknowable, except by experimentation). 
  
In these situations, it’s unclear what metric for evaluation should be chosen.  This post has some design advice for this murkier case.  I’m using the word “metric” here to distinguish the fact that we are considering methods for  evaluating  predictive systems rather than a loss imposed by the real wor</p><p>6 0.80188662 <a title="274-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-13-Regression_vs._Classification_as_a_Primitive.html">196 hunch net-2006-07-13-Regression vs. Classification as a Primitive</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the  regression vs classification debate , I’m adding a new “pro” to classification.  It seems there are computational shortcuts available for classification which simply aren’t available for regression.  This arises in several situations.
  
 In  active learning  it is sometimes possible to find an  e  error classifier with just  log(e)  labeled samples.    Only much more modest improvements appear to be achievable for squared loss regression.  The essential reason is that the loss function on many examples is flat with respect to large variations in the parameter spaces of a learned classifier, which implies that many of these classifiers do not need to be considered.  In contrast, for squared loss regression, most substantial variations in the parameter space influence the loss at most points. 
 In budgeted learning, where there is either a computational time constraint or a feature cost constraint, a classifier can sometimes be learned to very high accuracy under the constraints</p><p>2 0.99964017 <a title="274-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-24-NLPers.html">166 hunch net-2006-03-24-NLPers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are two papers that seem particularly interesting at this year’s COLT.
  
  Gilles Blanchard  and  FranÃƒÂ§ois Fleuret ,  Occam’s Hammer .  When we are interested in very tight bounds on the true error rate of a classifier, it is tempting to use a PAC-Bayes bound which can (empirically) be  quite tight .  A disadvantage of the PAC-Bayes bound is that it applies to a classifier which is randomized over a set of base classifiers rather than a single classifier.  This paper shows that a similar bound can be proved which holds for a single classifier drawn from the set.   The ability to safely use a single classifier is very nice.  This technique applies generically to any base bound, so it has other applications covered in the paper.

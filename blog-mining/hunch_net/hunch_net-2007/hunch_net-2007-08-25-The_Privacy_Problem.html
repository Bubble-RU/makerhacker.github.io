</p><p>4 If 10 terms appear with known relative frequencies in public data, then finding 10 terms encrypted terms with the same relative frequencies might give you very good evidence for what these terms are. [sent-13, score-0.994]
</p><p>5 Many internet companies run off of advertising so eliminating the ability to do targeted advertising will eliminate the ability of these companies to exist. [sent-18, score-0.496]
</p><p>6 However, this is not simply an interest burst--the long term trend of increasing data collection implies this problem will repeatedly come up over the indefinite future. [sent-26, score-0.5]

</p><p>8 The cultural norm privacy problem is sometimes solvable by creating an opt-in or opt-out protocol. [sent-36, score-0.742]

</p><p>10 At some point, we may end up with cameras and storage devices so small, cheap, and portable that forbidding their use is essentially absurd. [sent-49, score-0.399]
</p><p>11 For example, a reasonable argument can be made that the British were effective at tracking bomb planters because the cameras of London helped them sourceattacks. [sent-51, score-0.399]

</p><p>13 Recordings from these cameras can often settle disputes very definitively. [sent-55, score-0.399]
</p><p>14 As technology improves, it's reasonable to expect cameras just about anywhere people are in public. [sent-56, score-0.455]
</p><p>15 Some legislation and good engineering could make these cameras available to anyone. [sent-57, score-0.499]
</p><p>16 This directly collides with the "privacy as a cultural norm" privacy problem. [sent-59, score-0.545]
</p><p>17 The hardness of the privacy problem mentioned at the post beginning implies difficult tradeoffs. [sent-60, score-0.503]
</p><p>18 If you have cultural norm privacy concerns, then you really don't appreciate method (3) for power balance privacy concerns. [sent-61, score-1.352]
</p><p>19 If you value privacy greatly and the default action is taken, then you prefer monopolistic marketplaces. [sent-62, score-0.442]

<p>Introduction: There were several papers that seemed fairly interesting atKDD this year. The
ones that caught my attention are:Xin Jin, Mingyang Zhang,Nan Zhang, andGautam
Das,Versatile Publishing For Privacy Preservation. This paper provides a
conservative method for safely determining which data is publishable from any
complete source of information (for example, a hospital) such that it does not
violate privacy rules in a natural language. It is not differentially private,
so no external sources of join information can exist. However, it is a
mechanism forpublishingdata rather than (say) the output of a learning
algorithm.Arik FriedmanAssaf Schuster,Data Mining with Differential Privacy.
This paper shows how to create effective differentially private decision
trees. Progress in differentially private datamining is pretty impressive, as
it wasdefined in 2006.David Chan, Rong Ge, Ori Gershony,Tim Hesterberg,Diane

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example

<p>Introduction: The Second Annual Reinforcement Learning Competition is about to get started.
The aim of the competition is to facilitate direct comparisons between various
learning methods on important and realistic domains. This year's event will
feature well-known benchmark domains as well as more challenging problems of
real-world complexity, such as helicopter control and robot soccer
keepaway.The competition begins on November 1st, 2007 when training software
is released. Results must be submitted by July 1st, 2008. The competition will
culminate in an event at ICML-08 in Helsinki, Finland, at which the winners
will be announced.For more information, visitthe competition website.</p><p>2 0.90907782 <a title="260-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-11-Interesting_papers_at_KDD.html">364 hunch net-2009-07-11-Interesting papers at KDD</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I attendedKDDthis year. The conference has always had a strong grounding in
what works based on theKDDcup, but it has developed a halo of workshops on
various subjects. It seems that KDD has become a place where the economy meets
machine learning in a stronger sense than many other conferences.There were
several papers that other people might like to take a look at.Yehuda
KorenCollaborative Filtering with Temporal Dynamics. This paper describes how
to incorporate temporal dynamics into a couple of collaborative filtering
approaches. This was also a best paper award.D. Sculley, Robert Malkin,Sugato
Basu,Roberto J. Bayardo,Predicting Bounce Rates in Sponsored Search

immediately leave ("bounce") after clicking on an advertisement is

<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is rising in importance because data is being collected for
all sorts of tasks where it either wasn't previously collected, or for tasks
that did not previously exist. While this is great for Machine Learning, it
has a downside--the massive data collection which is so useful can also lead
to substantial privacy problems.It's important to understand that this is a
much harder problem than many people appreciate. TheAOLdatareleaseis a good
example. To those doing machine learning, the following strategies might be
obvious:Just delete any names or other obviously personally identifiable
information. The logic here seems to be "if I can't easily find the person
then no one can". That doesn't work as demonstrated by the people who were
found circumstantially from the AOL data.… then just hash all the search
terms! The logic here is "if I can't read it, then no one can". It's also
trivially broken by a dictionary attack--just hash all the strings that might
be in the data an</p><p>4 0.75259006 <a title="260-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-27-Gradients_everywhere.html">167 hunch net-2006-03-27-Gradients everywhere</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the basic observations from theatomic learning workshopis that
gradient-based optimization is pervasive. For example, at least 7 (of 12)
speakers used the word 'gradient' in their talk and several others may be
approximating a gradient. The essential useful quality of a gradient is that
it decouples local updates from global optimization. Restated: Given a
gradient, we can determine how to change individual parameters of the system
so as to improve overall performance.It's easy to feel depressed about this
and think "nothing has happened", but that appears untrue. Many of the talks
were about clever techniques for computing gradients where your calculus
textbook breaks down.Sometimes there are clever approximations of the
gradient. (Simon Osindero)Sometimes we can compute constrained gradients via
iterated gradient/project steps. (Ben Taskar)Sometimes we can compute
gradients anyways over mildly nondifferentiable functions. (Drew Bagnell)Even
given a gradient, the choice of upda</p><p>5 0.63688552 <a title="260-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT
ResearchandLucenthad one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the
remainder ofBell Labs, triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine
learning group there. As the recession progresses, we may easily see more
firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer
support research.There are a couple positives to the recession as well.Both
the implosion of Wall Street (which siphoned off smart people) and the general
difficulty of getting a job coming out of an undergraduate education suggest
that the quality of admitted phd</p><p>6 0.63305932 <a title="260-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

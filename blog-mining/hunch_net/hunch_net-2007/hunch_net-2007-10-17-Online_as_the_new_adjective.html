<p>Introduction: If you search for "online learning" with anymajorsearchengine, it's
interesting to note that zero of the results are for online machine learning.
This may not be a mistake if you are committed to a global ordering. In other
words, the number of people specifically interested in the least interesting
top-10 online human learning result might exceed the number of people
interested in online machine learning, even given the presence of the other 9
results. The essential observation here is that the process of human learning
is a big business (around 5% of GDP) effecting virtually everyone.The internet
is changing this dramatically, by altering the economics of teaching. Consider
two possibilities:The classroom-style teaching environment continues as is,
with many teachers for the same subject.All the teachers for one subject get
together, along with perhaps a factor of 2 more people who are experts in
online delivery. They spend a factor of 4 more time designing the perfect

<p>Introduction: Here are a few of the papers I enjoyed at ICML.Steffen Bickel, Michael
BrÃƒÂ¼eckner,Tobias Scheffer,Discriminative Learning for Differing Training
and Test DistributionsThere is a nice trick in this paper: they predict the
probability that an unlabeled sample is in the training set vs. the test set,
and then use this prediction to importance weight labeled samples in the
training set. This paper uses a specific parametric model, but the approach is
easily generalized.Steve HannekeA Bound on the Label Complexity of Agnostic
Active LearningThis paper bounds the number of labels required by the
A2algorithm for active learning in the agnostic case. Last year we figured out
agnostic active learning was possible. This year, it's quantified. Hopefull
soon, it will be practical.Sylvian Gelly,David SilverCombining Online and

<p>Introduction: I've releasedversion 5.0of theVowpal Wabbitonline learning software. The major
number has changed since thelast releasebecause I regard all earlier versions
as obsolete--there are several new algorithms & features including substantial
changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.The biggest changes are
new algorithms:Nikosand I improved the default algorithm. The basic update
rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully
controlled so that it's impossible to overrun the label. In addition, the
normalization has changed. Computationally, these changes are virtually free
and yield better results, sometimes much better. Less careful updates can be
reenabled with -loss_function classic, although results are still not
identical to previous due to normalization changes.Nikos also implemented the
per-feature learning rates as per thesetwopapers. Often, this works better
than the default algorithm. It isn't the default because it isn't (yet) as
adaptable</p><p>5 0.12919192 <a title="267-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-12-13-Vowpal_Wabbit_version_6.1_%26%23038%3B_the_NIPS_tutorial.html">451 hunch net-2011-12-13-Vowpal Wabbit version 6.1 &#038; the NIPS tutorial</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just madeversion 6.1ofVowpal Wabbit. Relative to6.0, there are few new
features, but many refinements.The cluster parallel learning code better
supports multiple simultaneous runs, and other forms of parallelism have been
mostly removed. This incidentally significantly simplifies the learning
core.The online learning algorithms are more general, with support for l1(via
a truncated gradient variant) and l2regularization, and a generalized form of
variable metric learning.There is a solid persistent server mode which can
train online, as well as serve answers to many simultaneous queries, either in
text or binary.This should be a very good release if you are just getting
started, as we've made it compile more automatically out of the box, have
several newexamplesand updated documentation.Aspertradition, we're planning to
do a tutorial at NIPS during the break at theparallel learning workshopat 2pm
Spanish time Friday. I'll cover the basics, leaving the fun stuff for
others.Mirowill cov</p><p>6 0.12847894 <a title="267-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated_Gradient.html">258 hunch net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>

<p>Introduction: YoramandShai'sonline learning tutorialatICMLbrings up a question for me, "Why
use thedual?"The basic setting is learning a weight vectorwiso that the
functionf(x)= sumiwixioptimizes some convex loss function.The functional view
of the dual is that instead of (or in addition to) keeping track ofwiover the
feature space, you keep track of a vectorajover the examples and definewi=
sumjajxji.The above view of duality makes operating in the dual appear
unnecessary, because in the end a weight vector is always used. The tutorial
suggests that thinking about the dual gives a unified algorithmic font for
deriving online learning algorithms. I haven't worked with the dual
representation much myself, but I have seen a few examples where it appears
helpful.NoiseWhen doing online optimization (i.e. online learning where you
are allowed to look at individual examples multiple times), the dual
representation may be helpful in dealing with noisy labels.RatesOne annoyance

<p>Introduction: Several papers at NIPS caught my attention.Elad HazanandSatyen Kale,Online
Submodular OptimizationThey define an algorithm for online optimization of
submodular functions with regret guarantees. This places submodular
optimization roughly on par with online convex optimization as tractable
settings for online learning.Elad HazanandSatyen KaleOn Stochastic and Worst-
Case Models of Investing. At it's core, this is yet another example of
modifying worst-case online learning to deal with variance, but the
application to financial models is particularly cool and it seems plausibly
superior other common approaches for financial modeling.Mark Palatucci,Dean
Pomerlau,Tom Mitchell, andGeoff HintonZero Shot Learning with Semantic Output
CodesThe goal here is predicting a label in a multiclass supervised setting
where the label never occurs in the training data. They have some basic
analysis and also a nice application to FMRI brain reading.Shobha

<p>Introduction: Online learning is in vogue, which means we should expect to see in the near
future:Online boosting.Online decision trees.Online SVMs. (actually, we've
already seen)Online deep learning.Online parallel learning.etc…There are three
fundamental drivers of this trend.Increasing size of datasets makes online
algorithms attractive.Online learning can simply be more efficient than batch
learning. Here is a picture from a class on online learning:The point of this
picture is that even in 3 dimensions and even with linear constraints, finding
the minima of a set in an online fashion can be typically faster than finding
the minima in a batch fashion. To see this, note that there is a minimal
number of gradient updates (i.e. 2) required in order to reach the minima in
the typical case. Given this, it's best to do these updates as quickly as
possible, which implies doing the first update online (i.e. before seeing all
the examples) is preferred. Note that this is the simplest possible setting--

<p>Introduction: It turns out that many different people use the term "Online Learning", and
often they don't have the same definition in mind. Here's a list of the
possibilities I know of.Online Information SettingOnline learning refers to
aproblemin which unlabeled data comes, a prediction is made, and then feedback
is acquired.Online Adversarial SettingOnline learning refers toalgorithmsin
the Online Information Setting which satisfy guarantees of the form: "For all
possible sequences of observations, the algorithim has regret at mostlog (
number of strategies)with respect to the best strategy in a set." This is
sometimes called online learning with experts.Online Optimization
ConstraintOnline learning refers to optimizing a predictor via a learning
algorithm tunes parameters on a per-example basis. This may or may not be
applied in the Online Information Setting, and the strategy may or may not
satisfy Adversarial setting theory.Online Computational ConstraintOnline
learning refers to an algorithmi</p><p>3 0.7406553 <a title="267-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-23-Use_of_Learning_Theory.html">332 hunch net-2008-12-23-Use of Learning Theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've had serious conversations with several people who believe that the theory
in machine learning is "only useful for getting papers published". That's a
compelling statement, as I've seen many papers where the algorithm clearly
came first, and the theoretical justification for it came second, purely as a
perceived means to improve the chance of publication.Naturally, I disagree and
believe that learning theory has much more substantial applications.Even in
core learning algorithm design, I've found learning theory to be useful,
although it's application is more subtle than many realize. The most
straightforward applications can fail, because (as expectation suggests) worst
case bounds tend to be loose in practice (*). In my experience, considering
learning theory when designing an algorithm has two important effects in
practice:It can help make your algorithm behave right at a crude level of
analysis, leaving finer details to tuning or common sense. The best example I
have of this is</p><p>4 0.71391243 <a title="267-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-18-What_it_means_to_do_research..html">22 hunch net-2005-02-18-What it means to do research.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point
of view of an undergraduate. The shift from a class-taking mentality to a
research mentality is very significant and not easy.Problem PosingPosing the
right problem is often as important as solving them. Many people can get by in
research by solving problems others have posed, but that's not sufficient for
really inspiring research. For learning in particular, there is a strong
feeling that we just haven't figured out which questions are the right ones to
ask. You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem
convincing.Gambling your lifeWhen you do research, you think very hard about
new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions. Many
conversations are of the form "I wonder what would happen if…" These processes
can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours. The worst part is that
you'll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and
sometimes not even then be</p><p>5 0.71389347 <a title="267-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-05-An_ICML_reject.html">177 hunch net-2006-05-05-An ICML reject</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hal,Daniel, and I have been working on the algorithmSearnfor structured
prediction. This was just conditionally accepted and then rejected from ICML,
and we were quite surprised. By any reasonable criteria, it seems this is an
interesting algorithm.Prediction Performance: Searn performed better than any
other algorithm on all the problems we tested against using the same feature
set. This is true even using the numbers reported by authors in their
papers.Theoretical underpinning. Searn is a reduction which comes with a
reduction guarantee: the good performance on a base classifiers implies good
performance for the overall system. No other theorem of this type has been
made for other structured prediction algorithms, as far as we know.Speed.
Searn has no problem handling much larger datasets than other algorithms we
tested against.Simplicity. Given code for a binary classifier and a problem-
specific search algorithm, only a few tens of lines are necessary to implement
Searn.Generality.</p><p>6 0.71295679 <a title="267-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

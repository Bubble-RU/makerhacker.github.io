<p>Introduction: It turns out that many different people use the term “Online Learning”, and often they don’t have the same definition in mind.  Here’s a list of the possibilities I know of.  
  
  Online Information Setting   Online learning refers to a  problem  in which unlabeled data comes, a prediction is made, and then feedback is acquired. 
  Online Adversarial Setting  Online learning refers to  algorithms  in the Online Information Setting which satisfy guarantees of the form: “For all possible sequences of observations, the algorithim has regret at most  log ( number of strategies)  with respect to the best strategy in a set.”  This is sometimes called online learning with experts. 
  Online Optimization Constraint  Online learning refers to optimizing a predictor via a learning algorithm tunes parameters on a per-example basis.  This may or may not be applied in the Online Information Setting, and the strategy may or may not satisfy Adversarial setting theory.

<p>Introduction: If you search for “online learning” with any  major   search   engine , it’s interesting to note that zero of the results are for online machine learning.  This may not be a mistake if you are committed to a global ordering.  In other words, the number of people specifically interested in the least interesting top-10 online human learning result might exceed the number of people interested in online machine learning, even given the presence of the other 9 results.  The essential observation here is that the process of human learning is a big business (around 5% of GDP) effecting virtually everyone.

<p>Introduction: Here are a few of the papers I enjoyed at ICML.
  
  Steffen Bickel , Michael BrÃƒÂ¼eckner,  Tobias Scheffer ,  Discriminative Learning for Differing Training and Test Distributions   There is a nice trick in this paper: they predict the probability that an unlabeled sample is in the training set vs. the test set, and then use this prediction to importance weight labeled samples in the training set.  This paper uses a specific parametric model, but the approach is easily generalized. 
  Steve Hanneke   A Bound on the Label Complexity of Agnostic Active Learning   This paper bounds the number of labels required by the A 2  algorithm for active learning in the agnostic case.   Last year we figured out agnostic active learning was possible.  This year, it’s quantified.  Hopefull soon, it will be practical.

<p>Introduction: One nice use for this blog is to consider and discuss papers that that have appeared at recent conferences. I really enjoyed Andrew Ng and Sham Kakade’s paper  Online Bounds for Bayesian Algorithms . From the paper:
  

The philosophy taken in the Bayesian methodology is often at odds with 
that in the online learning community…. the online learning setting 
makes rather minimal assumptions on the conditions under which the 
data are being presented to the learner â€”usually, Nature could provide 
examples in an adversarial manner. We study the performance of 
Bayesian algorithms in a more adversarial setting… We provide 
competitive bounds when the cost function is the log loss, and we 
compare our performance to the best model in our model class (as in 
the experts setting).  
  
It’s a very nice analysis of some of my favorite algorithms that all hinges around a beautiful theorem:
 
Let Q be any distribution over parameters theta. Then for all sequences S:

<p>Introduction: Yoram  and  Shai ‘s  online learning tutorial  at  ICML  brings up a question for me, “Why use the  dual ?”
 
The basic setting is learning a weight vector  w i   so that the function  f(x)= sum i  w i  x i   optimizes some convex loss function.
 
The functional view of the dual is that instead of (or in addition to) keeping track of  w i   over the feature space, you keep track of a vector  a j   over the examples and define  w i  = sum j  a j  x ji  .
 
The above view of duality makes operating in the dual appear unnecessary, because in the end a weight vector is always used.  The tutorial suggests that thinking about the dual gives a unified algorithmic font for deriving online learning algorithms.  I haven’t worked with the dual representation much myself, but I have seen a few examples where it appears helpful.
  
  Noise  When doing online optimization (i.e. online learning where you are allowed to look at individual examples multiple times), the dual representation may be helpfu</p><p>4 0.74315333 <a title="267-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-15-The_Other_Online_Learning.html">378 hunch net-2009-11-15-The Other Online Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Accountability is a social problem.  When someone screws up, do you fire them?  Or do you accept the error and let them continue?  This is a very difficult problem and we all know of stories where the wrong decision was made.
 
 Online learning  (as meant here), is a subfield of learning theory which analyzes the online learning model.  
 
In the online learning model, there are a set of hypotheses or “experts”.  On any instantance  x , each expert makes a prediction  y .  A master algorithm  A  uses these predictions to form it’s own prediction  y A   and then  learns the correct prediction  y *  .  This process repeats.
 
The goal of online learning is to find a master algorithm  A  which uses the advice of the experts to make good predictions.  In particular, we typically want to guarantee that the master algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert.  If  L(e)  is the loss of expert  e  and  L(A)  is the loss of the master algorithm, it is often possible to prove:   L(A) les</p><p>6 0.66114521 <a title="267-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-27-Interesting_things_at_NIPS_2009.html">385 hunch net-2009-12-27-Interesting things at NIPS 2009</a></p>

<p>Introduction: David Mcallester  gave a talk about this  paper  (with  Pedro Felzenszwalb ).  I’ll try to give a high level summary of why it’s interesting.
 
Dynamic programming is most familiar as instantiated by Viterbi decoding in a hidden markov model.  It is a general paradigm for problem solving where subproblems are solved and used to solve larger problems.  In the Viterbi decoding example, the subproblem is “What is the most probable path ending at each state at timestep  t ?”, and the larger problem is the same except at timestep  t+1 .  There are a few optimizations you can do here:
  
  Dynamic Programming -> queued Dynamic Programming . Keep track of the “cost so far” (or “most probable path”) and (carefully) only look at extensions to paths likely to yield the shortest path.  “Carefully” here is defined by  Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm .

<p>Introduction: The ideal of theoretical algorithm analysis is to construct an algorithm with accompanying optimality theorems proving that it is a useful algorithm.  This ideal often fails, particularly for learning algorithms and theory.  The general form of a theorem is:  If  preconditions  Then  postconditions     When we design learning algorithms it is very common to come up with precondition assumptions such as “the data is IID”, “the learning problem is drawn from a known distribution over learning problems”, or “there is a perfect classifier”.  All of these example preconditions can be false for real-world problems in ways that are not easily detectable.  This means that algorithms derived and justified by these very common forms of analysis may be prone to catastrophic failure in routine (mis)application.
 
We  can  hope for better.  Several different kinds of learning algorithm analysis have been developed some of which have fewer preconditions.  Simply demanding that these forms of analysi</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90412283 <a title="267-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-17-Online_as_the_new_adjective.html">267 hunch net-2007-10-17-Online as the new adjective</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Online learning is in vogue, which means we should expect to see in the near future:
  
 Online boosting. 
 Online decision trees. 
 Online SVMs.  (actually, we’ve already seen) 
 Online deep learning. 
 Online parallel learning. 
 etc… 
  
There are three fundamental drivers of this trend. 
  
 Increasing size of datasets makes online algorithms attractive.   
 Online learning can simply be more efficient than batch learning.  Here is a picture from a class on online learning: 
  
The point of this picture is that even in 3 dimensions and even with linear constraints, finding the minima of a set in an online fashion can be typically faster than finding the minima in a batch fashion.  To see this, note that there is a minimal number of gradient updates (i.e. 2) required in order to reach the minima in the typical case.  Given this, it’s best to do these updates as quickly as possible, which implies doing the first update online (i.e. before seeing all the examples) is preferred.

<p>Introduction: All branches of machine learning seem to be united in the idea of using data to make predictions.  However, people disagree to some extent about what this means.  One way to categorize these different goals is on an axis, where one extreme is “tools to aid a human in using data to do prediction” and the other extreme is “tools to do prediction with no human intervention”.  Here is my estimate of where various elements of machine learning fall on this spectrum.
  
 
 Human Necessary 
  
 Human partially necessary 
  
 Human unnecessary 
 
 
 Clustering, data visualization 
 Bayesian Learning, Probabilistic Models, Graphical Models 
 Kernel Learning (SVM’s, etc..) 
 Decision Trees? 
 Reinforcement Learning 
 
  
The exact position of each element is of course debatable.  My reasoning is that clustering and data visualization are nearly useless for prediction without a human in the loop.  Bayesian/probabilistic models/graphical models generally require a human to sit and think about what</p><p>5 0.87895453 <a title="267-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-27-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">369 hunch net-2009-08-27-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several events are happening in the NY area.
  
  Barriers in Computational Learning Theory Workshop, Aug 28.   That’s tomorrow near Princeton.  I’m looking forward to speaking at this one on “Getting around Barriers in Learning Theory”, but several other talks are of interest, particularly to the CS theory inclined. 
  Claudia Perlich  is running the  INFORMS Data Mining Contest  with a deadline of Sept. 25. This is a contest using real health record data (they partnered with  HealthCare Intelligence ) to predict transfers and mortality. In the current US health care reform debate, the case studies of high costs we hear strongly suggest machine learning & statistics can save many billions. 
  The Singularity Summit October 3&4 .  This is for the AIists out there.  Several of the talks look interesting, although unfortunately I’ll miss it for  ALT . 
  Predictive Analytics World, Oct 20-21 .  This is stretching the definition of “New York Area” a bit, but the train to DC is reasonable.</p><p>6 0.83285296 <a title="267-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-15-The_Other_Online_Learning.html">378 hunch net-2009-11-15-The Other Online Learning</a></p>

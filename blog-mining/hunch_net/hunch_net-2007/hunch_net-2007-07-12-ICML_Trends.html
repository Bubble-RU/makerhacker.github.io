<p>Introduction: Everyone should have received notice forNY ML Symposiumabstracts. Check
carefully, as one was lost by our system.The event itself is October 21, next
week.Leon Bottou,Stephen Boyd, andYoav Freundare giving the invited talks this
year, and there are many spotlights on local work spread throughout the
day.Chris Wigginshas setup 6(!) ML-interested startups to follow the
symposium, which should be of substantial interest to the employment
interested.I also wanted to give an update onICML 2012. Unlike last year, our
deadline is coordinated withAIStat(which is due this Friday). The paper
deadline for ICML has been pushed back to February 24 which should allow
significant time for finishing up papers after the winter break. Other details
may interest people as well:We settled on usingCMTafter checking out the
possibilities. I wasn't looking for this, because I've often found CMT clunky
in terms of easy access to the right information. Nevertheless, the breadth of

<p>Introduction: Here are a few papers fromCOLT 2008that I found interesting.Maria-Florina
Balcan,Steve Hanneke, andJenn Wortman,The True Sample Complexity of Active
Learning. This paper shows that in an asymptotic setting, active learning
isalwaysbetter than supervised learning (although the gap may be small). This
is evidence that the only thing in the way of universal active learning is us
knowing how to do it properly.Nir AilonandMehryar Mohri,An Efficient Reduction
of Ranking to Classification. This paper shows how to robustly ranknobjects
withn log(n)classifications using a quicksort based algorithm. The result is
applicable to many ranking loss functions and has implications for
others.Michael KearnsandJennifer Wortman.Learning from Collective Behavior.
This is about learning in a new model, where the goal is to predict how a
collection of interacting agents behave. One claim is that learning in this
setting can be reduced to IID learning.Due to the relation withMetric-E3, I

<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point
of view of an undergraduate. The shift from a class-taking mentality to a
research mentality is very significant and not easy.Problem PosingPosing the
right problem is often as important as solving them. Many people can get by in
research by solving problems others have posed, but that's not sufficient for
really inspiring research. For learning in particular, there is a strong
feeling that we just haven't figured out which questions are the right ones to
ask. You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem
convincing.Gambling your lifeWhen you do research, you think very hard about
new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions. Many
conversations are of the form "I wonder what would happen if…" These processes
can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours. The worst part is that
you'll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and
sometimes not even then be</p><p>6 0.0 <a title="254-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-19-Why_I_decided_to_run_a_weblog..html">1 hunch net-2005-01-19-Why I decided to run a weblog.</a></p>

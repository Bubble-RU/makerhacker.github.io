<p>Introduction: Here are two papers that seem particularly interesting at this year's
COLT.Gilles BlanchardandFranÃƒÂ§ois Fleuret,Occam's Hammer. When we are

<p>Introduction: This post is about a reductions-related problem that I find mysterious. There
are two kinds of reductions analysis currently under consideration.Error
limiting reductions. Here, the goal is to bound the error rate of the created
classifier in terms of the error rate of the binary classifiers that you
reduce to. A very simple example of this is thaterror correcting output
codeswhere it is possible to prove that for certain codes, the multiclass
error rate is at most 4 * the binary classifier error rate.Regret minimizing
reductions. Here, the goal is to bound theregretof the created classifier in
terms of theregretof the binary classifiers reduced to. The regret is the
error rate minus the minimum error rate. When the learning problem is noisy
the minimum error rate may not be0. An analagous result for reget is that for
aprobabilistic error correcting output code, multiclass regret is at most 4 *
(binary regret)0.5.The use of "regret" is more desirable than the use of error
rates, becaus</p><p>3 0.17349914 <a title="247-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-13-Regression_vs._Classification_as_a_Primitive.html">196 hunch net-2006-07-13-Regression vs. Classification as a Primitive</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Forlearning reductionswe have been concentrating on reducing various complex
learning problems to binary classification. This choice needs to be actively
questioned, because it was not carefully considered.Binary clasification is
learning a classifierc:X -> {0,1}so as to minimize the probability of being
wrong,Prx,y~D(c(x)y).The primary alternative candidate seems to be squared
error regression. In squared error regression, you learn a regressors:X ->
[0,1]so as to minimize squared error,Ex,y~D(s(x)-y)2.It is difficult to judge
one primitive against another. The judgement must at least partially be made
on nontheoretical grounds because (essentially) we are evaluating a choice
between two axioms/assumptions.These two primitives are significantly related.
Classification can be reduced to regression in the obvious way: you use the
regressor to predictD(y=1|x), then threshold at0.5. For this simple reduction
a squared error regret ofrimplies a classification regret of at mostr0.5.

means that many people attempt to use Bennett's bound (incorrectly) by

that samples are drawn independently. This bound is easily computed and will

something very striking: several previous error bounds arealwaysgreater than

samples are drawn IID from an unknown distributionD.Fix a set of
classifiersFind a high probability bound on the maximum true error rate (with
respect toD) as a function of the empirical error rate on the training
set.Many of these bounds become extremely complex and hairy.CurrentEveryone
working on this subject wants "tighter bounds", however there are different
definitions of "tighter". Some groups focus on "functional tightness" (getting
the right functional dependency between the size of the training set and a
parameterization of the hypothesis space) whileothersfocus on "practical
tightness" (finding bounds which work well on practical problems). (I am
definitely in the second camp.)One of the dangers of striving for "functional
tightness" is that the bound</p><p>5 0.6352548 <a title="247-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-21-Problem%3A_Cross_Validation.html">26 hunch net-2005-02-21-Problem: Cross Validation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are in the New York area and interested in machine learning, consider
submitting a 2 page abstract to theML symposiumby tomorrow (Sept 5th)
midnight. It's a fun one day affair on October 10 in an awesome location
overlooking the world trade center site.A bit further off (but a real
conference) is theAI and Statsdeadline on November 5, to be held in Florida

<p>Introduction: Mark Reidhas stepped up and created acomment system for ICML paperswhichGreger
Lindenhas tightly integrated.My understanding is that Mark spent quite a bit
of time on the details, and there are some cool features like working latex
math mode. This is an excellent chance for the ICML community to experiment
with making ICML year-round, so I hope it works out. Please do consider
experimenting with it.</p><p>3 0.92198664 <a title="247-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-27-Antilearning%3A_When_proximity_goes_bad.html">32 hunch net-2005-02-27-Antilearning: When proximity goes bad</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Joel Preddmentioned"Antilearning" byAdam Kowalczyk, which is interesting from
a foundational intuitions viewpoint.There is a pervasive intuition that
"nearby things tend to have the same label". This intuition is instantiated in
SVMs, nearest neighbor classifiers, decision trees, and neural networks. It
turns out there are natural problems where this intuition is opposite of the
truth.One natural situation where this occurs is in competition. For example,
whenIntelfails to meet its earnings estimate, is this evidence thatAMDis doing
badly also? Or evidence that AMD is doing well?This violation of the proximity
intuition means that when the number of examples is few,negatinga classifier
which attempts to exploit proximity can provide predictive power (thus, the
term "antilearning").</p><p>4 0.91007125 <a title="247-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-02-27-The_Stats_Handicap.html">290 hunch net-2008-02-27-The Stats Handicap</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Graduating students in Statistics appear to be at a substantial handicap
compared to graduating students in Machine Learning, despite being in
substantially overlapping subjects.The problem seems to be cultural.
Statistics comes from a mathematics background which emphasizes large
publications slowly published under review at journals. Machine Learning comes
from a Computer Science background which emphasizes quick publishing at
reviewed conferences. This has a number of implications:Graduating statistics
PhDs often have 0-2 publications while graduating machine learning PhDs might
have 5-15.Graduating ML students have had a chance for others to build on
their work. Stats students have had no such chance.Graduating ML students have
attended a number of conferences and presented their work, giving them a
chance to meet people. Stats students have had fewer chances of this sort.In
short, Stats students have had relatively few chances to distinguish
themselves and are heavily reliant on t</p><p>same-blog 5 0.9037416 <a title="247-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-14-Interesting_Papers_at_COLT_2007.html">247 hunch net-2007-06-14-Interesting Papers at COLT 2007</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are two papers that seem particularly interesting at this year's
COLT.Gilles BlanchardandFranÃƒÂ§ois Fleuret,Occam's Hammer. When we are
interested in very tight bounds on the true error rate of a classifier, it is
tempting to use a PAC-Bayes bound which can (empirically) bequite tight. A
disadvantage of the PAC-Bayes bound is that it applies to a classifier which
is randomized over a set of base classifiers rather than a single classifier.
This paper shows that a similar bound can be proved which holds for a single
classifier drawn from the set. The ability to safely use a single classifier
is very nice. This technique applies generically to any base bound, so it has
other applications covered in the paper.Adam Tauman Kalai.Learning Nested
Halfspaces and Uphill Decision Trees. Classification PAC-learning, where you
prove that any problem amongst some set is polytime learnable with respect to
any distribution over the inputXis extraordinarily challenging as judged by

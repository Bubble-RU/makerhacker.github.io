<p>Introduction: What?   Bounds are mathematical formulas relating observations to future error rates assuming that data is drawn independently.  In classical statistics, they are calld confidence intervals. 
 Why?  
  
  Good Judgement . In many applications of learning, it is desirable to know how well the learned predictor works in the future.  This helps you decide if the problem is solved or not. 
  Learning Essence .  The form of some of these bounds helps you understand what the essence of learning is. 
  Algorithm Design .  Some of these bounds suggest, motivate, or even directly imply learning algorithms. 
  
 What We Know Now 
 
There are several families of bounds, based on how information is used.
  
  Testing Bounds . These are methods which use labeled data not used in training to estimate the future error rate.  Examples include the  test set bound ,  progressive validation  also  here  and  here ,  train and test bounds , and cross-validation (but see the  big open problem ).  These tec</p><p>3 0.1575183 <a title="247-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-28-A_COLT_paper.html">85 hunch net-2005-06-28-A COLT paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found Tong Zhangâ&euro;&trade;s paper on  Data Dependent Concentration Bounds for Sequential Prediction Algorithms  interesting.  Roughly speaking, it states a tight bound on the future error rate for online learning algorithms assuming that samples are drawn independently.   This bound is easily computed and will make the progressive validation approaches used  here  significantly more practical.</p><p>4 0.15707658 <a title="247-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-13-Regression_vs._Classification_as_a_Primitive.html">196 hunch net-2006-07-13-Regression vs. Classification as a Primitive</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For  learning reductions  we have been concentrating on reducing various complex learning problems to binary classification.  This choice needs to be actively questioned, because it was not carefully considered.
 
Binary clasification is learning a classifier  c:X -> {0,1}  so as to minimize the probability of being wrong,  Pr x,y~D (c(x)   y)  .
 
The primary alternative candidate seems to be squared error regression.  In squared error regression, you learn a regressor  s:X -> [0,1]  so as to minimize squared error,  E x,y~D  (s(x)-y) 2  .
 
It is difficult to judge one primitive against another.  The judgement must at least partially be made on nontheoretical grounds because (essentially) we are evaluating a choice between two axioms/assumptions.
 
These two primitives are significantly related.  Classification can be reduced to regression in the obvious way: you use the regressor to predict  D(y=1|x) , then threshold at  0.5 .   For this simple reduction a squared error regret of  r</p><p>5 0.15547876 <a title="247-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-05-09-The_Missing_Bound.html">244 hunch net-2007-05-09-The Missing Bound</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sham Kakade  points out that we are missing a bound.
 
Suppose we have  m  samples  x  drawn IID from some distribution  D .  Through the magic of exponential moment method we know that:
  
 If the range of  x  is bounded by an interval of size  I , a  Chernoff/Hoeffding style bound  gives us a bound on the deviations like  O(I/m 0.5 )  (at least in crude form).  A proof is on page 9  here . 
 If the range of  x  is bounded, and the variance (or a bound on the variance) is known, then  Bennett’s bound  can give tighter results (*).  This can be a huge improvment when the true variance small. 
  
What’s missing here is a bound that depends on the observed variance rather than a bound on the variance.  This means that many people attempt to use Bennett’s bound (incorrectly) by plugging the observed variance in as the true variance, invalidating the bound application.  Most of the time, they get away with it, but this is a dangerous move when doing machine learning.

<p>Introduction: The essential problem here is the large gap between experimental observation and theoretical understanding.
 
 Method   K-fold cross validation is a commonly used technique which takes a set of  m  examples and partitions them into  K  sets (“folds”) of size  m/K .  For each fold, a classifier is trained on the other folds and then test on the fold.
 
 Problem   Assume only independent samples.  Derive a classifier from the K classifiers with a small bound on the true error rate.
 
 Past Work  (I’ll add more as I remember/learn.)
  
  Devroye , Rogers, and Wagner analyzed cross validation and found algorithm specific bounds.  Not all of this is online, but here is one  paper .  
  Michael Kearns  and  Dana Ron   analyzed cross validation  and found that under additional stability assumptions the bound for the classifier which learns on all the data is not much worse than for a test set of size  m/K  .

<p>Introduction: In the  regression vs classification debate , I’m adding a new “pro” to classification.  It seems there are computational shortcuts available for classification which simply aren’t available for regression.  This arises in several situations.
  
 In  active learning  it is sometimes possible to find an  e  error classifier with just  log(e)  labeled samples.    Only much more modest improvements appear to be achievable for squared loss regression.  The essential reason is that the loss function on many examples is flat with respect to large variations in the parameter spaces of a learned classifier, which implies that many of these classifiers do not need to be considered.  In contrast, for squared loss regression, most substantial variations in the parameter space influence the loss at most points. 
 In budgeted learning, where there is either a computational time constraint or a feature cost constraint, a classifier can sometimes be learned to very high accuracy under the constraints</p><p>2 0.9992137 <a title="247-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-24-NLPers.html">166 hunch net-2006-03-24-NLPers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are two papers that seem particularly interesting at this year’s COLT.
  
  Gilles Blanchard  and  FranÃƒÂ§ois Fleuret ,  Occam’s Hammer .  When we are interested in very tight bounds on the true error rate of a classifier, it is tempting to use a PAC-Bayes bound which can (empirically) be  quite tight .  A disadvantage of the PAC-Bayes bound is that it applies to a classifier which is randomized over a set of base classifiers rather than a single classifier.  This paper shows that a similar bound can be proved which holds for a single classifier drawn from the set.   The ability to safely use a single classifier is very nice.  This technique applies generically to any base bound, so it has other applications covered in the paper.

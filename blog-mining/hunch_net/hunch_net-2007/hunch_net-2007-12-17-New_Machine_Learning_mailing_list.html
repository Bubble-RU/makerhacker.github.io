<p>Introduction: Many of the large machine learning conferences were in the US this summer.  A common problem which students from abroad encounter is visa issues. 
Just getting a visa to visit can be pretty rough: you stand around in lines, sometimes for days.  Even worse is the timing with respect to ticket buying.  Airplane tickets typically need to be bought well in advance on nonrefundable terms to secure a reasonable rate for air travel.  When a visa is denied, as happens reasonably often, a very expensive ticket is burnt.
 
A serious effort is under way to raise this as in issue in need of fixing.  Over the long term, effectively driving research conferences to locate outside of the US seems an unwise policy.   Robert Schapire  is planning to talk to a congressman.   Sally Goldman  suggested putting together a list of problem cases, and  Phil Long  setup an email address  immigration.and.confs@gmail.com  to collect them.

<p>Introduction: Data linkage is a problem which seems to come up in various applied machine learning problems.  I have heard it mentioned in various data mining contexts, but it seems relatively less studied for systemic reasons.
 
A very simple version of the data linkage problem is a cross hospital patient record merge.  Suppose a patient (John Doe) is admitted to a hospital (General Health), treated, and released.  Later, John Doe is admitted to a second hospital (Health General), treated, and released.  Given a large number of records of this sort, it becomes very tempting to try and predict the outcomes of treatments.  This is reasonably straightforward as a machine learning problem if there is a shared unique identifier for John Doe used by General Health and Health General along with time stamps.  We can merge the records and create examples of the form “Given symptoms and treatment, did the patient come back to a hospital within the next year?”  These examples could be fed into a learning algo</p><p>5 0.21774916 <a title="278-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-02-Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Googling.html">10 hunch net-2005-02-02-Kolmogorov Complexity and Googling</a></p>

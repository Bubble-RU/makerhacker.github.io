dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.Machine Learning conferences
are triannual now, betweenNIPS,AIStat, andICML. This has not always been the
case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started
with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April
conference.However, the first claim is not quite correct. NIPS and AIStat have
few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other
conferences accepting machine learning related papers. SinceJoelleand I are

<p>Introduction: This is a rather long post, detailing the ICML 2012 review process. The goal
is to make the process more transparent, help authors understand how we came
to a decision, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this process for
future conference organizers.Microsoftâ€™s Conference Management Toolkit (CMT)We
chose to useCMTover other conference management software mainly because of its
rich toolkit. The interface is sub-optimal (to say the least!) but it has
extensive capabilities (to handle bids, author response, resubmissions, etc.),
good import/export mechanisms (to process the data elsewhere), excellent
technical support (to answer late night emails, add new functionalities).
Overall, it was the right choice, although we hope a designer will look at
that interface sometime soon!Toronto Matching System (TMS)TMSis now being used
by many major conferences in our field (including NIPS and UAI). It is an

carefully, as one was lost by our system.The event itself is October 21, next
week.Leon Bottou,Stephen Boyd, andYoav Freundare giving the invited talks this
year, and there are many spotlights on local work spread throughout the
day.Chris Wigginshas setup 6(!) ML-interested startups to follow the
symposium, which should be of substantial interest to the employment
interested.I also wanted to give an update onICML 2012. Unlike last year, our
deadline is coordinated withAIStat(which is due this Friday). The paper
deadline for ICML has been pushed back to February 24 which should allow
significant time for finishing up papers after the winter break. Other details
may interest people as well:We settled on usingCMTafter checking out the
possibilities. I wasn't looking for this, because I've often found CMT clunky
in terms of easy access to the right information. Nevertheless, the breadth of

<p>Introduction: Although I'm greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be
admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in
reviews. The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if theByzantine
generalslimit has been exceeded. For example, I've seen recent reviews where
the given reasons for rejecting are:[NIPS] Theorem A is uninteresting because
Theorem B is uninteresting.[UAI] When you learn by memorization, the problem
addressed is trivial.[NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.[NIPS] This has been
done before. (Ã¢&euro;Åš but not giving any relevant citations)Just for the record I
want to point out what's wrong with these reviews. A future world in which
such reasons never come up again would be great, but I'm sure these errors
will be committed many times more in the future.This is nonsense. A theorem
should be evaluated based on it's merits, rather than the merits of another
theorem.Learning by memorization requires an exponentially larger sample
complexity than man</p><p>3 0.88900197 <a title="278-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-04-The_Health_of_COLT.html">89 hunch net-2005-07-04-The Health of COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The health ofCOLT(Conference on Learning Theory or Computational Learning
Theory depending on who you ask) has been questioned over the last few years.
Low points for the conference occurred whenEuroCOLTmerged with COLT in 2001,
and the attendance at the 2002 Sydney COLT fell to a new low. This occurred in
the general context of machine learning conferences rising in both number and
size over the last decade.Any discussion ofwhyCOLT has had difficulties is
inherently controversial as is any story about well-intentioned people making
the wrong decisions. Nevertheless, this may be worth discussing in the hope of
avoiding problems in the future and general understanding. In any such
discussion there is a strong tendency to identify with a conference/community
in a patriotic manner that is detrimental to thinking. Keep in mind that
conferences exist to further research.My understanding (I wasn't around) is
that COLT started as a subcommunity of the computer science theory community.

<p>Introduction: We just finished theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer School. The school
was 2 weeks long with about 130 (or 140 counting the speakers) participants.
For perspective, this is perhaps the largest graduate level machine learning
class I am aware of anywhere and anytime (previousMLSSs have been close).
Overall, it seemed to go well, although the students are the real authority on
this. For those who missed it, DVDs will be available from our Slovenian
friends. EmailMrs Spela Sitarof the Jozsef Stefan Institute for details.The
following are some notes for future planning and those interested.Good

<p>Introduction: How should we, as researchers in machine learning, organize ourselves?The most
immediate measurable objective of computer science research is publishing a
paper. The most difficult aspect of publishing a paper is having reviewers
accept and recommend it for publication. The simplest mechanism for doing this
is to show theoretical progress on some standard, well-known easily understood
problem.In doing this, we often fall into a local minima of the research
process. The basic problem in machine learning is that it is very unclear that
the mathematical model is the right one for the (or some) real problem. A good
mathematical model in machine learning should have one fundamental trait: it
should aid the design of effective learning algorithms. To date, our ability
to solve interesting learning problems (speech recognition, machine
translation, object recognition, etcÃ¢&euro;Åš) remains limited (although improving),
so the "rightness" of our models is in doubt.If our mathematical models are

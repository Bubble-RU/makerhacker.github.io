<p>Introduction: A couple security researchers  claim to have cracked the netflix dataset .  The claims of success appear somewhat overstated to me, but the method of attack is valid and could plausibly be substantially improved so as to reveal the movie preferences of a small fraction of Netflix users.
 
The basic idea is to use a heuristic similarity function between ratings in a public database (from IMDB) and an anonymized database (Netflix) to link ratings in the private database to public identities (in IMDB).  They claim to have linked two of a few dozen IMDB users to anonymized netflix users.
 
The claims seem a bit inflated to me, because (a) knowing the IMDB identity isn’t equivalent to knowing the person and (b) the claims of statistical significance are with respect to a model of the world they created (rather than one they created).

<p>Introduction: There are two prediction competitions currently in the air.  
  
 The  Performance Prediction Challenge   by  Isabelle Guyon .  Good entries minimize a weighted 0/1 loss + the difference between a prediction of this loss and the observed truth on 5 datasets.  Isabelle tells me all of the problems are “real world” and the test datasets are large enough (17K minimum) that the winner should be well determined by ability rather than luck.  This is due March 1. 
 The  Predictive Uncertainty Challenge  by  Gavin Cawley .  Good entries minimize log loss on real valued output variables for one synthetic and 3 “real” datasets related to atmospheric prediction. The use of log loss (which can be infinite and hence is never convergent) and smaller test sets of size 1K to 7K examples makes the winner of this contest more luck dependent.  Nevertheless, the contest may be of some interest particularly to the branch of learning (typically Bayes learning) which prefers to optimize log loss.

<p>Introduction: Rajat Raina  presented a paper on the technique they used for the  PASCAL   Recognizing Textual Entailment  challenge.  
 
“Text entailment” is the problem of deciding if one sentence implies another.  For example the previous sentence entails: 
  
 Text entailment is a decision problem. 
 One sentence can imply another. 
  
The challenge was of the form: given an original sentence and another sentence predict whether there was an entailment.  All current techniques for predicting correctness of an entailment are at the “flail” stage—accuracies of around 58% where humans could achieve near 100% accuracy, so there is much room to improve.   Apparently, there may be another PASCAL challenge on this problem in the near future.</p><p>5 0.50973123 <a title="239-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-26-Netflix_nearly_done.html">362 hunch net-2009-06-26-Netflix nearly done</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joel Predd   mentioned  “ Antilearning ” by  Adam Kowalczyk , which is interesting from a foundational intuitions viewpoint.
 
There is a pervasive intuition that “nearby things tend to have the same label”.  This intuition is instantiated in SVMs, nearest neighbor classifiers, decision trees, and neural networks.  It turns out there are natural problems where this intuition is opposite of the truth.
 
One natural situation where this occurs is in competition.   For example, when  Intel  fails to meet its earnings estimate, is this evidence that  AMD  is doing badly also?  Or evidence that AMD is doing well?
 
This violation of the proximity intuition means that when the number of examples is few,  negating  a classifier which attempts to exploit proximity can provide predictive power (thus, the term “antilearning”).</p><p>6 0.61877453 <a title="239-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-11-More_NIPS_Papers.html">139 hunch net-2005-12-11-More NIPS Papers</a></p>

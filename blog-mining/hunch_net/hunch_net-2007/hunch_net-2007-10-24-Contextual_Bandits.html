<p>Introduction: This post is about contextual bandit problems where, repeatedly:
  
 The world chooses features  x  and rewards for each action  r 1 ,…,r k   then announces the features  x  (but not the rewards). 
 A policy chooses an action  a . 
 The world announces the reward  r a   
  
The goal in these situations is to learn a policy which maximizes  r a   in expectation efficiently.  I’m thinking about all situations which fit the above setting, whether they are drawn IID or adversarially from round to round and whether they involve past logged data or rapidly learning via interaction.
 
One common drawback of all algorithms for solving this setting, is that they have a poor dependence on the number of actions.  For example if  k  is the number of actions,  EXP4 (page 66)  has a dependence on  k 0.5  ,  epoch-greedy  (and the simpler epsilon greedy) have a dependence on  k 1/3  , and the  offset tree  has a dependence on  k-1 .

<p>Introduction: Consider the contextual bandit setting where, repeatedly:
  
 A context  x  is observed. 
 An action  a  is taken given the context  x .  
 A reward  r  is observed, dependent on  x  and  a . 
  
Where the goal of a learning agent is to find a policy for step 2 achieving a large expected reward.  
 
This setting is of obvious importance, because in the real world we typically make decisions based on some set of information and then get feedback only about the single action taken.  It also fundamentally differs from supervised learning settings because knowing the value of one action is not equivalent to knowing the value of all actions.
 
A decade ago the best machine learning techniques for this setting where implausibly inefficient.

<p>Introduction: One thing which is clear on a little reflection is that there exists a single master learning problem capable of encoding essentially all learning problems.  This problem is of course a very general sort of reinforcement learning where the world interacts with an agent as:
  
 The world announces an observation  x . 
 The agent makes a choice  a . 
 The world announces a reward  r . 
  
The goal here is to maximize the sum of the rewards over the time of the agent.  No particular structure relating  x  to  a  or  a  to  r  is implied by this setting so we do not know effective general algorithms for the agent.  It’s very easy to prove lower bounds showing that an agent cannot hope to succeed here—just consider the case where actions are unrelated to rewards.

<p>Introduction: A new direction of research seems to be arising in machine learning: Interactive Machine Learning.  This isn’t a familiar term, although it does include some familiar subjects.
 
 What is Interactive Machine Learning?   The fundamental requirement is (a) learning algorithms which interact with the world and (b) learn.  
 
For our purposes, let’s define learning as efficiently competing with a large set of possible predictors.  Examples include:
  
 Online learning against an adversary ( Avrim’s Notes ).  The interaction is almost trivial: the learning algorithm makes a prediction and then receives feedback. The learning is choosing based upon the advice of many experts. 
   Active Learning  .  In active learning, the interaction is choosing which examples to label, and the learning is choosing from amongst a large set of hypotheses. 
   Contextual Bandits  .  The interaction is choosing one of several actions and learning only the value of the chosen action (weaker than active learning</p><p>6 0.17539757 <a title="269-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-26-Compositional_Machine_Learning_Algorithm_Design.html">311 hunch net-2008-07-26-Compositional Machine Learning Algorithm Design</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is about a general technique for problem solving which I’ve never seen taught (in full generality), but which I’ve found very useful.
 
Many problems in computer science turn out to be discretely difficult.  The best known version of such problems are NP-hard problems, but I mean ‘discretely difficult’ in a much more general way, which I only know how to capture by examples.
  
  ERM  In empirical risk minimization, you choose a minimum error rate classifier from a set of classifiers.  This is NP hard for common sets, but it can be much harder, depending on the set. 
  Experts  In the online learning with experts setting, you try to predict well so as to compete with a set of (adversarial) experts.  Here the alternating quantifiers of you and an adversary playing out a game can yield a dynamic programming problem that grows exponentially. 
  Policy Iteration  The problem with policy iteration is that you learn a new policy with respect to an old policy, which implies that sim</p><p>6 0.68505013 <a title="269-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-26-Compositional_Machine_Learning_Algorithm_Design.html">311 hunch net-2008-07-26-Compositional Machine Learning Algorithm Design</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This title is a lie, but it is a special lie which has a bit of truth.
 
If  n  players each play each other, you have a tournament.   How do you order the players from weakest to strongest?
 
The standard first attempt is “find the ordering which agrees with the tournament on as many player pairs as possible”.  This is called the “minimum feedback arcset” problem in the CS theory literature and it is a well known NP-hard problem.  A basic guarantee holds for the solution to this problem: if there is some “true” intrinsic ordering, and the outcome of the tournament disagrees  k  times (due to noise for instance), then the output ordering will disagree with the original ordering on at most  2k  edges (and no solution can be better).
 
One standard approach to tractably solving an NP-hard problem is to find another algorithm with an approximation guarantee.  For example,  Don Coppersmith ,  Lisa Fleischer  and  Atri Rudra  proved that  ordering players according to the number of wins is</p><p>3 0.95706385 <a title="269-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-21-Rob_Schapire_at_NYC_ML_Meetup.html">405 hunch net-2010-08-21-Rob Schapire at NYC ML Meetup</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the “right” way to do machine learning.  This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.  The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a reply 2 .
 
The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and general.  Essentially, you first specify a prior  P(D)  over possible processes  D  producing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:   P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)   
After this, hard decisions are made (such as “turn left” or “turn right”) by choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior) loss.
 
This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices of  P(D)  and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice properties:
  
 There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual distribution generating the data is drawn from  P(D)  there is no better method.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.90422022 <a title="269-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-24-Contextual_Bandits.html">269 hunch net-2007-10-24-Contextual Bandits</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the fundamental underpinnings of the internet is advertising based content.  This has become much more effective due to targeted advertising where ads are specifically matched to interests.  Everyone is familiar with this, because everyone uses search engines and all search engines try to make money this way.
 
The problem of matching ads to interests is a natural machine learning problem in some ways since there is much information in who clicks on what.  A fundamental problem with this information is that it is not supervised—in particular a click-or-not on one ad doesn’t generally tell you if a different ad would have been clicked on.  This implies we have a fundamental exploration problem.
 
A standard mathematical setting for this situation is “ k -Armed Bandits”, often with various relevant embellishments.  The  k -Armed Bandit setting works on a round-by-round basis.  On each round:
  
 A policy chooses arm  a  from  1  of  k  arms (i.e. 1 of k ads).

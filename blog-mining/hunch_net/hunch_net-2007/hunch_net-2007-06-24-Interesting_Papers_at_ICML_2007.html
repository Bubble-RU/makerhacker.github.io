<p>Introduction: I learned a number of things atNIPS.The financial people were there in greater
force than previously.Two Sigmasponsored NIPS whileDRW Tradinghad a
booth.Theadversarial machine learning workshophad a number of talks about
interesting applications where an adversary really is out to try and mess up
your learning algorithm. This is very different from the situation we often
think of where the world is oblivious to our learning. This may present new
and convincing applications for the learning-against-an-adversary work common
atCOLT.There were several interesing papers.Sanjoy Dasgupta,Daniel Hsu,
andClaire Monteleonihad a paper onGeneral Agnostic Active Learning. The basic
idea is that active learning can be done via reduction to a form of supervised
learning problem. This is great, because we have many supervised learning
algorithms from which the benefits of active learning may be derived.Joseph

<p>Introduction: What?Bounds are mathematical formulas relating observations to future error
rates assuming that data is drawn independently. In classical statistics, they
are calld confidence intervals.Why?Good Judgement. In many applications of
learning, it is desirable to know how well the learned predictor works in the
future. This helps you decide if the problem is solved or not.Learning
Essence. The form of some of these bounds helps you understand what the
essence of learning is.Algorithm Design. Some of these bounds suggest,
motivate, or even directly imply learning algorithms.What We Know NowThere are
several families of bounds, based on how information is used.Testing Bounds.
These are methods which use labeled data not used in training to estimate the
future error rate. Examples include thetest set bound,progressive
validationalsohereandhere,train and test bounds, and cross-validation (but see
thebig open problem). These techniques are the best available for goal (1)

<p>Introduction: This post is by Daniel Hsu and John Langford.In selective sampling style
active learning, a learning algorithm chooses which examples to label. We now
have an active learning algorithm that is:Efficientin label complexity,
unlabeled complexity, and computational complexity.Competitivewith supervised
learning anywhere that supervised learning works.Compatiblewith online
learning, with any optimization-based learning algorithm, with any loss
function, with offline testing, and even with changing learning
algorithms.Empiricallyeffective.The basic idea is to combinedisagreement
region-based samplingwithimportance weighting: an example is selected to be
labeled with probability proportional to how useful it is for distinguishing
among near-optimal classifiers, and labeled examples are importance-weighted
by the inverse of these probabilities. The combination of these simple ideas
removes thesampling biasproblem that has plagued many previous heuristics for
active learning, and yet leads to</p><p>5 0.16921018 <a title="251-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-14-Clever_Methods_of_Overfitting.html">19 hunch net-2005-02-14-Clever Methods of Overfitting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Overfitting" is traditionally defined as training some flexible
representation so that it memorizes the data but fails to predict well in the
future. For this post, I will define overfitting more generally as over-
representing the performance of systems. There are two styles of general
overfitting: overrepresenting performance on particular datasets and
(implicitly) overrepresenting performance of a method on future datasets.We
should all be aware of these methods, avoid them where possible, and take them
into account otherwise. I have used "reproblem" and "old datasets", and may
have participated in "overfitting by review"--some of these are very difficult
to avoid.NameMethodExplanationRemedyTraditional overfittingTrain a complex
predictor on too-few examples.Hold out pristine examples for testing.Use a
simpler predictor.Get more training examples.Integrate over many
predictors.Reject papers which do this.Parameter tweak overfittingUse a
learning algorithm with many parameters. Choo</p><p>6 0.15402327 <a title="251-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-22-Active_learning.html">45 hunch net-2005-03-22-Active learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here's a list of papers that I found interesting atICML/COLT/UAIin 2009.Elad
HazanandComandur SeshadhriEfficient learning algorithms for changing
environmentsat ICML. This paper shows how to adapt learning algorithms that
compete with fixed predictors to compete with changing policies. The
definition of regret they deal with seems particularly useful in many
situation.Hal Daume,Unsupervised Search-based Structured Predictionat ICML.
This paper shows a technique for reducing unsupervised learning to supervised
learning which (a) make a fast unsupervised learning algorithm and (b) makes
semisupervised learning both easy and highly effective.There were two papers
with similar results on active learning in the KWIK framework for linear
regression, both reducing the sample complexity to . One wasNicolo Cesa-
Bianchi,Claudio Gentile, andFrancesco OrabonaRobust Bounds for Classification

<p>Introduction: Several papers at NIPS caught my attention.Elad HazanandSatyen Kale,Online
Submodular OptimizationThey define an algorithm for online optimization of
submodular functions with regret guarantees. This places submodular
optimization roughly on par with online convex optimization as tractable
settings for online learning.Elad HazanandSatyen KaleOn Stochastic and Worst-
Case Models of Investing. At it's core, this is yet another example of
modifying worst-case online learning to deal with variance, but the
application to financial models is particularly cool and it seems plausibly
superior other common approaches for financial modeling.Mark Palatucci,Dean
Pomerlau,Tom Mitchell, andGeoff HintonZero Shot Learning with Semantic Output
CodesThe goal here is predicting a label in a multiclass supervised setting
where the label never occurs in the training data. They have some basic
analysis and also a nice application to FMRI brain reading.Shobha

<p>Introduction: Here are a few papers fromCOLT 2008that I found interesting.Maria-Florina
Balcan,Steve Hanneke, andJenn Wortman,The True Sample Complexity of Active
Learning. This paper shows that in an asymptotic setting, active learning
isalwaysbetter than supervised learning (although the gap may be small). This
is evidence that the only thing in the way of universal active learning is us
knowing how to do it properly.Nir AilonandMehryar Mohri,An Efficient Reduction
of Ranking to Classification. This paper shows how to robustly ranknobjects
withn log(n)classifications using a quicksort based algorithm. The result is
applicable to many ranking loss functions and has implications for
others.Michael KearnsandJennifer Wortman.Learning from Collective Behavior.
This is about learning in a new model, where the goal is to predict how a
collection of interacting agents behave. One claim is that learning in this
setting can be reduced to IID learning.Due to the relation withMetric-E3, I

<p>Introduction: Here are some papers fromICML 2008that I found interesting.Risi
KondorandKarsten Borgwardt,The Skew Spectrum of Graphs. This paper is about a
new family of functions on graphs which is invariant under node label
permutation. They show that these quantities appear to yield good features for
learning.Sanjoy DasguptaandDaniel Hsu.Hierarchical sampling for active
learning.This is the first published practical consistent active learning
algorithm. The abstract is also pretty impressive.Lihong Li,Michael Littman,
andThomas WalshKnows What It Knows: A Framework For Self-Aware Learning.This
is an attempt to create learning algorithms that know when they err, (other
work includesVovk). It's not yet clear to me what the right model forfeature-
dependent confidence intervalsis.Novi Quadrianto,Alex Smola,TIberio Caetano,
andQuoc Viet LeEstimating Labels from Label Proportions. This is an example of
learning in a specialization of the offline contextual bandit setting.Filip

<p>Introduction: Reviewers and students are sometimes greatly concerned by the distinction
between:Anopen setand aclosed set.ASupremumand aMaximum.An event which happens
with probability 1 and an event that always happens.I don't appreciate this
distinction in machine learning & learning theory. All machine learning takes
place (by definition) on a machine where every parameter has finite precision.
Consequently, every set is closed, a maximal element always exists, and
probability 1 events always happen.The fundamental issue here is that
substantial parts of mathematics don't appear well-matched to computation in
the physical world, because the mathematics has concerns which are unphysical.
This mismatched mathematics makes irrelevant distinctions. We can ask "what
mathematics is appropriate to computation?"Andrejhas convinced me that a
pretty good answer to this question isconstructive mathematics.So, here's a
basic challenge: Can anyone name a situation where any of the distinctions

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! is sponsoring two machine learning events that might interest
people.TheKey Scientific Challengesprogram (due March 5) forMachine
LearningandStatisticsoffers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working
on a core problem of interest to Y! If you are already working on one of these
problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you aren't you might want
to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary
of the possible in Machine Learning. There are 7 days left.TheLearning to Rank
challenge(due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm
on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at
an ICML workshop. Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd,
3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreakthe ensembleencountered. If
you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all
learn something. There are 3 months left.</p><p>3 0.94068521 <a title="251-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-04-23-Jonathan_Chang_at_Slycoder.html">350 hunch net-2009-04-23-Jonathan Chang at Slycoder</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are a few of the papers I enjoyed at ICML.Steffen Bickel, Michael
BrÃƒÂ¼eckner,Tobias Scheffer,Discriminative Learning for Differing Training
and Test DistributionsThere is a nice trick in this paper: they predict the
probability that an unlabeled sample is in the training set vs. the test set,
and then use this prediction to importance weight labeled samples in the
training set. This paper uses a specific parametric model, but the approach is
easily generalized.Steve HannekeA Bound on the Label Complexity of Agnostic
Active LearningThis paper bounds the number of labels required by the
A2algorithm for active learning in the agnostic case. Last year we figured out
agnostic active learning was possible. This year, it's quantified. Hopefull
soon, it will be practical.Sylvian Gelly,David SilverCombining Online and
Offline Knowledge in UCT. This paper is about techniques for improvingMoGowith
various sorts of learning. MoGo has a fair claim at being the world's best Go
algorithm.There</p><p>5 0.90897036 <a title="251-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-26-NIPS_2010.html">420 hunch net-2010-12-26-NIPS 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I enjoyed attendingNIPSthis year, with several things interesting me. For the
conference itself:Peter Welinder,Steve Branson,Serge Belongie, andPietro
Perona,The Multidimensional Wisdom of Crowds. This paper is about
usingmechanical turkto get label information, with results superior to a
majority vote approach.David McAllester,Tamir Hazan, andJoseph KeshetDirect
Loss Minimization for Structured Prediction. This is about another technique
for directly optimizing the loss in structured prediction, with an application
to speech recognition.Mohammad SaberianandNuno VasconcelosBoosting Classifier
Cascades. This is about an algorithm for simultaneously optimizing loss and
computation in a classifier cascade construction. There were several other
papers on cascades which are worth looking at if interested.Alan FernandPrasad

<p>Introduction: Online learning is in vogue, which means we should expect to see in the near future:
  
 Online boosting. 
 Online decision trees. 
 Online SVMs.  (actually, we’ve already seen) 
 Online deep learning. 
 Online parallel learning. 
 etc… 
  
There are three fundamental drivers of this trend. 
  
 Increasing size of datasets makes online algorithms attractive.   
 Online learning can simply be more efficient than batch learning.  Here is a picture from a class on online learning: 
  
The point of this picture is that even in 3 dimensions and even with linear constraints, finding the minima of a set in an online fashion can be typically faster than finding the minima in a batch fashion.  To see this, note that there is a minimal number of gradient updates (i.e. 2) required in order to reach the minima in the typical case.  Given this, it’s best to do these updates as quickly as possible, which implies doing the first update online (i.e. before seeing all the examples) is preferred.

<p>Introduction: I learned a number of things at  NIPS .
  
 The financial people were there in greater force than previously.   Two Sigma  sponsored NIPS while  DRW Trading  had a booth. 
 The  adversarial machine learning workshop  had a number of talks about interesting applications where an adversary really is out to try and mess up your learning algorithm.  This is very different from the situation we often think of where the world is oblivious to our learning.  This may present new and convincing applications for the learning-against-an-adversary work common at  COLT . 
 There were several interesing papers.
 
  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Daniel Hsu , and  Claire Monteleoni  had a paper on  General Agnostic Active Learning .  The basic idea is that active learning can be done via reduction to a form of supervised learning problem.  This is great, because we have many supervised learning algorithms from which the benefits of active learning may be derived.

<p>Introduction: What?   Bounds are mathematical formulas relating observations to future error rates assuming that data is drawn independently.  In classical statistics, they are calld confidence intervals. 
 Why?  
  
  Good Judgement . In many applications of learning, it is desirable to know how well the learned predictor works in the future.  This helps you decide if the problem is solved or not. 
  Learning Essence .  The form of some of these bounds helps you understand what the essence of learning is. 
  Algorithm Design .  Some of these bounds suggest, motivate, or even directly imply learning algorithms. 
  
 What We Know Now 
 
There are several families of bounds, based on how information is used.
  
  Testing Bounds . These are methods which use labeled data not used in training to estimate the future error rate.  Examples include the  test set bound ,  progressive validation  also  here  and  here ,  train and test bounds , and cross-validation (but see the  big open problem ).  These tec</p><p>5 0.15927394 <a title="251-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-18-ICML_%26%23038%3B_COLT_2010.html">403 hunch net-2010-07-18-ICML &#038; COLT 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The papers which interested me most at  ICML  and  COLT  2010 were:
  
  Thomas Walsh ,  Kaushik Subramanian ,  Michael Littman  and  Carlos Diuk   Generalizing Apprenticeship Learning across Hypothesis Classes .  This paper formalizes and provides algorithms with guarantees for mixed-mode apprenticeship and traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, allowing RL algorithms that perform better than for either setting alone. 
  István Szita  and  Csaba Szepesvári   Model-based reinforcement learning with nearly tight exploration complexity bounds .  This paper and  another represent the frontier of best-known algorithm for Reinforcement Learning in a Markov Decision Process. 
  James Martens   Deep learning via Hessian-free optimization .  About a new not-quite-online second order gradient algorithm for learning deep functional structures.  Potentially this is very powerful because while people have often talked about end-to-end learning, it has rarely worked in practice.

<p>Introduction: Here are a few papers from  COLT 2008  that I found interesting.
  
  Maria-Florina Balcan ,  Steve Hanneke , and  Jenn Wortman ,  The True Sample Complexity of Active Learning .  This paper shows that in an asymptotic setting, active learning is  always  better than supervised learning (although the gap may be small).  This is evidence that the only thing in the way of universal active learning is us knowing how to do it properly. 
  Nir Ailon  and  Mehryar Mohri ,  An Efficient Reduction of Ranking to Classification .  This paper shows how to robustly rank  n  objects with  n log(n)  classifications using a quicksort based algorithm.  The result is applicable to many ranking loss functions and has implications for others.

<p>Introduction: Several papers at NIPS caught my attention.
  
  Elad Hazan  and  Satyen Kale ,  Online Submodular Optimization  They define an algorithm for online optimization of submodular functions with regret guarantees.  This places submodular optimization roughly on par with online convex optimization as tractable settings for online learning.   
  Elad Hazan  and  Satyen Kale   On Stochastic and Worst-Case Models of Investing .  At it’s core, this is yet another example of modifying worst-case online learning to deal with variance, but the application to financial models is particularly cool and it seems plausibly superior other common approaches for financial modeling. 
  Mark Palatucci ,  Dean Pomerlau ,  Tom Mitchell , and  Geoff Hinton   Zero Shot Learning with Semantic Output Codes  The goal here is predicting a label in a multiclass supervised setting where the label never occurs in the training data.  They have some basic analysis and also a nice application to FMRI brain reading.

<p>Introduction: Here are some papers from  ICML 2008  that I found interesting.  
  
  Risi Kondor  and  Karsten Borgwardt ,  The Skew Spectrum of Graphs . This paper is about a new family of functions on graphs which is invariant under node label permutation.  They show that these quantities appear to yield good features for learning. 
  Sanjoy Dasgupta  and  Daniel Hsu .   Hierarchical sampling for active learning.   This is the first published practical consistent active learning algorithm.  The abstract is also pretty impressive. 
  Lihong Li ,  Michael Littman , and  Thomas Walsh   Knows What It Knows: A Framework For Self-Aware Learning.   This is an attempt to create learning algorithms that know when they err, (other work includes  Vovk ).  It’s not yet clear to me what the right model for  feature-dependent confidence intervals  is.

  Elad Hazan  and  Comandur Seshadhri   Efficient learning algorithms for changing environments  at ICML.  This paper shows how to adapt learning algorithms that compete with fixed predictors to compete with changing policies.  The definition of regret they deal with seems particularly useful in many situation. 
  Hal Daume ,  Unsupervised Search-based Structured Prediction  at ICML.  This paper shows a technique for reducing unsupervised learning to supervised learning which (a) make a fast unsupervised learning algorithm and (b)  makes semisupervised learning both easy and highly effective.  
 There were two papers with similar results on active learning in the KWIK framework for linear regression, both reducing the sample complexity to .

<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.
 
 Background  A reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there are  k  possible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2 possible labels.   On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary classifier with some error rate  e .  After subtracting the minimum possible (Bayes) error rate  b , we get a regret  r = e – b .  The  PECOC (Probabilistic Error Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regret  r  implies multiclass regret at most  4r 0.5  .
 
 The problem  This is not the “rightest” answer.  Consider the  k=2  case, where we reduce binary to binary.  There exists a reduction (the identity) with the property that regret  r  implies regret  r .  This is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which suggests that a better reduction may exist for general  k .  For example, we can not rule out the possibility that a reduction</p><p>2 0.99493372 <a title="251-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-18-Lower_Bounds_for_Learning_Reductions.html">83 hunch net-2005-06-18-Lower Bounds for Learning Reductions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Learning reductions  transform a solver of one type of learning problem into a solver of another type of learning problem.  When we analyze these for robustness we can make statement of the form “Reduction  R  has the property that regret  r  (or loss) on subproblems of type  A  implies regret at most   f ( r )  on the original problem of type  B “.
 
A lower bound for a learning reduction would have the form “for all reductions  R , there exists a learning problem of type  B  and learning algorithm for problems of type  A  where regret  r  on induced problems implies  at least  regret  f ( r )  for  B “.
 
The pursuit of lower bounds is often questionable because, unlike upper bounds, they do not yield practical algorithms.  Nevertheless, they may be helpful as a tool for thinking about what is learnable and how learnable it is.  This has already come up  here  and  here .
 
At the moment, there is no coherent theory of lower bounds for learning reductions, and we have little understa</p><p>3 0.98194569 <a title="251-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-06-Bounds_greater_than_1.html">170 hunch net-2006-04-06-Bounds greater than 1</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nati Srebro  and  Shai Ben-David  have a  paper  at  COLT  which, in the appendix, proves something very striking: several previous error bounds are  always  greater than 1.
 
 Background  One branch of learning theory focuses on theorems which
  
 Assume samples are drawn IID from an unknown distribution  D . 
 Fix a set of classifiers 
 Find a high probability bound on the maximum true error rate (with respect to  D ) as a function of the empirical error rate on the training set.
 
  
Many of these bounds become extremely complex and hairy.

 
 Current  Everyone working on this subject wants “tighter bounds”, however there are different definitions of “tighter”.  Some groups focus on “functional tightness” (getting the right functional dependency between the size of the training set and a parameterization of the hypothesis space) while  others  focus on “practical tightness” (finding bounds which work well on practical problems).  (I am definitely in the second camp.)

<p>Introduction: Yahoo released the  Key Scientific Challenges  program.  There is a  Machine Learning  list I worked on and a  Statistics  list which  Deepak  worked on.
 
I’m hoping this is taken quite seriously by graduate students.  The primary value, is that it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research which would be valuable to make progress on.  A good strategy for a beginning graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make substantial advances for a PhD.  The directions are sufficiently general that I’m sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.
 
A secondary point, (which I’m sure is primary for many    ) is that there is money for graduate students here.  It’s unrestricted, so you can use it for any reasonable travel, supplies, etc…</p><p>5 0.9418602 <a title="251-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-08-Computability_in_Artificial_Intelligence.html">353 hunch net-2009-05-08-Computability in Artificial Intelligence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally I do not blog, but John kindly invited me to do so.  Since computability issues play a major role in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on that and raise some questions.
 
The general attitude is that AI is about finding efficient smart algorithms. For large parts of machine learning, the same attitude is not too dangerous. If you want to concentrate on conceptual problems, simply become a statistician. There is no analogous escape for modern research on AI (as opposed to  GOFAI  rooted in logic).

 
Let me show by analogy why  limiting research to computational questions is bad for any field. 
 
Except in computer science, computational aspects play little role in the development of  fundamental  theories: Consider e.g. set theory with axiom of choice, foundations of logic, exact/full minimax for zero-sum games, quantum (field) theory, string theory, … Indeed, at least in physics, every new fundamental theory seems to</p><p>same-blog 6 0.93344831 <a title="251-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-24-Interesting_Papers_at_ICML_2007.html">251 hunch net-2007-06-24-Interesting Papers at ICML 2007</a></p>

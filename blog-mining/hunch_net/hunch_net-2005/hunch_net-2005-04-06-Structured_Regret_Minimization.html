<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, Drew Bagnell and I started theRLBench projectto setup a
suite of reinforcement learning benchmark problems. We haven't been able to
touch it (due to lack of time) for a year so the project is on hold. Luckily,
there are several other projects such asCLSquareandRL-Gluewith a similar goal,
and we strongly endorse their continued development.I would like to explain
why, especially in the context of criticism of other learning benchmarks. For
example, sometimes theUCI Machine Learning Repositoryis criticized. There are
two criticisms I know of:Learning algorithms have overfit to the problems in
the repository. It is easy to imagine a mechanism for this happening
unintentionally. Strong evidence of this would be provided by learning
algorithms which perform great on the UCI machine learning repository but very
badly (relative to other learning algorithms) on non-UCI learning problems. I
have seen little evidence of this but it remains a point of concern. There is

<p>Introduction: Accountability is a social problem. When someone screws up, do you fire them?
Or do you accept the error and let them continue? This is a very difficult
problem and we all know of stories where the wrong decision was made.Online
learning(as meant here), is a subfield of learning theory which analyzes the
online learning model.In the online learning model, there are a set of
hypotheses or "experts". On any instantancex, each expert makes a predictiony.
A master algorithmAuses these predictions to form it's own predictionyAand
then learns the correct predictiony*. This process repeats.The goal of online
learning is to find a master algorithmAwhich uses the advice of the experts to
make good predictions. In particular, we typically want to guarantee that the
master algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert. IfL(e)is the loss
of experteandL(A)is the loss of the master algorithm, it is often possible to
prove:L(A) less than mineL(e) + log(number of experts)over all sequences.In

<p>Introduction: Halasksa very good question: "When is the right time to insert the loss
function?" In particular, should it be used at testing time or at training
time?When the world imposes a loss on us, the standard Bayesian recipe is to
predict the (conditional) probability of each possibility and then choose the
possibility which minimizes the expected loss. In contrast, as
theconfusionover "loss = money lost" or "loss = the thing you optimize" might
indicate, many people ignore the Bayesian approach and simply optimize their
loss (or a close proxy for their loss) over the representation on the training
set.The best answer I can give is "it's unclear, but I prefer optimizing the
loss at training time". My experience is that optimizing the loss in the most
direct manner possible typically yields best performance. This question is
related to a basic principle which bothYann LeCun(applied) andVladimir
Vapnik(theoretical) advocate: "solve the simplest prediction problem that
solves the problem". (One</p><p>6 0.089851514 <a title="53-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-05-An_ICML_reject.html">177 hunch net-2006-05-05-An ICML reject</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The ideal of theoretical algorithm analysis is to construct an algorithm with
accompanying optimality theorems proving that it is a useful algorithm. This
ideal often fails, particularly for learning algorithms and theory. The
general form of a theorem is:IfpreconditionsThenpostconditionsWhen we design
learning algorithms it is very common to come up with precondition assumptions
such as "the data is IID", "the learning problem is drawn from a known
distribution over learning problems", or "there is a perfect classifier". All
of these example preconditions can be false for real-world problems in ways
that are not easily detectable. This means that algorithms derived and
justified by these very common forms of analysis may be prone to catastrophic
failure in routine (mis)application.Wecanhope for better. Several different
kinds of learning algorithm analysis have been developed some of which have
fewer preconditions. Simply demanding that these forms of analysis be used may
be too stron</p><p>3 0.51287401 <a title="53-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-08-Fast_Physics_for_Learning.html">37 hunch net-2005-03-08-Fast Physics for Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: While everyone is silently working on ICML submissions, I found this
discussion about afast physics simulatorchip interesting from a learning
viewpoint. In many cases, learning attempts to predict the outcome of physical
processes. Access to a fast simulator for these processes might be quite
helpful in predicting the outcome. Bayesian learning in particular may
directly benefit while many other algorithms (like support vector machines)
might have their speed greatly increased.The biggest drawback is that writing
software for these odd architectures is always difficult and time consuming,
but a several-orders-of-magnitude speedup might make that worthwhile.</p><p>4 0.49707255 <a title="53-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-07-Interesting_Papers_at_SODA_2009.html">334 hunch net-2009-01-07-Interesting Papers at SODA 2009</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several talks seem potentially interesting to ML folks at this year's SODA
.Maria-Florina Balcan,Avrim Blum, andAnupam Gupta,Approximate Clustering
without the Approximation. This paper gives reasonable algorithms with
provable approximation guarantees for k-median and other notions of
clustering. It's conceptually interesting, because it's the second example
I've seen where NP hardness is subverted by changing the problem definition
subtle but reasonable way. Essentially, they show that if any near-
approximation to an optimal solution is good, then it's computationally easy
to find a near-optimal solution. This subtle shift bears serious thought. A
similar one occurred inour ranking paperwith respect to minimum feedback
arcset. With two known examples, it suggests that many more NP-complete
problems might be finessed into irrelevance in this style.Yury

<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don't fully understand the impact of
computation, as demonstrated by a lack ofbig-Oanalysis of new learning
algorithms. This is important--some current active research programs are
fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are
directly motivated by it. When considering a learning algorithm, I think about
the following questions:How does the learning algorithm scale with the number
of examplesm? Any algorithm using all of the data is at leastO(m), but in many
cases this isO(m2)(naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown
(k-means or many other optimization algorithms). The unknown case is very
common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn't convergent or
simply that the amount of computation isn't controlled.The above question can
also be asked for test cases. In some applications, test-time performance is
of great importance.How does the algorithm scale with the number of
featuresnper example? Many sec</p><p>6 0.47440815 <a title="53-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-04-21-Interesting_Presentations_at_Snowbird.html">349 hunch net-2009-04-21-Interesting Presentations at Snowbird</a></p>

these online algorithms is that they can't cope with structure very easily.
This drawback is addressed for certain structures.ExperimentsOne criticism of
such algorithms is that they are too "worst case". Several experiments suggest
that protecting yourself against this worst case does not necessarily incur a
great loss.</p><p>3 0.86973763 <a title="53-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML_Open_Questions_and_ICML_Instructions.html">458 hunch net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML Open Questions and ICML Instructions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sashais theopen problemschair for bothCOLTandICML. Open problems will be
presented in a joint session in the evening of the COLT/ICML overlap day. COLT
has a history of open sessions, but this is new for ICML. If you have a
difficult theoretically definable problem in machine learning, consider
submitting it for review,due March 16. You'll benefit three ways:The effort of
writing down a precise formulation of what you want often helps you understand
the nature of the problem.Your problem will be officially published and
citable.You might have it solved by some very intelligent bored people.The
general idea could easily be applied to any problem which can be crisply
stated with an easily verifiable solution, and we may consider expanding this
in later years, but for this year all problems need to be of a theoretical
variety.Joelleand I (andMahdi, andLaurent) finished an initial assignment

<p>Introduction: One standard approach for clustering data with a set of gaussians is using EM.
Roughly speaking, you pick a set ofkrandom guassians and then use alternating
expectation maximization to (hopefully) find a set of guassians that "explain"
the data well. This process is difficult to work with because EM can become
"stuck" in local optima. There are various hacks like "rerun withtdifferent
random starting points".One cool observation is that this can often be solved
via other algorithm which donotsuffer from local optima. This is an
earlypaperwhich shows this. Ravi Kannan presented anew papershowing this is
possible in a much more adaptive setting.A very rough summary of these papers
is that by projecting into a lower dimensional space, it is computationally
tractable to pick out the gross structure of the data. It is unclear how well
these algorithms work in practice, but they might be effective, especially if
used as a subroutine of the form:Project to low dimensional space.Pick out

<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made sinceSanjoypointed out the
significantlack of theoretical understanding of active learning. This is an
update on the progress I know of. As a refresher, active learning as meant
here is:There is a source of unlabeled data.There is an oracle from which
labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source.The goal is
to perform well with minimal use of the oracle.Here is what I've
learned:Sanjoy has developed sufficient and semi-necessary conditions for
active learning given the assumptions of IID data and "realizability" (that
one of the classifiers is a correct classifier).Nina,Alina, and I developed an
algorithm for active learning relying on only the assumption of IID data. A
draft ishere.Nicolo,Claudio, andLucashowed that it is possible to do active
learning in an entirely adversarial setting for linear threshold
classifiershere. This was published a year or two ago and I recently learned
about it.All of these results are relative</p><p>6 0.64001334 <a title="53-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks_for_RL.html">148 hunch net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks for RL</a></p>

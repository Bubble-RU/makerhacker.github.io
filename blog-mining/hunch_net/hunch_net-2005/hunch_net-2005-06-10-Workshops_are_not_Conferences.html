<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult.  As a conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good papers—enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to (generally) to grow the conference.  For someone choosing to participate in a new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work out?  Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you are sure will work?
 
The conference founding problem is a joint agreement problem with a very significant barrier.  Workshops are a way around this problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective means for this.  A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available.

<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4, 2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245 participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see our  WIKI  for more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as organizers to screw it up too bad.  Also, since we have pretty good infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this two-week long party of machine learning.
 
In the end of MLSS we distributed a survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from participants.

<p>Introduction: As usual  ICML 2007  will be hosting a  workshop program  to be held this year on June 24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I’d like to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for details. 
 
Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your choosing. I’ve always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-conference on a particular ML sub-area.  Hope to see some interesting proposals rolling in.</p><p>5 0.16484819 <a title="80-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-04-More_Presentation_Preparation.html">307 hunch net-2008-07-04-More Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We’ve discussed  presentation preparation before , but I have one more thing to add:  transitioning .  For a research presentation, it is substantially helpful for the audience if transitions are clear.  A common outline for a research presentation in machine leanring is:
  
  The problem .  Presentations which don’t describe the problem almost immediately lose people, because the context is missing to understand the detail. 
  Prior relevant work .  In many cases, a paper builds on some previous bit of work which must be understood in order to understand what the paper does.  A common failure mode seems to be spending too much time on prior work.  Discuss just the relevant aspects of prior work in the language of your work.  Sometimes this is missing when unneeded. 
  What we did . For theory papers in particular, it is often not possible to really cover the details.  Prioritizing what you present can be very important. 
  How it worked .  Many papers in Machine Learning have some sor</p><p>6 0.13610454 <a title="80-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-18-A_paper_not_at_Snowbird.html">431 hunch net-2011-04-18-A paper not at Snowbird</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference.  Since many people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial challenge.  Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about preparing a presentation on research.
  
  Motivate .  Talks which don’t start by describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out. 
  Prioritize .  It is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much.  This is an easy-to-understand failure mode as it’s very natural to want to include everything.  A basic fact is: you can’t.  Example of this are:
 
 Your slides are so densely full of equations and words that you can’t cover them. 
 Your talk runs over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off. 
 You motor-mouth through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience prioritizes in some uncontrolled fashion.

<p>Introduction: … and you should use that fact.
 
A workshop differs from a conference in that it is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic.  It also differs in that a workshop is typically a “one-time affair” rather than a series.  (The  Snowbird learning workshop  counts as a conference in this respect.)  
 
A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop is to treat it as a conference.  This is “ok”, but it is not really taking advantage of the situation.  Here are some things I’ve learned:
  
 For speakers: A smaller audience means it can be more interactive.  Interactive means a better chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation (because you can adapt to your audience).  Greater focus amongst the participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and discuss tradeoffs more carefully.  Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued than newness. 
 For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference st</p><p>2 0.65612715 <a title="80-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-25-1_year.html">151 hunch net-2006-01-25-1 year</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the one year (+5 days) anniversary, the natural question is: “Was it helpful for research?”
 
Answer: Yes, and so it shall continue.
 
Some evidence is provided by noticing that I am about a factor of 2 more overloaded with paper ideas than I’ve ever previously been.  It is always hard to estimate counterfactual worlds, but I expect that this is also a factor of 2 more than “What if I had not started the blog?”
 
As for “Why?”, there seem to be two primary effects.
  
 A blog is a mechanism for connecting with people who either think like you or are interested in the same problems.  This allows for concentration of thinking which is very helpful in solving problems. 
 The process of stating things you don’t understand publicly is very helpful in understanding them.  Sometimes you are simply forced to express them in a way which aids understanding.  Sometimes someone else says something which helps.  And sometimes you discover that someone else has already solved the problem.

<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time.

<p>Introduction: Last year about this time, we received a conditional accept for the  searn paper , which asked us to reference a paper that was not reasonable to cite because there was strictly more relevant work by the same authors that we already cited.  We wrote a response explaining this, and didn’t cite it in the final draft, giving the SPC an excuse to  reject the paper , leading to unhappiness for all.
 
Later,  Sanjoy Dasgupta  suggested that an alternative was to talk to the PC chair instead, as soon as you see that a conditional accept is unreasonable.   William Cohen  and I spoke about this by email, the relevant bit of which is:
  

If an SPC asks for a revision that is inappropriate, the correct 
action is to contact the chairs as soon as the decision is made, 
clearly explaining what the problem is, so we can decide whether or 
not to over-rule the SPC.  As you say, this is extra work for us 
chairs, but that’s part of the job, and we’re willing to do that sort 
of work to improve the ov</p><p>5 0.47395504 <a title="80-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML.  I did manage to catch one interesting paper:
 
 Richard Socher ,  Cliff Lin ,  Andrew Y. Ng , and  Christopher D. Manning   Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks .
 
I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so hopefully we’ll hear from him soon.  In the meantime,  Paul  and  Hal  have posted some lists.
 
 the future 
 
 Joelle  and I are program chairs for ICML 2012 in  Edinburgh , which I previously enjoyed visiting in  2005 .  This is a huge responsibility, that we hope to accomplish well.  A part of this (perhaps the most fun part), is imagining how we can make ICML better.  A key and critical constraint is choosing things that can be accomplished.  So far we have:
  
  Colocation . The first thing we looked into was potential colocations.  We quickly discovered that many other conferences precomitted their location.

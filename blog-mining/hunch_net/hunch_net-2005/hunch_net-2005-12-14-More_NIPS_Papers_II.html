<p>Introduction: Probability is one of the most confusingly used words in machine learning.
There are at least 3 distinct ways the word is used.BayesianThe Bayesian
notion of probability is a 'degree of belief'. The degree of belief that some
event (i.e. "stock goes up" or "stock goes down") occurs can be measured by
asking a sequence of questions of the form "Would you bet the stock goes up or
down atYto 1 odds?" A consistent better will switch from 'for' to 'against' at
some single value ofY. The probability is thenY/(Y+1). Bayesian probabilities
express lack of knowledge rather than randomization. They are useful in
learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly
makes the learning algorithms work better. Bayesian Learning uses
'probability' in this way exclusively.FrequentistThe Frequentist notion of
probability is a rate of occurence. A rate of occurrence can be measured by
doing an experiment many times. If an event occursktimes innexperiments then
it has probability ab</p><p>3 0.12090401 <a title="140-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-18-It%26%238217%3Bs_MDL_Jim%2C_but_not_as_we_know_it%26%238230%3B%28on_Bayes%2C_MDL_and_consistency%29.html">263 hunch net-2007-09-18-It&#8217;s MDL Jim, but not as we know it&#8230;(on Bayes, MDL and consistency)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Forlearning reductionswe have been concentrating on reducing various complex
learning problems to binary classification. This choice needs to be actively
questioned, because it was not carefully considered.Binary clasification is
learning a classifierc:X -> {0,1}so as to minimize the probability of being
wrong,Prx,y~D(c(x)y).The primary alternative candidate seems to be squared
error regression. In squared error regression, you learn a regressors:X ->
[0,1]so as to minimize squared error,Ex,y~D(s(x)-y)2.It is difficult to judge
one primitive against another. The judgement must at least partially be made
on nontheoretical grounds because (essentially) we are evaluating a choice
between two axioms/assumptions.These two primitives are significantly related.
Classification can be reduced to regression in the obvious way: you use the
regressor to predictD(y=1|x), then threshold at0.5. For this simple reduction
a squared error regret ofrimplies a classification regret of at mostr0.5.

<p>Introduction: Here's a list of papers that I found interesting atICML/COLT/UAIin 2009.Elad
HazanandComandur SeshadhriEfficient learning algorithms for changing
environmentsat ICML. This paper shows how to adapt learning algorithms that
compete with fixed predictors to compete with changing policies. The
definition of regret they deal with seems particularly useful in many
situation.Hal Daume,Unsupervised Search-based Structured Predictionat ICML.
This paper shows a technique for reducing unsupervised learning to supervised
learning which (a) make a fast unsupervised learning algorithm and (b) makes
semisupervised learning both easy and highly effective.There were two papers
with similar results on active learning in the KWIK framework for linear
regression, both reducing the sample complexity to . One wasNicolo Cesa-

<p>Introduction: Following up on Hal Daume's post and John's post on cool and interesting
things seen at NIPS I'll post my own little list of neat papers here as well.
Of course it's going to be biased towards what I think is interesting. Also, I
have to say that I hadn't been able to see many papers this year at nips due
to myself being too busy, so please feel free to contribute the papers that
you liked1. P. Mudigonda, V. Kolmogorov, P. Torr. An Analysis of Convex
Relaxations for MAP Estimation. A surprising paper which shows that many of
the more sophisticated convex relaxations that had been proposed recently
turns out to be subsumed by the simplest LP relaxation. Be careful next time
you try a cool new convex relaxation!2. D. Sontag, T. Jaakkola. New Outer
Bounds on the Marginal Polytope. The title says it all. The marginal polytope
is the set of local marginal distributions over subsets of variables that are
globally consistent in the sense that there is at least one distribution over
all the va</p><p>3 0.65246749 <a title="140-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Maximum_Margin_Mismatch%3F.html">77 hunch net-2005-05-29-Maximum Margin Mismatch?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John makes a fascinating point about structured classification (and slightly
scooped my post!). Maximum Margin Markov Networks (M3N) are an interesting
example of the second class of structured classifiers (where the
classification of one label depends on the others), and one of my favorite
papers. I'm not alone: the paper won the best student paper award at NIPS in
2003.There are some things I find odd about the paper. For instance, it says
of probabilistic models"cannot handle high dimensional feature spaces and lack
strong theoretical guarrantees."I'm aware of no such limitations.
Also:"Unfortunately, even probabilistic graphical models that are trained
discriminatively do not achieve the same level of performance as SVMs,
especially when kernel features are used."This is quite interesting and
contradicts my own experience as well as that of a number of
peopleIgreatlyrespect. I wonder what the root cause is: perhaps there is
something different about the data Ben+Carlos were working</p><p>4 0.64419276 <a title="140-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-18-It%26%238217%3Bs_MDL_Jim%2C_but_not_as_we_know_it%26%238230%3B%28on_Bayes%2C_MDL_and_consistency%29.html">263 hunch net-2007-09-18-It&#8217;s MDL Jim, but not as we know it&#8230;(on Bayes, MDL and consistency)</a></p>

conference. First, let me say thatSanjoy's talk,Coarse Sample Complexity

finding Nash equilibria.And, speaking of tagging, I thinkthe U.Mass Citeseer

recommendations for specific papers:Z. Ghahramani, K. Heller:Bayesian Sets[no

<p>Introduction: I thought this was a very good NIPS with many excellent papers. The following
are a few NIPS papers which I liked and I hope to study more carefully when I
get the chance. The list is not exhaustive and in no particular
order…Preconditioner Approximations for Probabilistic Graphical
Models.Pradeeep Ravikumar and John Lafferty.I thought the use of
preconditioner methods from solving linear systems in the context of
approximate inference was novel and interesting. The results look good and I'd
like to understand the limitations.Rodeo: Sparse nonparametric regression in
high dimensions.John Lafferty and Larry Wasserman.A very interesting approach
to feature selection in nonparametric regression from a frequentist framework.
The use of lengthscale variables in each dimension reminds me a lot of
'Automatic Relevance Determination' in Gaussian process regression -- it would
be interesting to compare Rodeo to ARD in GPs.Interpolating between types and

<p>Introduction: Andrej Bauer has setup aMathematics and ComputationBlog. As a first step he
has tried to address the persistent and annoying problem of math on the web.
As a basic tool for precisely stating and transfering understanding of
technical subjects, mathematics is very necessary. Despite this necessity,
every mechanism for expressing mathematics on the web seems unnaturally
clumsy. Here are some of the methods and their drawbacks:MathMLThis was
supposed to be the answer, but it has two severe drawbacks: "Internet
Explorer" doesn't read it and the language is an example of push-XML-to-the-
limit which no one would ever consider writing in. (In contrast, html is easy
to write in.) It's also very annoying that math fonts must be installed
independent of the browser, even for mozilla based browsers.Create inline
images. This has several big drawbacks: font size is fixed for all viewers,
you can't cut & paste inside the images, and you can't hyperlink from (say)
symbol to definition.Math Worldis</p><p>3 0.70705473 <a title="140-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-19-How_is_Compressed_Sensing_going_to_change_Machine_Learning_%3F.html">248 hunch net-2007-06-19-How is Compressed Sensing going to change Machine Learning ?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Compressed Sensing(CS) is a new framework developed byEmmanuel Candes,Terry
TaoandDavid Donoho. To summarize, if you acquire a signal in some basis that
is incoherent with the basis in which you know the signal to be sparse in, it
is very likely you will be able to reconstruct the signal from these
incoherent projections.Terry Tao, the recentFields medalist, does a very nice
job at explaining the frameworkhere. He goes further in the theory description
in thispostwhere he mentions the central issue of the Uniform Uncertainty
Principle. It so happens that random projections are on average incoherent,
within the UUP meaning, with most known basis (sines, polynomials, splines,
wavelets, curvelets …) and are therefore an ideal basis for Compressed
Sensing. [ For more in-depth information on the subject, the Rice group has
done a very good job at providing a central library of papers relevant to the
growing subject:http://www.dsp.ece.rice.edu/cs/]The Machine Learning community

<p>Introduction: Often, unlabeled data is easy to come by but labels are expensive. For
instance, if you're building a speech recognizer, it's easy enough to get raw
speech samples -- just walk around with a microphone -- but labeling even one
of these samples is a tedious process in which a human must examine the speech
signal and carefully segment it into phonemes. In the field of active
learning, the goal is as usual to construct an accurate classifier, but the
labels of the data points are initially hidden and there is a charge for each
label you want revealed. The hope is that by intelligent adaptive querying,
you can get away with significantly fewer labels than you would need in a
regular supervised learning framework.Here's an example. Suppose the data lie
on the real line, and the classifiers are simple thresholding functions, H =
{hw}:hw(x) = 1 if x > w, and 0 otherwise.VC theory tells us that if the
underlying distribution P can be classified perfectly by some hypothesis in H

<p>Introduction: "Search" is the other branch of AI research which has been succesful. Concrete
examples includeDeep Bluewhich beat the world chess champion andChinookthe
champion checkers program. A set of core search techniques exist including A*,
alpha-beta pruning, and others that can be applied to any of many different
search problems.Given this, it may be surprising to learn that there has been
relatively little succesful work on combining prediction and search. Given
also that humans typically solve search problems using a number of predictive
heuristics to narrow in on a solution, we might be surprised again. However,
the big successful search-based systems have typically not used "smart" search
algorithms. Insteady they have optimized for very fast search. This is not for
lack of tryingâ&euro;Ś many people have tried to synthesize search and prediction to
various degrees of success. For example,Knightcapachieves good-but-not-stellar
chess playing performance, andTD-gammonhas achieved near-optimal Bac</p><p>6 0.43261442 <a title="140-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-18-It%26%238217%3Bs_MDL_Jim%2C_but_not_as_we_know_it%26%238230%3B%28on_Bayes%2C_MDL_and_consistency%29.html">263 hunch net-2007-09-18-It&#8217;s MDL Jim, but not as we know it&#8230;(on Bayes, MDL and consistency)</a></p>

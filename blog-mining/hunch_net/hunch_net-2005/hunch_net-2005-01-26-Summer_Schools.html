<p>Introduction: Chicago '05ended a couple of weeks ago. This was the sixthMachine Learning
Summer School, and the second one that used awiki. (The first was Berder '04,
thanks to Gunnar Raetsch.) Wikis are relatively easy to set up, greatly aid
social interaction, and should be used a lot more at summer schools and
workshops. They can even be used as the meeting's webpage, as a permanent
record of its participants' collaborations -- see for example the wiki/website
for last year'sNVO Summer School.A basic wiki is a collection of editable
webpages, maintained by software called awiki engine. The engine used at both
Berder and Chicago wasTikiWiki-- it is well documented and gets you something
running fast. It uses PHP and MySQL, but doesn't require you to know either.
Tikiwiki has far more features than most wikis, as it is really a fullContent
Management System. (My thanks to Sebastian Stark for pointing this out.) Here
are the features we found most useful:Bulletin boards, or forums. The most-

summer date. (Presumably, this is to avoid melting people in the Indian
summer.)The paper deadline(June 23 abstract / June 30 submission) are
particularly inconvenient if you attendCOLTorICML. But on the other hand, it's
a good excuse to visit India.</p><p>6 0.6129443 <a title="4-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-13-Wikis_for_Summer_Schools_and_Workshops.html">81 hunch net-2005-06-13-Wikis for Summer Schools and Workshops</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are a few papers fromCOLT 2008that I found interesting.Maria-Florina
Balcan,Steve Hanneke, andJenn Wortman,The True Sample Complexity of Active
Learning. This paper shows that in an asymptotic setting, active learning
isalwaysbetter than supervised learning (although the gap may be small). This
is evidence that the only thing in the way of universal active learning is us
knowing how to do it properly.Nir AilonandMehryar Mohri,An Efficient Reduction
of Ranking to Classification. This paper shows how to robustly ranknobjects
withn log(n)classifications using a quicksort based algorithm. The result is
applicable to many ranking loss functions and has implications for
others.Michael KearnsandJennifer Wortman.Learning from Collective Behavior.
This is about learning in a new model, where the goal is to predict how a
collection of interacting agents behave. One claim is that learning in this
setting can be reduced to IID learning.Due to the relation withMetric-E3, I

<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point
of view of an undergraduate. The shift from a class-taking mentality to a
research mentality is very significant and not easy.Problem PosingPosing the
right problem is often as important as solving them. Many people can get by in
research by solving problems others have posed, but that's not sufficient for
really inspiring research. For learning in particular, there is a strong
feeling that we just haven't figured out which questions are the right ones to
ask. You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem
convincing.Gambling your lifeWhen you do research, you think very hard about
new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions. Many
conversations are of the form "I wonder what would happen if…" These processes
can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours. The worst part is that
you'll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and
sometimes not even then be</p><p>6 0.13544048 <a title="4-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-10-Interesting_papers%2C_ICML_2008.html">309 hunch net-2008-07-10-Interesting papers, ICML 2008</a></p>

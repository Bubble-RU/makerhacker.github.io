<p>Introduction: Probability is one of the most confusingly used words in machine learning.
There are at least 3 distinct ways the word is used.BayesianThe Bayesian
notion of probability is a 'degree of belief'. The degree of belief that some
event (i.e. "stock goes up" or "stock goes down") occurs can be measured by
asking a sequence of questions of the form "Would you bet the stock goes up or
down atYto 1 odds?" A consistent better will switch from 'for' to 'against' at
some single value ofY. The probability is thenY/(Y+1). Bayesian probabilities
express lack of knowledge rather than randomization. They are useful in
learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly
makes the learning algorithms work better. Bayesian Learning uses
'probability' in this way exclusively.FrequentistThe Frequentist notion of

<p>Introduction: This post is really for peoplenotin machine learning (or related fields). It
is about a common misperception which affects people who have not thought
about the process of trying to predict somethinng. Hopefully, by precisely
stating it, we can remove it.Suppose we have a set of events, each described
by a vector of features.01011101011101000111110011000101110Suppose we want to
predict the value of the first feature given the others. One approach is to
bin the data byonefeature. For the above example, we might partition the data
according to feature 2, then observe that when feature 2 is 0 the label
(feature 1) is mostly 1. On the other hand, when feature 2 is 1, the label
(feature 1) is mostly 0. Using this simple rule we get an observed error rate
of 3/7.There are two issues here. The first is that this is really a training
error rate, and (hence) may be an overoptimistic prediction. This is not a
very serious issue as long as there are a reasonable number of representative

<p>Introduction: Rich Caruana,Alexandru Niculescu, Geoff Crew, and Alex Ksikes have donea lot
of empirical testingwhich shows thatusing all methods to make a predictionis
more powerful than using any single method. This is in rough agreement with
the Bayesian way of solving problems, but based upon a different (essentially
empirical) motivation. A rough summary is:Take all of {decision trees, boosted
decision trees, bagged decision trees, boosted decision stumps, K nearest
neighbors, neural networks, SVM} with all reasonable parameter settings.Run
the methods on each problem of 8 problems with a large test set, calibrating
margins using eithersigmoid fittingorisotonic regression.For each loss of
{accuracy, area under the ROC curve, cross entropy, squared error, etcâ&euro;Ś}
evaluate the average performance of the method.A series of conclusions can be
drawn from the observations.(Calibrated) boosted decision trees appear to
perform best, in general although support vector machines and neural networks

<p>Introduction: Sam Roweis's comment reminds me of a more general issue that comes up in doing
research: abstractions always break.Real number's aren't. Most real numbers
can not be represented with any machine. One implication of this is that many
real-number based algorithms have difficulties when implemented with floating
point numbers.The box on your desk is not a turing machine. A turing machine
can compute anything computable, given sufficient time. A typical computer
fails terribly when the state required for the computation exceeds some
limit.Nash equilibria aren't equilibria. This comes up when trying to predict
human behavior based on the result of the equilibria computation. Often, it
doesn't work.Theprobabilityisn't. Probability is an abstraction expressing
either our lack of knowledge (the Bayesian viewpoint) or fundamental
randomization (the frequentist viewpoint). From the frequentist viewpoint the
lack of knowledge typically precludes actually knowing the fundamental
randomization. Fro</p><p>6 0.55724591 <a title="62-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-07-A_NIPS_paper.html">330 hunch net-2008-12-07-A NIPS paper</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A calibrated predictor is one which predicts the probability of a binary event
with the property: For all predictionsp, the proportion of the time that1is
observed isp.Since there are infinitely manyp, this definition must be
"softened" to make sense for any finite number of samples. The standard method
for "softening" is to consider all predictions in a small neighborhood about
each possiblep.A great deal of effort has been devoted to strategies for
achieving calibrated (such ashere) prediction. With statements like: (under
minimal conditions) you can always make calibrated predictions.Given the
strength of these statements, we might conclude we are done, but that would be
a "confusion of ends". A confusion of ends arises in the following way:We want
good probabilistic predictions.Good probabilistic predictions are
calibrated.Therefore, we want calibrated predictions.The "Therefore" step
misses the fact that calibration is a necessary but not

<p>Introduction: One thing which is clear on a little reflection is that there exists a single
master learning problem capable of encoding essentially all learning problems.
This problem is of course a very general sort of reinforcement learning where
the world interacts with an agent as:The world announces an observationx.The
agent makes a choicea.The world announces a rewardr.The goal here is to
maximize the sum of the rewards over the time of the agent. No particular
structure relatingxtoaoratoris implied by this setting so we do not know
effective general algorithms for the agent. It's very easy to prove lower
bounds showing that an agent cannot hope to succeed here--just consider the
case where actions are unrelated to rewards. Nevertheless, there is a real
sense in which essentially all forms of life are agents operating in this
setting, somehow succeeding. The gap between these observations drives
research--How can we find tractable specializations of the master problem

<p>Introduction: Muthuinvited me to the workshop onalgorithms in the field, with the goal of
providing a sense of where near-term research should go. When the time came
though, I bargained for a post instead, which provides a chance for many other
people to comment.There are several things I didn't fully understand when I
went to Yahoo! about 5 years ago. I'd like to repeat them as people in
academia may not yet understand them intuitively.Almost all the big impact
algorithms operate in pseudo-linear or better time. Think about caching,
hashing, sorting, filtering, etcâ&euro;Ś and you have a sense of what some of the
most heavily used algorithms are. This matters quite a bit to Machine Learning
research, because people often work with superlinear time algorithms and
languages. Two very common examples of this are graphical models, where
inference is often a superlinear operation--think about then2dependence on the
number of states in aHidden Markov Modeland KernelizedSupport Vector

<p>Introduction: If you search for "online learning" with anymajorsearchengine, it's
interesting to note that zero of the results are for online machine learning.
This may not be a mistake if you are committed to a global ordering. In other
words, the number of people specifically interested in the least interesting
top-10 online human learning result might exceed the number of people
interested in online machine learning, even given the presence of the other 9
results. The essential observation here is that the process of human learning
is a big business (around 5% of GDP) effecting virtually everyone.The internet
is changing this dramatically, by altering the economics of teaching. Consider
two possibilities:The classroom-style teaching environment continues as is,
with many teachers for the same subject.All the teachers for one subject get
together, along with perhaps a factor of 2 more people who are experts in
online delivery. They spend a factor of 4 more time designing the perfect

<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This

<p>Introduction: At the one year (+5 days) anniversary, the natural question is: "Was it
helpful for research?"Answer: Yes, and so it shall continue.Some evidence is
provided by noticing that I am about a factor of 2 more overloaded with paper
ideas than I've ever previously been. It is always hard to estimate
counterfactual worlds, but I expect that this is also a factor of 2 more than
"What if I had not started the blog?"As for "Why?", there seem to be two
primary effects.A blog is a mechanism for connecting with people who either
think like you or are interested in the same problems. This allows for
concentration of thinking which is very helpful in solving problems.The
process of stating things you don't understand publicly is very helpful in
understanding them. Sometimes you are simply forced to express them in a way
which aids understanding. Sometimes someone else says something which helps.
And sometimes you discover that someone else has already solved the
problem.There are drawbacks which shou</p><p>6 0.20863807 <a title="96-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I found the article aboutscience using modern tools interesting, especially
the part about 'blogophobia', which in my experience is often a substantial
issue: many potential guest posters aren't quite ready, because of the fear of
a permanent public mistake, because it is particularly hard to write about the
unknown (the essence of research), and because the system for public credit
doesn't yet really handle blog posts.So far, science has been relatively
resistant to discussing research on blogs. Some things need to change to get
there. Public tolerance of the occasional mistake is essential, as is a
willingness to cite (and credit) blogs as freely as papers.I've often run into
another reason for holding back myself: I don't want to overtalk my own
research. Nevertheless, I'm slowly changing to the opinion that I'm holding
back too much: the real power of a blog in research is that it can be used to
confer with many people, and that just makes research work better.</p><p>5 0.6946879 <a title="96-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>

to have a multiauthor blog which is more specialized towards learning

be of wider interest.</p><p>6 0.69242036 <a title="96-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-25-1_year.html">151 hunch net-2006-01-25-1 year</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Dean FosterandDaniel Hsuhad a couple observations about reductions to
regression that I wanted to share. This will make the most sense for people
familiar with error correcting output codes (see thetutorial, page 11).Many
people are comfortable using linear regression in a one-against-all style,
where you try to predict the probability of choiceivs other classes, yet they
are not comfortable with more complex error correcting codes because they fear
that they create harder problems. This fear turns out to be mathematically
incoherent under a linear representation: comfort in the linear case should
imply comfort with more complex codes.In particular, If there exists a set of
weight vectorswisuch thatP(i|x)=, then for any invertible error
correcting output codeC, there exists weight vectorswcwhich decode to
perfectly predict the probability of each class. The proof is simple and
constructive: the weight vectorwccan be constructed according to the linear

<p>Introduction: This is an attempt to organize the broad research programs related to machine
learning currently underway. This isn't easy--this map is partial, the
categories often overlap, and there are many details left out. Nevertheless,
it is (perhaps) helpful to have some map of what is happening where. The word
'typical' should not be construed narrowly here.Learning TheoryFocuses on
analyzing mathematical models of learning, essentially no experiments. Typical
conference: COLT.Bayesian LearningBayes law is always used. Focus on methods
of speeding up or approximating integration, new probabilistic models, and
practical applications. Typical conferences: NIPS,UAIStructured

<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given
framework or mathematical model. It turns out that all of these models are
significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning. I've
created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of
machine learning.The point here is not simply "woe unto us". There are several
implications which seem important.The multitude of models is a point of
continuing confusion. It is common for people to learn about machine learning
within one framework which often becomes there "home framework" through which
they attempt to filter all machine learning. (Have you met people who can only
think in terms of kernels? Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)
Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help
resolve the confusion. This is particularly important when reviewing and
particularly important for students.Algorithms which conform to multiple
approaches can have substantial</p><p>6 0.7747317 <a title="96-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-18-Decision_by_Vetocracy.html">343 hunch net-2009-02-18-Decision by Vetocracy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time. 
  Feedback failure .  This blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from</p><p>3 0.22986601 <a title="96-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-25-1_year.html">151 hunch net-2006-01-25-1 year</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the one year (+5 days) anniversary, the natural question is: “Was it helpful for research?”
 
Answer: Yes, and so it shall continue.
 
Some evidence is provided by noticing that I am about a factor of 2 more overloaded with paper ideas than I’ve ever previously been.  It is always hard to estimate counterfactual worlds, but I expect that this is also a factor of 2 more than “What if I had not started the blog?”
 
As for “Why?”, there seem to be two primary effects.
  
 A blog is a mechanism for connecting with people who either think like you or are interested in the same problems.  This allows for concentration of thinking which is very helpful in solving problems. 
 The process of stating things you don’t understand publicly is very helpful in understanding them.  Sometimes you are simply forced to express them in a way which aids understanding.  Sometimes someone else says something which helps.  And sometimes you discover that someone else has already solved the problem.

<p>Introduction: This is the  6 month point  in the “run a research blog” experiment, so it seems like a good point to take stock and assess.  
 
One fundamental question is: “Is it worth it?”  The idea of running a research blog will never become widely popular and useful unless it actually aids research.  On the negative side, composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount of time.  On the positive side, the process might yield better research because there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster thinking.
 
My answer at the moment is a provisional “yes”.  Running the blog has been incidentally helpful in several ways:
  
 It is sometimes educational.  example  
 More often, the process of composing thoughts well enough to post simply aids thinking.  This has resulted in a couple solutions to problems of  interest  (and perhaps more over time).  If you really want to solve a problem, letting the world know is helpful.  This isn’t necessarily</p><p>2 0.84651846 <a title="96-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-14-What_Learning_Theory_might_do.html">95 hunch net-2005-07-14-What Learning Theory might do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on this  post  and some of the previous  problems/research directions  about where learning theory might make large strides.  
  
  Why theory?   The essential reason for theory is “intuition extension”.  A very good applied learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the best computer algorithms for solving that problem.  A very good theory can take the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion.  To do this, we take these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:
 
 Explains the basic intuitions. 
 Makes new testable predictions about how to learn. 
 Succeeds in so learning. 
 

This is “intuition extension”: taking what we have learned somewhere else and applying it in new domains.  It is fundamentally useful to everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving problems.

 
  Where next for learning theory?  I like the a</p><p>3 0.83346218 <a title="96-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-26-Summer_Schools.html">4 hunch net-2005-01-26-Summer Schools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are several summer schools related to machine learning.
 
We are running a two week  machine learning summer school  in Chicago, USA May 16-27.  
 
IPAM is running a more focused three week summer school on  Intelligent Extraction of Information from Graphs and High Dimensional Data  in Los Angeles, USA July 11-29.

<p>Introduction: If we accept that bad reviewing often occurs and want to fix it, the question is “how”?
 
Reviewing is done by paper writers just like yourself, so a good proxy for this question is asking “How can I be a better reviewer?”  Here are a few things I’ve learned by trial (and error), as a paper writer, and as a reviewer.
  
 The secret ingredient is careful thought.  There is no good substitution for a deep and careful understanding. 
 Avoid reviewing papers that you feel competitive about.  You almost certainly will be asked to review papers that feel competitive if you work on subjects of common interest.  But, the feeling of competition can easily lead to bad judgement. 
 If you feel biased for some other reason, then you should avoid reviewing.  For example… 
 Feeling angry or threatened by a paper is a form of bias.  See above. 
 Double blind yourself (avoid looking at the name even in a single-blind situation).  The significant effect of a name you recognize is making you pay close a</p><p>5 0.79731035 <a title="96-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research.  They provide many roles including “announcing research”, “meeting people”, and  “point of reference”.  Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: “to what extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?”  This question is very difficult to answer in any satisfying way.  What we can do is compare details of the process across multiple conferences.
  
  Comments   The average quality of comments across conferences can vary dramatically.  At one extreme, the tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback.  At the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing detailed constructive feedback.  Detailed feedback can give authors significant guidance about how to improve research.  This is the most subjective entry. 
  Blind  Virtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors do not know reviewers.  Some also provide  double blind  review where rev</p><p>6 0.79400378 <a title="96-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

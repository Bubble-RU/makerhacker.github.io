<p>Introduction: This is the  6 month point  in the “run a research blog” experiment, so it seems like a good point to take stock and assess.  
 
One fundamental question is: “Is it worth it?”  The idea of running a research blog will never become widely popular and useful unless it actually aids research.  On the negative side, composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount of time.  On the positive side, the process might yield better research because there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster thinking.
 
My answer at the moment is a provisional “yes”.  Running the blog has been incidentally helpful in several ways:
  
 It is sometimes educational.  example  
 More often, the process of composing thoughts well enough to post simply aids thinking.  This has resulted in a couple solutions to problems of  interest  (and perhaps more over time).  If you really want to solve a problem, letting the world know is helpful.

<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.  
  
 It’s entirely reasonable for anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don’t have a paper.  For students, visiting a conference is almost a ‘must’—there is no where else that a broad cross-section of research is on display. 
 Workshops are also a very good idea.   ICML has 11 ,  KDD has 9 , and  AAAI has 19 .  Workshops provide an opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research.  They are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research because they are so interactive. 
 Tutorials are a good way to gain some understanding of a long-standing direction of research.  They are generally more coherent than workshops.   ICML has 7  and  AAAI has 15 .</p><p>4 0.16363104 <a title="92-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-13-%26%238220%3BSister_Conference%26%238221%3B_presentations.html">93 hunch net-2005-07-13-&#8220;Sister Conference&#8221; presentations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some of the “sister conference” presentations at  AAAI  have been great.  Roughly speaking, the conference organizers asked other conference organizers to come give a summary of their conference.  Many different AI-related conferences accepted.  The presenters typically discuss some of the background and goals of the conference then mention the results from a few papers they liked.  This is great because it provides a mechanism to get a digested overview of the work of several thousand researchers—something which is simply available nowhere else.
 
Based on these presentations, it looks like there is a significant component of (and opportunity for) applied machine learning in  AIIDE ,  IUI , and  ACL .
 
There was also some discussion of having a super-colocation event similar to  FCRC , but centered on AI & Learning.  This seems like a fine idea.  The field is fractured across so many different conferences that the mixing of a supercolocation seems likely helpful for research.</p><p>5 0.15900496 <a title="92-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-13-David_Pennock_starts_Oddhead.html">214 hunch net-2006-10-13-David Pennock starts Oddhead</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is about a general technique for problem solving which I’ve never seen taught (in full generality), but which I’ve found very useful.
 
Many problems in computer science turn out to be discretely difficult.  The best known version of such problems are NP-hard problems, but I mean ‘discretely difficult’ in a much more general way, which I only know how to capture by examples.
  
  ERM  In empirical risk minimization, you choose a minimum error rate classifier from a set of classifiers.  This is NP hard for common sets, but it can be much harder, depending on the set. 
  Experts  In the online learning with experts setting, you try to predict well so as to compete with a set of (adversarial) experts.  Here the alternating quantifiers of you and an adversary playing out a game can yield a dynamic programming problem that grows exponentially. 
  Policy Iteration  The problem with policy iteration is that you learn a new policy with respect to an old policy, which implies that sim</p><p>4 0.067697756 <a title="92-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-19-Second_Annual_Reinforcement_Learning_Competition.html">268 hunch net-2007-10-19-Second Annual Reinforcement Learning Competition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Second Annual Reinforcement Learning Competition is about to get started.  The aim of the competition is to facilitate direct comparisons between various learning methods on important and realistic domains.  This yearâ&euro;&trade;s event will feature well-known benchmark domains as well as more challenging problems of real-world complexity, such as helicopter control and robot soccer keepaway.
 
The competition begins on November 1st, 2007 when training software is released.   Results must be submitted by July 1st, 2008.  The competition will culminate in an event at ICML-08 in Helsinki, Finland, at which the winners will be announced.

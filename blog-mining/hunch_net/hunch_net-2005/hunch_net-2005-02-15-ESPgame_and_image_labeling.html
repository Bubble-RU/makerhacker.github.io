Peekaboom is the second attempt (after  Espgame ) to produce a dataset which is useful for learning to solve vision problems based on voluntary game play.  As a second attempt, it is meant to address all of the shortcomings of the first attempt.  In particular:

 The data collection is far more complete and extensive.

<p>Introduction: This is a summary of the  workshop on Learning Problem Design  which  Alina  and I ran at  NIPS  this year.
 
The first question many people have is “What is learning problem design?”  This workshop is about admitting that solving learning problems does not start with labeled data, but rather somewhere before.  When humans are hired to produce labels, this is usually not a serious problem because you can tell them precisely what semantics you want the labels to have, and we can fix some set of features in advance.  However, when other methods are used this becomes more problematic.  This focus is important for Machine Learning because there are very large quantities of data which are not labeled by a hired human.
 
The title of the workshop was a bit ambitious, because a workshop is not long enough to synthesize a diversity of approaches into a coherent set of principles.  For me, the posters at the end of the workshop were quite helpful in getting approaches to gel.

<p>Introduction: The  New York Times  has an article on the  growth of spam .  Interesting facts include: 9/10 of all email is spam, spam source identification is nearly useless due to botnet spam senders, and image based spam (emails which consist of an image only) are on the growth.
 
Estimates of the cost of spam are almost certainly far to low, because they do not account for the cost in time lost by people.
 
The image based spam which is currently penetrating many filters should be catchable with a more sophisticated application of machine learning technology.  For the spam I see, the rendered images come in only a few formats, which would be easy to recognize via a support vector machine (with RBF kernel), neural network, or even nearest-neighbor architecture.  The mechanics of setting this up to run efficiently is the only real challenge.  This is the next step in the spam war.
 
The response to this system is to make the image based spam even more random.  We should (essentially) expect to see</p><p>6 0.44085628 <a title="20-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-04-21-Interesting_Presentations_at_Snowbird.html">349 hunch net-2009-04-21-Interesting Presentations at Snowbird</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is October 19 with a 2 page abstract deadline due September 13 via email with subject “Machine Learning Poster Submission” sent to physicalscience@nyas.org.  Everyone is welcome to submit.  Last year’s attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.
 
The primary experiment for  ICML 2013  is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling review cycles.  The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15.  This is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and reduce peak load.   The “not for proceedings” experiment from this year’s ICML is not continuing.
 
Edit: Fixed second ICML deadline.</p><p>2 0.99306667 <a title="20-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-05-CMU_wins_DARPA_Urban_Challenge.html">271 hunch net-2007-11-05-CMU wins DARPA Urban Challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  results have been posted , with  CMU first ,  Stanford second , and  Virginia Tech Third .
 
Considering that this was an open event (at least for people in the US), this was a very strong showing for research at universities (instead of defense contractors, for example).  Some details should become public at the  NIPS workshops .

<p>Introduction: Various people want to use hunch.net to announce things.  I’ve generally resisted this because I feared hunch becoming a pure announcement zone while I am much more interested contentful posts and discussion personally.  Nevertheless there is clearly some value and announcements are easy, so I’m planning to summarize announcements on Mondays.
  
  D. Sculley  points out an interesting  Semisupervised feature learning  competition, with a deadline of October 17.  
  Lihong Li  points out the  webscope user interaction dataset  which is the first high quality exploration dataset I’m aware of that is publicly available. 
 Seth Rogers points out  CrossValidated  which looks similar in conception to  metaoptimize , but directly using the  stackoverflow  interface and with a bit more of a statistics twist.</p><p>4 0.98591411 <a title="20-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-11-COLT_CFP.html">326 hunch net-2008-11-11-COLT CFP</a></p>

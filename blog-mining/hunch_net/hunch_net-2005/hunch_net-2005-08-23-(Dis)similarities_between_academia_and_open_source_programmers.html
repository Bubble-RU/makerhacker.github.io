</p><p>11 A few open source projects have achieved significantly larger scales than academia as far as coordination amongst many people over a long time. [sent-15, score-1.616]

</p><p>19 Open source programmers take significantly more advantage of modern tools for communication. [sent-26, score-0.858]

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>4 0.16246583 <a title="105-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-03-15-COLT_Open_Problems.html">292 hunch net-2008-03-15-COLT Open Problems</a></p>

specifiable open problem to write it down and send it in. Just the effort of
specifying an open problem precisely and concisely has been very helpful for
my own solutions, and there is a substantial chance others will solve it. To
increase the chance someone will take it up, you can even put a bounty on the
solution. (Perhaps I should raise the$500 bountyon theK-fold cross-validation

<p>Introduction: At thelast ICML,Tom Dietterichasked me to look into systems for commenting on
papers. I've been slow getting to this, but it's relevant now.The essential
observation is that we now have many tools for online collaboration, but they
are not yet much used in academic research. If we can find the right way to
use them, then perhaps great things might happen, with extra kudos to the
first conference that manages to really create an online community. Various
conferences have been poking at this. For example,UAI has setup a wiki, COLT
hasstarted usingJoomla, with some dynamic content, and AAAI has been setting
up a "student blog". Similarly,Dinoj Surendransetup a twiki for theChicago
Machine Learning Summer School, which was quite useful for coordinating events
and other things.I believe the most important thing is a willingness to
experiment. A good place to start seems to be enhancing existing conference
websites. For example, theICML 2007 papers pageis basically only useful via
grep. A mu</p><p>6 0.13658525 <a title="105-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

this is cool, and worth doing if you can come up with a crisp question. In my

or make a case for the reward. But less esoterically, this is a way to get the

<p>Introduction: Following up on Hal Daume's post and John's post on cool and interesting
things seen at NIPS I'll post my own little list of neat papers here as well.
Of course it's going to be biased towards what I think is interesting. Also, I
have to say that I hadn't been able to see many papers this year at nips due
to myself being too busy, so please feel free to contribute the papers that
you liked1. P. Mudigonda, V. Kolmogorov, P. Torr. An Analysis of Convex
Relaxations for MAP Estimation. A surprising paper which shows that many of
the more sophisticated convex relaxations that had been proposed recently
turns out to be subsumed by the simplest LP relaxation. Be careful next time
you try a cool new convex relaxation!2. D. Sontag, T. Jaakkola. New Outer
Bounds on the Marginal Polytope. The title says it all. The marginal polytope
is the set of local marginal distributions over subsets of variables that are

<p>Introduction: Martin Pooland I recently discussed the similarities and differences between
academia and open source programming.Similarities:Cost profileResearch and
programming share approximately the same cost profile: A large upfront effort
is required to produce something useful, and then "anyone" can use it. (The
"anyone" is not quite right for either group because only sufficiently
technical people could use it.)Wealth profileA "wealthy" academic or open
source programmer is someone who has contributed a lot to other people in
research or programs. Much of academia is a "gift culture": whoever gives the
most is most respected.ProblemsBoth academia and open source programming
suffer from similar problems.Whether or not (and which) open source program is
used are perhaps too-often personality driven rather than driven by capability
or usefulness. Similar phenomena can happen in academia with respect to
directions of research.Funding is often a problem for both groups. Academics
often invest many</p><p>3 0.89195967 <a title="105-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-27-Interesting_things_at_NIPS_2009.html">385 hunch net-2009-12-27-Interesting things at NIPS 2009</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several papers at NIPS caught my attention.Elad HazanandSatyen Kale,Online
Submodular OptimizationThey define an algorithm for online optimization of
submodular functions with regret guarantees. This places submodular
optimization roughly on par with online convex optimization as tractable
settings for online learning.Elad HazanandSatyen KaleOn Stochastic and Worst-
Case Models of Investing. At it's core, this is yet another example of
modifying worst-case online learning to deal with variance, but the
application to financial models is particularly cool and it seems plausibly
superior other common approaches for financial modeling.Mark Palatucci,Dean
Pomerlau,Tom Mitchell, andGeoff HintonZero Shot Learning with Semantic Output
CodesThe goal here is predicting a label in a multiclass supervised setting
where the label never occurs in the training data. They have some basic
analysis and also a nice application to FMRI brain reading.Shobha

<p>Introduction: "Science" has many meanings, but one common meaning is "thescientific method"
which is a principled method for investigating the world using the following
steps:Form a hypothesis about the world.Use the hypothesis to make
predictions.Run experiments to confirm or disprove the predictions.The
ordering of these steps is very important to the scientific method. In
particular, predictionsmustbe made before experiments are run.Given that we
all believe in the scientific method of investigation, it may be surprising to
learn that cheating is very common. This happens for many reasons, some
innocent and some not.Drug studies. Pharmaceutical companies make predictions
about the effects of their drugs and then conduct blind clinical studies to
determine their effect. Unfortunately, they have also been caught using some
of the more advanced techniques for cheatinghere: including "reprobleming",
"data set selection", and probably "overfitting by review". It isn't too
surprising to observe this: w</p><p>5 0.81384933 <a title="105-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-12-Fast_Gradient_Descent.html">111 hunch net-2005-09-12-Fast Gradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nic Schaudolphhas been developing a fast gradient descent algorithm
calledStochastic Meta-Descent(SMD).Gradient descent is currently untrendy in
the machine learning community, but there remains a large number of people
using gradient descent on neural networks or other architectures from when it
was trendy in the early 1990s. There are three problems with gradient
descent.Gradient descent does not necessarily produce easily reproduced
results. Typical algorithms start with "set the initial parameters to small
random values".The design of the representation that gradient descent is
applied to is often nontrivial. In particular, knowing exactly how to build a
large neural network so that it will perform well requires knowledge which has
not been made easily applicable.Gradient descent can be slow. Obviously,
taking infinitesimal steps in the direction of the gradient would take
forever, so some finite step size must be used. What exactly this step size
should be is unclear. Many people</p><p>6 0.80719697 <a title="105-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-21-Netflix_finishes_%28and_starts%29.html">371 hunch net-2009-09-21-Netflix finishes (and starts)</a></p>

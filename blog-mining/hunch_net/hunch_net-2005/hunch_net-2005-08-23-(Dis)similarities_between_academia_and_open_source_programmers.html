<p>Introduction: Martin Pool  and I recently discussed the similarities and differences between academia and open source programming.

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: I just created  version 5.1  of  vowpal wabbit .  This almost entirely a bugfix release, so it’s an easy upgrade from v5.0.
 
In addition:
  
 There is now a  mailing list , which I and several other developers are subscribed to. 
 The main website has shifted to the wiki on github.  This means that anyone with a github account can now edit it. 
 I’m planning to give a tutorial tomorrow on it at  eHarmony / the LA machine learning meetup  at 10am.  Drop by if you’re interested. 
  
The status of VW amongst other open source projects has changed.  When VW first came out, it was relatively unique amongst existing projects in terms of features.  At this point, many other projects have started to appreciate the value of the design choices here.  This includes:
  
  Mahout , which now has an SGD implementation. 
  Shogun , where  Soeren  is keen on  incorporating features . 
  LibLinear , where they won the KDD best paper award for  out-of-core learning .

<p>Introduction: At the  last ICML ,  Tom Dietterich  asked me to look into systems for commenting on papers.  I’ve been slow getting to this, but it’s relevant now.
 
The essential observation is that we now have many tools for online collaboration, but they are not yet much used in academic research.  If we can find the right way to use them, then perhaps great things might happen, with extra kudos to the first conference that manages to really create an online community.  Various conferences have been poking at this.  For example,  UAI has setup a wiki , COLT has  started using   Joomla , with some dynamic content, and AAAI has been setting up a “ student blog “.  Similarly,  Dinoj Surendran  setup a twiki for the  Chicago Machine Learning Summer School , which was quite useful for coordinating events and other things.
 
I believe the most important thing is a willingness to experiment.  A good place to start seems to be enhancing existing conference websites.  For example, the  ICML 2007 papers pag</p><p>5 0.13804096 <a title="105-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

<p>Introduction: COLT has a  call for open problems  due March 21.  I encourage anyone with a specifiable open problem to write it down and send it in.  Just the effort of specifying an open problem precisely and concisely has been very helpful for my own solutions, and there is a substantial chance others will solve it.  To increase the chance someone will take it up, you can even put a bounty on the solution.  (Perhaps I should raise the  $500 bounty  on the  K-fold cross-validation problem  as it hasnâ&euro;&trade;t yet been solved).</p><p>3 0.57810014 <a title="105-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-05-Funding_Research.html">36 hunch net-2005-03-05-Funding Research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of “mechanism design”: setting up the structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane things (rather than obviously counterproductive things).  Application of this principle to academic research may be fruitful.
 
What is misdesigned about academic research?
  
 The  JMLG  guides give many hints. 
 The common nature of  bad reviewing  also suggests the system isn’t working optimally. 
 There are many ways to experimentally  “cheat” in machine learning . 
  Funding Prisoner’s Delimma.  Good researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing research.  Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written.  This is essentially a “prisoner’s delimma”: anyone not writing grant proposals loses, but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction.  If everyone wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution</p><p>5 0.55305183 <a title="105-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-05-CMU_wins_DARPA_Urban_Challenge.html">271 hunch net-2007-11-05-CMU wins DARPA Urban Challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  results have been posted , with  CMU first ,  Stanford second , and  Virginia Tech Third .
 
Considering that this was an open event (at least for people in the US), this was a very strong showing for research at universities (instead of defense contractors, for example).  Some details should become public at the  NIPS workshops .

<p>Introduction: I will join  Yahoo Research  (in New York) after my contract ends at  TTI-Chicago .
 
The deciding reasons are:
  
 Yahoo is running into many hard learning problems.  This is precisely the situation where basic research might hope to have the greatest impact. 
 Yahoo Research understands research including publishing, conferences, etc… 
 Yahoo Research is growing, so there is a chance I can help it grow well. 
 Yahoo understands the internet, including (but not at all limited to) experimenting with research blogs. 
  
In the end, Yahoo Research seems like the place where I might have a chance to make the greatest difference.  
 
Yahoo (as a company) has made a strong bet on Yahoo Research.  We-the-researchers all hope that bet will pay off, and this seems plausible.  I’ll certainly have fun trying.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88953966 <a title="105-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-23-%28Dis%29similarities_between_academia_and_open_source_programmers.html">105 hunch net-2005-08-23-(Dis)similarities between academia and open source programmers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Martin Pool  and I recently discussed the similarities and differences between academia and open source programming.   
 
Similarities:
  
  Cost profile   Research and programming share approximately the same cost profile: A large upfront effort is required to produce something useful, and then “anyone” can use it.  (The “anyone” is not quite right for either group because only sufficiently technical people could use it.) 
  Wealth profile  A “wealthy” academic or open source programmer is someone who has contributed a lot to other people in research or programs.  Much of academia is a “gift culture”: whoever gives the most is most respected. 
  Problems   Both academia and open source programming suffer from similar problems.
 
 Whether or not (and which) open source program is used are perhaps too-often personality driven rather than driven by capability or usefulness.  Similar phenomena can happen in academia with respect to directions of research.

<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.
  
  September 9 ,  abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  Send a 2 page pdf, if interested, and note that we:
 
 widened submissions to be from anybody rather than students. 
 set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed submissions.  
 
 
  September 15 , there is a  machine learning meetup , where I’ll be discussing terascale learning at AOL. 
  September 16 , there is a  CS&Econ; day  at New York Academy of Sciences.  This is not ML focused, but it’s easy to imagine interest. 
  September 23 and later   NIPS workshop  submissions start coming due.  As usual, there are too many good ones, so I won’t be able to attend all those that interest me.  I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you.  Here are a few that interest me:
 
  Big Learning  is about dealing with lots of data.  Abstracts are due  September 30 .

<p>Introduction: Foster Provost  gave a talk at the ICML  metalearning workshop  on “metalearning” and the “no free lunch theorem” which seems worth summarizing.
 
As a review: the no free lunch theorem is the most complicated way we know of to say that a  bias  is required in order to learn.  The simplest way to see this is in a nonprobabilistic setting.  If you are given examples of the form  (x,y)  and you wish to predict  y  from  x  then any prediction mechanism errs half the time in expectation over all sequences of examples.  The proof of this is very simple: on every example a predictor must make some prediction and by symmetry over the set of sequences it will be wrong half the time and right half the time.  The basic idea of this proof has been applied to many other settings.
 
The simplistic interpretation of this theorem which many people jump to is “machine learning is dead” since there can be no single learning algorithm which can solve all learning problems.  This is the wrong way to thi</p><p>5 0.77597737 <a title="105-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-06-Structured_Regret_Minimization.html">53 hunch net-2005-04-06-Structured Regret Minimization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Geoff Gordon made an interesting presentation at the  snowbird learning workshop  discussing the use of no-regret algorithms for the use of several robot-related learning problems.    There seems to be a draft  here .  This seems interesting in two ways:
  
  Drawback Removal  One of the significant problems with these online algorithms is that they can’t cope with structure very easily.  This drawback is addressed for certain structures. 
  Experiments  One criticism of such algorithms is that they are too “worst case”.   Several experiments suggest that protecting yourself against this worst case does not necessarily incur a great loss.</p><p>6 0.76645827 <a title="105-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>

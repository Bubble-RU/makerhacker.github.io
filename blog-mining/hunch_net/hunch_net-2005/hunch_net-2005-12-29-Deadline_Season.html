<p>Introduction: TheNew York Machine Learning Symposiumis October 19 with a 2 page abstract
deadline due September 13 via email with subject "Machine Learning Poster
Submission" sent to physicalscience@nyas.org. Everyone is welcome to submit.
Last year's attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.The primary
experiment forICML 2013is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling
review cycles. The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15. This
is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and
reduce peak load. The "not for proceedings" experiment from this year's ICML
is not continuing.Edit: Fixed second ICML deadline.</p><p>3 0.1352527 <a title="145-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-02-17-The_Meaning_of_Confidence.html">289 hunch net-2008-02-17-The Meaning of Confidence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In many machine learning papers experiments are done and little confidence
bars are reported for the results. This often seems quite clear, until you
actually try to figure out what it means. There are several different kinds of
'confidence' being used, and it's easy to become confused.Confidence =
Probability. For those who haven't worried about confidence for a long time,
confidence is simply the probability of some event. You are confident about
events which have a large probability. This meaning of confidence is
inadequate in many applications because we want to reason about how much more
information we have, how much more is needed, and where to get it. As an
example, a learning algorithm might predict that the probability of an event
is0.5, but it's unclear if the probability is0.5because no examples have been
provided or0.5because many examples have been provided and the event is simply
fundamentally uncertain.Classical Confidence Intervals. These are common in
learning theory.</p><p>4 0.11867279 <a title="145-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-11-AAAI_blog.html">92 hunch net-2005-07-11-AAAI blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: IJCAIis running January 6-12 in Hyderabad India rather than a more traditional
summer date. (Presumably, this is to avoid melting people in the Indian
summer.)The paper deadline(June 23 abstract / June 30 submission) are

a good excuse to visit India.</p><p>3 0.50868994 <a title="145-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-21-NIPS_paper_evaluation_criteria.html">180 hunch net-2006-05-21-NIPS paper evaluation criteria</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Platt, who is PC-chair forNIPS 2006has organized aNIPS paper evaluation
criteriadocument with input from theprogram committeeand others.The document
contains specific advice about what is appropriate for the various subareas
within NIPS. It may be very helpful, because the standards of evaluation for
papers varies significantly.This is a bit of an experiment: the hope is that
by carefully thinking about and stating what is important, authors can better
understand whether and where their work fits.Update: Thegeneral submission

learning efforts. Signs of this include:Winning aKaggle competition.Wide
adoption ofdeep learning for speech recognition.Significantindustry
support.Gains inimagerecognition.This is a rare event in research: a

<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is anothermachine learning meetupwhere I'll be speaking.
Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as "the future of
machine learning". In particular, it's all about how to learn in an
interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation,
etcâ&euro;ŚOn Sept 24, abstracts for theNew York Machine Learning Symposiumare due.
This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it's a great way to
have a conversation with other people.On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually
happens. This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more
time for posters. In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:David
Blei,Sanjoy Dasgupta,Tommi Jaakkola, andYann LeCun. After the meeting, a
latehackNYrelated event is planned where students and startups can meet.I'd
also like to point out the relatedCS/Econ symposiumas I have interests there
as well.</p><p>5 0.68547881 <a title="145-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-26-Two_more_UAI_papers_of_interest.html">199 hunch net-2006-07-26-Two more UAI papers of interest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In addition to Ed Snelson's paper, there were (at least) two other papers that
caught my eye at UAI.One wasthis paperby Sanjoy Dasgupta, Daniel Hsu and Nakul
Verma at UCSD which shows in a surprisingly general and strong way that almost
all linear projections of any jointly distributed vector random variable with
finite first and second moments look sphereical and unimodal (in fact look
like a scale mixture of Gaussians). Great result, as you'd expect from
Sanjoy.The other paper which I found intriguing but which I just haven't
groked yet isthis beastby Manfred and Dima Kuzmin.You can check out the
(beautiful)slidesif that helps. I feel like there is something deep here, but
my brain is too small to understand it. The COLT and last NIPS papers/slides
are also on Manfred's page. Hopefully someone here can illuminate.</p><p>6 0.56047386 <a title="145-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-01-Basic_computer_science_research_takes_a_hit.html">50 hunch net-2005-04-01-Basic computer science research takes a hit</a></p>

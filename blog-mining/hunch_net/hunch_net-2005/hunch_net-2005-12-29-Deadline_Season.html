ICML continues to experiment with the reviewing process, although perhaps less so than last year.  
 
The S “sort-of” for COLT is because author feedback occurs only after decisions are made.  
 
KDD is notable for being the most comprehensive in terms of {Tutorials, Workshops, Challenges, Panels, Papers (two tracks), Demos}.  The S for KDD is because there is sometimes author feedback at the decision of the SPC.

The big winner this year is Europe.   This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.  With  cuts to basic science  in the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside the US become more attractive.   Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english in place.  China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>6 0.26476753 <a title="145-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-04-2007_Summer_Machine_Learning_Conferences.html">226 hunch net-2007-01-04-2007 Summer Machine Learning Conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I tweaked the site in a number of ways today, including:
  
 Updating to  WordPress  1.5. 
 Installing and heavily tweaking the  Geekniche  theme.  Update: I switched back to a tweaked version of the old theme. 
 Adding the  Customizable Post Listings  plugin. 
 Installing the  StatTraq  plugin. 
 Updating some of the links.  I particularly recommend looking at the  computer research policy  blog. 
 Adding  threaded comments .  This doesn’t thread old comments obviously, but the extra structure may be helpful for new ones. 
  
Overall, I think this is an improvement, and it addresses a few of my  earlier problems .  If you have any difficulties or anything seems “not quite right”, please speak up.  A few other tweaks to the site may happen in the near future.</p><p>3 0.90037531 <a title="145-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-09-Intuitions_from_applied_learning.html">16 hunch net-2005-02-09-Intuitions from applied learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since learning is far from an exact science, it’s good to pay attention to basic intuitions of applied learning.  Here are a few I’ve collected.
  
  Integration   In Bayesian learning, the posterior is computed by an integral, and the optimal thing to do is to predict according to this integral.  This phenomena seems to be far more general.  Bagging, Boosting, SVMs, and Neural Networks all take advantage of this idea to some extent.  The phenomena is more general: you can average over many different  classification predictors  to improve performance.  Sources:  Zoubin ,  Caruana  
  Differentiation  Different pieces of an average should differentiate to achieve good performance by different methods.  This is know as the ‘symmetry breaking’ problem for neural networks, and it’s why weights are initialized randomly.   Boosting explicitly attempts to achieve good differentiation by creating new, different, learning problems.  Sources:  Yann LeCun ,  Phil Long

<p>Introduction: The diagram above shows a very broad viewpoint of learning theory.

 Typical statement 
 Examples 
 
 
 Past->Past 
  Some prediction algorithm  A  does almost as well as any of a set of algorithms. 
 Weighted Majority 
 
 
 Past->Future 
 Assuming independent samples, past performance predicts future performance. 
 PAC analysis, ERM analysis 
 
 
 Future->Future 
 Future prediction performance on subproblems implies future prediction performance using algorithm  A . 
 ECOC, Probing 
 
  
A basic question is: Are there other varieties of statements of this type?   Avrim  noted that there are also “arrows between arrows”: generic methods for transforming between Past->Past statements and Past->Future statements.  Are there others?</p><p>5 0.86444473 <a title="145-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-10-Thinking_the_Unthought.html">91 hunch net-2005-07-10-Thinking the Unthought</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing common to much research is that the researcher must be the first person  ever  to have some thought.  How do you think of something that has never been thought of?  There seems to be no methodical manner of doing this, but there are some tricks.
  
 The easiest method is to just have some connection come to you.  There is a trick here however: you should write it down and fill out the idea immediately because  it can just as easily go away. 
 A harder method is to set aside a block of time and simply think about an idea.  Distraction elimination is essential here because thinking about the unthought is hard work which your mind will avoid. 
 Another common method is in conversation.  Sometimes the process of verbalizing implies new ideas come up and sometimes whoever you are talking to replies just the right way.  This method is dangerous though—you must speak to someone who helps you think rather than someone who occupies your thoughts.

<p>Introduction: What?   Bounds are mathematical formulas relating observations to future error rates assuming that data is drawn independently.  In classical statistics, they are calld confidence intervals. 
 Why?  
  
  Good Judgement . In many applications of learning, it is desirable to know how well the learned predictor works in the future.  This helps you decide if the problem is solved or not. 
  Learning Essence .  The form of some of these bounds helps you understand what the essence of learning is. 
  Algorithm Design .  Some of these bounds suggest, motivate, or even directly imply learning algorithms. 
  
 What We Know Now 
 
There are several families of bounds, based on how information is used.
  
  Testing Bounds . These are methods which use labeled data not used in training to estimate the future error rate.  Examples include the  test set bound ,  progressive validation  also  here  and  here ,  train and test bounds , and cross-validation (but see the  big open problem ).

<p>Introduction: I found Tong Zhangâ&euro;&trade;s paper on  Data Dependent Concentration Bounds for Sequential Prediction Algorithms  interesting.

This bound is easily computed and will make the progressive validation approaches used  here  significantly more practical.</p><p>4 0.1460541 <a title="115-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-05-09-The_Missing_Bound.html">244 hunch net-2007-05-09-The Missing Bound</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sham Kakade  points out that we are missing a bound.
 
Suppose we have  m  samples  x  drawn IID from some distribution  D .  Through the magic of exponential moment method we know that:
  
 If the range of  x  is bounded by an interval of size  I , a  Chernoff/Hoeffding style bound  gives us a bound on the deviations like  O(I/m 0.5 )  (at least in crude form).  A proof is on page 9  here . 
 If the range of  x  is bounded, and the variance (or a bound on the variance) is known, then  Bennett’s bound  can give tighter results (*).  This can be a huge improvment when the true variance small. 
  
What’s missing here is a bound that depends on the observed variance rather than a bound on the variance.  This means that many people attempt to use Bennett’s bound (incorrectly) by plugging the observed variance in as the true variance, invalidating the bound application.  Most of the time, they get away with it, but this is a dangerous move when doing machine learning.

<p>Introduction: Nati Srebro  and  Shai Ben-David  have a  paper  at  COLT  which, in the appendix, proves something very striking: several previous error bounds are  always  greater than 1.
 
 Background  One branch of learning theory focuses on theorems which
  
 Assume samples are drawn IID from an unknown distribution  D . 
 Fix a set of classifiers 
 Find a high probability bound on the maximum true error rate (with respect to  D ) as a function of the empirical error rate on the training set.
 
  
Many of these bounds become extremely complex and hairy.

 
 Current  Everyone working on this subject wants “tighter bounds”, however there are different definitions of “tighter”.  Some groups focus on “functional tightness” (getting the right functional dependency between the size of the training set and a parameterization of the hypothesis space) while  others  focus on “practical tightness” (finding bounds which work well on practical problems).  (I am definitely in the second camp.)

<p>Introduction: At many points in research, you face a choice: should I keep on improving some old piece of technology or should I do something new?  For example: 
  
 Should I refine bounds to make them tighter? 
 Should I take some learning theory and turn it into a learning algorithm? 
 Should I implement the learning algorithm? 
 Should I test the learning algorithm widely? 
 Should I release the algorithm as source code? 
 Should I go see what problems people actually need to solve? 
  
The universal temptation of people attracted to research is doing something new.  That is sometimes the right decision, but is also often not.  I’d like to discuss some reasons why not.
  
  Expertise  Once expertise are developed on some subject, you are the right person to refine them. 
  What is the real problem?  Continually improving a piece of technology is a mechanism forcing you to confront this question.  In many cases, this confrontation is uncomfortable because you discover that your method has fundamen</p><p>2 0.97985148 <a title="115-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-13-Wikis_for_Summer_Schools_and_Workshops.html">81 hunch net-2005-06-13-Wikis for Summer Schools and Workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chicago ’05  ended a couple of weeks ago. This was the sixth  Machine Learning Summer School , and the second one that used a  wiki . (The first was Berder ’04, thanks to Gunnar Raetsch.) Wikis are relatively easy to set up, greatly aid social interaction, and should be used a lot more at summer schools and workshops. They can even be used as the meeting’s webpage, as a permanent record of its participants’ collaborations — see for example the wiki/website for last year’s  NVO Summer School .
 
A basic wiki is a collection of editable webpages, maintained by software called a   wiki engine . The engine used at both Berder and Chicago was  TikiWiki  — it is well documented and gets you something running fast. It uses PHP and MySQL, but doesn’t require you to know either. Tikiwiki has far more features than most wikis, as it is  really a full  Content Management System . (My thanks to Sebastian Stark for pointing this out.) Here are the features we found most useful:

<p>Introduction: “Science” has many meanings, but one common meaning is “the  scientific method ” which is a principled method for investigating the world using the following steps:
  
 Form a hypothesis about the world. 
 Use the hypothesis to make predictions. 
 Run experiments to confirm or disprove the predictions. 
  
The ordering of these steps is very important to the scientific method.  In particular, predictions  must  be made before experiments are run.  
 
Given that we all believe in the scientific method of investigation, it may be surprising to learn that cheating is very common.  This happens for many reasons, some innocent and some not.    
  
 Drug studies.  Pharmaceutical companies make predictions about the effects of their drugs and then conduct blind clinical studies to determine their effect.  Unfortunately, they have also been caught using some of the more advanced techniques for cheating  here : including “reprobleming”, “data set selection”, and probably “overfitting by review”</p><p>4 0.97446978 <a title="115-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-04-The_Big_O_and_Constants_in_Learning.html">35 hunch net-2005-03-04-The Big O and Constants in Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The notation  g(n) = O(f(n))  means that in the limit as  n  approaches infinity there exists a constant  C  such that the  g(n)  is less than  Cf(n) .
 
In learning theory, there are many statements about learning algorithms of the form “under assumptions  x , y , and  z , the classifier learned has an error rate of at most  O(f(m)) “.
 
There is one very good reason to use O(): it helps you understand the big picture and neglect the minor details which are not important in the big picture.  However, there are some important reasons not to do this as well.
  
  Unspeedup  In algorithm analysis, the use of O() for time complexity is pervasive and well-justified.  Determining the exact value of C is inherently computer architecture dependent.  (The “C” for x86 processors might differ from the “C” on PowerPC processors.)  Since many learning theorists come from a CS theory background, the O() notation is applied to generalization error.  The O() abstraction breaks here—you can not genera</p><p>5 0.9688105 <a title="115-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-18-Parallel_ML_primitives.html">346 hunch net-2009-03-18-Parallel ML primitives</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Previously, we discussed  parallel machine learning  a bit.  As parallel ML is rather difficult, I’d like to describe my thinking at the moment, and ask for advice from the rest of the world.  This is particularly relevant right now, as I’m attending a workshop tomorrow on parallel ML.
 
Parallelizing slow algorithms seems uncompelling.  Parallelizing many algorithms also seems uncompelling, because the effort required to parallelize is substantial.  This leaves the question: Which one fast algorithm is the best to parallelize?  What is a substantially different second?
 
One compellingly fast simple algorithm is online gradient descent on a linear representation.  This is the core of Leon’s  sgd  code and  Vowpal Wabbit .   Antoine Bordes  showed a variant was competitive in the  large scale learning challenge .  It’s also a decades old primitive which has been reused in many algorithms, and continues to be reused.  It also applies to online  learning  rather than just online  optimiz</p><p>6 0.93079937 <a title="115-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-10-Predictive_Search_is_Coming.html">120 hunch net-2005-10-10-Predictive Search is Coming</a></p>

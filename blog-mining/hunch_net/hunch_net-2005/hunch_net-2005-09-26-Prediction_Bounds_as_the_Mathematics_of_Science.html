havemsamplesxdrawn IID from some distributionD. Through the magic of
exponential moment method we know that:If the range ofxis bounded by an
interval of sizeI, aChernoff/Hoeffding style boundgives us a bound on the

the range ofxis bounded, and the variance (or a bound on the variance) is
known, thenBennett's boundcan give tighter results (*). This can be a huge
improvment when the true variance small.What's missing here is a bound that
depends on the observed variance rather than a bound on the variance. This
means that many people attempt to use Bennett's bound (incorrectly) by
plugging the observed variance in as the true variance, invalidating the bound
application. Most of the time, they get away with it, but this is a dangerous
move when doing machine learning. In machine learning, we are typically trying

<p>Introduction: Should results of experiments on proprietary datasets be in the academic
research literature?The arguments I can imagine in the "against" column
are:Experiments are not repeatable. Repeatability in experiments is essential
to science because it allows others to compare new methods with old and
discover which is better.It's unfair. Academics who don't have insider access
to proprietary data are at a substantial disadvantage when competing with
others who do.I'm unsympathetic to argument (2). To me, it looks like their
are simply some resource constraints, and these should not prevent research
progress. For example, we wouldn't prevent publishing about particle
accelerator experiments by physicists atCERNbecause physicists atCMUcouldn't
run their own experiments.Argument (1) seems like a real issue.The argument
for is:Yes, they are another form of evidence that an algorithm is good. The
degree to which they are evidence is less than for publicly repeatable
experiments, but greater than n</p><p>5 0.13017699 <a title="115-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-18-Lower_Bounds_for_Learning_Reductions.html">83 hunch net-2005-06-18-Lower Bounds for Learning Reductions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Learning reductionstransform a solver of one type of learning problem into a
solver of another type of learning problem. When we analyze these for
robustness we can make statement of the form "ReductionRhas the property that
regretr(or loss) on subproblems of typeAimplies regret at mostf ( r )on the
original problem of typeB".A lower bound for a learning reduction would have
the form "for all reductionsR, there exists a learning problem of typeBand
learning algorithm for problems of typeAwhere regretron induced problems
impliesat leastregretf ( r )forB".The pursuit of lower bounds is often
questionable because, unlike upper bounds, they do not yield practical
algorithms. Nevertheless, they may be helpful as a tool for thinking about
what is learnable and how learnable it is. This has already come
uphereandhere.At the moment, there is no coherent theory of lower bounds for
learning reductions, and we have little understanding of how feasible they are

<p>Introduction: Nati SrebroandShai Ben-Davidhave apaperatCOLTwhich, in the appendix, proves
something very striking: several previous error bounds arealwaysgreater than

samples are drawn IID from an unknown distributionD.Fix a set of
classifiersFind a high probability bound on the maximum true error rate (with
respect toD) as a function of the empirical error rate on the training
set.Many of these bounds become extremely complex and hairy.CurrentEveryone
working on this subject wants "tighter bounds", however there are different
definitions of "tighter". Some groups focus on "functional tightness" (getting
the right functional dependency between the size of the training set and a
parameterization of the hypothesis space) whileothersfocus on "practical
tightness" (finding bounds which work well on practical problems). (I am
definitely in the second camp.)One of the dangers of striving for "functional
tightness" is that the bound</p><p>5 0.63602048 <a title="115-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-26-A_Variance_only_Deviation_Bound.html">392 hunch net-2010-03-26-A Variance only Deviation Bound</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At thePAC-Bayesworkshop earlier this week,Olivier Catonidescribed a result
that I hadn't believed was possible:a deviation bound dependingonlyon the
variance of a random variable.For people not familiar with deviation bounds,
this may be hard to appreciate. Deviation bounds, are one of the core
components for the foundations of machine learning theory, so developments
here have a potential to alter our understanding of how to learn and what is
learnable. My understanding is that the basic proof techniques started
withBernsteinand have evolved into several variants specialized for various
applications. All of the variants I knew had a dependence on the range, with
some also having a dependence on the variance of an IID or martingale random
variable. This one is the first I know of with a dependence on only the
variance.The basic idea is to use a biased estimator of the mean which is not
influenced much by outliers. Then, a deviation bound can be proved by using
the exponential moment me</p><p>6 0.63493353 <a title="115-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-28-A_COLT_paper.html">85 hunch net-2005-06-28-A COLT paper</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Following up on Hal Daume's post and John's post on cool and interesting
things seen at NIPS I'll post my own little list of neat papers here as well.
Of course it's going to be biased towards what I think is interesting. Also, I
have to say that I hadn't been able to see many papers this year at nips due
to myself being too busy, so please feel free to contribute the papers that
you liked1. P. Mudigonda, V. Kolmogorov, P. Torr. An Analysis of Convex
Relaxations for MAP Estimation. A surprising paper which shows that many of
the more sophisticated convex relaxations that had been proposed recently
turns out to be subsumed by the simplest LP relaxation. Be careful next time
you try a cool new convex relaxation!2. D. Sontag, T. Jaakkola. New Outer
Bounds on the Marginal Polytope. The title says it all. The marginal polytope
is the set of local marginal distributions over subsets of variables that are

<p>Introduction: "Science" has many meanings, but one common meaning is "thescientific method"
which is a principled method for investigating the world using the following
steps:Form a hypothesis about the world.Use the hypothesis to make
predictions.Run experiments to confirm or disprove the predictions.The
ordering of these steps is very important to the scientific method. In
particular, predictionsmustbe made before experiments are run.Given that we
all believe in the scientific method of investigation, it may be surprising to
learn that cheating is very common. This happens for many reasons, some
innocent and some not.Drug studies. Pharmaceutical companies make predictions
about the effects of their drugs and then conduct blind clinical studies to
determine their effect. Unfortunately, they have also been caught using some
of the more advanced techniques for cheatinghere: including "reprobleming",
"data set selection", and probably "overfitting by review". It isn't too
surprising to observe this: w</p><p>3 0.85312569 <a title="115-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-27-Interesting_things_at_NIPS_2009.html">385 hunch net-2009-12-27-Interesting things at NIPS 2009</a></p>

Submodular OptimizationThey define an algorithm for online optimization of
submodular functions with regret guarantees. This places submodular
optimization roughly on par with online convex optimization as tractable
settings for online learning.Elad HazanandSatyen KaleOn Stochastic and Worst-
Case Models of Investing. At it's core, this is yet another example of
modifying worst-case online learning to deal with variance, but the
application to financial models is particularly cool and it seems plausibly
superior other common approaches for financial modeling.Mark Palatucci,Dean
Pomerlau,Tom Mitchell, andGeoff HintonZero Shot Learning with Semantic Output
CodesThe goal here is predicting a label in a multiclass supervised setting
where the label never occurs in the training data. They have some basic
analysis and also a nice application to FMRI brain reading.Shobha

<p>Introduction: Martin Pooland I recently discussed the similarities and differences between
academia and open source programming.Similarities:Cost profileResearch and
programming share approximately the same cost profile: A large upfront effort
is required to produce something useful, and then "anyone" can use it. (The
"anyone" is not quite right for either group because only sufficiently
technical people could use it.)Wealth profileA "wealthy" academic or open
source programmer is someone who has contributed a lot to other people in
research or programs. Much of academia is a "gift culture": whoever gives the
most is most respected.ProblemsBoth academia and open source programming
suffer from similar problems.Whether or not (and which) open source program is
used are perhaps too-often personality driven rather than driven by capability
or usefulness. Similar phenomena can happen in academia with respect to
directions of research.Funding is often a problem for both groups. Academics
often invest many</p><p>5 0.75514704 <a title="115-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-03-All_Models_of_Learning_have_Flaws.html">235 hunch net-2007-03-03-All Models of Learning have Flaws</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given
framework or mathematical model. It turns out that all of these models are
significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning. I've
created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of
machine learning.The point here is not simply "woe unto us". There are several
implications which seem important.The multitude of models is a point of
continuing confusion. It is common for people to learn about machine learning
within one framework which often becomes there "home framework" through which
they attempt to filter all machine learning. (Have you met people who can only
think in terms of kernels? Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)
Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help
resolve the confusion. This is particularly important when reviewing and
particularly important for students.Algorithms which conform to multiple
approaches can have substantial</p><p>6 0.74929649 <a title="115-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

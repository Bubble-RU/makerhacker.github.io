<p>Introduction: Watson  convincingly beat the best champion  Jeopardy!  players.  The apparent significance of this varies hugely, depending on your background knowledge about the related machine learning, NLP, and search technology.  For a random person, this might seem evidence of serious machine intelligence, while for people working on the system itself, it probably seems like a reasonably good assemblage of existing technologies with several twists to make the entire system work.
 
Above all, I think we should congratulate the people who managed to put together and execute this project—many years of effort by a diverse set of highly skilled people were needed to make this happen.  In academia, it’s pretty difficult for one professor to assemble that quantity of talent, and in industry it’s rarely the case that such a capable group has both a worthwhile project and the support needed to pursue something like this for several years before success.

<p>Introduction: Apparently, the company  Spock  is setting up a  $50k entity resolution challenge .  $50k is much less than the Netflix challenge, but it’s effectively the same as Netflix until  someone reaches 10% .

<p>Introduction: A  recent discussion  indicated that one goal of this blog might be to allow people to post comments about recent papers that they liked.  I think this could potentially be very useful, especially for those with diverse interests but only finite time to read through conference proceedings.   ACL 2005  recently completed, and here are four papers from that conference that I thought were either good or perhaps of interest to a machine learning audience.
 
David Chiang,   A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation  . (Best paper award.) This paper takes the standard phrase-based MT model that is popular in our field (basically, translate a sentence by individually translating phrases and reordering them according to a complicated statistical model) and extends it to take into account hierarchy in phrases, so that you can learn things like “X ‘s Y” -> “Y de X” in chinese, where X and Y are arbitrary phrases. This takes a step toward linguistic syntax for MT, whic</p><p>5 0.052801773 <a title="94-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-15-The_Other_Online_Learning.html">378 hunch net-2009-11-15-The Other Online Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If you search for “online learning” with any  major   search   engine , it’s interesting to note that zero of the results are for online machine learning.  This may not be a mistake if you are committed to a global ordering.  In other words, the number of people specifically interested in the least interesting top-10 online human learning result might exceed the number of people interested in online machine learning, even given the presence of the other 9 results.  The essential observation here is that the process of human learning is a big business (around 5% of GDP) effecting virtually everyone.  
 
The internet is changing this dramatically, by altering the economics of teaching. Consider two possibilities:
  
 The classroom-style teaching environment continues as is, with many teachers for the same subject. 
 All the teachers for one subject get together, along with perhaps a factor of 2 more people who are experts in online delivery.

<p>Introduction: Alan Fern  points out the  second branch prediction challenge  (due September 29) which is a follow up to the  first branch prediction competition .  Branch prediction is one of the fundamental learning problems of the computer age: without it our computers might run an order of magnitude slower.  This is a tough problem since there are sharp constraints on time and space complexity in an online environment.  For machine learning, the “idealistic track” may fit well.  Essentially, they remove these constraints to gain a weak upper bound on what might be done.</p><p>5 0.46775708 <a title="94-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-02-Traffic_Prediction_Problem.html">418 hunch net-2010-12-02-Traffic Prediction Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There are  a handful of basic code patterns  that I wish I was more aware of when I started research in machine learning. Each on its own may seem pointless, but collectively they go a long way towards making the typical research workflow more efficient. Here they are:
  
 Separate code from data. 
 Separate input data, working data and output data. 
 Save everything to disk frequently. 
 Separate options from parameters. 
 Do not use global variables. 
 Record the options used to generate each run of the algorithm. 
 Make it easy to sweep options. 
 Make it easy to execute only portions of the code. 
 Use checkpointing. 
 Write demos and tests.

<p>Introduction: About 4 years ago, I speculated that  decision trees qualify as a deep learning algorithm  because they can make decisions which are substantially nonlinear in the input representation.   Ping Li  has  proved this correct, empirically  at  UAI  by showing that boosted decision trees can beat deep belief networks on versions of  Mnist  which are artificially hardened so as to make them solvable only by deep learning algorithms.  
 
This is an important point, because the ability to solve these sorts of problems is probably the best objective definition of a deep learning algorithm we have.   Iâ&euro;&trade;m not that surprised.  In my experience, if you can accept the computational drawbacks of a boosted decision tree, they can achieve pretty good performance.
 
 Geoff Hinton  once told me that the great thing about deep belief networks is that they work.  I understand that Ping had very substantial difficulty in getting this published, so I hope some reviewers step up to the standard of valuing wha</p><p>4 0.63518518 <a title="94-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-29-AI_Safety.html">380 hunch net-2009-11-29-AI Safety</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Reeves  introduced me to  Michael Vassar  who ran the  Singularity Summit  and educated me a bit on the subject of AI safety which the  Singularity Institute  has  small grants for .  
 
I still believe that  interstellar space travel is necessary for long term civilization survival, and the AI is necessary for interstellar space travel .  On these grounds alone, we could judge that developing AI is much more safe than not.  Nevertheless, there is a basic reasonable fear, as expressed by some commenters, that AI could go bad.
 
A basic scenario starts with someone inventing an AI and telling it to make as much money as possible.  The AI promptly starts trading in various markets to make money.  To improve, it crafts a virus that takes over most of the world’s computers using it as a surveillance network so that it can always make the right decision.  The AI also branches out into any form of distance work, taking over the entire outsourcing process for all jobs that are entirely di</p><p>5 0.6264146 <a title="94-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-11-The_Heritage_Health_Prize.html">430 hunch net-2011-04-11-The Heritage Health Prize</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  Heritage Health Prize  is potentially the largest prediction prize yet at $3M, which is sure to get many people interested.  Several elements of the competition may be worth discussing.
  
 The most straightforward way for HPN to deploy this predictor is in determining who to cover with insurance.  This might easily cover the costs of running the contest itself, but the value to the health system of a whole is minimal, as people not covered still exist.  While HPN itself is a provider network, they have active relationships with a number of insurance companies, and the right to resell any entrant.  It’s worth keeping in mind that the research and development may nevertheless end up being useful in the longer term, especially as entrants also keep the right to their code. 
 The  judging metric  is something I haven’t seen previously.  If a patient has probability 0.5 of being in the hospital 0 days and probability 0.5 of being in the hospital ~53.6 days, the optimal prediction in e</p><p>6 0.38138232 <a title="94-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-16-The_Everything_Ensemble_Edge.html">131 hunch net-2005-11-16-The Everything Ensemble Edge</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Arecent discussionindicated that one goal of this blog might be to allow
people to post comments about recent papers that they liked. I think this
could potentially be very useful, especially for those with diverse interests
but only finite time to read through conference proceedings.ACL 2005recently
completed, and here are four papers from that conference that I thought were
either good or perhaps of interest to a machine learning audience.David
Chiang,A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation.
(Best paper award.) This paper takes the standard phrase-based MT model that
is popular in our field (basically, translate a sentence by individually
translating phrases and reordering them according to a complicated statistical
model) and extends it to take into account hierarchy in phrases, so that you
can learn things like "X 's Y" -> "Y de X" in chinese, where X and Y are
arbitrary phrases. This takes a step toward linguistic syntax for MT, which

<p>Introduction: Watsonconvincingly beat the best championJeopardy!players. The apparent
significance of this varies hugely, depending on your background knowledge
about the related machine learning, NLP, and search technology. For a random
person, this might seem evidence of serious machine intelligence, while for
people working on the system itself, it probably seems like a reasonably good
assemblage of existing technologies with several twists to make the entire
system work.Above all, I think we should congratulate the people who managed
to put together and execute this project--many years of effort by a diverse
set of highly skilled people were needed to make this happen. In academia,
it's pretty difficult for one professor to assemble that quantity of talent,
and in industry it's rarely the case that such a capable group has both a
worthwhile project and the support needed to pursue something like this for
several years before success.Alinainvited me to the Jeopardy watching party

<p>Introduction: If you search for "online learning" with anymajorsearchengine, it's
interesting to note that zero of the results are for online machine learning.
This may not be a mistake if you are committed to a global ordering. In other
words, the number of people specifically interested in the least interesting
top-10 online human learning result might exceed the number of people
interested in online machine learning, even given the presence of the other 9
results. The essential observation here is that the process of human learning
is a big business (around 5% of GDP) effecting virtually everyone.The internet
is changing this dramatically, by altering the economics of teaching. Consider
two possibilities:The classroom-style teaching environment continues as is,
with many teachers for the same subject.All the teachers for one subject get
together, along with perhaps a factor of 2 more people who are experts in
online delivery. They spend a factor of 4 more time designing the perfect

<p>Introduction: A couple security researchersclaim to have cracked the netflix dataset. The
claims of success appear somewhat overstated to me, but the method of attack
is valid and could plausibly be substantially improved so as to reveal the
movie preferences of a small fraction of Netflix users.The basic idea is to
use a heuristic similarity function between ratings in a public database (from
IMDB) and an anonymized database (Netflix) to link ratings in the private
database to public identities (in IMDB). They claim to have linked two of a
few dozen IMDB users to anonymized netflix users.The claims seem a bit
inflated to me, because (a) knowing the IMDB identity isn't equivalent to
knowing the person and (b) the claims of statistical significance are with
respect to a model of the world they created (rather than one they
created).Overall, this is another example showing that completeprivacy is
hard. It may be worth remembering that there are some substantial benefits
from the Netflix challenge as w</p><p>4 0.50270939 <a title="94-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-10-03-Static_vs._Dynamic_multiclass_prediction.html">373 hunch net-2009-10-03-Static vs. Dynamic multiclass prediction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have had interesting discussions about distinction between static vs.
dynamic classes withKishoreandHal.The distinction arises in multiclass
prediction settings. A static set of classes is given by a set of
labels{1,â&euro;Ś,k}and the goal is generally to choose the most likely label given
features. The static approach is the one that we typically analyze and think
about in machine learning.The dynamic setting is one that is often used in
practice. The basic idea is that the number of classes is not fixed, varying
on a per example basis. These different classes are generally defined by a
choice of features.The distinction between these two settings as far as theory
goes, appears to be very substantial. For example, in the static setting,
inlearning reductions land, we have techniques now for robustO(log(k))time
prediction in many multiclass setting variants. In the dynamic setting, the
best techniques known areO(k), and furthermore this exponential gap may be
essential, at least without fur</p><p>5 0.47438845 <a title="94-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-28-Open_Problems_for_Colt.html">47 hunch net-2005-03-28-Open Problems for Colt</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thelarge scale machine learning classI taught withYann LeCunhas finished. As I
expected, it took quite a bit of time. We had about 25 people attending in
person on average and 400 regularly watching therecorded lectureswhich is
substantially more sustained interest than I expected for an advanced ML
class. We also had some fun with class projects--I'm hopeful that several will
eventually turn into papers.I expect there are a number of professors
interested in lecturing on this and related topics. Everyone will have their
personal taste in subjects of course, but hopefully there will be some
convergence to common course materials as well. To help with this, I am making
thesources to my presentations available. Feel free to

<p>Introduction: I only managed to make it out to the NIPS workshops this year soI'll give my
comments on what I saw there.The Learing and Robotics workshops lives again. I
hope itcontinues and gets more high quality papers in the future. Themost
interesting talk for me was Larry Jackel's on the LAGRprogram (see John's
previous post on said program). I got someideas as to what progress has been
made. Larry really explainedthe types of benchmarks and the tradeoffs that had
to be made tomake the goals achievable but challenging.Hal Daume gave a very
interesting talk about structuredprediction using RL techniques, something
near and dear to my ownheart. He achieved rather impressive results using only
a verygreedy search.The non-parametric Bayes workshop was great. I enjoyed the
entiremorning session I spent there, and particularly (the usuallydesultory)

<p>Introduction: TheHeritage Health Prizeis potentially the largest prediction prize yet at
$3M, which is sure to get many people interested. Several elements of the
competition may be worth discussing.The most straightforward way for HPN to
deploy this predictor is in determining who to cover with insurance. This
might easily cover the costs of running the contest itself, but the value to
the health system of a whole is minimal, as people not covered still exist.
While HPN itself is a provider network, they have active relationships with a
number of insurance companies, and the right to resell any entrant. It's worth
keeping in mind that the research and development may nevertheless end up
being useful in the longer term, especially as entrants also keep the right to
their code.Thejudging metricis something I haven't seen previously. If a
patient has probability 0.5 of being in the hospital 0 days and probability
0.5 of being in the hospital ~53.6 days, the optimal prediction in expectation
is ~6.4 da</p><p>6 0.77157426 <a title="94-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-20-New_York%26%238217%3Bs_ML_Day.html">322 hunch net-2008-10-20-New York&#8217;s ML Day</a></p>

is "how"?Reviewing is done by paper writers just like yourself, so a good
proxy for this question is asking "How can I be a better reviewer?" Here are a

reviewer.The secret ingredient is careful thought. There is no good
substitution for a deep and careful understanding.Avoid reviewing papers that
you feel competitive about. You almost certainly will be asked to review
papers that feel competitive if you work on subjects of common interest. But,
the feeling of competition can easily lead to bad judgement.If you feel biased
for some other reason, then you should avoid reviewing. For exampleâ&euro;ŚFeeling
angry or threatened by a paper is a form of bias. See above.Double blind

<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms

<p>Introduction: Most long conversations between academics seem to converge on the topic of
reviewing where almost no one is happy. A basic question is: Should most

flow of papers realizes that most papers amount to little in the longer term.
By it's nature research is brutal, where the second-best method is worthless,
and the second person to discover things typically gets no credit. If you
think about this for a moment, it's very different from most other human
endeavors. The second best migrant laborer, construction worker, manager,
conductor, quarterback, etcâ&euro;Ś all can manage quite well. If a reviewer has even
a vaguely predictive sense of what's important in the longer term, then most
people submitting papers will be unhappy.But this argument unravels, in my
experience. Perhaps half of reviews are thoughtless or simply wrong with a

<p>Introduction: Claireasked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite
a bit of work.I had a relatively light load--merely 49 theory papers. Many of
these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common
for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help
review the papers. I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally. There were a
couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed
off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.There are some
differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and
theory communities. In machine learning it is expected that a review be
detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case. Every
paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very
detailed.I'm sure not every author was happy with the outcome. While we did
our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make. For
example, if there is a</p><p>6 0.24389757 <a title="116-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Reviewing is a fairly formal process which is integral to the way academia is
run. Given this integral nature, the quality of reviewing is often
frustrating. I've seen plenty of examples of false statements, misbeliefs,
reading what isn't written, etcâ&euro;Ś, and I'm sure many other people have as
well.Recently, mechanisms like double blind review and author feedback have
been introduced to try to make the process more fair and accurate in many
machine learning (and related) conferences. My personal experience is that
these mechanisms help, especially the author feedback. Nevertheless, some
problems remain.The game theory take on reviewing is that the incentive for
truthful reviewing isn't there. Since reviewers are also authors, there are
sometimes perverse incentives created and acted upon. (Incidentially, these
incentives can be both positive and negative.)Setting up a truthful reviewing
system is tricky because their is no final reference truth available in any
acceptable (say: subyear)</p><p>3 0.83361757 <a title="116-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-13-Avoiding_Bad_Reviewing.html">40 hunch net-2005-03-13-Avoiding Bad Reviewing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>3 0.86804938 <a title="116-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-05-ICML_acceptance_statistics.html">466 hunch net-2012-06-05-ICML acceptance statistics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Most long conversations between academics seem to converge on the topic of
reviewing where almost no one is happy. A basic question is: Should most
people be happy?The case against is straightforward. Anyone who watches the
flow of papers realizes that most papers amount to little in the longer term.
By it's nature research is brutal, where the second-best method is worthless,
and the second person to discover things typically gets no credit. If you
think about this for a moment, it's very different from most other human
endeavors. The second best migrant laborer, construction worker, manager,
conductor, quarterback, etcâ&euro;Ś all can manage quite well. If a reviewer has even
a vaguely predictive sense of what's important in the longer term, then most
people submitting papers will be unhappy.But this argument unravels, in my
experience. Perhaps half of reviews are thoughtless or simply wrong with a
small part being simply malicious. And yet, I'm sure that most reviewers
genuinely believe th</p><p>5 0.86407393 <a title="116-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>6 0.85884476 <a title="116-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-28-Why_COLT%3F.html">453 hunch net-2012-01-28-Why COLT?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Manifold based dimension-reduction algorithms share the following general outline.  
 
Given: a metric  d()  and a set of points  S 
  
 Construct a graph with a point in every node and every edge connecting to the node of one of the  k -nearest neighbors.  Associate with the edge a weight which is the distance between the points in the connected nodes. 
 Digest the graph.  This might include computing the shortest path between all points or figuring out how to linearly interpolate the point from it’s neighbors. 
 Find a set of points in a low dimensional space which preserve the digested properties. 
  
Examples include LLE, Isomap (which I worked on), Hessian-LLE, SDE, and many others.  The hope with these algorithms is that they can recover the low dimensional structure of point sets in high dimensional spaces.  Many of them can be shown to work in interesting ways producing various compelling pictures.

<p>Introduction: Hal ,  Daniel , and I have been working on the algorithm  Searn  for structured prediction.  This was just conditionally accepted and then rejected from ICML, and we were quite surprised.  By any reasonable criteria, it seems this is an interesting algorithm.
  
 Prediction Performance: Searn performed better than any other algorithm on all the problems we tested against using the same feature set.  This is true even using the numbers reported by authors in their papers. 
 Theoretical underpinning.  Searn is a reduction which comes with a reduction guarantee: the good performance on a base classifiers implies good performance for the overall system.  No other theorem of this type has been made for other structured prediction algorithms, as far as we know. 
 Speed. Searn has no problem handling much larger datasets than other algorithms we tested against. 
 Simplicity.  Given code for a binary classifier and a problem-specific search algorithm, only a few tens of lines are necessary to</p><p>4 0.10892148 <a title="87-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-24-COLT_Treasurer_is_now_Phil_Long.html">394 hunch net-2010-04-24-COLT Treasurer is now Phil Long</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For about 5 years, I’ve been the treasurer of the Association for Computational Learning, otherwise known as COLT, taking over from  John Case  before me.  A transfer of duties to  Phil Long  is now about complete.  This probably matters to almost no one, but I wanted to describe things a bit for those interested.
 
The immediate impetus for this decision was unhappiness over reviewing decisions at  COLT 2009 , one as an author and several as a member of the program committee.  I seem to have disagreements fairly often about what is important work, partly because I’m focused on learning theory with practical implications, partly because I define learning theory more broadly than is typical amongst COLT members, and partly because COLT suffers a bit from insider-clique issues.  The degree to which these issues come up varies substantially each year so last year is not predictive of this one.  And, it’s important to understand that COLT remains healthy with these issues not nearly so bad</p><p>5 0.097148426 <a title="87-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-24-Specializations_of_the_Master_Problem.html">388 hunch net-2010-01-24-Specializations of the Master Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing which is clear on a little reflection is that there exists a single master learning problem capable of encoding essentially all learning problems.  This problem is of course a very general sort of reinforcement learning where the world interacts with an agent as:
  
 The world announces an observation  x . 
 The agent makes a choice  a . 
 The world announces a reward  r . 
  
The goal here is to maximize the sum of the rewards over the time of the agent.  No particular structure relating  x  to  a  or  a  to  r  is implied by this setting so we do not know effective general algorithms for the agent.  It’s very easy to prove lower bounds showing that an agent cannot hope to succeed here—just consider the case where actions are unrelated to rewards.  Nevertheless, there is a real sense in which essentially all forms of life are agents operating in this setting, somehow succeeding.

<p>Introduction: Compressed Sensing  (CS) is a new framework developed by  Emmanuel Candes ,  Terry Tao  and  David Donoho . To summarize, if you acquire a signal in some basis that is incoherent with the basis in which you know the signal to be sparse in, it is very likely you will be able to reconstruct the signal from these incoherent projections. 
 
Terry Tao, the recent  Fields medalist , does a very nice job at explaining the framework  here . He goes further in the theory description in this  post  where he mentions the central issue of the Uniform Uncertainty Principle. It so happens that random projections are on average incoherent, within the UUP meaning, with most known basis (sines, polynomials, splines, wavelets, curvelets …) and are therefore an ideal basis for Compressed Sensing. [ For more in-depth information on the subject, the Rice group has done a very good job at providing a central library of papers relevant to the growing subject:  http://www.dsp.ece.rice.edu/cs/  ]

<p>Introduction: Several talks seem potentially interesting to ML folks at this year’s SODA.
  
  Maria-Florina Balcan ,  Avrim Blum , and  Anupam Gupta ,  Approximate Clustering without the Approximation .  This paper gives reasonable algorithms with provable approximation guarantees for k-median and other notions of clustering.  It’s conceptually interesting, because it’s the second example I’ve seen where NP hardness is subverted by changing the problem definition subtle but reasonable way.  Essentially, they show that if any near-approximation to an optimal solution is good, then it’s computationally easy to find a near-optimal solution.  This subtle shift bears serious thought.  A similar one occurred in  our ranking paper  with respect to minimum feedback arcset.  With two known examples, it suggests that many more NP-complete problems might be finessed into irrelevance in this style.

<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.
 
Topic Models:
  
   
Dynamic Topic Models  
David Blei, John Lafferty 
A nice model for how topics in LDA type models can evolve over time, 
using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters and a very 
clever structured variational approximation (in which the mean field 
parameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all Blei 
papers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive. 
   
Pachinko Allocation  
Wei Li, Andrew McCallum 
A very elegant (but computationally challenging) model which induces 
correlation amongst topics using a multi-level DAG whose interior nodes 
are “super-topics” and “sub-topics” and whose leaves are the 
vocabulary words. Makes the slumbering monster of structure learning stir. 
  
Sequence Analysis (I missed these talks since I was chairing another session)

<p>Introduction: One standard approach for clustering data with a set of gaussians is using EM.  Roughly speaking, you pick a set of  k  random guassians and then use alternating expectation maximization to (hopefully) find a set of guassians that “explain” the data well.  This process is difficult to work with because EM can become “stuck” in local optima.   There are various hacks like “rerun with  t  different random starting points”.
 
One cool observation is that this can often be solved via other algorithm which do  not  suffer from local optima.  This is an early  paper  which shows this.  Ravi Kannan presented a  new paper  showing this is possible in a much more adaptive setting.  
 
A very rough summary of these papers is that by projecting into a lower dimensional space, it is computationally tractable to pick out the gross  structure of the data.  It is unclear how well these algorithms work in practice, but they might be effective, especially if used as a subroutine of the form:

<p>Introduction: A new version of  VW  is  out .  The primary changes are:
  
  Learning Reductions : I’ve wanted to get  learning reductions  working and we’ve finally done it.  Not everything is implemented yet, but VW now supports direct:
 
 Multiclass Classification  –oaa  or  –ect . 
 Cost Sensitive Multiclass Classification  –csoaa  or  –wap . 
 Contextual Bandit Classification  –cb . 
 Sequential Structured Prediction   –searn  or  –dagger  
 

In addition, it is now easy to build your own custom learning reductions for various plausible uses: feature diddling, custom structured prediction problems, or alternate learning reductions.  This effort is far from done, but it is now in a generally useful state.  Note that all learning reductions inherit the ability to do cluster parallel learning.

 
  Library interface :  VW now has a basic library interface.  The library provides most of the functionality of VW, with the limitation that it is monolithic and nonreentrant.  These will be improved over</p><p>3 0.80528468 <a title="87-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-09-The_Stock_Prediction_Machine_Learning_Problem.html">193 hunch net-2006-07-09-The Stock Prediction Machine Learning Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: …is discussed in  this nytimes article .  I generally expect such approaches to become more common since computers are getting faster, machine learning is getting better, and data is becoming more plentiful.   This is another example where machine learning technology may have a huge economic impact.  Some side notes:
  
 We-in-research know almost nothing about how these things are done (because it is typically a corporate secret). 
 … but the limited discussion in the article seem naive from a machine learning viewpoint.
 
 The learning process used apparently often fails to take into account transaction costs. 
 What little of the approaches is discussed appears modeling based.  It seems plausible that more direct prediction methods can yield an edge. 
 
 
 One difficulty with stock picking as a research topic is that it is inherently a zero sum game (for every winner, there is a loser).  Much of the rest of research is positive sum (basically, everyone wins).</p><p>4 0.79928106 <a title="87-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-26-To_calibrate_or_not%3F.html">62 hunch net-2005-04-26-To calibrate or not?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A calibrated predictor is one which predicts the probability of a binary event with the property: For all predictions  p , the proportion of the time that  1  is observed is  p .
 
Since there are infinitely many  p , this definition must be “softened” to make sense for any finite number of samples.  The standard method for “softening” is to consider all predictions in a small neighborhood about each possible  p .
 
A great deal of effort has been devoted to strategies for achieving calibrated (such as  here ) prediction.  With statements like: (under minimal conditions) you can always make calibrated predictions.  
 
Given the strength of these statements, we might conclude we are done, but that would be a “confusion of ends”.  A confusion of ends arises in the following way:
  
 We want good probabilistic predictions. 
 Good probabilistic predictions are calibrated. 
 Therefore, we want calibrated predictions. 
  
The “Therefore” step misses the fact that calibration is a necessary b</p><p>5 0.78838229 <a title="87-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-22-Exemplar_programming.html">215 hunch net-2006-10-22-Exemplar programming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are many different abstractions for problem definition and solution.  Here are a few examples:
  
 Functional programming: a set of functions are defined.  The composed execution of these functions yields the solution. 
 Linear programming: a set of constraints and a linear objective function are defined.  An LP solver finds the constrained optimum. 
 Quadratic programming: Like linear programming, but the language is a little more flexible (and the solution slower). 
 Convex programming: like quadratic programming, but the language is more flexible (and the solutions even slower). 
 Dynamic programming: a recursive definition of the problem is defined and then solved efficiently via caching tricks. 
 SAT programming: A problem is specified as a satisfiability involving a conjunction of a disjunction of boolean variables.  A general engine attempts to find a good satisfying assignment.  For example  Kautz’s   blackbox  planner. 
  
These abstractions have different tradeoffs betw</p><p>6 0.70836514 <a title="87-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-21-What_is_the_right_form_of_modularity_in_structured_prediction%3F.html">74 hunch net-2005-05-21-What is the right form of modularity in structured prediction?</a></p>

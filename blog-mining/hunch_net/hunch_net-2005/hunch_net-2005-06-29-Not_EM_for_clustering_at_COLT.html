in every node and every edge connecting to the node of one of thek-nearest

<p>Introduction: Hal,Daniel, and I have been working on the algorithmSearnfor structured
prediction. This was just conditionally accepted and then rejected from ICML,
and we were quite surprised. By any reasonable criteria, it seems this is an
interesting algorithm.Prediction Performance: Searn performed better than any
other algorithm on all the problems we tested against using the same feature
set. This is true even using the numbers reported by authors in their
papers.Theoretical underpinning. Searn is a reduction which comes with a
reduction guarantee: the good performance on a base classifiers implies good
performance for the overall system. No other theorem of this type has been
made for other structured prediction algorithms, as far as we know.Speed.
Searn has no problem handling much larger datasets than other algorithms we
tested against.Simplicity. Given code for a binary classifier and a problem-
specific search algorithm, only a few tens of lines are necessary to implement
Searn.Generality.</p><p>4 0.1097464 <a title="87-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-24-COLT_Treasurer_is_now_Phil_Long.html">394 hunch net-2010-04-24-COLT Treasurer is now Phil Long</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For about 5 years, I've been the treasurer of the Association for
Computational Learning, otherwise known as COLT, taking over fromJohn
Casebefore me. A transfer of duties toPhil Longis now about complete. This
probably matters to almost no one, but I wanted to describe things a bit for
those interested.The immediate impetus for this decision was unhappiness over
reviewing decisions atCOLT 2009, one as an author and several as a member of
the program committee. I seem to have disagreements fairly often about what is
important work, partly because I'm focused on learning theory with practical
implications, partly because I define learning theory more broadly than is
typical amongst COLT members, and partly because COLT suffers a bit from
insider-clique issues. The degree to which these issues come up varies
substantially each year so last year is not predictive of this one. And, it's
important to understand that COLT remains healthy with these issues not nearly
so bad asthey were. Never</p><p>5 0.10061278 <a title="87-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-24-Specializations_of_the_Master_Problem.html">388 hunch net-2010-01-24-Specializations of the Master Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing which is clear on a little reflection is that there exists a single
master learning problem capable of encoding essentially all learning problems.
This problem is of course a very general sort of reinforcement learning where
the world interacts with an agent as:The world announces an observationx.The
agent makes a choicea.The world announces a rewardr.The goal here is to
maximize the sum of the rewards over the time of the agent. No particular
structure relatingxtoaoratoris implied by this setting so we do not know
effective general algorithms for the agent. It's very easy to prove lower
bounds showing that an agent cannot hope to succeed here--just consider the
case where actions are unrelated to rewards. Nevertheless, there is a real
sense in which essentially all forms of life are agents operating in this
setting, somehow succeeding. The gap between these observations drives
research--How can we find tractable specializations of the master problem

<p>Introduction: One of the basic observations from theatomic learning workshopis that
gradient-based optimization is pervasive. For example, at least 7 (of 12)
speakers used the word 'gradient' in their talk and several others may be
approximating a gradient. The essential useful quality of a gradient is that
it decouples local updates from global optimization. Restated: Given a
gradient, we can determine how to change individual parameters of the system
so as to improve overall performance.It's easy to feel depressed about this
and think "nothing has happened", but that appears untrue. Many of the talks
were about clever techniques for computing gradients where your calculus
textbook breaks down.Sometimes there are clever approximations of the
gradient. (Simon Osindero)Sometimes we can compute constrained gradients via
iterated gradient/project steps. (Ben Taskar)Sometimes we can compute
gradients anyways over mildly nondifferentiable functions. (Drew Bagnell)Even

<p>Introduction: I've been looking at some recent embeddings work, and am struck by how
beautiful the theory and algorithms are. It also makes me wonder, what are
embeddings good for?A few things immediately come to mind:(1) For
visualization of high-dimensional data sets.In this case, one would like good
algorithms for embedding specifically into 2- and 3-dimensional Euclidean
spaces.(2) For nonparametric modeling.The usual nonparametric models
(histograms, nearest neighbor) often require resources which are exponential
in the dimension. So if the data actually lie close to some low-
dimensionalsurface, it might be a good idea to first identify this surface and
embed the data before applying the model.Incidentally, for applications like
these, it's important to have a functional mapping from high to low dimension,
which some techniques do not yield up.(3) As a prelude to classifier
learning.The hope here is presumably that learning will be easier in the low-
dimensional space, because of (i) better ge</p><p>5 0.53427768 <a title="87-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-05-more_icml_papers.html">189 hunch net-2006-07-05-more icml papers</a></p>

ModelsDavid Blei, John LaffertyA nice model for how topics in LDA type models
can evolve over time,using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters
and a veryclever structured variational approximation (in which the mean
fieldparameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all
Bleipapers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive.Pachinko

challenging) model which inducescorrelation amongst topics using a multi-level

<p>Introduction: Hunch.net has shifted to a new server, and wordpress has been updated to the
latest version. If anyone notices difficulties associated with this, please
comment. (Note that DNS updates can take awhile so the shift may not yet be
complete.)More generally, this is a good time to ask for suggestions. What
would make this blog more useful?</p><p>2 0.9056313 <a title="87-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-06-Structured_Regret_Minimization.html">53 hunch net-2005-04-06-Structured Regret Minimization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Geoff Gordon made an interesting presentation at thesnowbird learning
workshopdiscussing the use of no-regret algorithms for the use of several
robot-related learning problems. There seems to be a drafthere. This seems
interesting in two ways:Drawback RemovalOne of the significant problems with
these online algorithms is that they can't cope with structure very easily.
This drawback is addressed for certain structures.ExperimentsOne criticism of
such algorithms is that they are too "worst case". Several experiments suggest
that protecting yourself against this worst case does not necessarily incur a
great loss.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.87732029 <a title="87-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-29-Not_EM_for_clustering_at_COLT.html">87 hunch net-2005-06-29-Not EM for clustering at COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One standard approach for clustering data with a set of gaussians is using EM.
Roughly speaking, you pick a set ofkrandom guassians and then use alternating
expectation maximization to (hopefully) find a set of guassians that "explain"
the data well. This process is difficult to work with because EM can become
"stuck" in local optima. There are various hacks like "rerun withtdifferent
random starting points".One cool observation is that this can often be solved
via other algorithm which donotsuffer from local optima. This is an
earlypaperwhich shows this. Ravi Kannan presented anew papershowing this is
possible in a much more adaptive setting.A very rough summary of these papers
is that by projecting into a lower dimensional space, it is computationally
tractable to pick out the gross structure of the data. It is unclear how well
these algorithms work in practice, but they might be effective, especially if
used as a subroutine of the form:Project to low dimensional space.Pick out

<p>Introduction: Sashais theopen problemschair for bothCOLTandICML. Open problems will be
presented in a joint session in the evening of the COLT/ICML overlap day. COLT
has a history of open sessions, but this is new for ICML. If you have a
difficult theoretically definable problem in machine learning, consider
submitting it for review,due March 16. You'll benefit three ways:The effort of
writing down a precise formulation of what you want often helps you understand
the nature of the problem.Your problem will be officially published and
citable.You might have it solved by some very intelligent bored people.The
general idea could easily be applied to any problem which can be crisply
stated with an easily verifiable solution, and we may consider expanding this
in later years, but for this year all problems need to be of a theoretical
variety.Joelleand I (andMahdi, andLaurent) finished an initial assignment

<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made sinceSanjoypointed out the
significantlack of theoretical understanding of active learning. This is an
update on the progress I know of. As a refresher, active learning as meant
here is:There is a source of unlabeled data.There is an oracle from which
labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source.The goal is
to perform well with minimal use of the oracle.Here is what I've
learned:Sanjoy has developed sufficient and semi-necessary conditions for
active learning given the assumptions of IID data and "realizability" (that
one of the classifiers is a correct classifier).Nina,Alina, and I developed an
algorithm for active learning relying on only the assumption of IID data. A
draft ishere.Nicolo,Claudio, andLucashowed that it is possible to do active
learning in an entirely adversarial setting for linear threshold
classifiershere. This was published a year or two ago and I recently learned
about it.All of these results are relative</p><p>6 0.63166738 <a title="87-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks_for_RL.html">148 hunch net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks for RL</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.  This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.  Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention.  Roughly speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your interest.  The main conference program consists of elements related to someoneâ&euro;&trade;s interest (which is rarely your own).  Workshops are more about doing research while conferences are more about presenting research.

 Several   times   before , details of why and how to run a  workshop have been mentioned.  
 
There is a simple reason to prefer workshops here: attendance.  The Helsinki colocation has placed workshops  directly between ICML and COLT/UAI , which is optimal for getting attendees from any conference.  In addition,  last year ICML had relatively few workshops  and NIPS workshops were overloaded.  In addition to  those that happened  a similar number were rejected.  The overload has strange consequences—for example,  the best attended workshop  wasn’t an official NIPS workshop.  Aside from intrinsic interest, the Deep Learning workshop benefited greatly from being off schedule.</p><p>4 0.24781723 <a title="141-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-10-Workshops_are_not_Conferences.html">80 hunch net-2005-06-10-Workshops are not Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: … and you should use that fact.
 
A workshop differs from a conference in that it is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic.  It also differs in that a workshop is typically a “one-time affair” rather than a series.  (The  Snowbird learning workshop  counts as a conference in this respect.)  
 
A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop is to treat it as a conference.  This is “ok”, but it is not really taking advantage of the situation.  Here are some things I’ve learned:
  
 For speakers: A smaller audience means it can be more interactive.  Interactive means a better chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation (because you can adapt to your audience).  Greater focus amongst the participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and discuss tradeoffs more carefully.  Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued than newness. 
 For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference st</p><p>5 0.22963612 <a title="141-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML.  I did manage to catch one interesting paper:
 
 Richard Socher ,  Cliff Lin ,  Andrew Y. Ng , and  Christopher D. Manning   Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks .
 
I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so hopefully we’ll hear from him soon.  In the meantime,  Paul  and  Hal  have posted some lists.
 
 the future 
 
 Joelle  and I are program chairs for ICML 2012 in  Edinburgh , which I previously enjoyed visiting in  2005 .  This is a huge responsibility, that we hope to accomplish well.  A part of this (perhaps the most fun part), is imagining how we can make ICML better.  A key and critical constraint is choosing things that can be accomplished.  So far we have:
  
  Colocation . The first thing we looked into was potential colocations.  We quickly discovered that many other conferences precomitted their location.

<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.  
  
 It’s entirely reasonable for anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don’t have a paper.  For students, visiting a conference is almost a ‘must’—there is no where else that a broad cross-section of research is on display. 
 Workshops are also a very good idea.   ICML has 11 ,  KDD has 9 , and  AAAI has 19 .  Workshops provide an opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research.  They are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research because they are so interactive. 
 Tutorials are a good way to gain some understanding of a long-standing direction of research.  They are generally more coherent than workshops.   ICML has 7  and  AAAI has 15 .</p><p>6 0.65949154 <a title="141-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-14-NIPS.html">71 hunch net-2005-05-14-NIPS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As part of a  PASCAL  project, the Slovenians have been filming various machine learning events and placing them on the web  here .  This includes, for example, the  Chicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer School  as well as a number of other summer schools, workshops, and conferences.
 
There are some significant caveats here—for example, I can’t access it from Linux.  Based upon the webserver logs, I expect that is a problem for most people—Computer scientists are particularly nonstandard in their choice of computing platform.
 
Nevertheless, the core idea here is excellent and details of compatibility can be fixed later.  With modern technology toys, there is no fundamental reason why the process of announcing new work at a conference should happen only once and only for the people who could make it to that room in that conference.  The problems solved include:
  
 The multitrack vs. single-track debate.  (“Sometimes the single track doesn’t interest me” vs. “When it’s multitrack I mis</p><p>2 0.90920681 <a title="141-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-12-05-Recruitment_Conferences.html">222 hunch net-2006-12-05-Recruitment Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the subsidiary roles of conferences is recruitment.   NIPS  is optimally placed in time for this because it falls right before the major recruitment season.
 
I personally found job hunting embarrassing, and was relatively inept at it.  I expect this is true of many people, because it is not something done often. 
 
The basic rule is: make the plausible hirers aware of your interest.  Any  corporate sponsor  is  a “plausible”, regardless of whether or not there is a booth.   CRA  and the  acm job center  are other reasonable sources.
 
There are substantial differences between the different possibilities.  Putting some effort into understanding the distinctions is a good idea, although you should always remember where the other person is coming from.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.89985985 <a title="141-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult.  As a conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good papers—enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to (generally) to grow the conference.  For someone choosing to participate in a new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work out?  Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you are sure will work?
 
The conference founding problem is a joint agreement problem with a very significant barrier.  Workshops are a way around this problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective means for this.  A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available.  Presenting work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a confe</p><p>4 0.86629975 <a title="141-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-10-Learning_Reductions_are_Reductionist.html">68 hunch net-2005-05-10-Learning Reductions are Reductionist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about a fundamental motivation for the investigation of reductions in learning.  It applies to many pieces of work other than my own.
 
The reductionist approach to problem solving is characterized by taking a problem, decomposing it into as-small-as-possible subproblems, discovering how to solve the subproblems, and then discovering how to use the solutions to the subproblems to solve larger problems.  The reductionist approach to solving problems has often payed off  very  well.  Computer science related examples of the reductionist approach include:
  
 Reducing computation to the transistor. All of our CPUs are built from transistors. 
 Reducing rendering of images to rendering a triangle (or other simple polygons).  Computers can now render near-realistic scenes in real time. The big breakthrough came from learning how to render many triangles quickly.
  
  
This approach to problem solving extends well beyond computer science.  Many fields of science focus on theories mak</p><p>5 0.79972947 <a title="141-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-02-Prior%2C_%26%238220%3BPrior%26%238221%3B_and_Bias.html">34 hunch net-2005-03-02-Prior, &#8220;Prior&#8221; and Bias</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many different ways of reasoning about learning exist, and many of these suggest that some method of saying “I prefer this predictor to that predictor” is useful and necessary.  Examples include Bayesian reasoning, prediction bounds, and online learning.   One difficulty which arises is that the manner and meaning of saying “I prefer this predictor to that predictor” differs.
  
  Prior  (Bayesian) A prior is a probability distribution over a set of distributions which expresses a belief in the probability that some distribution is the distribution generating the data. 
  “Prior”  (Prediction bounds & online learning) The “prior” is a measure over a set of classifiers which expresses the degree to which you hope the classifier will predict well. 
  Bias  (Regularization, Early termination of neural network training, etc…)  The bias is some (often implicitly specified by an algorithm) way of preferring one predictor to another.

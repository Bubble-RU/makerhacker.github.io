papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to

paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to

</p><p>7 Presenting work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a conference. [sent-8, score-0.557]
</p><p>8 For someone considering participation, the only overhead is the direct time and effort involved in participation. [sent-9, score-0.458]
</p><p>9 All of the above says that workshops are much easier than conferences, but it does not address a critical question: "Why run a workshop at a conference rather than just a session at the conference? [sent-10, score-1.351]
</p><p>10 " A session at the conference would have all the above advantages. [sent-11, score-0.643]
</p><p>11 There is one more very signficant and direct advantage of a workshop over a special session: workshops are run by people who have a direct and significant interest in their success. [sent-12, score-1.595]
</p><p>12 The workshop organizers do the hard work of developing a topic, soliciting speakers, and deciding what the program will be. [sent-13, score-0.703]
</p><p>13 Reputations for the workshop organizer are then built on the success or flop of the workshop. [sent-14, score-0.579]
</p><p>14 This "direct and signficant interest" aspect of a workshop is the basic reason why franchise systems (think 7-11 or McDonalds) are common and successful. [sent-15, score-0.621]
</p><p>15 For example, we could imagine a conference that is "all workshops". [sent-17, score-0.452]
</p><p>16 Instead of having a program committee and program chair, the conference might just have a program chair that accepts or rejects workshop chairs who then organize their own workshop/session. [sent-18, score-1.58]
</p><p>17 This mode doesn't seem to exist which is always cautioning, but on the other hand it 's not clear this mode has even been tried. [sent-19, score-0.254]
</p><p>18 NIPS is probably the conference closest to using this approach. [sent-20, score-0.526]
</p><p>19 For example, a significant number of people attend only the workshops at NIPS. [sent-21, score-0.573]

<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.
This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.
Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance
can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention. Roughly
speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your
interest. The main conference program consists of elements related to
someone's interest (which is rarely your own). Workshops are more about doing
research while conferences are more about presenting research.Several
conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due
shortly.ICML workshopsDue April 1IJCAI workshopsDeadlines VaryKDD workshopsNot

and see if any are of interest. (If none are, then maybe you should organize
one next year.)</p><p>3 0.25171494 <a title="141-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-10-Workshops_are_not_Conferences.html">80 hunch net-2005-06-10-Workshops are not Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś and you should use that fact.A workshop differs from a conference in that it
is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic. It also
differs in that a workshop is typically a "one-time affair" rather than a
series. (TheSnowbird learning workshopcounts as a conference in this
respect.)A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop
is to treat it as a conference. This is "ok", but it is not really taking
advantage of the situation. Here are some things I've learned:For speakers: A
smaller audience means it can be more interactive. Interactive means a better
chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation
(because you can adapt to your audience). Greater focus amongst the
participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and
discuss tradeoffs more carefully. Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued
than newness.For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference style

<p>Introduction: As usualICML 2007will be hosting aworkshop programto be held this year on June
24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you
propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I'd like
to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal
deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for
details.Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group
of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your
choosing. I've always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so
large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a
workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to
potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-
conference on a particular ML sub-area. Hope to see some interesting proposals
rolling in.</p><p>5 0.21842661 <a title="141-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-23-Why_Workshop%3F.html">285 hunch net-2008-01-23-Why Workshop?</a></p>

why and how to run a workshop have been mentioned.There is a simple reason to
prefer workshops here: attendance. The Helsinki colocation has placed
workshopsdirectly between ICML and COLT/UAI, which is optimal for getting
attendees from any conference. In addition,last year ICML had relatively few
workshopsand NIPS workshops were overloaded. In addition tothose that
happeneda similar number were rejected. The overload has strange consequences
--for example,the best attended workshopwasn't an official NIPS workshop.
Aside from intrinsic interest, the Deep Learning workshop benefited greatly
from being off schedule.</p><p>6 0.21379368 <a title="141-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the most confusing things about understanding learning theory is the
vast array of differing assumptions. Some critical thought about which of
these assumptions are reasonable for real-world problems may be useful.Before
we even start thinking about assumptions, it's important to realize that the
word hasmultiple meanings. The meaning used here is "assumption = axiom" (i.e.
something you can not verify).AssumptionReasonable?Which

<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>3 0.83454609 <a title="141-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-19-Workshop%3A_Atomic_Learning.html">124 hunch net-2005-10-19-Workshop: Atomic Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is a field with an impressively diverse set of reseearch
styles. Understanding this may be important in appreciating what you see at a
conference.Engineering. How can I solve this problem? People in the
engineering research style try to solve hard problems directly by any means
available and then describe how they did it. This is typical of problem-
specific conferences and communities.Scientific. What are the principles for
solving learning problems? People in this research style test techniques on
many different problems. This is fairly common at ICML and NIPS.Mathematical.
How can the learning problem be mathematically understood? People in this
research style prove theorems with implications for learning but often do not
implement (or test algorithms). COLT is a typical conference for this
style.Many people manage to cross these styles, and that is often
beneficial.Whenver we list a set of alternative, it becomes natural to think
"which is best?" In this case of le</p><p>5 0.79403198 <a title="141-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-18-Decision_by_Vetocracy.html">343 hunch net-2009-02-18-Decision by Vetocracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Few would mistake the process of academic paper review for a fair process, but
sometimes the unfairness seems particularly striking. This is most easily seen
by comparison:PaperBanditronOffset TreeNotesProblem ScopeMulticlass problems
where only the loss of one choice can be probed.Strictly greater: Cost
sensitive multiclass problems where only the loss of one choice can be
probed.Often generalizations don't matter. That's not the case here, since
every plausible application I've thought of involves loss functions
substantially different from 0/1.What's newAnalysis and ExperimentsAlgorithm,
Analysis, and ExperimentsAs far as I know, the essence of the more general
problem was first stated and analyzed with theEXP4 algorithm (page 16)(1998).
It's also the time horizon 1 simplification of the Reinforcement Learning
setting for therandom trajectory method (page 15)(2002). The Banditron
algorithm itself is functionally identical toOne-Step RL with Traces (page
122)(2003) inBianca's thesis</p><p>6 0.77852631 <a title="141-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-06-22-Ultra_LDA.html">436 hunch net-2011-06-22-Ultra LDA</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired. 
  
In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,  ATnT Research  and  Lucent  had one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the remainder of  Bell Labs , triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine learning group there.  As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.
 
There are a couple positives to the recession as well.

<p>Introduction: The New York Times has an interesting  article  about how DARPA has dropped funding for computer science to universities by about a factor of 2 over the last 5 years and become less directed towards basic research.  Partially in response, the number of grant submissions to NSF has grown by a factor of 3 (with the NSF budget staying approximately constant in the interim).
 
This is the sort of policy decision which may make sense for the defense department, but which means a large hit for basic research on information technology development in the US.  For example “darpa funded the invention of the internet” is reasonably correct.  This policy decision is particularly painful in the context of NSF budget cuts and the end of extensive phone monopoly funded research at Bell labs.

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is encouraging.   There is some discussion of this at the  Computing Research Policy  blog.  
 
One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time, presumably in dollar budgets.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t believe that dollar budgets are the right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers.  A better way to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a measure of the relative emphasis on research.
 
  
 
This graph was assembled by dividing the  NSF budget  by the  US GDP .  For 2005 GDP, I used the  current estimate  and for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per year.  The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to change.
 
This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row.

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

<p>Introduction: I attended the  IBM research 60th anniversary .  IBM research is, by any reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the most value to it’s parent company over the long term.  This can be seen by simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab which has not gone through a period of massive firing.  (Note that there are also  new research labs .)
 
Despite this impressive record, IBM research has failed, by far, to achieve it’s potential.  Examples which came up in this meeting include:
  
 It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented in the lab.  (In fact, Intel produced it first.) 
 Relational databases and SQL were invented and then languished.  It was only under external competition that IBM released it’s own relational database.  Why didn’t IBM grow an  Oracle division ? 
 An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing a  Cisco division .  Why not?

<p>Introduction: My impression is that this is a particularly strong year for machine learning graduates.  Here’s my short list of the strong graduates I know.  Analpha (for perversity’s sake) by last name:
  
  Jenn Wortmann . When Jenn visited us for the summer, she had  one ,  two ,  three ,  four  papers.  That is typical—she’s smart, capable, and follows up many directions of research.  I believe approximately all of her many papers are on different subjects. 
  Ruslan Salakhutdinov . A  Science paper on bijective dimensionality reduction , mastered and improved on deep belief nets which seems like an important flavor of nonlinear learning, and in my experience he’s very fast, capable and creative at problem solving. 
  Marc’Aurelio Ranzato .  I haven’t spoken with Marc very much, but he had a great visit at Yahoo! this summer, and has an impressive portfolio of applications and improvements on convolutional neural networks and other deep learning algorithms.

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: Although I’m greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in reviews.  The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if the  Byzantine generals  limit has been exceeded.  For example, I’ve seen recent reviews where the given reasons for rejecting are:
  
 [ NIPS ] Theorem A is uninteresting because Theorem B is uninteresting. 
 [ UAI ] When you learn by memorization, the problem addressed is trivial. 
 [NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.  
 [NIPS] This has been done before.  (… but not giving any relevant citations)  
  
Just for the record I want to point out what’s wrong with these reviews.  A future world in which such reasons never come up again would be great, but I’m sure these errors will be committed many times more in the future.
  
 This is nonsense.  A theorem should be evaluated based on it’s merits, rather than the merits of another theorem.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people .  Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs, this is serious for  Yahoo! Research .  
 
We had advanced warning from  Prabhakar  through the  simple act of leaving .  Yahoo! Research was a world class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave.  My first thought when I saw the news was “Uhoh,  Rob  said that he knew it was serious when the head of ATnT Research left.”  In this case it was even more significant, because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high engagement with the company.  Prabhakar’s departure is a clear end to that experiment.
 
The result is ambiguous from a business perspective.  Y!R clearly was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses.  I’m not privy to the internal accounting of impact and this is the kind of subject where there c</p><p>6 0.71811205 <a title="36-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-23-%28Dis%29similarities_between_academia_and_open_source_programmers.html">105 hunch net-2005-08-23-(Dis)similarities between academia and open source programmers</a></p>

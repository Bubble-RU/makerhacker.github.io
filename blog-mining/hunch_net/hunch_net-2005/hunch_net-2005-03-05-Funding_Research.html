<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT

<p>Introduction: The New York Times has an interestingarticleabout how DARPA has dropped
funding for computer science to universities by about a factor of 2 over the
last 5 years and become less directed towards basic research. Partially in
response, the number of grant submissions to NSF has grown by a factor of 3
(with the NSF budget staying approximately constant in the interim).This is
the sort of policy decision which may make sense for the defense department,
but which means a large hit for basic research on information technology
development in the US. For example "darpa funded the invention of the
internet" is reasonably correct. This policy decision is particularly painful
in the context of NSF budget cuts and the end of extensive phone monopoly
funded research at Bell labs.The good news from a learning perspective is that
(based on anecdotal evidence) much of the remaining funding is aimed at
learning and learning-related fields. Methods of making good automated

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is
encouraging. There is some discussion of this at theComputing Research
Policyblog.One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time,
presumably in dollar budgets. I don't believe that dollar budgets are the
right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers. A better way
to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a
measure of the relative emphasis on research.This graph was assembled by
dividing theNSF budgetby theUS GDP. For 2005 GDP, I used thecurrent
estimateand for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per
year. The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to
change.This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding
emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row. The reality has been significantly
more severe due toDARPA decreasing fundingand industrial research labs (ATnT

<p>Introduction: I attended theIBM research 60th anniversary. IBM research is, by any
reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the
most value to it's parent company over the long term. This can be seen by
simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab
which has not gone through a period of massive firing. (Note that there are
alsonew research labs.)Despite this impressive record, IBM research has
failed, by far, to achieve it's potential. Examples which came up in this
meeting include:It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented
in the lab. (In fact, Intel produced it first.)Relational databases and SQL
were invented and then languished. It was only under external competition that
IBM released it's own relational database. Why didn't IBM grow anOracle
division?An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing
aCisco division. Why not?And remember â&euro;Ś IBM research is a stark success story

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is
encouraging. There is some discussion of this at theComputing Research
Policyblog.One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time,
presumably in dollar budgets. I don't believe that dollar budgets are the
right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers. A better way
to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a
measure of the relative emphasis on research.This graph was assembled by
dividing theNSF budgetby theUS GDP. For 2005 GDP, I used thecurrent
estimateand for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per
year. The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to
change.This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding
emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row. The reality has been significantly
more severe due toDARPA decreasing fundingand industrial research labs (ATnT

<p>Introduction: A $1M qualifying result was achieved on thepublic Netflix test setby a3-way
ensemble team. This is just in time forYehuda's presentation atKDD, which I'm
sure will be one of the best attended ever.This isn't quite over--there are a
few days for another super-conglomerate team to come together and there is
some small chance that the performance is nonrepresentative of the final test
set, but I expect not.Regardless of the final outcome, the biggest lesson for
ML from the Netflix contest has been the formidable performance edge of
ensemble methods.</p><p>3 0.96072894 <a title="36-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-04-15-NEML_II.html">481 hunch net-2013-04-15-NEML II</a></p>

England. There is a poster session with abstracts due April 19. I understand

<p>Introduction: Vikaspoints out theHerman Goldstine FellowshipatIBM. I was a Herman Goldstine
Fellow, and benefited from the experience a great deal--that's where work on
learning reductions started. If you can do research independently, it's
recommended. Applications are due January 6.</p><p>5 0.90216702 <a title="36-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-13-David_Pennock_starts_Oddhead.html">214 hunch net-2006-10-13-David Pennock starts Oddhead</a></p>

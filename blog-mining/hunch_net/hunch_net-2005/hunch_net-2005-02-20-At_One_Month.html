<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time. 
  Feedback failure .  This blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from</p><p>3 0.24841744 <a title="25-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-25-1_year.html">151 hunch net-2006-01-25-1 year</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the one year (+5 days) anniversary, the natural question is: “Was it helpful for research?”
 
Answer: Yes, and so it shall continue.
 
Some evidence is provided by noticing that I am about a factor of 2 more overloaded with paper ideas than I’ve ever previously been.  It is always hard to estimate counterfactual worlds, but I expect that this is also a factor of 2 more than “What if I had not started the blog?”
 
As for “Why?”, there seem to be two primary effects.
  
 A blog is a mechanism for connecting with people who either think like you or are interested in the same problems.  This allows for concentration of thinking which is very helpful in solving problems. 
 The process of stating things you don’t understand publicly is very helpful in understanding them.  Sometimes you are simply forced to express them in a way which aids understanding.  Sometimes someone else says something which helps.  And sometimes you discover that someone else has already solved the problem.

<p>Introduction: The  New York Times  has an article on the  growth of spam .  Interesting facts include: 9/10 of all email is spam, spam source identification is nearly useless due to botnet spam senders, and image based spam (emails which consist of an image only) are on the growth.
 
Estimates of the cost of spam are almost certainly far to low, because they do not account for the cost in time lost by people.
 
The image based spam which is currently penetrating many filters should be catchable with a more sophisticated application of machine learning technology.  For the spam I see, the rendered images come in only a few formats, which would be easy to recognize via a support vector machine (with RBF kernel), neural network, or even nearest-neighbor architecture.  The mechanics of setting this up to run efficiently is the only real challenge.  This is the next step in the spam war.
 
The response to this system is to make the image based spam even more random.  We should (essentially) expect to see</p><p>6 0.14081539 <a title="25-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-21-Six_Months.html">96 hunch net-2005-07-21-Six Months</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The hunch.net server has been updated.  I’ve taken the opportunity to upgrade the version of wordpress which caused cascading changes.
  
 Old threaded comments are now flattened.  The system we used to use ( Brian’s threaded comments ) appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress.  I haven’t yet figured out a workaround. 
 I setup a  feedburner account . 
 I added an RSS aggregator for both Machine Learning and other research blogs that I like to follow.  This is something that I’ve wanted to do for awhile. 
 Many other minor changes in font and format, with some help from  Alina .

<p>Introduction: Centmail  is a scheme which makes charity donations have a secondary value, as a stamp for email.  When discussed on  newscientist ,  slashdot , and others, some of the comments make the academic review process appear thoughtful   .  Some prominent fallacies are:
  
 Costing money fallacy.  Some commenters appear to believe the system charges money per email.  Instead, the basic idea is that users get an extra benefit from donations to a charity and participation is strictly voluntary.  The solution to this fallacy is simply reading  the details . 
 Single solution fallacy.  Some commenters seem to think this is proposed as a complete solution to spam, and since not everyone will opt to participate, it won’t work.  But a complete solution is not at all necessary or even possible given the  flag-day problem .  Deployed machine learning systems for fighting spam are great at taking advantage of a partial solution.  The solution to this fallacy is learning about machine learning.

<p>Introduction: I just visited  ISI  where  Daniel Marcu  and others are working on machine translation.  Apparently, machine translation is rapidly improving.   A particularly dramatic year was 2002->2003 when systems switched from word-based translation to phrase-based translation.  From a (now famous) slide by Charles Wayne at  DARPA  (which funds much of the work on machine translation) here is some anecdotal evidence:

 And said the official “the institution sent a speech to Ministry of Foreign Affairs of lifting on Libya air, a situation her recieving replying are so a trip will pull to Libya a morning Wednesday.”

<p>Introduction: Textbooks invariably seem to carry the proof that uses Markov’s inequality, moment-generating functions, and Taylor approximations. Here’s an easier way.
 
For  , let   be the KL divergence between a coin of bias   and one of bias  :  
 
 Theorem:  Suppose you do   independent tosses of a coin of bias  . The probability of seeing   heads or more, for  , is at most  . So is the probability of seeing   heads or less, for  .
 
 Remark:  By Pinsker’s inequality,  .
 
 Proof  Let’s do the   case; the other is identical.
 
Let   be the distribution over   induced by a coin of bias  , and likewise   for a coin of bias  . Let   be the set of all sequences of   tosses which contain   heads or more. We’d like to show that   is unlikely under  .
 
Pick any  , with say   heads. Then: 
 
 
Since   for every  , we have   and we’re done.</p><p>3 0.88366389 <a title="25-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-06-30-ICML_has_a_comment_system.html">305 hunch net-2008-06-30-ICML has a comment system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Reid  has stepped up and created a  comment system for ICML papers  which  Greger Linden  has tightly integrated.  
 
My understanding is that Mark spent quite  a bit of time on the details, and there are some cool features like working latex math mode.  This is an excellent chance for the ICML community to experiment with making ICML year-round, so I hope it works out.  Please do consider experimenting with it.</p><p>4 0.87475806 <a title="25-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-23-Interesting_papers_at_ACL.html">97 hunch net-2005-07-23-Interesting papers at ACL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  recent discussion  indicated that one goal of this blog might be to allow people to post comments about recent papers that they liked.  I think this could potentially be very useful, especially for those with diverse interests but only finite time to read through conference proceedings.   ACL 2005  recently completed, and here are four papers from that conference that I thought were either good or perhaps of interest to a machine learning audience.
 
David Chiang,   A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation  . (Best paper award.) This paper takes the standard phrase-based MT model that is popular in our field (basically, translate a sentence by individually translating phrases and reordering them according to a complicated statistical model) and extends it to take into account hierarchy in phrases, so that you can learn things like “X ‘s Y” -> “Y de X” in chinese, where X and Y are arbitrary phrases. This takes a step toward linguistic syntax for MT, whic</p><p>5 0.87296849 <a title="25-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-10-Conferences%2C_Dates%2C_Locations.html">17 hunch net-2005-02-10-Conferences, Dates, Locations</a></p>

The big winner this year is Europe.   This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.  With  cuts to basic science  in the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside the US become more attractive.   Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english in place.  China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>same-blog 6 0.86641294 <a title="25-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest. The
problem with discussing politics is that it's customary for people to say much
based upon little information. Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial
impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa). It's primary
election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the
issues are not.There are several policy decisions which substantially effect
development of science and technology in the US.EducationThe US has great
contrasts in education. The top universities are very good places, yet the
grade school education system produces mediocre results. For me, the contrast
between apublic educationandCaltechwas bracing. For many others attending
Caltech, it clearly was not. Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is
a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about. My own

<p>Introduction: The internet has significantly effected the way we do research but it's
capabilities have not yet been fully realized.First, let's acknowledge some
known effects.Self-publishingBy default, all researchers in machine learning
(and more generally computer science and physics) place their papers online
for anyone to download. The exact mechanism differs--physicists tend to use a
central repository (Arxiv) while computer scientists tend to place the papers
on their webpage. Arxiv has been slowly growing in subject breadth so it now
sometimes used by computer scientists.CollaborationEmail has enabled working
remotely with coauthors. This has allowed collaborationis which would not
otherwise have been possible and generally speeds research.Now, let's look at
attempts to go further.Blogs(like this one) allow public discussion about
topics which are not easily categorized as "a new idea in machine learning"
(like this topic).Organizationof some subfield of research. This

<p>Introduction: This is about the hard choices that graduate students must make.The cultural
definition of success in academic research is to:Produce good research which
many other people appreciate.Produce many students who go on to do the
same.There are fundamental reasons why this is success in the local culture.
Good research appreciated by others means access to jobs. Many students
succesful in the same way implies that there are a number of people who think
in a similar way and appreciate your work.In order to graduate, a phd student
must live in an academic culture for a period of several years. It is common
to adopt the culture's definition of success during this time. It's also
common for many phd students discover they are not suited to an academic
research lifestyle. This collision of values and abilities naturally results
in depression.The most fundamental advice when this happens is: change
something. Pick a new advisor. Pick a new research topic. Or leave the program
(and do something el</p><p>5 0.10769013 <a title="106-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-01-The_Producer-Consumer_Model_of_Research.html">51 hunch net-2005-04-01-The Producer-Consumer Model of Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the quest to understand what good reviewing is, perhaps it's worthwhile to
think about what good research is. One way to think about good research is in
terms of a producer/consumer model.In the producer/consumer model of research,
for any element of research there are producers (authors and coauthors of
papers, for example) and consumers (people who use the papers to make new
papers or code solving problems). An produced bit of research is judged as
"good" if it is used by many consumers. There are two basic questions which
immediately arise:Is this a good model of research?Are there alternatives?The
producer/consumer model has some difficulties which can be (partially)
addressed.Disconnect.A group of people doing research on some subject may
become disconnected from the rest of the world. Each person uses the research
of other people in the group so it appears good research is being done, but
the group has no impact on the rest of the world. One way to detect this is by

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and
then trying to figure out how to get there.A big part of science fiction is
imagining how things could be different, and then working through the
implications.Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can
sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research. (And, hey, it's
fun.) Here's some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem
particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning
systems:Vernor Vinge, "True Names", "A Fire Upon the Deep"Marc Stiegler,
"David's Sling", "Earthweb"Charles Stross, "Singularity Sky"Greg Egan,
"Diaspora"Joe Haldeman, "Forever Peace"(There are surely many
others.)Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.
Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans
control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series). That didn't really happen in the
last 50 years. Instead, we gradually refined the degree to whi</p><p>4 0.63756645 <a title="106-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-28-The_Coming_Patent_Apocalypse.html">241 hunch net-2007-04-28-The Coming Patent Apocalypse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in computer science believe that patents are problematic. The
truth is even worse--the patent system in the US is fundamentally broken in
ways that will require much more significant reform thanis being considered
now.The myth of the patent is the following: Patents are a mechanism for
inventors to be compensated according to the value of their inventions while
making the invention available to all. This myth sounds pretty desirable, but
the reality is a strange distortion slowly leading towards collapse.There are
many problems associated with patents, but I would like to focus on just two
of them:Patent TrollsThe way that patents have generally worked over the last
several decades is that they were a tool of large companies. Large companies
would amass a large number of patents and then cross-license each other's
patents--in effect saying "we agree to owe each other nothing". Smaller
companies would sometimes lose in this game, essentially because they didn't
have enough p</p><p>5 0.63730669 <a title="106-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-14-The_Predictionist_Viewpoint.html">112 hunch net-2005-09-14-The Predictionist Viewpoint</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Virtually every discipline of significant human endeavor has a way explaining
itself as fundamental and important. In all the cases I know of, they are both
right (they are vital) and wrong (they are not solely vital).Politics. This is
the one that everyone is familiar with at the moment. "What could be more
important than the process of making decisions?"Science and Technology. This
is the one that we-the-academics are familiar with. "The loss of modern
science and technology would be catastrophic."Military. "Without the military,
a nation will be invaded and destroyed."(insert your favorite here)Within
science and technology, the same thing happens again.Mathematics. "What could
be more important than a precise language for establishing truths?"Physics.
"Nothing is more fundamental than the laws which govern the universe.
Understanding them is the key to understanding everything else."Biology.

fundamental."Computer S</p><p>6 0.60116184 <a title="106-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-02-Proprietary_Data_in_Academic_Research%3F.html">306 hunch net-2008-07-02-Proprietary Data in Academic Research?</a></p>

mandatory for success. Aside from exposing yourself to a large collection of
different ideas, many interesting conversations leading to new research happen
at conferences. If you are a student, you should plan to go to at least one

<p>Introduction: I found the article on "Political Science" at theNew York Timesinteresting.
Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been
systematically distorting scientific views. With apetitionby some7000+
scientistsalleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.One
thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are
fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the
world. In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued. This value is
achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms. One example of a formal
mechanism is peer review.In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value
is agreement. It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be
passed or other actions can be taken. Since Science (with a capitol 'S') has
accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.
This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mechanism for
pushing agreement</p><p>3 0.85230201 <a title="106-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-20-Both_new%3A_STOC_workshops_and_NEML.html">462 hunch net-2012-04-20-Both new: STOC workshops and NEML</a></p>
<p>Introduction: May 16 in Cambridge, is theNew England Machine Learning Day, a first regional
workshop/symposium on machine learning. To present a poster, submit an
abstract byMay 5.May 19 in New York,STOCis coming to town and rather
surprisingly havingworkshopswhich should be quite a bit of fun. I'll be
speaking atAlgorithms for Distributed and Streaming Data.</p><p>4 0.65683013 <a title="106-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-03-Microsoft_Research%2C_New_York_City.html">464 hunch net-2012-05-03-Microsoft Research, New York City</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people. Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs,
this is serious forYahoo! Research.We had advanced warning
fromPrabhakarthrough thesimple act of leaving. Yahoo! Research was a world
class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is
deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave. My first
thought when I saw the news was "Uhoh,Robsaid that he knew it was serious when
the head of ATnT Research left." In this case it was even more significant,
because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in
how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high
engagement with the company. Prabhakar's departure is a clear end to that
experiment.The result is ambiguous from a business perspective. Y!R clearly
was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses. I'm not privy to the
internal accounting of impact and this is the kind of subject where there can
easily be great disagreemen</p><p>5 0.65253925 <a title="106-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-28-Somebody%26%238217%3Bs_Eating_Your_Lunch.html">445 hunch net-2011-09-28-Somebody&#8217;s Eating Your Lunch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since we last discussedthe other online learning,Stanfordhas very visibly
started pushing mass teaching inAI,Machine Learning, andDatabases. In
retrospect, it's not too surprising that the next step up in serious online
teaching experiments are occurring at the computer science department of a
university embedded in the land of startups. Numbers on the order of100000are
quite significant--similar in scale to the number ofcomputer science
undergraduate students/yearin the US. Although these populations surely
differ, the fact that theycouldoverlap is worth considering for the
future.It's too soon to say how successful these classes will be and there are
many easy criticisms to make:Registration != Learning… but if only 1/10th
complete these classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of any
traditional process.1st year excitement != nth year routine… but if only
1/10th take future classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of
any traditional process.Hello, che</p><p>6 0.64603984 <a title="106-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-16-The_Everything_Ensemble_Edge.html">131 hunch net-2005-11-16-The Everything Ensemble Edge</a></p>

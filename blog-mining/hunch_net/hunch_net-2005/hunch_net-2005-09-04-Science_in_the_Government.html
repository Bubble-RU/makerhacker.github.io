<p>Introduction: This is about the hard choices that graduate students must make.
 
The cultural definition of success in academic research is to:
  
 Produce good research which many other people appreciate. 
 Produce many students who go on to do the same. 
  
There are fundamental reasons why this is success in the local culture.   Good research appreciated by others means access to jobs.  Many students succesful in the same way implies that there are a number of people who think in a similar way and appreciate your work.
 
In order to graduate, a phd student must live in an academic culture for a period of several years. It is common to adopt the culture’s definition of success during this time.  It’s also common for many phd students discover they are not suited to an academic research lifestyle.  This collision of values and abilities naturally results in depression.
 
The most fundamental advice when this happens is: change something.  Pick a new advisor.  Pick a new research topic.  Or leave th</p><p>5 0.1070298 <a title="106-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-01-The_Webscience_Future.html">134 hunch net-2005-12-01-The Webscience Future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The internet has significantly effected the way we do research but it’s capabilities have not yet been fully realized.
 
First, let’s acknowledge some known effects.
  
  Self-publishing  By default, all researchers in machine learning (and more generally computer science and physics) place their papers online for anyone to download.  The exact mechanism differs—physicists tend to use a central repository ( Arxiv ) while computer scientists tend to place the papers on their webpage.  Arxiv has been slowly growing in subject breadth so it now sometimes used by computer scientists. 
  Collaboration  Email has enabled working remotely with coauthors.  This has allowed collaborationis which would not otherwise have been possible and generally speeds research. 
  
Now, let’s look at attempts to go further.
  
  Blogs  (like this one) allow public discussion about topics which are not easily categorized as “a new idea in machine learning” (like this topic).

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and then trying to figure out how to get there.  
 
A big part of science fiction is imagining how things could be different, and then working through the implications.  
 
Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research.  (And, hey, it’s fun.)  Here’s some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning systems:
  
 Vernor Vinge, “True Names”, “A Fire Upon the Deep” 
 Marc Stiegler, “David’s Sling”, “Earthweb” 
 Charles Stross, “Singularity Sky” 
 Greg Egan, “Diaspora” 
 Joe Haldeman, “Forever Peace” 
  
(There are surely many others.)  
 
Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.  Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series).  That didn’t really happen in the last 50 years.

<p>Introduction: Virtually every discipline of significant human endeavor has a way explaining itself as fundamental and important.  In all the cases I know of, they are both right (they are vital) and wrong (they are not solely vital).
  
 Politics.  This is the one that everyone is familiar with at the moment.  “What could be more important than the process of making decisions?” 
 Science and Technology.  This is the one that we-the-academics are familiar with.  “The loss of modern science and technology would be catastrophic.” 
 Military.  “Without the military, a nation will be invaded and destroyed.” 
 (insert your favorite here) 
  
Within science and technology, the same thing happens again.
  
 Mathematics. “What could be more important than a precise language for establishing truths?” 
 Physics.  “Nothing is more fundamental than the laws which govern the universe.  Understanding them is the key to understanding everything else.” 
 Biology.  “Without life, we wouldn’t be here, so clearly the s</p><p>5 0.66228086 <a title="106-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-09-The_Stock_Prediction_Machine_Learning_Problem.html">193 hunch net-2006-07-09-The Stock Prediction Machine Learning Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I found the article on “ Political Science ” at the  New York Times  interesting.  Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been systematically distorting scientific views.   With a  petition  by some  7000+ scientists  alleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.
 
One thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the world.  In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued.  This value is achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms.  One example of a formal mechanism is peer review.
 
In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value is agreement.  It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be passed or other actions can be taken.  Since Science (with a capitol ‘S’) has accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.  This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mec</p><p>2 0.83965158 <a title="106-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-28-Machined_Learnings.html">412 hunch net-2010-09-28-Machined Learnings</a></p>

<p>Introduction: (update:  cross-posted  on  CACM )
 
For the first time in several years,  ICML 2010  did not have  videolectures  attending.  Luckily, the  tutorial on exploration and learning  which  Alina  and I put together can  be viewed , since we also presented at  KDD 2010 , which included videolecture support. 
 
ICML didn’t cover the cost of a videolecture, because  PASCAL  didn’t provide a grant for it this year.  On the other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs.  The cost of videolectures isn’t cheap.  For  a workshop  the baseline quote we have is 270 euro per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman’s travel and accomodation.  This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a quoted 216 euro per hour.
 
 Youtube  is the most predominant free video site with a cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.   15 minute upload limits  do not match typical talk lengths.</p><p>4 0.70392621 <a title="106-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-07-The_Call_of_the_Deep.html">201 hunch net-2006-08-07-The Call of the Deep</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple.  Viewed representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural networks or kernelized SVMs).  Should we go beyond this, and start using “deep” representations?
 
 What is deep learning?  
Intuitively, deep learning is about learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the input (observed) features.
 
Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be rather difficult.  Consider the following cases:
  
 SVM with Gaussian Kernel.  This is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can’t succinctly represent certain decision surfaces.  One of  Yann LeCun ‘s examples is recognizing objects based on pixel values.  An SVM will need a new support vector for each significantly different background.  Since the number</p><p>5 0.61261696 <a title="106-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML.  I did manage to catch one interesting paper:
 
 Richard Socher ,  Cliff Lin ,  Andrew Y. Ng , and  Christopher D. Manning   Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks .
 
I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so hopefully we’ll hear from him soon.  In the meantime,  Paul  and  Hal  have posted some lists.
 
 the future 
 
 Joelle  and I are program chairs for ICML 2012 in  Edinburgh , which I previously enjoyed visiting in  2005 .  This is a huge responsibility, that we hope to accomplish well.  A part of this (perhaps the most fun part), is imagining how we can make ICML better.  A key and critical constraint is choosing things that can be accomplished.  So far we have:
  
  Colocation . The first thing we looked into was potential colocations.  We quickly discovered that many other conferences precomitted their location.

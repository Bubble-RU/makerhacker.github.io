<p>Introduction: "Science" has many meanings, but one common meaning is "thescientific method"
which is a principled method for investigating the world using the following
steps:Form a hypothesis about the world.Use the hypothesis to make
predictions.Run experiments to confirm or disprove the predictions.The
ordering of these steps is very important to the scientific method. In
particular, predictionsmustbe made before experiments are run.Given that we

about the effects of their drugs and then conduct blind clinical studies to

<p>Introduction: Learning reductionstransform a solver of one type of learning problem into a
solver of another type of learning problem. When we analyze these for
robustness we can make statement of the form "ReductionRhas the property that
regretr(or loss) on subproblems of typeAimplies regret at mostf ( r )on the
original problem of typeB".A lower bound for a learning reduction would have
the form "for all reductionsR, there exists a learning problem of typeBand
learning algorithm for problems of typeAwhere regretron induced problems
impliesat leastregretf ( r )forB".The pursuit of lower bounds is often
questionable because, unlike upper bounds, they do not yield practical
algorithms. Nevertheless, they may be helpful as a tool for thinking about
what is learnable and how learnable it is. This has already come
uphereandhere.At the moment, there is no coherent theory of lower bounds for
learning reductions, and we have little understanding of how feasible they are
or which techniques may be useful in</p><p>5 0.20172273 <a title="41-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-06-Bounds_greater_than_1.html">170 hunch net-2006-04-06-Bounds greater than 1</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sham Kakadepoints out that we are missing a bound.Suppose we
havemsamplesxdrawn IID from some distributionD. Through the magic of
exponential moment method we know that:If the range ofxis bounded by an
interval of sizeI, aChernoff/Hoeffding style boundgives us a bound on the
deviations likeO(I/m0.5)(at least in crude form). A proof is on page 9here.If
the range ofxis bounded, and the variance (or a bound on the variance) is
known, thenBennett's boundcan give tighter results (*). This can be a huge
improvment when the true variance small.What's missing here is a bound that
depends on the observed variance rather than a bound on the variance. This
means that many people attempt to use Bennett's bound (incorrectly) by
plugging the observed variance in as the true variance, invalidating the bound
application. Most of the time, they get away with it, but this is a dangerous
move when doing machine learning. In machine learning, we are typically trying

<p>Introduction: What?Bounds are mathematical formulas relating observations to future error
rates assuming that data is drawn independently. In classical statistics, they
are calld confidence intervals.Why?Good Judgement. In many applications of
learning, it is desirable to know how well the learned predictor works in the
future. This helps you decide if the problem is solved or not.Learning
Essence. The form of some of these bounds helps you understand what the
essence of learning is.Algorithm Design. Some of these bounds suggest,
motivate, or even directly imply learning algorithms.What We Know NowThere are
several families of bounds, based on how information is used.Testing Bounds.
These are methods which use labeled data not used in training to estimate the
future error rate. Examples include thetest set bound,progressive
validationalsohereandhere,train and test bounds, and cross-validation (but see
thebig open problem). These techniques are the best available for goal (1)

<p>Introduction: I'm not as naturally exuberant asMuthu2orDavidaboutCS/Econday, but I believe
it andML daywere certainly successful.At the CS/Econ day, I particularly
enjoyedToumas Sandholm'stalk which showed a commanding depth of understanding
and application in automated auctions.For the machine learning day, I enjoyed
several talks and posters (I better, I helped pick them.). What stood out to
me was number of people attending: 158 registered, a level qualifying as
"scramble to find seats". My rule of thumb for workshops/conferences is that
the number of attendees is often something like the number of submissions.
That isn't the case here, where there were just 4 invited speakers and 30-or-
so posters. Presumably, the difference is due to a critical mass of Machine
Learning interested people in the area and the ease of their attendance.Are
there other areas where a local Machine Learning day would fly? It's easy to
imagine something working out in the San Francisco bay area and possibly
Germany or E</p><p>3 0.95288122 <a title="41-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-16-MLSS_2008.html">273 hunch net-2007-11-16-MLSS 2008</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TheHeritage Health Prizeis potentially the largest prediction prize yet at
$3M, which is sure to get many people interested. Several elements of the
competition may be worth discussing.The most straightforward way for HPN to
deploy this predictor is in determining who to cover with insurance. This
might easily cover the costs of running the contest itself, but the value to
the health system of a whole is minimal, as people not covered still exist.
While HPN itself is a provider network, they have active relationships with a
number of insurance companies, and the right to resell any entrant. It's worth
keeping in mind that the research and development may nevertheless end up
being useful in the longer term, especially as entrants also keep the right to
their code.Thejudging metricis something I haven't seen previously. If a
patient has probability 0.5 of being in the hospital 0 days and probability
0.5 of being in the hospital ~53.6 days, the optimal prediction in expectation
is ~6.4 da</p><p>5 0.94175863 <a title="41-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-10-The_Large_Scale_Learning_class_notes.html">483 hunch net-2013-06-10-The Large Scale Learning class notes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thelarge scale machine learning classI taught withYann LeCunhas finished. As I
expected, it took quite a bit of time. We had about 25 people attending in
person on average and 400 regularly watching therecorded lectureswhich is
substantially more sustained interest than I expected for an advanced ML
class. We also had some fun with class projects--I'm hopeful that several will
eventually turn into papers.I expect there are a number of professors
interested in lecturing on this and related topics. Everyone will have their
personal taste in subjects of course, but hopefully there will be some
convergence to common course materials as well. To help with this, I am making
thesources to my presentations available. Feel free to

<p>Introduction: If we accept that bad reviewing often occurs and want to fix it, the question is “how”?
 
Reviewing is done by paper writers just like yourself, so a good proxy for this question is asking “How can I be a better reviewer?”  Here are a few things I’ve learned by trial (and error), as a paper writer, and as a reviewer.
  
 The secret ingredient is careful thought.  There is no good substitution for a deep and careful understanding. 
 Avoid reviewing papers that you feel competitive about.  You almost certainly will be asked to review papers that feel competitive if you work on subjects of common interest.  But, the feeling of competition can easily lead to bad judgement. 
 If you feel biased for some other reason, then you should avoid reviewing.  For example… 
 Feeling angry or threatened by a paper is a form of bias.  See above. 
 Double blind yourself (avoid looking at the name even in a single-blind situation).  The significant effect of a name you recognize is making you pay close a</p><p>3 0.33740813 <a title="65-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-26-Compassionate_Reviewing.html">395 hunch net-2010-04-26-Compassionate Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Most long conversations between academics seem to converge on the topic of reviewing where almost no one is happy.  A basic question is: Should most people be happy?
 
The case against is straightforward.  Anyone who watches the flow of papers realizes that most papers amount to little in the longer term.  By it’s nature research is brutal, where the second-best method is worthless, and the second person to discover things typically gets no credit.  If you think about this for a moment, it’s very different from most other human endeavors.  The second best migrant laborer, construction worker, manager, conductor, quarterback, etc… all can manage quite well. If a reviewer has even a vaguely predictive sense of what’s important in the longer term, then most people submitting papers will be unhappy.
 
But this argument unravels, in my experience.  Perhaps half of reviews are thoughtless or simply wrong with a small part being simply malicious.  And yet, I’m sure that most reviewers genuine</p><p>4 0.30060193 <a title="65-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research.  They provide many roles including “announcing research”, “meeting people”, and  “point of reference”.  Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: “to what extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?”  This question is very difficult to answer in any satisfying way.  What we can do is compare details of the process across multiple conferences.
  
  Comments   The average quality of comments across conferences can vary dramatically.  At one extreme, the tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback.  At the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing detailed constructive feedback.  Detailed feedback can give authors significant guidance about how to improve research.  This is the most subjective entry.

<p>Introduction: The many reviews following the many paper deadlines are just about over.  AAAI and ICML in particular were experimenting with several reviewing techniques.  
  
 Double Blind: AAAI and ICML were both double blind this year.  It seemed (overall) beneficial, but two problems arose.
 
 For theoretical papers, with a lot to say, authors often leave out the proofs.  This is very hard to cope with under a double blind review because (1) you can not trust the authors got the proof right but (2) a blanket “reject” hits many probably-good papers.  Perhaps authors should more strongly favor proof-complete papers sent to double blind conferences. 
 On the author side, double blind reviewing is actually somewhat disruptive to research.  In particular, it discourages the author from talking about the subject, which is one of the mechanisms of research.  This is not a great drawback, but it is one not previously appreciated.

<p>Introduction: Perhaps the biggest CS prize for research is the  Turing Award , which has a $0.25M cash prize associated with it.  It appears none of the prizes so far have been for anything like machine learning (the closest are perhaps database awards).
 
In CS theory, there is the  GÃƒÂ¶del Prize  which is smaller and newer, offering a $5K prize along and perhaps (more importantly) recognition.  One such award has been given for Machine Learning, to  Robert Schapire  and  Yoav Freund  for Adaboost.
 
In Machine Learning, there seems to be no equivalent of these sorts of prizes.  There are several plausible reasons for this:
  
 
 There is no coherent community. 
  People drift in and out of the central conferences all the time.  Most of the author names from 10 years ago do not occur in the conferences of today.  In addition, the entire subject area is fairly new. 
 There are at least a core group of people who have stayed around.

<p>Introduction: Most long conversations between academics seem to converge on the topic of reviewing where almost no one is happy.  A basic question is: Should most people be happy?
 
The case against is straightforward.  Anyone who watches the flow of papers realizes that most papers amount to little in the longer term.  By it’s nature research is brutal, where the second-best method is worthless, and the second person to discover things typically gets no credit.  If you think about this for a moment, it’s very different from most other human endeavors.  The second best migrant laborer, construction worker, manager, conductor, quarterback, etc… all can manage quite well. If a reviewer has even a vaguely predictive sense of what’s important in the longer term, then most people submitting papers will be unhappy.
 
But this argument unravels, in my experience.  Perhaps half of reviews are thoughtless or simply wrong with a small part being simply malicious.  And yet, I’m sure that most reviewers genuine</p><p>4 0.84576261 <a title="65-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-07-The_Limits_of_Learning_Theory.html">90 hunch net-2005-07-07-The Limits of Learning Theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Suppose we had an infinitely powerful mathematician sitting in a room and proving theorems about learning.  Could he solve machine learning?
 
The answer is “no”.   This answer is both obvious and sometimes underappreciated.   
 
There are several ways to conclude that some  bias  is necessary in order to succesfully learn.  For example, suppose we are trying to solve classification.  At prediction time, we observe some features  X  and want to make a prediction of either  0  or  1 .   Bias is what makes us prefer one answer over the other based on past experience.  In order to learn we must:
  
 Have a bias.  Always predicting  0  is as likely as  1  is useless. 
 Have the “right” bias.  Predicting  1  when the answer is  0  is also not helpful. 
  
The implication of “have a bias” is that we can not design effective learning algorithms with “a uniform prior over all possibilities”.  The implication of “have the ‘right’ bias” is that our mathematician fails since “right” is defined wi</p><p>5 0.84031445 <a title="65-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-28-Why_COLT%3F.html">453 hunch net-2012-01-28-Why COLT?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: By  Shie  and  Nati 
 
Following John’s advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is often the best place for theory papers.  We would like to emphasize that we both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs, and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers.  For many papers, ICML is the best venue.  But for many theory papers, COLT is a better and more appropriate place.
 
Why should you submit to COLT?
 
By-and-large, theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT is more focused then ICML with a single track session.  Unlike ICML, the norm in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks presented.  There is also often a lively discussion followi</p><p>6 0.83730304 <a title="65-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-24-2011_ML_symposium_and_the_bears.html">448 hunch net-2011-10-24-2011 ML symposium and the bears</a></p>

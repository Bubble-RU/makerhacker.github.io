<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.
This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.
Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance
can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention. Roughly
speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your
interest. The main conference program consists of elements related to
someone's interest (which is rarely your own). Workshops are more about doing
research while conferences are more about presenting research.Several
conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due
shortly.ICML workshopsDue April 1IJCAI workshopsDeadlines VaryKDD workshopsNot
yet finalizedAnyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops
and see if any are of interest. (If none are, then maybe you should organize
one next year.)</p><p>3 0.10656172 <a title="114-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-22-Create_Your_Own_ICML_Workshop.html">234 hunch net-2007-02-22-Create Your Own ICML Workshop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As usualICML 2007will be hosting aworkshop programto be held this year on June
24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you
propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I'd like
to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal
deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for
details.Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group
of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your
choosing. I've always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so
large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a
workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to
potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-
conference on a particular ML sub-area. Hope to see some interesting proposals
rolling in.</p><p>4 0.10409235 <a title="114-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-12-Workshop_Summary%26%238212%3BPrinciples_of_Learning_Problem_Design.html">277 hunch net-2007-12-12-Workshop Summary&#8212;Principles of Learning Problem Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a summary of theworkshop on Learning Problem DesignwhichAlinaand I ran
atNIPSthis year.The first question many people have is "What is learning
problem design?" This workshop is about admitting that solving learning
problems does not start with labeled data, but rather somewhere before. When
humans are hired to produce labels, this is usually not a serious problem
because you can tell them precisely what semantics you want the labels to
have, and we can fix some set of features in advance. However, when other
methods are used this becomes more problematic. This focus is important for
Machine Learning because there are very large quantities of data which are not
labeled by a hired human.The title of the workshop was a bit ambitious,
because a workshop is not long enough to synthesize a diversity of approaches
into a coherent set of principles. For me, the posters at the end of the
workshop were quite helpful in getting approaches to gel.Here are some answers
to "where do the lab</p><p>5 0.08985997 <a title="114-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-07-A_NIPS_paper.html">330 hunch net-2008-12-07-A NIPS paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm skipping NIPS this year in favor ofAda, but I wanted to point outthis
paperbyAndriy MnihandGeoff Hinton. The basic claim of the paper is that by
carefully but automatically constructing a binary tree over words, it's
possible to predict words well with huge computational resource savings over
unstructured approaches.I'm interested in this beyond the application to word
prediction because it is relevant to the general normalization problem: If you
want to predict the probability of one of a large number of events, often you
must compute a predicted score for all the events and then normalize, a
computationally inefficient operation. The problem comes up in many places
using probabilistic models, but I've run into it with high-dimensional
regression.There are a couple workarounds for this computational
bug:Approximate. There are many ways. Often the approximations are
uncontrolled (i.e. can be arbitrarily bad), and hence finicky in
application.Avoid. You don't really want a probabili</p><p>6 0.079434939 <a title="114-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-24-NLPers.html">166 hunch net-2006-03-24-NLPers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We'd like to invite hunch.net readers to participate in the NIPS 2008 workshop
on kernel learning. While the main focus is on automatically learning kernels
from data, we are also also looking at the broader questions of feature
selection, multi-task learning and multi-view learning. There are no
restrictions on the learning problem being addressed (regression,
classification, etc), and both theoretical and applied work will be
considered. The deadline for submissions isOctober 24.More detail can be
foundhere.Corinna Cortes, Arthur Gretton, Gert Lanckriet, Mehryar Mohri,

<p>Introduction: This is a proposal for a workshop. It may or may not happen depending on the
level of interest. If you are interested, feel free to indicate so (by email
or comments).Description:Assume(*) that any system for solving large difficult
learning problems must decompose into repeated use of basic elements (i.e.
atoms). There are many basic questions which remain:What are the viable basic
elements?What makes a basic element viable?What are the viable principles for
the composition of these basic elements?What are the viable principles for
learning in such systems?What problems can this approach handle?Hal Daume
adds:Can composition of atoms be (semi-) automatically constructed[?]When
atoms are constructed through reductions, is there some notion of the
"naturalness" of the created leaning problems?Other than Markov
fields/graphical models/Bayes nets, is there a good language for representing
atoms and their compositions?The answer to these and related questions remain
unclear to me. A worksh</p><p>2 0.8868112 <a title="114-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-14-BellKor_wins_Netflix.html">272 hunch net-2007-11-14-BellKor wins Netflix</a></p>
<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś but only the little prize. TheBellKor teamfocused on integrating predictions
from many different methods. The base methods consist of:Nearest Neighbor
MethodsMatrix Factorization Methods (asymmetric and symmetric)Linear
Regression on various feature spacesRestricted Boltzman MachinesThe final
predictor was an ensemble (as was reasonable to expect), although it's a
little bit more complicated than just a weighted average--it's essentially a
customized learning algorithm. Base approaches (1)-(3) seem like relatively
well-known approaches (although I haven't seen the asymmetric factorization
variant before). RBMs are the new approach.Thewriteupis pretty clear for more
details.The contestants are close to reaching the big prize, but the last 1.5%
is probably at least as hard as what's been done. A few new structurally
different methods for making predictions may need to be discovered and added
into the mixture. In other words, research may be required.</p><p>3 0.84972984 <a title="114-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-30-NIPS_workshops_are_out..html">264 hunch net-2007-09-30-NIPS workshops are out.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here. I'm particularly interested in theWeb Search,Efficient ML, and (of
course)Learning Problem Designworkshops but there are many others to check out
as well. Workshops are a great chance to make progress on or learn about a
topic. Relevance and interaction amongst diverse people can sometimes be
magical.</p><p>4 0.83870775 <a title="114-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-07-Prediction_Competitions.html">129 hunch net-2005-11-07-Prediction Competitions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are two prediction competitions currently in the air.ThePerformance
Prediction ChallengebyIsabelle Guyon. Good entries minimize a weighted 0/1
loss + the difference between a prediction of this loss and the observed truth
on 5 datasets. Isabelle tells me all of the problems are "real world" and the
test datasets are large enough (17K minimum) that the winner should be well
determined by ability rather than luck. This is due March 1.ThePredictive
Uncertainty ChallengebyGavin Cawley. Good entries minimize log loss on real
valued output variables for one synthetic and 3 "real" datasets related to
atmospheric prediction. The use of log loss (which can be infinite and hence
is never convergent) and smaller test sets of size 1K to 7K examples makes the
winner of this contest more luck dependent. Nevertheless, the contest may be
of some interest particularly to the branch of learning (typically Bayes
learning) which prefers to optimize log loss.May the best predictor win.</p><p>5 0.74942064 <a title="114-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-12-Summer_Conferences.html">331 hunch net-2008-12-12-Summer Conferences</a></p>

poor decisions happen because the papers go to reviewers who are unqualified,
and the hope is that allowing authors to point out who is qualified results in
better decisions. In my experience, this is a reasonable idea to test.Both UAI
and COLT are experimenting this year as well with double blind and author
feedback, respectively. Of the two, I believe author feedback is more
important, as I've seen it make a difference. However, I still consider double
blind reviewing a net win, as it's a substantial public commitment to
fairness.</p><p>6 0.69279462 <a title="114-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-18-What_it_means_to_do_research..html">22 hunch net-2005-02-18-What it means to do research.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Nic Schaudolphhas been developing a fast gradient descent algorithm
calledStochastic Meta-Descent(SMD).Gradient descent is currently untrendy in
the machine learning community, but there remains a large number of people
using gradient descent on neural networks or other architectures from when it
was trendy in the early 1990s. There are three problems with gradient
descent.Gradient descent does not necessarily produce easily reproduced
results. Typical algorithms start with "set the initial parameters to small
random values".The design of the representation that gradient descent is
applied to is often nontrivial. In particular, knowing exactly how to build a
large neural network so that it will perform well requires knowledge which has
not been made easily applicable.Gradient descent can be slow. Obviously,
taking infinitesimal steps in the direction of the gradient would take
forever, so some finite step size must be used. What exactly this step size
should be is unclear. Many people</p><p>3 0.1618441 <a title="23-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-04-Optimal_Proxy_Loss_for_Classification.html">341 hunch net-2009-02-04-Optimal Proxy Loss for Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in machine learning take advantage of the notion of a proxy loss:
A loss function which is much easier to optimize computationally than the loss
function imposed by the world. A canonical example is when we want to learn a
weight vectorwand predict according to a dot productfw(x)= sumiwixiwhere
optimizing squared loss(y-fw(x))2over many samples is much more tractable than
optimizing 0-1 lossI(y = Threshold(fw(x) - 0.5)).While the computational
advantages of optimizing a proxy loss are substantial, we are curious: which
proxy loss is best? The answer of course depends on what the real loss imposed
by the world is. For 0-1 loss classification, there are adherents to many
choices:Log loss. If we confine the prediction to[0,1], we can treat it as a
predicted probability that the label is1, and measure loss according tolog
1/p'(y|x)wherep'(y|x)is the predicted probability of the observed label. A
standard method for confining the prediction to[0,1]islogistic regressionwhich

<p>Introduction: Some loss functions have a meaning, which can be understood in a manner
independent of the loss function itself.Optimizing squared
losslsq(y,y')=(y-y')2means predicting the (conditional) mean ofy.Optimizing
absolute value losslav(y,y')=|y-y'|means predicting the (conditional) median
ofy. Variants canhandle other quantiles. 0/1 loss for classification is a
special case.Optimizing log lossllog(y,y')=log (1/Prz~y'(z=y))means minimizing
the description length ofy.The semantics (= meaning) of the loss are made
explicit by a theorem in each case. For squared loss, we can prove a theorem
of the form:For all distributionsDoverY, ify' = arg miny'Ey ~ Dlsq(y,y')theny'
= Ey~DySimilar theorems hold for the other examples above, and they can all be
extended to predictors ofy'for distributionsDover a contextXand a valueY.There
are 3 points to this post.Everyone doing general machine learning should be
aware of the laundry list above. They form a handy toolkit which can match

<p>Introduction: A loss function is some function which, for any example, takes a prediction
and the correct prediction, and determines how much loss is incurred. (People
sometimes attempt to optimize functions of more than one example such as "area
under the ROC curve" or "harmonic mean of precision and recall".) Typically we
try to find predictors that minimize loss.There seems to be a strong dichotomy
between two views of what "loss" means in learning.Loss is determined by the
problem.Loss is a part of the specification of the learning problem. Examples
of problems specified by the loss function include "binary classification",
"multiclass classification", "importance weighted classification",
"l2regression", etcâ&euro;Ś This is the decision theory view of what loss means, and
the view that I prefer.Loss is determined by the solution.To solve a problem,
you optimize some particular loss functionnotgiven by the problem. Examples of
these loss functions are "hinge loss" (for SVMs), "log loss" (common in

<p>Introduction: Arecent discussionindicated that one goal of this blog might be to allow
people to post comments about recent papers that they liked. I think this
could potentially be very useful, especially for those with diverse interests
but only finite time to read through conference proceedings.ACL 2005recently
completed, and here are four papers from that conference that I thought were
either good or perhaps of interest to a machine learning audience.David
Chiang,A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation.
(Best paper award.) This paper takes the standard phrase-based MT model that
is popular in our field (basically, translate a sentence by individually
translating phrases and reordering them according to a complicated statistical
model) and extends it to take into account hierarchy in phrases, so that you
can learn things like "X 's Y" -> "Y de X" in chinese, where X and Y are
arbitrary phrases. This takes a step toward linguistic syntax for MT, which

<p>Introduction: I had a chance to attendUAIthis year, where several papers interested me,
including:Hoifung PoonandPedro DomingosSum-Product Networks: A New Deep
Architecture. We'vealready discussed this one, but in a nutshell, they
identify a large class of efficiently normalizable distributions and do
learning with it.Yao-Liang YuandDale Schuurmans,Rank/norm regularization with
closed-form solutions: Application to subspace clustering. This paper is about
matrices, and in particular they prove that certain matrices are the solution
of matrix optimizations. I'm not matrix inclined enough to fully appreciate
this one, but I believe many others may be, and anytime closed form solutions
come into play, you get 2 order of magnitude speedups, as they show
experimentally.Laurent Charlin,Richard ZemelandCraig Boutilier,A Framework for
Optimizing Paper Matching. This is about what works in matching papers to
reviewers, as has been tested at several previous NIPS. We are looking into

<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.Topic Models:Dynamic Topic
ModelsDavid Blei, John LaffertyA nice model for how topics in LDA type models
can evolve over time,using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters
and a veryclever structured variational approximation (in which the mean
fieldparameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all
Bleipapers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive.Pachinko

challenging) model which inducescorrelation amongst topics using a multi-level

<p>Introduction: TheExponentiated Gradientalgorithm byManfred WarmuthandJyrki Kivinencame out
just as I was starting graduate school, so I missed it both at a conference
and in class. It's a fine algorithm which has a remarkable theoretical
statement accompanying it.The essential statement holds in the "online
learning with an adversary" setting. Initially, there are of set ofnweights,
which might have values(1/n,â&euro;Ś,1/n), (or any other values from a probability
distribution). Everything happens in a round-by-round fashion. On each round,
the following happens:The world reveals a set of featuresx in {0,1}n. In the
online learning with an adversary literature, the features are called
"experts" and thought of as subpredictors, but this interpretation isn't
necessary--you can just use feature values as experts (or maybe the feature
value and the negation of the feature value as two experts).EG makes a
prediction according toy' = w . x(dot product).The world reveals the truthy in
[0,1].EG updates the weights</p><p>6 0.53500652 <a title="23-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-05-23-Three_levels_of_addressing_the_Netflix_Prize.html">301 hunch net-2008-05-23-Three levels of addressing the Netflix Prize</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Probability is one of the most confusingly used words in machine learning.
There are at least 3 distinct ways the word is used.BayesianThe Bayesian
notion of probability is a 'degree of belief'. The degree of belief that some
event (i.e. "stock goes up" or "stock goes down") occurs can be measured by
asking a sequence of questions of the form "Would you bet the stock goes up or
down atYto 1 odds?" A consistent better will switch from 'for' to 'against' at
some single value ofY. The probability is thenY/(Y+1). Bayesian probabilities
express lack of knowledge rather than randomization. They are useful in
learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly
makes the learning algorithms work better. Bayesian Learning uses
'probability' in this way exclusively.FrequentistThe Frequentist notion of
probability is a rate of occurence. A rate of occurrence can be measured by
doing an experiment many times. If an event occursktimes innexperiments then
it has probability ab</p><p>same-blog 2 0.90225148 <a title="23-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-19-Loss_Functions_for_Discriminative_Training_of_Energy-Based_Models.html">23 hunch net-2005-02-19-Loss Functions for Discriminative Training of Energy-Based Models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is apaperby Yann LeCun and Fu Jie Huang published atAISTAT 2005. I found
this paper very difficult to read, but it does have some point about a
computational shortcut.This paper takes for granted that the method of solving
a problem is gradient descent on parameters. Given this assumption, the
question arises: Do you want to do gradient descent on a probabilistic model
or something else?All (conditional) probabilistic models have the formp(y|x) =
f(x,y)/Z(x)whereZ(x) = sumyf(x,y)(the paper calls- log f(x,y)an "energy").
Iffis parameterized by somew, the gradient has a term forZ(x), and hence for
every value ofy. The paper claims, that such models can be optimized for
classification purposes using only the correctyand the othery' not ywhich
maximizesf(x,y). This can even be done on unnormalizable models. The paper
further claims that this can be done with an approximate maximum. These claims
are plausible based on experimental results and intuition.It wouldn't surprise
me to learn</p><p>3 0.87057579 <a title="23-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-04-JMLG.html">13 hunch net-2005-02-04-JMLG</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people. Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs,
this is serious forYahoo! Research.We had advanced warning
fromPrabhakarthrough thesimple act of leaving. Yahoo! Research was a world
class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is
deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave. My first
thought when I saw the news was "Uhoh,Robsaid that he knew it was serious when
the head of ATnT Research left." In this case it was even more significant,
because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in
how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high
engagement with the company. Prabhakar's departure is a clear end to that
experiment.The result is ambiguous from a business perspective. Y!R clearly
was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses. I'm not privy to the
internal accounting of impact and this is the kind of subject where there can
easily be great disagreemen</p><p>5 0.78533161 <a title="23-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-15-The_Machine_Learning_Department.html">228 hunch net-2007-01-15-The Machine Learning Department</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Carnegie MellonSchool of Computer Sciencehas the first academicMachine
Learning department. This department already existed as theCenter for
Automated Learning and Discovery, but recently changed it's name.The reason
for changing the name is obvious: very few people think of themselves as
"Automated Learner and Discoverers", but there are number of people who think
of themselves as "Machine Learners". Machine learning is both more succinct
and recognizable--good properties for a name.A more interesting question is
"Should there be a Machine Learning Department?".Tom Mitchellhas a
relevantwhitepaperclaiming that machine learning is answering a different
question than other fields or departments. The fundamental debate here is "Is
machine learning different from statistics?"At a cultural level, there is no
real debate: they are different. Machine learning is characterized by several
very active large peer reviewed conferences, operating in a computer science
mode. Statistics tends to fun</p><p>6 0.77963144 <a title="23-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-10-Breaking_Abstractions.html">39 hunch net-2005-03-10-Breaking Abstractions</a></p>

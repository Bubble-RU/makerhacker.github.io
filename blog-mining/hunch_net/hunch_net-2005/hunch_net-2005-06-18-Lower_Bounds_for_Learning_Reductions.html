<p>Introduction: A type of prediction problem is specified by the type of samples produced by a data source (Example:  X x {0,1} ,  X x [0,1] ,  X x {1,2,3,4,5} , etc…) and a loss function (0/1 loss, squared error loss, cost sensitive losses, etc…).  For simplicity, we’ll assume that all losses have a minimum of zero.
 
For this post, we can think of a learning reduction as
  
 A mapping  R  from samples of one type  T  (like multiclass classification) to another type  T’  (like binary classification). 
 A mapping  Q  from predictors for type  T’  to predictors for type  T . 
  
The simplest sort of learning reduction is a “loss reduction”.  The idea in a loss reduction is to prove a statement of the form: 
 Theorem  For all base predictors  b , for all distributions  D  over examples of type  T : 
  E (x,y) ~ D  L T (y,Q(b,x)) <= f(E (x’,y’)~R(D)  L T’ (y’,b(x’)))

<p>Introduction: What?  Reductions are machines which turn solvers for one problem into solvers for another problem. 
 Why?  Reductions are useful for several reasons.
  
  Laziness .  Reducing a problem to classification make at least 10 learning algorithms available to solve a problem.  Inventing 10 learning algorithms is quite a bit of work.  Similarly, programming a reduction is often trivial, while programming a learning algorithm is a great deal of work. 
  Crystallization .  The problems we often want to solve in learning are worst-case-impossible, but average case feasible.  By reducing all problems onto one or a few primitives, we can fine tune these primitives to perform well on real-world problems with greater precision due to the greater number of problems to validate on. 
  Theoretical Organization .  By studying what reductions are easy vs. hard vs. impossible, we can learn which problems are roughly equivalent in difficulty and which are much harder. 
  
 What we know now .

<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.
 
 Background  A reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there are  k  possible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2 possible labels.   On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary classifier with some error rate  e .  After subtracting the minimum possible (Bayes) error rate  b , we get a regret  r = e – b .  The  PECOC (Probabilistic Error Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regret  r  implies multiclass regret at most  4r 0.5  .
 
 The problem  This is not the “rightest” answer.  Consider the  k=2  case, where we reduce binary to binary.  There exists a reduction (the identity) with the property that regret  r  implies regret  r .  This is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which suggests that a better reduction may exist for general  k .  For example, we can not rule out the possibility that a reduction</p><p>6 0.20255633 <a title="83-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-15-The_State_of_Tight_Bounds.html">41 hunch net-2005-03-15-The State of Tight Bounds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Several recent papers have shown that SVM-like optimizations can be used to handle several large family loss functions.
 
This is a good thing because it is implausible that the  loss  function imposed by the world can not be taken into account in the process of solving a prediction problem.  Even people used to the hard-core  Bayesian  approach to learning often note that some approximations are almost inevitable in specifying a  prior  and/or integrating to achieve a posterior.  Taking into account how the system will be evaluated can allow both computational effort and design effort to be focused so as to improve performance.

<p>Introduction: The New York Times had a  short interview  about machine learning in datamining being used pervasively by the IRS and large corporations to predict who to audit and who to target for various marketing campaigns.  This is a big application area of machine learning.  It can be harmful (learning + databases = another way to invade privacy) or beneficial (as google demonstrates, better targeting of marketing campaigns is far less annoying).  This is yet more evidence that we can not rely upon “I’m just another fish in the school” logic for our expectations about treatment by government and large corporations.</p><p>2 0.97451627 <a title="83-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-27-Key_Scientific_Challenges.html">339 hunch net-2009-01-27-Key Scientific Challenges</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo released the  Key Scientific Challenges  program.  There is a  Machine Learning  list I worked on and a  Statistics  list which  Deepak  worked on.
 
I’m hoping this is taken quite seriously by graduate students.  The primary value, is that it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research which would be valuable to make progress on.  A good strategy for a beginning graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make substantial advances for a PhD.  The directions are sufficiently general that I’m sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.
 
A secondary point, (which I’m sure is primary for many    ) is that there is money for graduate students here.  It’s unrestricted, so you can use it for any reasonable travel, supplies, etc…</p><p>3 0.96373552 <a title="83-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-23-What_is_the_best_regret_transform_reduction_from_multiclass_to_binary%3F.html">181 hunch net-2006-05-23-What is the best regret transform reduction from multiclass to binary?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.
 
 Background  A reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there are  k  possible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2 possible labels.   On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary classifier with some error rate  e .  After subtracting the minimum possible (Bayes) error rate  b , we get a regret  r = e – b .  The  PECOC (Probabilistic Error Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regret  r  implies multiclass regret at most  4r 0.5  .
 
 The problem  This is not the “rightest” answer.  Consider the  k=2  case, where we reduce binary to binary.  There exists a reduction (the identity) with the property that regret  r  implies regret  r .  This is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which suggests that a better reduction may exist for general  k .  For example, we can not rule out the possibility that a reduction</p><p>same-blog 4 0.96162915 <a title="83-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-18-Lower_Bounds_for_Learning_Reductions.html">83 hunch net-2005-06-18-Lower Bounds for Learning Reductions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Learning reductions  transform a solver of one type of learning problem into a solver of another type of learning problem.  When we analyze these for robustness we can make statement of the form “Reduction  R  has the property that regret  r  (or loss) on subproblems of type  A  implies regret at most   f ( r )  on the original problem of type  B “.
 
A lower bound for a learning reduction would have the form “for all reductions  R , there exists a learning problem of type  B  and learning algorithm for problems of type  A  where regret  r  on induced problems implies  at least  regret  f ( r )  for  B “.
 
The pursuit of lower bounds is often questionable because, unlike upper bounds, they do not yield practical algorithms.  Nevertheless, they may be helpful as a tool for thinking about what is learnable and how learnable it is.  This has already come up  here  and  here .
 
At the moment, there is no coherent theory of lower bounds for learning reductions, and we have little understa</p><p>5 0.94754273 <a title="83-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-08-31-Extreme_Classification_workshop_at_NIPS.html">488 hunch net-2013-08-31-Extreme Classification workshop at NIPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Manik  and I are organizing the  extreme classification  workshop at NIPS this year.  We have a number of good speakers lined up, but I would further encourage anyone working in the area to submit an abstract by October 9.  I believe this is an idea whose time has now come.

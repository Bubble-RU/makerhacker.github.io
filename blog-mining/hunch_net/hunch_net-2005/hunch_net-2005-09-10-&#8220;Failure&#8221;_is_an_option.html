<p>Introduction: Graduate study is a mysterious and uncertain process.  This easiest way to see this is by noting that a very old advisor/student mechanism is preferred. There is no known succesful mechanism for “mass producing” PhDs as is done (in some sense) for undergraduate and masters study.  Here are a few hints that might be useful to prospective or current students based on my own experience.
  
  Masters or PhD  (a) You want a PhD if you want to do research.  (b) You want a masters if you want to make money.  People wanting (b) will be manifestly unhappy with (a) because it typically means years of low pay.  People wanting (a) should try to avoid (b) because it prolongs an already long process.

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo released the  Key Scientific Challenges  program.  There is a  Machine Learning  list I worked on and a  Statistics  list which  Deepak  worked on.
 
I’m hoping this is taken quite seriously by graduate students.  The primary value, is that it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research which would be valuable to make progress on.  A good strategy for a beginning graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make substantial advances for a PhD.  The directions are sufficiently general that I’m sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.
 
A secondary point, (which I’m sure is primary for many    ) is that there is money for graduate students here.

<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of “mechanism design”: setting up the structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane things (rather than obviously counterproductive things).  Application of this principle to academic research may be fruitful.
 
What is misdesigned about academic research?
  
 The  JMLG  guides give many hints. 
 The common nature of  bad reviewing  also suggests the system isn’t working optimally. 
 There are many ways to experimentally  “cheat” in machine learning . 
  Funding Prisoner’s Delimma.  Good researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing research.  Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written.  This is essentially a “prisoner’s delimma”: anyone not writing grant proposals loses, but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction.  If everyone wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution</p><p>6 0.11697985 <a title="110-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-18-What_it_means_to_do_research..html">22 hunch net-2005-02-18-What it means to do research.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.
 
As a researcher, I am most thankful for my education, without which I could not function.  I want to share this, because it provides some sense of how a researcher starts.
  
 My long term memory seems to function particularly well, which makes any education I get is particularly useful. 
 I am naturally obsessive, which makes me chase down details until I fully understand things.  Natural obsessiveness can go wrong, of course, but it’s a great ally when you absolutely must get things right. 
 My childhood was all in one hometown, which was a conscious sacrifice on the part of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated.  I’m not sure how important this was since travel has it’s own benefits, but it bears thought. 
 I had several great teachers in grade school, and naturally gravitated towards teachers over classmates, as they seemed</p><p>5 0.71176463 <a title="110-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of “mechanism design”: setting up the structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane things (rather than obviously counterproductive things).  Application of this principle to academic research may be fruitful.
 
What is misdesigned about academic research?
  
 The  JMLG  guides give many hints. 
 The common nature of  bad reviewing  also suggests the system isn’t working optimally. 
 There are many ways to experimentally  “cheat” in machine learning . 
  Funding Prisoner’s Delimma.  Good researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing research.  Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written.  This is essentially a “prisoner’s delimma”: anyone not writing grant proposals loses, but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction.  If everyone wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88917977 <a title="110-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-10-%26%238220%3BFailure%26%238221%3B_is_an_option.html">110 hunch net-2005-09-10-&#8220;Failure&#8221; is an option</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about the hard choices that graduate students must make.
 
The cultural definition of success in academic research is to:
  
 Produce good research which many other people appreciate. 
 Produce many students who go on to do the same. 
  
There are fundamental reasons why this is success in the local culture.   Good research appreciated by others means access to jobs.  Many students succesful in the same way implies that there are a number of people who think in a similar way and appreciate your work.
 
In order to graduate, a phd student must live in an academic culture for a period of several years. It is common to adopt the culture’s definition of success during this time.  It’s also common for many phd students discover they are not suited to an academic research lifestyle.  This collision of values and abilities naturally results in depression.
 
The most fundamental advice when this happens is: change something.  Pick a new advisor.  Pick a new research topic.  Or leave th</p><p>3 0.87894934 <a title="110-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-03-27-Vowpal_Wabbit%2C_v5.1.html">428 hunch net-2011-03-27-Vowpal Wabbit, v5.1</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just created  version 5.1  of  vowpal wabbit .  This almost entirely a bugfix release, so it’s an easy upgrade from v5.0.
 
In addition:
  
 There is now a  mailing list , which I and several other developers are subscribed to. 
 The main website has shifted to the wiki on github.  This means that anyone with a github account can now edit it. 
 I’m planning to give a tutorial tomorrow on it at  eHarmony / the LA machine learning meetup  at 10am.  Drop by if you’re interested. 
  
The status of VW amongst other open source projects has changed.  When VW first came out, it was relatively unique amongst existing projects in terms of features.  At this point, many other projects have started to appreciate the value of the design choices here.  This includes:
  
  Mahout , which now has an SGD implementation. 
  Shogun , where  Soeren  is keen on  incorporating features . 
  LibLinear , where they won the KDD best paper award for  out-of-core learning .

<p>Introduction: I just visited  Yahoo Research  which has several fundamental learning problems near to (or beyond) the set of problems we know how to solve well.  Here are 3 of them.
  
  Ranking   This is the canonical problem of all search engines.  It is made extra difficult for several reasons.
 
 There is relatively little “good” supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as click through rates). 
 The learning must occur in a partially adversarial environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top of 
rankings. 
 It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as ‘ranking’ or as ‘regression’ which is then used to produce a 
ranking. 
 
 
  Collaborative filtering  Yahoo has a large number of recommendation systems for music, movies, etc…  In these sorts of systems, users specify how they liked a set of things, and then the system can (hopefully) find some more examples of things they might like

<p>Introduction: The many reviews following the many paper deadlines are just about over.  AAAI and ICML in particular were experimenting with several reviewing techniques.  
  
 Double Blind: AAAI and ICML were both double blind this year.  It seemed (overall) beneficial, but two problems arose.
 
 For theoretical papers, with a lot to say, authors often leave out the proofs.  This is very hard to cope with under a double blind review because (1) you can not trust the authors got the proof right but (2) a blanket “reject” hits many probably-good papers.  Perhaps authors should more strongly favor proof-complete papers sent to double blind conferences. 
 On the author side, double blind reviewing is actually somewhat disruptive to research.  In particular, it discourages the author from talking about the subject, which is one of the mechanisms of research.  This is not a great drawback, but it is one not previously appreciated.

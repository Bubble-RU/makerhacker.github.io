<p>Introduction: Graduate study is a mysterious and uncertain process. This easiest way to see
this is by noting that a very old advisor/student mechanism is preferred.
There is no known succesful mechanism for "mass producing" PhDs as is done (in
some sense) for undergraduate and masters study. Here are a few hints that
might be useful to prospective or current students based on my own
experience.Masters or PhD(a) You want a PhD if you want to do research. (b)
You want a masters if you want to make money. People wanting (b) will be
manifestly unhappy with (a) because it typically means years of low pay.
People wanting (a) should try to avoid (b) because it prolongs an already long
process.Attitude.Manystudents struggle for awhile with the wrong attitude
towards research. Most students come into graduate school with 16-19 years of
schooling where the principle means of success is proving that you know
something via assignments, tests, etcâ&euro;Ś Research doesnotwork this way. Research

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example

<p>Introduction: Yahoo released theKey Scientific Challengesprogram. There is aMachine
Learninglist I worked on and aStatisticslist whichDeepakworked on.I'm hoping
this is taken quite seriously by graduate students. The primary value, is that
it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research
which would be valuable to make progress on. A good strategy for a beginning
graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make
substantial advances for a PhD. The directions are sufficiently general that
I'm sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.A secondary
point, (which I'm sure is primary for many) is that there is money for
graduate students here. It's unrestricted, so you can use it for any

<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of "mechanism design": setting up the
structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane
things (rather than obviously counterproductive things). Application of this
principle to academic research may be fruitful.What is misdesigned about
academic research?TheJMLGguides give many hints.The common nature ofbad
reviewingalso suggests the system isn't working optimally.There are many ways
to experimentally"cheat" in machine learning.Funding Prisoner's Delimma. Good
researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing
research. Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant
proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written. This is
essentially a "prisoner's delimma": anyone not writing grant proposals loses,
but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction. If everyone
wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution of funding
would occur, and time w</p><p>6 0.12269381 <a title="110-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-01-The_Producer-Consumer_Model_of_Research.html">51 hunch net-2005-04-01-The Producer-Consumer Model of Research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and
giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.As a researcher, I am
most thankful for my education, without which I could not function. I want to
share this, because it provides some sense of how a researcher starts.My long
term memory seems to function particularly well, which makes any education I
get is particularly useful.I am naturally obsessive, which makes me chase down
details until I fully understand things. Natural obsessiveness can go wrong,
of course, but it's a great ally when you absolutely must get things right.My
childhood was all in one hometown, which was a conscious sacrifice on the part
of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated. I'm not
sure how important this was since travel has it's own benefits, but it bears
thought.I had several great teachers in grade school, and naturally gravitated
towards teachers over classmates, as they seemed more interesting. I</p><p>5 0.66007185 <a title="110-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-02-27-The_Stats_Handicap.html">290 hunch net-2008-02-27-The Stats Handicap</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Graduating students in Statistics appear to be at a substantial handicap
compared to graduating students in Machine Learning, despite being in
substantially overlapping subjects.The problem seems to be cultural.
Statistics comes from a mathematics background which emphasizes large
publications slowly published under review at journals. Machine Learning comes
from a Computer Science background which emphasizes quick publishing at
reviewed conferences. This has a number of implications:Graduating statistics
PhDs often have 0-2 publications while graduating machine learning PhDs might
have 5-15.Graduating ML students have had a chance for others to build on
their work. Stats students have had no such chance.Graduating ML students have
attended a number of conferences and presented their work, giving them a
chance to meet people. Stats students have had fewer chances of this sort.In
short, Stats students have had relatively few chances to distinguish
themselves and are heavily reliant on t</p><p>6 0.65695637 <a title="110-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-28-Somebody%26%238217%3Bs_Eating_Your_Lunch.html">445 hunch net-2011-09-28-Somebody&#8217;s Eating Your Lunch</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've enjoyed theTerminatormovies and show. Neglecting the whacky aspects (time
travel and associated paradoxes), there is an enduring topic of discussion:
how do people deal with intelligent machines (and vice versa)?In Terminator-
land, the primary method for dealing with intelligent machines is to prevent
them from being made. This approach works pretty badly, because a new angle on
building an intelligent machine keeps coming up. This is partly a ploy for
writer's to avoid writing themselves out of a job, but there is a fundamental
truth to it as well: preventing progress in research is hard.The United
States, has been experimenting with trying to stop research onstem cells. It
hasn't worked very well--the net effect has been retarding research programs a
bit, and exporting some research to other countries. Another less recent
example was encryption technology, for which the United States generally did
not encourage early public research and evendiscouraged as a munition. This

<p>Introduction: One conventional wisdom is that learning algorithms with linear
representations are sufficient to solve natural learning problems. This
conventional wisdom appears unsupported by empirical evidence as far as I can
tell. In nearly all vision, language, robotics, and speech applications I know
where machine learning is effectively applied, the approach involves either a
linear representation on hand crafted features capturing substantial
nonlinearities or learning directly on nonlinear representations.There are a
few exceptions to this--for example, if the problem of interest to you is
predicting the next word given previous words, n-gram methods have been shown
effective. Viewed the right way, n-gram methods are essentially linear
predictors on an enormous sparse feature space, learned from an enormous
number of examples. Hal's postheredescribes some of this in more detail.In
contrast, if you go to a machine learning conference, a large number of the
new algorithms are variations of lea</p><p>3 0.97122216 <a title="110-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-24-David_Waltz.html">460 hunch net-2012-03-24-David Waltz</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is about the hard choices that graduate students must make.The cultural
definition of success in academic research is to:Produce good research which
many other people appreciate.Produce many students who go on to do the
same.There are fundamental reasons why this is success in the local culture.
Good research appreciated by others means access to jobs. Many students
succesful in the same way implies that there are a number of people who think
in a similar way and appreciate your work.In order to graduate, a phd student
must live in an academic culture for a period of several years. It is common
to adopt the culture's definition of success during this time. It's also
common for many phd students discover they are not suited to an academic
research lifestyle. This collision of values and abilities naturally results
in depression.The most fundamental advice when this happens is: change
something. Pick a new advisor. Pick a new research topic. Or leave the program

<p>Introduction: Foster Provostgave a talk at the ICMLmetalearning workshopon "metalearning"
and the "no free lunch theorem" which seems worth summarizing.As a review: the
no free lunch theorem is the most complicated way we know of to say that
abiasis required in order to learn. The simplest way to see this is in a
nonprobabilistic setting. If you are given examples of the form(x,y)and you
wish to predictyfromxthen any prediction mechanism errs half the time in
expectation over all sequences of examples. The proof of this is very simple:
on every example a predictor must make some prediction and by symmetry over
the set of sequences it will be wrong half the time and right half the time.
The basic idea of this proof has been applied to many other settings.The
simplistic interpretation of this theorem which many people jump to is
"machine learning is dead" since there can be no single learning algorithm
which can solve all learning problems. This is the wrong way to think about
it. In the real world, w</p><p>6 0.9456346 <a title="110-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-04-Optimal_Proxy_Loss_for_Classification.html">341 hunch net-2009-02-04-Optimal Proxy Loss for Classification</a></p>

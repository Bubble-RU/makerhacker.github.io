<p>Introduction: What?Reductions are machines which turn solvers for one problem into solvers
for another problem.Why?Reductions are useful for several reasons.Laziness.
Reducing a problem to classification make at least 10 learning algorithms
available to solve a problem. Inventing 10 learning algorithms is quite a bit
of work. Similarly, programming a reduction is often trivial, while
programming a learning algorithm is a great deal of work.Crystallization. The
problems we often want to solve in learning are worst-case-impossible, but
average case feasible. By reducing all problems onto one or a few primitives,
we can fine tune these primitives to perform well on real-world problems with
greater precision due to the greater number of problems to validate
on.Theoretical Organization. By studying what reductions are easy vs. hard vs.
impossible, we can learn which problems are roughly equivalent in difficulty
and which are much harder.What we know now.Typesafe reductions. In the

<p>Introduction: Learning reductionstransform a solver of one type of learning problem into a
solver of another type of learning problem. When we analyze these for
robustness we can make statement of the form "ReductionRhas the property that
regretr(or loss) on subproblems of typeAimplies regret at mostf ( r )on the
original problem of typeB".A lower bound for a learning reduction would have
the form "for all reductionsR, there exists a learning problem of typeBand
learning algorithm for problems of typeAwhere regretron induced problems
impliesat leastregretf ( r )forB".The pursuit of lower bounds is often
questionable because, unlike upper bounds, they do not yield practical
algorithms. Nevertheless, they may be helpful as a tool for thinking about
what is learnable and how learnable it is. This has already come
uphereandhere.At the moment, there is no coherent theory of lower bounds for
learning reductions, and we have little understanding of how feasible they are
or which techniques may be useful in</p><p>4 0.11540791 <a title="82-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-15-Alternative_Machine_Learning_Reductions_Definitions.html">236 hunch net-2007-03-15-Alternative Machine Learning Reductions Definitions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A type of prediction problem is specified by the type of samples produced by a
data source (Example:X x {0,1},X x [0,1],X x {1,2,3,4,5}, etc…) and a loss
function (0/1 loss, squared error loss, cost sensitive losses, etc…). For
simplicity, we'll assume that all losses have a minimum of zero.For this post,
we can think of a learning reduction asA mappingRfrom samples of one
typeT(like multiclass classification) to another typeT'(like binary
classification).A mappingQfrom predictors for typeT'to predictors for
typeT.The simplest sort of learning reduction is a "loss reduction". The idea
in a loss reduction is to prove a statement of the form:TheoremFor all base
predictorsb, for all distributionsDover examples of typeT:E(x,y) ~
DLT(y,Q(b,x)) <= f(E(x',y')~R(D)LT'(y',b(x')))HereLTis the loss for the
typeTproblem andLT'is the loss for the typeT'problem. Also,R(D)is the
distribution over samples induced by first drawing fromDand then mapping the
sample viaR. The functionf()is the loss transf</p><p>5 0.10818198 <a title="82-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-02-Wielding_a_New_Abstraction.html">351 hunch net-2009-05-02-Wielding a New Abstraction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is partly meant as an advertisement for thereductions
tutorialAlina,Bianca, and I are planning to do atICML. Please come, if you are
interested.Many research programs can be thought of as finding and building
new useful abstractions. The running example I'll use islearning
reductionswhere I have experience. The basic abstraction here is that we can
build a learning algorithm capable of solving classification problems up to a
small expected regret. This is used repeatedly to solve more complex
problems.In working on a new abstraction, I think you typically run into many
substantial problems of understanding, which make publishing particularly
difficult.It is difficult to seriously discuss the reason behind or mechanism
for abstraction in a conference paper with small page limits. People rarely
see such discussions and hence have little basis on which to think about new
abstractions. Another difficulty is that when building an abstraction, you
often don't know the right way to</p><p>6 0.10534667 <a title="82-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-18-SVM_Adaptability.html">103 hunch net-2005-08-18-SVM Adaptability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One prescription for solving a problem well is:State the problem, in the
simplest way possible. In particular, this statement should involve no
contamination with or anticipation of the solution.Think about solutions to
the stated problem.Stating a problem in a succinct and crisp manner tends to
invite a simple elegant solution. When a problem can not be stated succinctly,
we wonder if the problem is even understood. (And when a problem is not
understood, we wonder if a solution can be meaningful.)Reinforcement learning
does step (1) well. It provides a clean simple language to state general AI
problems. In reinforcement learning there is a set of actionsA, a set of
observationsO, and a rewardr. The reinforcement learning problem, in general,
is defined by a conditional measureD( o, r | (o,r,a)*)which produces an
observationoand a rewardrgiven a history(o,r,a)*. The goal in reinforcement
learning is to find a policypi:(o,r,a)*-> amapping histories to actions so as
to maximize (or appro</p><p>4 0.63694888 <a title="82-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-15-Alternative_Machine_Learning_Reductions_Definitions.html">236 hunch net-2007-03-15-Alternative Machine Learning Reductions Definitions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Several recent papers have shown that SVM-like optimizations can be used to
handle several large family loss functions.This is a good thing because it is
implausible that thelossfunction imposed by the world can not be taken into
account in the process of solving a prediction problem. Even people used to
the hard-coreBayesianapproach to learning often note that some approximations
are almost inevitable in specifying apriorand/or integrating to achieve a
posterior. Taking into account how the system will be evaluated can allow both
computational effort and design effort to be focused so as to improve
performance.A current laundry list of capabilities includes:2002multiclass SVM

<p>Introduction: In research, it's often the case that solving a problem helps you realize that
it wasn't the right problem to solve. This is the case for the "reduce RL to
classification" problem with the solution hinted athereand turned into a
paperhere.The essential difficulty is that the method of stating and analyzing
reductions ends up being nonalgorithmic (unlike previous reductions) unless
you work with learning from teleoperated robots asGreg Grudicdoes. The
difficulty here is due to the reduction being dependent on the optimal policy
(which a human teleoperator might simulate, but which is otherwise
unavailable).So, thisproblemis "open" again with the caveat that this time we
want a more algorithmic solution.Whether or not this is feasible at all is
still unclear and evidence in either direction would greatly interest me. A
positive answer might have many practical implications in the long run.</p><p>2 0.94365174 <a title="82-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-01-NIPS_2008_workshop_on_%26%238216%3BLearning_over_Empirical_Hypothesis_Spaces%26%238217%3B.html">319 hunch net-2008-10-01-NIPS 2008 workshop on &#8216;Learning over Empirical Hypothesis Spaces&#8217;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This workshop asks for insights how far we may/can push the theoretical
boundary of using data in the design of learning machines. Can we express our
classification rule in terms of the sample, or do we have to stick to a core
assumption of classical statistical learning theory, namely that the
hypothesis space is to be defined independent from the sample? This workshop
is particularly interested in - but not restricted to - the 'luckiness
framework' and the recently introduced notion of 'compatibility functions' in
a semi-supervised learning context (more information can be found
athttp://www.kuleuven.be/wehys).</p><p>3 0.93188018 <a title="82-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-16-KDNuggets.html">342 hunch net-2009-02-16-KDNuggets</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many decision problems can be represented in the formFORn=1,2,â&euro;Ś:-- Reality
chooses a datumxn.-- Decision Maker chooses his decisiondn.-- Reality chooses
an observationyn.-- Decision Maker suffers lossL(yn,dn).END FOR.The
observationyncan be, for example, tomorrow's stock price and the decisiondnthe
number of shares Decision Maker chooses to buy. The datumxnideally contains
all information that might be relevant in making this decision. We do not want
to assume anything about the way Reality generates the observations and
data.Suppose there is a good and not too complex decision ruleDmapping each
datumxto a decisionD(x). Can we perform as well, or almost as well, asD,
without knowing it? This is essentially a special case of the problem ofon-
line learning.This is a simple result of this kind. Suppose the dataxnare
taken from [0,1] andL(y,d)=|y-d|. A norm ||h|| of a functionhon [0,1] is
defined by||h||2= (Integral01h(t)dt)2+ Integral01(h'(t))2dt.Decision Maker has

<p>Introduction: TheNew York Timeshas an article on thegrowth of spam. Interesting facts
include: 9/10 of all email is spam, spam source identification is nearly
useless due to botnet spam senders, and image based spam (emails which consist
of an image only) are on the growth.Estimates of the cost of spam are almost
certainly far to low, because they do not account for the cost in time lost by
people.The image based spam which is currently penetrating many filters should
be catchable with a more sophisticated application of machine learning
technology. For the spam I see, the rendered images come in only a few
formats, which would be easy to recognize via a support vector machine (with
RBF kernel), neural network, or even nearest-neighbor architecture. The
mechanics of setting this up to run efficiently is the only real challenge.
This is the next step in the spam war.The response to this system is to make
the image based spam even more random. We should (essentially) expect to

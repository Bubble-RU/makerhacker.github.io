</p><p>5 One key difficulty here is gauging how much a volunteer can (or should) do. [sent-13, score-0.149]
</p><p>6 Many people are willing to help a little, so breaking things down into small chunks is important. [sent-14, score-0.237]
</p><p>7 Unclear Decisions      Timing (May 16-27, 2005): We wanted to take advantage of the  special emphasis on learning  quarter here. [sent-15, score-0.419]
</p><p>8 We also wanted to run the summer school in the summer. [sent-16, score-0.456]
</p><p>9 By starting as late as possible in the quarter, we were in the “summer” for universities on a semester schedule but not those on a quarter schedule. [sent-18, score-0.314]
</p><p>10 Thus, we traded some students and scheduling conflicts at University of chicago for the advantages of the learning quarter. [sent-19, score-0.522]
</p><p>11 The disadvantage was that it forced talks to start relatively early. [sent-29, score-0.159]
</p><p>12 This meant that attendance at the start of the first lecture was relatively low (60-or-so), ramping up through the morning. [sent-30, score-0.258]
</p><p>13 Although some students benefitted from the workshop talks, most appeared to gain much more from the summer school. [sent-31, score-0.422]
</p><p>14 Doing various things rather than delegating means you feel like you are “doing your part”, but it also means that you are distracted and do not see other things which need to be done…. [sent-33, score-0.352]
</p><p>15 One good suggestion is “have a poster session for any attendees”. [sent-38, score-0.183]
</p><p>16 Having presentation slides and suggested reading well in advance helps. [sent-44, score-0.115]
</p><p>17 The bad news here is that it is  very  difficult to get speakers to make materials available in advance. [sent-45, score-0.356]
</p><p>18 They naturally want to tweak slides at the last minute and include the newest cool discoveries. [sent-46, score-0.183]
</p><p>19 The Future  There will almost certainly be future machine learning summer schools in the  series  and otherwise. [sent-48, score-0.472]
</p><p>20 My impression is that the support due to being “in series” is not critical to success, but it is considerable. [sent-49, score-0.084]

<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4, 2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245 participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see our  WIKI  for more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as organizers to screw it up too bad.  Also, since we have pretty good infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this two-week long party of machine learning.
 
In the end of MLSS we distributed a survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from participants.

<p>Introduction: Chicago ’05  ended a couple of weeks ago. This was the sixth  Machine Learning Summer School , and the second one that used a  wiki . (The first was Berder ’04, thanks to Gunnar Raetsch.) Wikis are relatively easy to set up, greatly aid social interaction, and should be used a lot more at summer schools and workshops. They can even be used as the meeting’s webpage, as a permanent record of its participants’ collaborations — see for example the wiki/website for last year’s  NVO Summer School .
 
A basic wiki is a collection of editable webpages, maintained by software called a   wiki engine . The engine used at both Berder and Chicago was  TikiWiki  — it is well documented and gets you something running fast. It uses PHP and MySQL, but doesn’t require you to know either. Tikiwiki has far more features than most wikis, as it is  really a full  Content Management System . (My thanks to Sebastian Stark for pointing this out.) Here are the features we found most useful:

<p>Introduction: There are at least  3  summer schools related to machine learning this summer.
  
  The first  is at  University of Chicago  June 1-11 organized by  Misha Belkin ,  Partha Niyogi , and   Steve Smale .  Registration is closed for this one, meaning they met their capacity limit.  The format is essentially an extended Tutorial/Workshop.  I was particularly interested to see  Valiant  amongst the speakers.  I’m also presenting Saturday June 6, on logarithmic time prediction. 
  Praveen Srinivasan  points out the second at  Peking University  in Beijing, China, July 20-27.   This one  differs substantially, as it is about vision, machine learning, and their intersection.  The deadline for applications is June 10 or 15.  This is also another example of the growth of research in China, with active support from  NSF . 
 The third one is at  Cambridge , England, August 29-September 10.  It’s in the  MLSS series .  Compared to the Chicago one, this one is more about the Bayesian side of ML, alth</p><p>6 0.15108658 <a title="75-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For the  Chicago 2005 machine learning summer school  we are organizing, at least 5 international students can not come due to visa issues.  There seem to be two aspects to visa issues:
  
  Inefficiency . The system rejected the student simply by being incapable of even  starting  to evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of time. 
  Politics . Border controls became much tighter after the September 11 attack.  Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will do that. 
  
What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem than (2).  Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa rejection.  Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry even people concerned with (2).  The obvious fixes to overload are “spend more money” and “make the system more efficient”.

<p>Introduction: COLT  had an impromptu session which seemed as interesting or more interesting than any other single technical session (despite being only an hour long).  There are several roles that an impromptu session can play including:
  
 Announcing new work since the paper deadline. Letting this happen now rather than later helps aid the process of research. 
 Discussing a paper that was rejected.  Reviewers err sometimes and an impromptu session provides a means to remedy that. 
 Entertainment.  We all like to have a bit of fun. 
  
For design, the following seem important:
  
 Impromptu speakers should not have much time.  At COLT, it was 8 minutes, but I have seen even 5 work well. 
 The entire impromptu session should not last too long because the format is dense and promotes restlessness.  A half hour or hour can work well. 
  
Impromptu talks are a mechanism to let a little bit of chaos into the schedule.  They will be chaotic in content, presentation, and usefulness.

<p>Introduction: I realized that the tools needed to solve the  problem just posted  were just created.  I tried to sketch out the solution  here  (also in  .lyx  and  .tex ).  It is still quite sketchy (and probably only the few people who understand reductions well can follow).
 
One of the reasons why I started this weblog was to experiment with “research in the open”, and this is an opportunity to do so.  Over the next few days, I’ll be filling in details and trying to get things to make sense.  If you have additions or ideas, please propose them.</p><p>3 0.86257195 <a title="75-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-06-A_link.html">108 hunch net-2005-09-06-A link</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Machine learning makes the   New Scientist  . From the article: 
  

COMPUTERS can learn the meaning of words simply by plugging into Google. The finding could bring forward the day that true artificial intelligence is developedâ&euro;Ś. 
But Paul Vitanyi and Rudi Cilibrasi of the National Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, realised that a Google search can be used to measure how closely two words relate to each other. For instance, imagine a computer needs to understand what a hat is.

<p>Introduction: We just finished the  Chicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer School .  The school was 2 weeks long with about 130 (or 140 counting the speakers) participants.   For perspective, this is perhaps the largest graduate level machine learning class I am aware of anywhere and anytime (previous  MLSS s have been close).  Overall, it seemed to go well, although the students are the real authority on this.  For those who missed it, DVDs will be available from our Slovenian friends.  Email  Mrs Spela Sitar  of the Jozsef Stefan Institute for details. 
 
The following are some notes for future planning and those interested. 
 Good Decisions 
  
 Acquiring the larger-than-necessary “Assembly Hall” at  International House .  Our attendance came in well above our expectations, so this was a critical early decision that made a huge difference. 
 The invited speakers were key.  They made a huge difference in the quality of the content. 
 Delegating early and often was important.  One key difficulty here</p><p>6 0.77926499 <a title="75-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-28-The_cross_validation_problem%3A_cash_reward.html">86 hunch net-2005-06-28-The cross validation problem: cash reward</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I don’t consider myself a “Bayesian”, but I do try hard to understand why Bayesian learning works.  For the purposes of this post, Bayesian learning is a simple process of:

 Predict according to the posterior. 
  
Bayesian learning has many advantages over other learning programs:

When faced with any learning problem, there is a choice of how much time and effort a human vs. a computer puts in.  (For example, the mars rover pathfinding algorithms are almost entirely engineered.)

<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the “right” way to do machine learning.  This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.  The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a reply 2 .
 
The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and general.  Essentially, you first specify a prior  P(D)  over possible processes  D  producing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:   P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)   
After this, hard decisions are made (such as “turn left” or “turn right”) by choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior) loss.
 
This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices of  P(D)  and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice properties:
  
 There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual distribution generating the data is drawn from  P(D)  there is no better method.</p><p>4 0.15013483 <a title="34-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-26-Watchword%3A_Probability.html">5 hunch net-2005-01-26-Watchword: Probability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Probability is one of the most confusingly used words in machine learning.  There are at least 3 distinct ways the word is used. 
  
  Bayesian  The Bayesian notion of probability is a ‘degree of belief’.   The degree of belief that some event (i.e. “stock goes up” or “stock goes down”) occurs can be measured by asking a sequence of questions of the form “Would you bet the stock goes up or down at  Y  to 1 odds?” A consistent better will switch from ‘for’ to ‘against’ at some single value of  Y .  The probability is then  Y/(Y+1) .  Bayesian probabilities express lack of knowledge rather than randomization.  They are useful in learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly makes the learning algorithms work better.  Bayesian Learning uses ‘probability’ in this way exclusively. 
  Frequentist  The Frequentist notion of probability is a rate of occurence.  A rate of occurrence can be measured by doing an experiment many times.  If an event occurs  k  times in</p><p>5 0.13755475 <a title="34-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-28-Regularization.html">33 hunch net-2005-02-28-Regularization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yaroslav Bulatov  says that we should think about regularization a bit.  It’s a complex topic which I only partially understand, so I’ll try to explain from a couple viewpoints.
  
  Functionally . Regularization is optimizing some representation to fit the data  and  minimize some notion of predictor complexity.  This notion of complexity is often the l 1  or l 2  norm on a set of parameters, but the term can be used much more generally.  Empirically, this often works much better than simply fitting the data. 
  Statistical Learning Viewpoint  Regularization is about the failiure of statistical learning to adequately predict generalization error.  Let  e(c,D)  be the expected error rate with respect to  D  of classifier  c  and  e(c,S)  the observed error rate on a sample  S .  There are numerous bounds of the form: assuming i.i.d. samples, with high probability over the drawn samples  S ,   e(c,D) less than e(c,S) + f(complexity)  where  complexity  is some measure of the size of a s</p><p>6 0.13615434 <a title="34-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-15-The_State_of_Tight_Bounds.html">41 hunch net-2005-03-15-The State of Tight Bounds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is about a confusion of mine with respect to many commonly used machine learning algorithms.   
 
A simple example where this comes up is Bayes net prediction.  A Bayes net where a directed acyclic graph over a set of nodes where each node is associated with a variable and the edges indicate dependence.  The joint probability distribution over the variables is given by a set of conditional probabilities.  For example, a very simple Bayes net might express: 
 P(A,B,C) = P(A | B,C)P(B)P(C) 
 
What I don’t understand is the mechanism commonly used to estimate  P(A | B, C) .  If we let  N(A,B,C)  be the number of instances of  A,B,C  then people sometimes form an estimate according to: 
  P’(A | B,C) = N(A,B,C) / N /[N(B)/N * N(C)/N] = N(A,B,C) N /[N(B)  N(C)]   
… in other words, people just estimate  P’(A | B,C)  according to observed relative frequencies.  This is a reasonable technique when you have a large number of samples compared to the size space  A x B x C , but it (nat</p><p>4 0.65190083 <a title="34-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-26-Watchword%3A_Probability.html">5 hunch net-2005-01-26-Watchword: Probability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is about a design flaw in several learning algorithms such as the Naive Bayes classifier and Hidden Markov Models.  A number of people are aware of it, but it seems that not everyone is.
 
Several learning systems have the property that they estimate some conditional probabilities  P(event | other events)  either explicitly or implicitly.  Then, at prediction time, these learned probabilities are multiplied together according to some formula to produce a final prediction.  The Naive Bayes classifier for binary data is the simplest of these, so it seems like a good example.  
 
When Naive Bayes is used, a set of probabilities of the form  Pr’(feature i | label)  are estimated via counting statistics and some prior.  Predictions are made according to the label maximizing: 
  Pr’(label) * Product features i  Pr’(feature i | label)  
 
(The  Pr’  notation indicates these are estimated values.)

<p>Introduction: Many different ways of reasoning about learning exist, and many of these suggest that some method of saying “I prefer this predictor to that predictor” is useful and necessary.  Examples include Bayesian reasoning, prediction bounds, and online learning.   One difficulty which arises is that the manner and meaning of saying “I prefer this predictor to that predictor” differs.
  
  Prior  (Bayesian) A prior is a probability distribution over a set of distributions which expresses a belief in the probability that some distribution is the distribution generating the data. 
  “Prior”  (Prediction bounds & online learning) The “prior” is a measure over a set of classifiers which expresses the degree to which you hope the classifier will predict well. 
  Bias  (Regularization, Early termination of neural network training, etc…)  The bias is some (often implicitly specified by an algorithm) way of preferring one predictor to another.

<p>Introduction: One of the subsidiary roles of conferences is recruitment.   NIPS  is optimally placed in time for this because it falls right before the major recruitment season.
 
I personally found job hunting embarrassing, and was relatively inept at it.  I expect this is true of many people, because it is not something done often. 
 
The basic rule is: make the plausible hirers aware of your interest.  Any  corporate sponsor  is  a “plausible”, regardless of whether or not there is a booth.   CRA  and the  acm job center  are other reasonable sources.
 
There are substantial differences between the different possibilities.  Putting some effort into understanding the distinctions is a good idea, although you should always remember where the other person is coming from.</p><p>3 0.84534562 <a title="34-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-10-Learning_Reductions_are_Reductionist.html">68 hunch net-2005-05-10-Learning Reductions are Reductionist</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about a fundamental motivation for the investigation of reductions in learning.  It applies to many pieces of work other than my own.
 
The reductionist approach to problem solving is characterized by taking a problem, decomposing it into as-small-as-possible subproblems, discovering how to solve the subproblems, and then discovering how to use the solutions to the subproblems to solve larger problems.  The reductionist approach to solving problems has often payed off  very  well.  Computer science related examples of the reductionist approach include:
  
 Reducing computation to the transistor. All of our CPUs are built from transistors. 
 Reducing rendering of images to rendering a triangle (or other simple polygons).  Computers can now render near-realistic scenes in real time. The big breakthrough came from learning how to render many triangles quickly.
  
  
This approach to problem solving extends well beyond computer science.  Many fields of science focus on theories mak</p><p>4 0.78832418 <a title="34-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-06-MLTV.html">146 hunch net-2006-01-06-MLTV</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of a  PASCAL  project, the Slovenians have been filming various machine learning events and placing them on the web  here .  This includes, for example, the  Chicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer School  as well as a number of other summer schools, workshops, and conferences.
 
There are some significant caveats here—for example, I can’t access it from Linux.  Based upon the webserver logs, I expect that is a problem for most people—Computer scientists are particularly nonstandard in their choice of computing platform.
 
Nevertheless, the core idea here is excellent and details of compatibility can be fixed later.  With modern technology toys, there is no fundamental reason why the process of announcing new work at a conference should happen only once and only for the people who could make it to that room in that conference.  The problems solved include:

<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult.  As a conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good papers—enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to (generally) to grow the conference.  For someone choosing to participate in a new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work out?  Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you are sure will work?
 
The conference founding problem is a joint agreement problem with a very significant barrier.  Workshops are a way around this problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective means for this.  A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available.  Presenting work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a confe</p><p>6 0.709454 <a title="34-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-26-Problem%3A_Reductions_and_Relative_Ranking_Metrics.html">31 hunch net-2005-02-26-Problem: Reductions and Relative Ranking Metrics</a></p>

Bayesian learning works. For the purposes of this post, Bayesian learning is a

interpolate all the way to pure engineering. When faced with any learning
problem, there is a choice of how much time and effort a human vs. a computer
puts in. (For example, the mars rover pathfinding algorithms are almost
entirely engineered.) When creating an engineered system, you build a model of
the world and then find a good controller in that model. Bayesian methods
interpolate to this extreme because the Bayesian prior can be a delta function
on one model of the world. What this means is that a recipe of "think harder"

<p>Introduction: Probability is one of the most confusingly used words in machine learning.
There are at least 3 distinct ways the word is used.BayesianThe Bayesian
notion of probability is a 'degree of belief'. The degree of belief that some
event (i.e. "stock goes up" or "stock goes down") occurs can be measured by
asking a sequence of questions of the form "Would you bet the stock goes up or
down atYto 1 odds?" A consistent better will switch from 'for' to 'against' at
some single value ofY. The probability is thenY/(Y+1). Bayesian probabilities
express lack of knowledge rather than randomization. They are useful in
learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly
makes the learning algorithms work better. Bayesian Learning uses
'probability' in this way exclusively.FrequentistThe Frequentist notion of
probability is a rate of occurence. A rate of occurrence can be measured by
doing an experiment many times. If an event occursktimes innexperiments then

complex topic which I only partially understand, so I'll try to explain from a
couple viewpoints.Functionally. Regularization is optimizing some
representation to fit the dataandminimize some notion of predictor complexity.
This notion of complexity is often the l1or l2norm on a set of parameters, but
the term can be used much more generally. Empirically, this often works much
better than simply fitting the data.Statistical Learning

<p>Introduction: This is about methods for phrasing and think about the scope of some theorems
in learning theory. The basic claim is that there are several different ways
of quantifying the scope which sound different yet are essentially the
same.For all sequences of examples. This is the standard quantification in
online learning analysis. Standard theorems would say something like "for all
sequences of predictions by experts, the algorithm A will perform almost as
well as the best expert."For all training sets. This is the standard
quantification for boosting analysis such asadaboostormulticlass
boosting.Standard theorems have the form "for all training sets the error rate
inequalities … hold".For all distributions over examples. This is the one that
we have been using for reductions analysis. Standard theorem statements have
the form "For all distributions over examples, the error rate inequalities …
hold".It is not quite true that each of these is equivalent. For example, in

<p>Introduction: This post is about a confusion of mine with respect to many commonly used
machine learning algorithms.A simple example where this comes up is Bayes net
prediction. A Bayes net where a directed acyclic graph over a set of nodes
where each node is associated with a variable and the edges indicate
dependence. The joint probability distribution over the variables is given by
a set of conditional probabilities. For example, a very simple Bayes net might
express:P(A,B,C) = P(A | B,C)P(B)P(C)What I don't understand is the mechanism
commonly used to estimateP(A | B, C). If we letN(A,B,C)be the number of
instances ofA,B,Cthen people sometimes form an estimate according to:P'(A |
B,C) = N(A,B,C) / N /[N(B)/N * N(C)/N] = N(A,B,C) N /[N(B) N(C)]â&euro;Ś in other
words, people just estimateP'(A | B,C)according to observed relative
frequencies. This is a reasonable technique when you have a large number of
samples compared to the size spaceA x B x C, but it (naturally) falls apart
when this is not the case</p><p>3 0.64463967 <a title="34-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-28-Regularization.html">33 hunch net-2005-02-28-Regularization</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many different ways of reasoning about learning exist, and many of these
suggest that some method of saying "I prefer this predictor to that predictor"
is useful and necessary. Examples include Bayesian reasoning, prediction
bounds, and online learning. One difficulty which arises is that the manner
and meaning of saying "I prefer this predictor to that predictor"
differs.Prior(Bayesian) A prior is a probability distribution over a set of
distributions which expresses a belief in the probability that some
distribution is the distribution generating the data."Prior"(Prediction bounds
& online learning) The "prior" is a measure over a set of classifiers which
expresses the degree to which you hope the classifier will predict
well.Bias(Regularization, Early termination of neural network training, etcâ&euro;Ś)
The bias is some (often implicitly specified by an algorithm) way of
preferring one predictor to another.This only scratches the surface--there are
yet more subtleties. For example the (as</p><p>2 0.77983236 <a title="34-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-28-Computational_Consequences_of_Classification.html">274 hunch net-2007-11-28-Computational Consequences of Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In theregression vs classification debate, I'm adding a new "pro" to
classification. It seems there are computational shortcuts available for
classification which simply aren't available for regression. This arises in
several situations.Inactive learningit is sometimes possible to find aneerror
classifier with justlog(e)labeled samples. Only much more modest improvements
appear to be achievable for squared loss regression. The essential reason is
that the loss function on many examples is flat with respect to large
variations in the parameter spaces of a learned classifier, which implies that
many of these classifiers do not need to be considered. In contrast, for
squared loss regression, most substantial variations in the parameter space
influence the loss at most points.In budgeted learning, where there is either
a computational time constraint or a feature cost constraint, a classifier can
sometimes be learned to very high accuracy under the constraints while a
squared loss regresso</p><p>3 0.74352503 <a title="34-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-20-The_Large_Scale_Learning_Survey_Tutorial.html">442 hunch net-2011-08-20-The Large Scale Learning Survey Tutorial</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ron Bekkermaninitiated an effort to create anedited book on parallel machine
learningthatMishaand I have been helping with. The breadth of efforts to
parallelize machine learning surprised me: I was only aware of a small
fraction initially.This put us in a unique position, with knowledge of a wide
array of different efforts, so it is natural to put together asurvey tutorial
on the subject of parallel learningforKDD, tomorrow. This tutorial
isnotlimited to the book itself however, as several interesting new algorithms
have come out since we started inviting chapters.This tutorial should interest
anyone trying to use machine learning on significant quantities of data,
anyone interested in developing algorithms for such, and of course who has
bragging rights to the fastest learning algorithm on planet earth(Also note
the Modeling with Hadoop tutorial just before ours which deals with one way of
trying to speed up learning algorithms. We have almost no overlap.)</p><p>4 0.67756307 <a title="34-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-03-Microsoft_Research%2C_New_York_City.html">464 hunch net-2012-05-03-Microsoft Research, New York City</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people. Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs,
this is serious forYahoo! Research.We had advanced warning
fromPrabhakarthrough thesimple act of leaving. Yahoo! Research was a world
class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is
deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave. My first
thought when I saw the news was "Uhoh,Robsaid that he knew it was serious when
the head of ATnT Research left." In this case it was even more significant,
because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in
how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high
engagement with the company. Prabhakar's departure is a clear end to that
experiment.The result is ambiguous from a business perspective. Y!R clearly
was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses. I'm not privy to the
internal accounting of impact and this is the kind of subject where there can
easily be great disagreemen</p><p>5 0.6764915 <a title="34-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-19-Loss_Functions_for_Discriminative_Training_of_Energy-Based_Models.html">23 hunch net-2005-02-19-Loss Functions for Discriminative Training of Energy-Based Models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is apaperby Yann LeCun and Fu Jie Huang published atAISTAT 2005. I found
this paper very difficult to read, but it does have some point about a
computational shortcut.This paper takes for granted that the method of solving
a problem is gradient descent on parameters. Given this assumption, the
question arises: Do you want to do gradient descent on a probabilistic model
or something else?All (conditional) probabilistic models have the formp(y|x) =
f(x,y)/Z(x)whereZ(x) = sumyf(x,y)(the paper calls- log f(x,y)an "energy").
Iffis parameterized by somew, the gradient has a term forZ(x), and hence for
every value ofy. The paper claims, that such models can be optimized for
classification purposes using only the correctyand the othery' not ywhich
maximizesf(x,y). This can even be done on unnormalizable models. The paper
further claims that this can be done with an approximate maximum. These claims
are plausible based on experimental results and intuition.It wouldn't surprise
me to learn</p><p>6 0.67599761 <a title="34-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-15-The_Machine_Learning_Department.html">228 hunch net-2007-01-15-The Machine Learning Department</a></p>

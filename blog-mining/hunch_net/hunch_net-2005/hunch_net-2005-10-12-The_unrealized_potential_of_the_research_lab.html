<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>4 0.1649687 <a title="121-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT
ResearchandLucenthad one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the
remainder ofBell Labs, triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine
learning group there. As the recession progresses, we may easily see more
firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer
support research.There are a couple positives to the recession as well.Both

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people. Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs,
this is serious forYahoo! Research.We had advanced warning
fromPrabhakarthrough thesimple act of leaving. Yahoo! Research was a world
class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is
deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave. My first
thought when I saw the news was "Uhoh,Robsaid that he knew it was serious when
the head of ATnT Research left." In this case it was even more significant,
because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in
how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high
engagement with the company. Prabhakar's departure is a clear end to that
experiment.The result is ambiguous from a business perspective. Y!R clearly
was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses. I'm not privy to the
internal accounting of impact and this is the kind of subject where there can
easily be great disagreemen</p><p>6 0.12863153 <a title="121-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-30-John_Langford_%26%238211%3B%3E_Yahoo_Research%2C_NY.html">175 hunch net-2006-04-30-John Langford &#8211;> Yahoo Research, NY</a></p>

publishing, conferences, etc…Yahoo Research is growing, so there is a chance I
can help it grow well.Yahoo understands the internet, including (but not at
all limited to) experimenting with research blogs.In the end, Yahoo Research
seems like the place where I might have a chance to make the greatest
difference.Yahoo (as a company) has made a strong bet on Yahoo Research. We-
the-researchers all hope that bet will pay off, and this seems plausible. I'll
certainly have fun trying.</p><p>6 0.79340273 <a title="121-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-04-Research_Budget_Changes.html">154 hunch net-2006-02-04-Research Budget Changes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Various people want to use hunch.net to announce things. I've generally
resisted this because I feared hunch becoming a pure announcement zone while I
am much more interested contentful posts and discussion personally.
Nevertheless there is clearly some value and announcements are easy, so I'm
planning to summarize announcements on Mondays.D. Sculleypoints out an
interestingSemisupervised feature learningcompetition, with a deadline of
October 17.Lihong Lipoints out thewebscope user interaction datasetwhich is
the first high quality exploration dataset I'm aware of that is publicly
available.Seth Rogers points outCrossValidatedwhich looks similar in
conception tometaoptimize, but directly using thestackoverflowinterface and
with a bit more of a statistics twist.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89869094 <a title="121-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-12-The_unrealized_potential_of_the_research_lab.html">121 hunch net-2005-10-12-The unrealized potential of the research lab</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I attended theIBM research 60th anniversary. IBM research is, by any
reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the
most value to it's parent company over the long term. This can be seen by
simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab
which has not gone through a period of massive firing. (Note that there are
alsonew research labs.)Despite this impressive record, IBM research has
failed, by far, to achieve it's potential. Examples which came up in this
meeting include:It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented
in the lab. (In fact, Intel produced it first.)Relational databases and SQL
were invented and then languished. It was only under external competition that
IBM released it's own relational database. Why didn't IBM grow anOracle
division?An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing
aCisco division. Why not?And remember â&euro;Ś IBM research is a stark success story

<p>Introduction: One of the confusing things about research is that progress is very hard to
measure. One of the consequences of being in a hard-to-measure environment is
that the wrong things are often measured.Lines of CodeThe classical example of
this phenomenon is the old lines-of-code-produced metric for programming. It
is easy to imagine systems for producing many lines of code with very little
work that accomplish very little.Paper countIn academia, a "paper count" is an
analog of "lines of code", and it suffers from the same failure modes. The
obvious failure mode here is that we end up with a large number of
uninteresting papers since people end up spending a lot of time optimizing
this metric.ComplexityAnother metric, is "complexity" (in the eye of a
reviewer) of a paper. There is a common temptation to make a method appear
more complex than it is in order for reviewers to judge it worthy of
publication. The failure mode here is unclean thinking. Simple effective
methods are often overlooked</p><p>4 0.68771607 <a title="121-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research. They provide many
roles including "announcing research", "meeting people", and "point of
reference". Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: "to what
extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?" This question is
very difficult to answer in any satisfying way. What we can do is compare
details of the process across multiple conferences.CommentsThe average quality
of comments across conferences can vary dramatically. At one extreme, the
tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback. At
the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing
detailed constructive feedback. Detailed feedback can give authors significant
guidance about how to improve research. This is the most subjective
entry.BlindVirtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors
do not know reviewers. Some also providedouble blindreview where reviewers do
not know authors. T</p><p>5 0.67638165 <a title="121-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-16-Representative_Reviewing.html">484 hunch net-2013-06-16-Representative Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>6 0.67292345 <a title="121-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

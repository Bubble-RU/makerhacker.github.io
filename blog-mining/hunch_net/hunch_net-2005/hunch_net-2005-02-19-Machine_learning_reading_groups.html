<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the2010 NYAS ML Symposiumthis year. (It wasabout 170
last year.) I particularly enjoyed several talks.Yannhas a new live demo of
(limited) real-time object recognition learning.Sanjoygave a fairly convincing
and comprehensible explanation of why amodified form of single-linkage
clusteringis consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a
critical feature for clustering algorithms. I'm curious how well this
algorithm works in practice.Matt Hoffman's poster covering online LDA seemed
pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement.This year, we allocated
more time towards posters & poster spotlights.For next year, we are
considering some further changes. The format has traditionally been 4 invited
Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students. Demand
from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and
startups in the area. Another growing concern is the facility--the location is
exceptional, but fittin</p><p>5 0.069623537 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-02-ICML%3A_Behind_the_Scenes.html">463 hunch net-2012-05-02-ICML: Behind the Scenes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a rather long post, detailing the ICML 2012 review process. The goal
is to make the process more transparent, help authors understand how we came
to a decision, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this process for
future conference organizers.Microsoftâ€™s Conference Management Toolkit (CMT)We
chose to useCMTover other conference management software mainly because of its
rich toolkit. The interface is sub-optimal (to say the least!) but it has
extensive capabilities (to handle bids, author response, resubmissions, etc.),
good import/export mechanisms (to process the data elsewhere), excellent
technical support (to answer late night emails, add new functionalities).
Overall, it was the right choice, although we hope a designer will look at
that interface sometime soon!Toronto Matching System (TMS)TMSis now being used
by many major conferences in our field (including NIPS and UAI). It is an
automated system (developed byLaurent CharlinandRich Zemelat U. Toronto) to

are now flattened. The system we used to use (Brian's threaded comments)
appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress. I
haven't yet figured out a workaround.I setup afeedburner account.I added an
RSS aggregator for both Machine Learning and other research blogs that I like
to follow. This is something that I've wanted to do for awhile.Many other

deadline. The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs
with a $300 registration fee.ICMLregistrationis also available, at about an x3
higher cost. My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a
larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as
long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference
organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>3 0.70109999 <a title="24-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-07-Pittsburgh_Mind_Reading_Competition.html">155 hunch net-2006-02-07-Pittsburgh Mind Reading Competition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Francisco Pereirapoints out a funPrediction Competition. Francisco says:DARPA
is sponsoring a competition to analyze data from an unusual functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiment. Subjects watch videos inside the
scanner while fMRI data are acquired. Unbeknownst to these subjects, the
videos have been seen by a panel of other subjects that labeled each instant
with labels in categories such as representation (are there tools, body parts,
motion, sound), location, presence of actors, emotional content, etc.The
challenge is to predict all of these different labels on an instant-by-instant
basis from the fMRI data. A few reasons why this is particularly
interesting:This is beyond the current state of the art, but not inconceivably
hard.This is a new type of experiment design current analysis methods cannot
deal with.This is an opportunity to work with a heavily examined and
preprocessed neuroimaging dataset.DARPA is offering prizes!</p><p>4 0.49401194 <a title="24-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-09-The_Machine_Learning_Forum.html">363 hunch net-2009-07-09-The Machine Learning Forum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dear Fellow Machine Learners,For the past year or so I have become
increasingly frustrated with the peer review system in our field. I constantly
get asked to review papers in which I have no interest. At the same time, as
an action editor in JMLR, I constantly have to harass people to review papers.
When I send papers to conferences and to journals I often get rejected with
reviews that, at least in my mind, make no sense. Finally, I have a very hard
time keeping up with the best new work, because I don't know where to look for
itÃ¢&euro;ÅšI decided to try an do something to improve the situation. I started a new
web site, which I decided to call "The machine learning forum" the URL
ishttp://themachinelearningforum.orgThe main idea behind this web site is to
remove anonymity from the review process. In this site, all opinions are
attributed to the actual person that expressed them. I expect that this will
improve the quality of the reviews. An obvious other effect is that there will
be fewer n</p><p>5 0.35565335 <a title="24-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-08-Online_Learning_as_the_Mathematics_of_Accountability.html">109 hunch net-2005-09-08-Online Learning as the Mathematics of Accountability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Accountability is a social problem. When someone screws up, do you fire them?
Or do you accept the error and let them continue? This is a very difficult
problem and we all know of stories where the wrong decision was made.Online
learning(as meant here), is a subfield of learning theory which analyzes the
online learning model.In the online learning model, there are a set of
hypotheses or "experts". On any instantancex, each expert makes a predictiony.
A master algorithmAuses these predictions to form it's own predictionyAand
then learns the correct predictiony*. This process repeats.The goal of online
learning is to find a master algorithmAwhich uses the advice of the experts to
make good predictions. In particular, we typically want to guarantee that the
master algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert. IfL(e)is the loss
of experteandL(A)is the loss of the master algorithm, it is often possible to
prove:L(A) less than mineL(e) + log(number of experts)over all sequences.In

<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>3 0.14787892 <a title="93-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-06-MLTV.html">146 hunch net-2006-01-06-MLTV</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of aPASCALproject, the Slovenians have been filming various machine
learning events and placing them on the webhere. This includes, for example,
theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer Schoolas well as a number of other
summer schools, workshops, and conferences.There are some significant caveats
here--for example, I can't access it from Linux. Based upon the webserver
logs, I expect that is a problem for most people--Computer scientists are
particularly nonstandard in their choice of computing platform.Nevertheless,
the core idea here is excellent and details of compatibility can be fixed
later. With modern technology toys, there is no fundamental reason why the
process of announcing new work at a conference should happen only once and
only for the people who could make it to that room in that conference. The
problems solved include:The multitrack vs. single-track debate. ("Sometimes
the single track doesn't interest me" vs. "When it's multitrack I miss good
talks""I couldn't</p><p>4 0.1426129 <a title="93-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-10-Workshops_are_not_Conferences.html">80 hunch net-2005-06-10-Workshops are not Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś and you should use that fact.A workshop differs from a conference in that it
is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic. It also
differs in that a workshop is typically a "one-time affair" rather than a
series. (TheSnowbird learning workshopcounts as a conference in this
respect.)A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop
is to treat it as a conference. This is "ok", but it is not really taking
advantage of the situation. Here are some things I've learned:For speakers: A
smaller audience means it can be more interactive. Interactive means a better
chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation
(because you can adapt to your audience). Greater focus amongst the
participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and
discuss tradeoffs more carefully. Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued
than newness.For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference style
presentation format (i.</p><p>5 0.13568971 <a title="93-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-05-04-COLT_and_ICML_registration.html">482 hunch net-2013-05-04-COLT and ICML registration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeckpoints outCOLTregistrationwith a May 13 early registration
deadline. The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs
with a $300 registration fee.ICMLregistrationis also available, at about an x3
higher cost. My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a
larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as
long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference
organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>6 0.12972079 <a title="93-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is an attempt to organize the broad research programs related to machine
learning currently underway. This isn't easy--this map is partial, the
categories often overlap, and there are many details left out. Nevertheless,
it is (perhaps) helpful to have some map of what is happening where. The word
'typical' should not be construed narrowly here.Learning TheoryFocuses on
analyzing mathematical models of learning, essentially no experiments. Typical
conference: COLT.Bayesian LearningBayes law is always used. Focus on methods
of speeding up or approximating integration, new probabilistic models, and
practical applications. Typical conferences: NIPS,UAIStructured
learningPredicting complex structured outputs, some applications. Typiical
conferences: NIPS, UAI, othersReinforcement LearningFocused on 'agent-in-the-
world' learning problems where the goal is optimizing reward. Typical
conferences: ICMLUnsupervised Learning/Clustering/Dimensionality

<p>Introduction: Some of the "sister conference" presentations atAAAIhave been great. Roughly
speaking, the conference organizers asked other conference organizers to come
give a summary of their conference. Many different AI-related conferences
accepted. The presenters typically discuss some of the background and goals of
the conference then mention the results from a few papers they liked. This is
great because it provides a mechanism to get a digested overview of the work
of several thousand researchers--something which is simply available nowhere
else.Based on these presentations, it looks like there is a significant
component of (and opportunity for) applied machine learning inAIIDE,IUI,
andACL.There was also some discussion of having a super-colocation event
similar toFCRC, but centered on AI & Learning. This seems like a fine idea.
The field is fractured across so many different conferences that the mixing of
a supercolocation seems likely helpful for research.</p><p>3 0.51543576 <a title="93-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>4 0.50933707 <a title="93-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-14-What_Learning_Theory_might_do.html">95 hunch net-2005-07-14-What Learning Theory might do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on thispostand some of the previousproblems/research
directionsabout where learning theory might make large strides.Why theory?The
essential reason for theory is "intuition extension". A very good applied
learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the
best computer algorithms for solving that problem. A very good theory can take
the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend
them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion. To do this, we take
these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:Explains the
basic intuitions.Makes new testable predictions about how to learn.Succeeds in
so learning.This is "intuition extension": taking what we have learned
somewhere else and applying it in new domains. It is fundamentally useful to
everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving
problems.Where next for learning theory?I like the analogy with physics. Back

<p>Introduction: In the quest to understand what good reviewing is, perhaps it's worthwhile to
think about what good research is. One way to think about good research is in
terms of a producer/consumer model.In the producer/consumer model of research,
for any element of research there are producers (authors and coauthors of
papers, for example) and consumers (people who use the papers to make new
papers or code solving problems). An produced bit of research is judged as
"good" if it is used by many consumers. There are two basic questions which
immediately arise:Is this a good model of research?Are there alternatives?The
producer/consumer model has some difficulties which can be (partially)
addressed.Disconnect.A group of people doing research on some subject may
become disconnected from the rest of the world. Each person uses the research
of other people in the group so it appears good research is being done, but
the group has no impact on the rest of the world. One way to detect this is by

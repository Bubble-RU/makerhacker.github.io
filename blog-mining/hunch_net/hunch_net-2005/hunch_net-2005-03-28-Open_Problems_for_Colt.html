<p>Introduction: Alina  and  Jake  point out the COLT  Call for Open Questions  due May 11.  In general, this is cool, and worth doing if you can come up with a crisp question.  In my case, I particularly enjoyed  crafting an open question  with precisely a form such that a  critic targeting my papers  would be forced to confront their fallacy or make a case for the reward.  But less esoterically, this is a way to get the attention of some very smart people focused on a problem that really matters, which is the real value.</p><p>4 0.10375197 <a title="47-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-07-Interesting_Papers_at_SODA_2009.html">334 hunch net-2009-01-07-Interesting Papers at SODA 2009</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several talks seem potentially interesting to ML folks at this year’s SODA.
  
  Maria-Florina Balcan ,  Avrim Blum , and  Anupam Gupta ,  Approximate Clustering without the Approximation .  This paper gives reasonable algorithms with provable approximation guarantees for k-median and other notions of clustering.  It’s conceptually interesting, because it’s the second example I’ve seen where NP hardness is subverted by changing the problem definition subtle but reasonable way.  Essentially, they show that if any near-approximation to an optimal solution is good, then it’s computationally easy to find a near-optimal solution.  This subtle shift bears serious thought.  A similar one occurred in  our ranking paper  with respect to minimum feedback arcset.  With two known examples, it suggests that many more NP-complete problems might be finessed into irrelevance in this style.

<p>Introduction: COLT has a  call for open problems  due March 21.  I encourage anyone with a specifiable open problem to write it down and send it in.  Just the effort of specifying an open problem precisely and concisely has been very helpful for my own solutions, and there is a substantial chance others will solve it.  To increase the chance someone will take it up, you can even put a bounty on the solution.

<p>Introduction: Sasha  is the  open problems  chair for both  COLT   and   ICML .  Open problems will be presented in a joint session in the evening of the COLT/ICML overlap day.   COLT has a history of open sessions, but this is new for ICML.  If you have a difficult theoretically definable problem in machine learning, consider submitting it for review,  due March 16 .  You’ll benefit three ways: 
  
 The effort of writing down a precise formulation of what you want often helps you understand the nature of the problem. 
 Your problem will be officially published and citable. 
 You might have it solved by some very intelligent bored people. 
  
The general idea could easily be applied to any problem which can be crisply stated with an easily verifiable solution, and we may consider expanding this in later years, but for this year all problems need to be of a theoretical variety.

<p>Introduction: Reviewing is a fairly formal process which is integral to the way academia is run.  Given this integral nature, the quality of reviewing is often frustrating.  I’ve seen plenty of examples of false statements, misbeliefs, reading what isn’t written, etc…, and I’m sure many other people have as well.  
 
Recently, mechanisms like double blind review and author feedback have been introduced to try to make the process more fair and accurate in many machine learning (and related) conferences.  My personal experience is that these mechanisms help, especially the author feedback.   Nevertheless, some problems remain.  
 
The game theory take on reviewing is that the incentive for truthful reviewing isn’t there.  Since reviewers are also authors, there are sometimes perverse incentives created and acted upon.  (Incidentially, these incentives can be both positive and negative.)  
 
Setting up a truthful reviewing system is tricky because their is no final reference truth available in any acce</p><p>3 0.54832584 <a title="47-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-05-09-The_Missing_Bound.html">244 hunch net-2007-05-09-The Missing Bound</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sham Kakade  points out that we are missing a bound.
 
Suppose we have  m  samples  x  drawn IID from some distribution  D .  Through the magic of exponential moment method we know that:
  
 If the range of  x  is bounded by an interval of size  I , a  Chernoff/Hoeffding style bound  gives us a bound on the deviations like  O(I/m 0.5 )  (at least in crude form).  A proof is on page 9  here . 
 If the range of  x  is bounded, and the variance (or a bound on the variance) is known, then  Bennett’s bound  can give tighter results (*).  This can be a huge improvment when the true variance small. 
  
What’s missing here is a bound that depends on the observed variance rather than a bound on the variance.  This means that many people attempt to use Bennett’s bound (incorrectly) by plugging the observed variance in as the true variance, invalidating the bound application.  Most of the time, they get away with it, but this is a dangerous move when doing machine learning.  In machine learning,</p><p>4 0.48644993 <a title="47-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-16-The_Everything_Ensemble_Edge.html">131 hunch net-2005-11-16-The Everything Ensemble Edge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rich Caruana ,  Alexandru Niculescu , Geoff Crew, and Alex Ksikes have done  a lot of empirical testing  which shows that  using all methods to make a prediction  is more powerful than using any single method.  This is in rough agreement with the Bayesian way of solving problems, but based upon a different (essentially empirical) motivation.  A rough summary is:
  
 Take all of {decision trees, boosted decision trees, bagged decision trees, boosted decision stumps, K nearest neighbors, neural networks, SVM} with all reasonable parameter settings. 
 Run the methods on each problem of 8 problems with a large test set, calibrating margins using either  sigmoid fitting  or  isotonic regression . 
 For each loss of {accuracy, area under the ROC curve, cross entropy, squared error, etc…} evaluate the average performance of the method. 
  
A series of conclusions can be drawn from the observations.

<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research.  They provide many roles including “announcing research”, “meeting people”, and  “point of reference”.  Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: “to what extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?”  This question is very difficult to answer in any satisfying way.  What we can do is compare details of the process across multiple conferences.

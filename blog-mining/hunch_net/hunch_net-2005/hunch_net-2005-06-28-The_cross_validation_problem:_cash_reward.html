<p>Introduction: ByShieandNatiFollowing John's advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought
it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is
often the best place for theory papers. We would like to emphasize that we
both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs,
and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers. For
many papers, ICML is the best venue. But for many theory papers, COLT is a
better and more appropriate place.Why should you submit to COLT?By-and-large,
theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory
papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking
theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT
is more focused then ICML with a single track session. Unlike ICML, the norm
in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks
presented. There is also often a lively discussion following paper

<p>Introduction: The health ofCOLT(Conference on Learning Theory or Computational Learning
Theory depending on who you ask) has been questioned over the last few years.
Low points for the conference occurred whenEuroCOLTmerged with COLT in 2001,
and the attendance at the 2002 Sydney COLT fell to a new low. This occurred in
the general context of machine learning conferences rising in both number and
size over the last decade.Any discussion ofwhyCOLT has had difficulties is
inherently controversial as is any story about well-intentioned people making
the wrong decisions. Nevertheless, this may be worth discussing in the hope of
avoiding problems in the future and general understanding. In any such
discussion there is a strong tendency to identify with a conference/community
in a patriotic manner that is detrimental to thinking. Keep in mind that
conferences exist to further research.My understanding (I wasn't around) is
that COLT started as a subcommunity of the computer science theory community.

<p>Introduction: Perhaps the biggest CS prize for research is theTuring Award, which has a
$0.25M cash prize associated with it. It appears none of the prizes so far
have been for anything like machine learning (the closest are perhaps database
awards).In CS theory, there is theGÃƒÂ¶del Prizewhich is smaller and newer,
offering a $5K prize along and perhaps (more importantly) recognition. One
such award has been given for Machine Learning, toRobert SchapireandYoav
Freundfor Adaboost.In Machine Learning, there seems to be no equivalent of
these sorts of prizes. There are several plausible reasons for this:There is
no coherent community.People drift in and out of the central conferences all
the time. Most of the author names from 10 years ago do not occur in the
conferences of today. In addition, the entire subject area is fairly new.There
are at least a core group of people who have stayed around.Machine Learning

<p>Introduction: Awhile ago, we discussed the health ofCOLT.COLT 2008substantially addressed my
concerns. The papers were diverse and several were interesting. Attendance was
up, which is particularly notable in Europe. In my opinion, the colocation
with UAI and ICML was the best colocation since 1998.And, perhaps best of all,
registration ended up being free for all students due to various grants from
theAcademy of Finland,Google,IBM, andYahoo.A basic question is: what went
right? There seem to be several answers.Cost-wise, COLT had sufficient grants
to alleviate the high cost of the Euro and location at a university
substantially reduces the cost compared to a hotel.Organization-wise, the
Finns were great with hordes of volunteers helping set everything up. Having
too many volunteers is a good failure mode.Organization-wise, it was clear
that all 3 program chairs were cooperating in designing the program
.Facilities-wise, proximity in time and space made the colocation much more
real than many others</p><p>5 0.47147676 <a title="86-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-28-Why_COLT%3F.html">453 hunch net-2012-01-28-Why COLT?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The notationg(n) = O(f(n))means that in the limit asnapproaches infinity there
exists a constantCsuch that theg(n)is less thanCf(n).In learning theory, there
are many statements about learning algorithms of the form "under
assumptionsx,y, andz, the classifier learned has an error rate of at
mostO(f(m))".There is one very good reason to use O(): it helps you understand
the big picture and neglect the minor details which are not important in the
big picture. However, there are some important reasons not to do this as
well.UnspeedupIn algorithm analysis, the use of O() for time complexity is
pervasive and well-justified. Determining the exact value of C is inherently
computer architecture dependent. (The "C" for x86 processors might differ from
the "C" on PowerPC processors.) Since many learning theorists come from a CS
theory background, the O() notation is applied to generalization error. The
O() abstraction breaks here--you can not generally change learning algorithm
and decrease your</p><p>4 0.29583889 <a title="86-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-17-Multitask_learning_is_Black-Boxable.html">164 hunch net-2006-03-17-Multitask learning is Black-Boxable</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Multitask learning is the problem of jointly predicting multiple labels
simultaneously with one system. A basic question iswhether or not multitask
learning can be decomposed into one (or more) single prediction problems. It
seems the answer to this is "yes", in a fairly straightforward manner.The
basic idea is that a controlled input feature is equivalent to an extra
output. Suppose we have some process generating examples:(x,y1,y2) in
Swherey1andy2are labels for two different tasks. Then, we could reprocess the
data to the formSb(S) = {((x,i),yi): (x,y1,y2) in S, i in {1,2}}and then learn
a classifierc:X x {1,2} -> Y. Note that(x,i)is the (composite) input. At
testing time, given an inputx, we can querycfor the predicted values of y1and
y2using(x,1)and(x,2).A strong form of equivalence can be stated between these
tasks. In particular, suppose we have a multitask learning algorithmMLwhich
learns a multitask predictorm:X -> Y x Y. Then the following theorem can be

<p>Introduction: The essential problem here is the large gap between experimental observation
and theoretical understanding.MethodK-fold cross validation is a commonly used
technique which takes a set ofmexamples and partitions them intoKsets
("folds") of sizem/K. For each fold, a classifier is trained on the other
folds and then test on the fold.ProblemAssume only independent samples. Derive
a classifier from the K classifiers with a small bound on the true error
rate.Past Work(I'll add more as I remember/learn.)Devroye, Rogers, and Wagner
analyzed cross validation and found algorithm specific bounds. Not all of this
is online, but here is onepaper.Michael KearnsandDana Ronanalyzed cross
validationand found that under additional stability assumptions the bound for
the classifier which learns on all the data is not much worse than for a test
set of sizem/K.Avrim Blum,Adam Kalai, andmyselfanalyzed cross validationand
found that you can do at least as well as a test set of sizem/Kwith no

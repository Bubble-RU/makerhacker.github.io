most thankful for my education, without which I could not function. I want to

details until I fully understand things. Natural obsessiveness can go wrong,
of course, but it's a great ally when you absolutely must get things right.My

of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated. I'm not

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with

<p>Introduction: For anyone planning to do research, conference attendance is virtually
mandatory for success. Aside from exposing yourself to a large collection of
different ideas, many interesting conversations leading to new research happen
at conferences. If you are a student, you should plan to go to at least one
summer conference. Your advisor should cover the costs.ConferenceLocationEarly

<p>Introduction: Yahoo released theKey Scientific Challengesprogram. There is aMachine
Learninglist I worked on and aStatisticslist whichDeepakworked on.I'm hoping
this is taken quite seriously by graduate students. The primary value, is that
it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research
which would be valuable to make progress on. A good strategy for a beginning
graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make
substantial advances for a PhD. The directions are sufficiently general that
I'm sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.A secondary
point, (which I'm sure is primary for many) is that there is money for
graduate students here. It's unrestricted, so you can use it for any
reasonable travel, supplies, etcâ&euro;Ś</p><p>5 0.65772766 <a title="73-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Larry Jackal has set up theLAGR("Learning Applied to Ground Robotics") project
(and competition) which seems to be quite well designed. Features include:Many
participants (8 going on 12?)Standardized hardware. In theDARPA grand
challengecontestants entering with motorcycles are at a severe disadvantage to
those entering with a Hummer. Similarly, contestants using more powerful
sensors can gain huge advantages.Monthly contests, with full feedback (but
since the hardware is standardized, only code is shipped). One of the premises
of the program is that robust systems are desired. Monthly evaluations at
different locations can help measure this and provide data.Attacks a known

<p>Introduction: Graduate study is a mysterious and uncertain process. This easiest way to see
this is by noting that a very old advisor/student mechanism is preferred.
There is no known succesful mechanism for "mass producing" PhDs as is done (in
some sense) for undergraduate and masters study. Here are a few hints that
might be useful to prospective or current students based on my own
experience.Masters or PhD(a) You want a PhD if you want to do research. (b)
You want a masters if you want to make money. People wanting (b) will be
manifestly unhappy with (a) because it typically means years of low pay.
People wanting (a) should try to avoid (b) because it prolongs an already long
process.Attitude.Manystudents struggle for awhile with the wrong attitude
towards research. Most students come into graduate school with 16-19 years of
schooling where the principle means of success is proving that you know
something via assignments, tests, etcâ&euro;Ś Research doesnotwork this way. Research
is what a PhD is about.</p><p>4 0.86949313 <a title="73-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-16-Optimizing_Machine_Learning_Programs.html">262 hunch net-2007-09-16-Optimizing Machine Learning Programs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning is often computationally bounded which implies that the
ability to write fast code becomes important if you ever want to implement a
machine learning algorithm. Basic tactical optimizations are covered
wellelsewhere, but I haven't seen a reasonable guide to higher level
optimizations, which are the most important in my experience. Here are some of
the higher level optimizations I've often found useful.Algorithmic Improvement
First. This is Hard, but it is the most important consideration, and typically
yields the most benefits. Good optimizations here are publishable. In the
context of machine learning, you should be familiar with the arguments for
online vs. batch learning.Choice of Language. There are many arguments about
thechoice of language. Sometimes you don't have a choice when interfacing with
other people. Personally, I favor C/C++ when I want to write fast code. This
(admittedly) makes me a slower programmer than when using higher level
languages. (Sometimes</p><p>5 0.86888248 <a title="73-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-14-The_Predictionist_Viewpoint.html">112 hunch net-2005-09-14-The Predictionist Viewpoint</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Virtually every discipline of significant human endeavor has a way explaining
itself as fundamental and important. In all the cases I know of, they are both
right (they are vital) and wrong (they are not solely vital).Politics. This is
the one that everyone is familiar with at the moment. "What could be more
important than the process of making decisions?"Science and Technology. This
is the one that we-the-academics are familiar with. "The loss of modern
science and technology would be catastrophic."Military. "Without the military,
a nation will be invaded and destroyed."(insert your favorite here)Within
science and technology, the same thing happens again.Mathematics. "What could
be more important than a precise language for establishing truths?"Physics.
"Nothing is more fundamental than the laws which govern the universe.
Understanding them is the key to understanding everything else."Biology.
"Without life, we wouldn't be here, so clearly the study of life is
fundamental."Computer S</p><p>6 0.81224495 <a title="73-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-03-Carbon_in_Computer_Science_Research.html">366 hunch net-2009-08-03-Carbon in Computer Science Research</a></p>

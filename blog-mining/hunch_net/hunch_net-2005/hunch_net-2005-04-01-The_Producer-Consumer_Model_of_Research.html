<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: How should we, as researchers in machine learning, organize ourselves?
 
The most immediate measurable objective of computer science research is publishing a paper.  The most difficult aspect of publishing a paper is having reviewers accept and recommend it for publication.  The simplest mechanism for doing this is to show theoretical progress on some standard, well-known easily understood problem.
 
In doing this, we often fall into a local minima of the research process.  The basic problem in machine learning is that it is very unclear that the mathematical model is the right one for the (or some) real problem.  A good mathematical model in machine learning should have one fundamental trait: it should aid the design of effective learning algorithms.  To date, our ability to solve interesting learning problems (speech recognition, machine translation, object recognition, etc…) remains limited (although improving), so the “rightness” of our models is in doubt.

<p>Introduction: Reviewing is a fairly formal process which is integral to the way academia is run.  Given this integral nature, the quality of reviewing is often frustrating.  I’ve seen plenty of examples of false statements, misbeliefs, reading what isn’t written, etc…, and I’m sure many other people have as well.  
 
Recently, mechanisms like double blind review and author feedback have been introduced to try to make the process more fair and accurate in many machine learning (and related) conferences.  My personal experience is that these mechanisms help, especially the author feedback.   Nevertheless, some problems remain.  
 
The game theory take on reviewing is that the incentive for truthful reviewing isn’t there.  Since reviewers are also authors, there are sometimes perverse incentives created and acted upon.  (Incidentially, these incentives can be both positive and negative.)

<p>Introduction: I attended the  IBM research 60th anniversary .  IBM research is, by any reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the most value to it’s parent company over the long term.  This can be seen by simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab which has not gone through a period of massive firing.  (Note that there are also  new research labs .)
 
Despite this impressive record, IBM research has failed, by far, to achieve it’s potential.  Examples which came up in this meeting include:
  
 It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented in the lab.  (In fact, Intel produced it first.) 
 Relational databases and SQL were invented and then languished.  It was only under external competition that IBM released it’s own relational database.  Why didn’t IBM grow an  Oracle division ? 
 An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing a  Cisco division .  Why not? 
  
And remember … IBM research is a s</p><p>3 0.75044632 <a title="51-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired. 
  
In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,  ATnT Research  and  Lucent  had one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the remainder of  Bell Labs , triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine learning group there.  As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.
 
There are a couple positives to the recession as well.

<p>Introduction: Alex Smola  showed me this  ICML 2006  webpage.  This is  NOT  the ICML we know, but rather some people at “Enformatika”.  Investigation shows that they registered with an anonymous yahoo email account from  dotregistrar.com  the “Home of the $6.79 wholesale domain!” and their nameservers are by  Turkticaret , a Turkish internet company.
 
It appears the website has since been altered to “ ICNL ” (the above link uses the google cache).
 
They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so the organizers of the real  ICML 2006  must feel quite flattered.</p><p>2 0.9260422 <a title="51-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-04-Health_of_Conferences_Wiki.html">212 hunch net-2006-10-04-Health of Conferences Wiki</a></p>

<p>Introduction: and I can’t help but remember him.
 
I first met  Sam  as an undergraduate at  Caltech  where he was TA for  Hopfield ‘s class, and again when I visited  Gatsby , when he invited me to visit  Toronto , and at too many conferences to recount.  His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great ability to phrase a problem so it’s solution must be understood.  With respect to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to make  my first tutorial , leading to others, and to other things, all of which I’m grateful to him for.  In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.
 
His death is  being called a suicide  which is so incompatible with my understanding of Sam that it strains my credibility.  But we know that his many responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane researchers have legions of inner doubts.  Having been depressed now and then myself, it’s helpful to understand at least intellectually</p><p>4 0.890149 <a title="51-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-09-Machine_Learning_Thoughts.html">137 hunch net-2005-12-09-Machine Learning Thoughts</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the quest to understand what good reviewing is,  perhaps it’s worthwhile to think about what good research is.   One way to think about good research is in terms of a producer/consumer model.
 
In the producer/consumer model of research, for any element of research there are producers (authors and coauthors of papers, for example) and consumers (people who use the papers to make new papers or code solving problems).  An produced bit of research is judged as “good” if it is used by many consumers.  There are two basic questions which immediately arise:
  
 Is this a good model of research? 
 Are there alternatives? 
  
The producer/consumer model has some difficulties which can be (partially) addressed.
  
  Disconnect.  A group of people doing research on some subject may become disconnected from the rest of the world.  Each person uses the research of other people in the group so it appears good research is being done, but the group has no impact on the rest of the world.  One way</p><p>6 0.85997319 <a title="51-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-12-01-NIPS_tutorials_and_Vowpal_Wabbit_7.4.html">492 hunch net-2013-12-01-NIPS tutorials and Vowpal Wabbit 7.4</a></p>

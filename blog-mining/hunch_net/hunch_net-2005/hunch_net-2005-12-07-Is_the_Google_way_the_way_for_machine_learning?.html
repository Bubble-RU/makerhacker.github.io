<p>Introduction: Suppose you have a dataset with 2 terafeatures (we only count nonzero entries in a datamatrix), and want to learn a good linear predictor in a reasonable amount of time.  How do you do it?  As a learning theorist, the first thing you do is pray that this is too much data for the number of parameters—but that’s not the case, there are around 16 billion examples, 16 million parameters, and people really care about a high quality predictor, so subsampling is not a good strategy.
 
 Alekh  visited us last summer, and we had a breakthrough (see  here  for details), coming up with the first learning algorithm I’ve seen that is provably faster than  any future  single machine learning algorithm.  The proof of this is simple: We can output a optimal-up-to-precision linear predictor faster than the data can be streamed through the network interface of any single machine involved in the computation.

<p>Introduction: Parallel machine learning is a subject rarely addressed at machine learning conferences.  Nevertheless, it seems likely to increase in importance because:
  
 Data set sizes appear to be growing substantially faster than computation.  Essentially, this happens because more and more sensors of various sorts are being hooked up to the internet. 
 Serial speedups of processors seem are relatively stalled.  The new trend is to make processors more powerful by making them  multicore .
 
 Both  AMD  and  Intel  are making dual core designs standard, with plans for more parallelism in the future. 
 IBM’s  Cell processor  has (essentially) 9 cores. 
 Modern graphics chips can have an order of magnitude more separate execution units. 
 

The meaning of ‘core’ varies a bit from processor to processor, but the overall trend seems quite clear.

<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don’t fully understand the impact of computation, as demonstrated by a lack of  big-O  analysis of new learning algorithms.  This is important—some current active research programs are fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are directly motivated by it.  When considering a learning algorithm, I think about the following questions:
  
 How does the learning algorithm scale with the number of examples  m ?  Any algorithm using all of the data is at least  O(m) , but in many cases this is  O(m 2 )  (naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown (k-means or many other optimization algorithms).  The unknown case is very common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn’t convergent or simply that the amount of computation isn’t controlled. 
 The above question can also be asked for test cases.  In some applications, test-time performance is of great importance. 
 How does the algorithm scale with the number of</p><p>5 0.12279023 <a title="136-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-14-Explorations_of_Exploration.html">183 hunch net-2006-06-14-Explorations of Exploration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Exploration is one of the big unsolved problems in machine learning. This isn’t for lack of trying—there are many models of exploration which have been analyzed in many different ways by many different groups of people. At some point, it is worthwhile to sit back and see what has been done across these many models.
  
   Reinforcement Learning  (1) . Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on Markov Decision Processes where the next state  s’    is given by a conditional distribution  P(s’|s,a)  given the current state  s  and action  a .  The typical result here is that certain specific algorithms controlling an agent can behave within  e  of optimal for horizon  T  except for  poly(1/e,T,S,A)  “wasted” experiences (with high probability).  This started with  E 3   by  Satinder Singh  and  Michael Kearns .  Sham Kakade’s thesis  has significant discussion.

<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied machine learning using current technology.  We just built a small one at TTI so this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design choices.
  
  Architecture   There are several architectural choices.
 
 AMD Athlon64 based system.  This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck.  Maximum RAM is typically 2-3GB. 
 AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB of RAM.  The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type. 
 Intel PIV or Xeon based system.  The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the above 2.  Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit hotter and be a bit more expensive. 
 Dual core chips.  Both Intel and AMD have chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them. 

In the end, we decided to go with option (2).  Roughly speaking,</p><p>5 0.6665194 <a title="136-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-30-Concerns_about_the_Large_Scale_Learning_Challenge.html">300 hunch net-2008-04-30-Concerns about the Large Scale Learning Challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  large scale learning challenge  for ICML interests me a great deal, although I have concerns about the way it is structured.
 
From the  instructions page , several issues come up:
  
  Large Definition   My personal definition of dataset size is:
 
  small   A dataset is small if a human could look at the dataset and plausibly find a good solution. 
  medium   A dataset is mediumsize if it fits in the RAM of a reasonably priced computer. 
  large  A large dataset does not fit in the RAM of a reasonably priced computer. 
 

By this definition, all of the datasets are medium sized.  This might sound like a pissing match over dataset size, but I believe it is more than that.


The fundamental reason for these definitions is that they correspond to transitions in the sorts of approaches which are feasible.  From small to medium, the ability to use a human as the learning algorithm degrades.  From medium to large, it becomes essential to have learning algorithms that don’t require ran</p><p>6 0.65966523 <a title="136-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-18-Parallel_ML_primitives.html">346 hunch net-2009-03-18-Parallel ML primitives</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In reinforcement learning (and sometimes other settings), there is a notion of “state”.   Based upon the state various predictions are made such as “Which action should be taken next?” or “How much cumulative reward do I expect if I take some action from this state?”  Given the importance of state, it is important to examine the meaning.   There are actually several distinct options and it turns out the definition variation is very important in motivating different pieces of work.
  
 Newtonian State.  State is the physical pose of the world.  Under this definition, there are  very  many states, often too many for explicit representation.  This is also the definition typically used in games. 
 Abstracted State.  State is an abstracted physical state of the world.  “Is the door open or closed?” “Are you in room A or not?” The number of states is much smaller here.  A basic issue here is: “How do you compute the state from observations?”

<p>Introduction: Urs Hoelzle  from  Google  gave an invited presentation at  NIPS .  In the presentation, he strongly advocates interacting with data in a particular scalable manner which is something like the following:
  
 Make a cluster of machines. 
 Build a unified filesystem.  (Google uses GFS, but NFS or other approaches work reasonably well for smaller clusters.) 
 Interact with data via  MapReduce . 
  
Creating a cluster of machines is, by this point, relatively straightforward.  
 
Unified filesystems are a little bit tricky—GFS is capable by design of essentially unlimited speed throughput to disk.  NFS can bottleneck because all of the data has to move through one machine.  Nevertheless,  this may not be a limiting factor for smaller clusters.
 
MapReduce is a programming paradigm.  Essentially, it is a combination of a data element transform (map) and an agreggator/selector (reduce).  These operations are highly parallelizable and the claim is that they support the forms of data interacti</p><p>3 0.88082278 <a title="136-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-26-Watchword%3A_Probability.html">5 hunch net-2005-01-26-Watchword: Probability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Probability is one of the most confusingly used words in machine learning.  There are at least 3 distinct ways the word is used. 
  
  Bayesian  The Bayesian notion of probability is a ‘degree of belief’.   The degree of belief that some event (i.e. “stock goes up” or “stock goes down”) occurs can be measured by asking a sequence of questions of the form “Would you bet the stock goes up or down at  Y  to 1 odds?” A consistent better will switch from ‘for’ to ‘against’ at some single value of  Y .  The probability is then  Y/(Y+1) .  Bayesian probabilities express lack of knowledge rather than randomization.  They are useful in learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly makes the learning algorithms work better.  Bayesian Learning uses ‘probability’ in this way exclusively. 
  Frequentist  The Frequentist notion of probability is a rate of occurence.  A rate of occurrence can be measured by doing an experiment many times.  If an event occurs  k  times in</p><p>4 0.7873717 <a title="136-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-25-Turing%26%238217%3Bs_Club_for_Machine_Learning.html">286 hunch net-2008-01-25-Turing&#8217;s Club for Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don’t fully understand the impact of computation, as demonstrated by a lack of  big-O  analysis of new learning algorithms.  This is important—some current active research programs are fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are directly motivated by it.  When considering a learning algorithm, I think about the following questions:
  
 How does the learning algorithm scale with the number of examples  m ?  Any algorithm using all of the data is at least  O(m) , but in many cases this is  O(m 2 )  (naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown (k-means or many other optimization algorithms).  The unknown case is very common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn’t convergent or simply that the amount of computation isn’t controlled. 
 The above question can also be asked for test cases.  In some applications, test-time performance is of great importance.

<p>Introduction: The  large scale learning challenge  for ICML interests me a great deal, although I have concerns about the way it is structured.
 
From the  instructions page , several issues come up:
  
  Large Definition   My personal definition of dataset size is:
 
  small   A dataset is small if a human could look at the dataset and plausibly find a good solution. 
  medium   A dataset is mediumsize if it fits in the RAM of a reasonably priced computer. 
  large  A large dataset does not fit in the RAM of a reasonably priced computer. 
 

By this definition, all of the datasets are medium sized.  This might sound like a pissing match over dataset size, but I believe it is more than that.


The fundamental reason for these definitions is that they correspond to transitions in the sorts of approaches which are feasible.  From small to medium, the ability to use a human as the learning algorithm degrades.  From medium to large, it becomes essential to have learning algorithms that don’t require ran</p><p>6 0.78470516 <a title="136-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

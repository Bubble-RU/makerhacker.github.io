<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahnhas been running theespgamefor awhile now. The espgame provides a
picture to two randomly paired people across the web, and asks them to agree
on a label. It hasn't managed to label the web yet, but it has produced alarge
datasetof (image, label) pairs. I organized the dataset so you couldexplore
the implied bipartite graph(requires much bandwidth).Relative to other image
datasets, this one is quite large--67000 images, 358,000 labels (average of
5/image with variation from 1 to 19), and 22,000 unique labels (one every 3
images). The dataset is also very 'natural', consisting of images spidered
from the internet. The multiple label characteristic is intriguing because
'learning to learn' and metalearning techniques may be applicable. The
'natural' quality means that this dataset varies greatly in difficulty from
easy (predicting "red") to hard (predicting "funny") and potentially more
rewarding to tackle.The open problem here is, of course, to make an internet

<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahn'sPeekaboom projecthas yieldeddata(830MB).Peekaboom is the second
attempt (afterEspgame) to produce a dataset which is useful for learning to
solve vision problems based on voluntary game play. As a second attempt, it is
meant to address all of the shortcomings of the first attempt. In
particular:The locations of specific objects are provided by the data.The data
collection is far more complete and extensive.The data consists of:The source
images. (1 file per image, just short of 60K images.)The in-game events. (1
file per image, in a lispy syntax.)A description of the event language.There
is a great deal of very specific and relevant data here so the hope that this
will help solve vision problems seems quite reasonable.</p><p>4 0.10588897 <a title="99-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-24-ICML%2B50%25.html">456 hunch net-2012-02-24-ICML+50%</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheICMLpaper deadline has passed.Joelleand I were surprised to see the number
of submissions jump from last year by about 50% to around 900 submissions. A
tiny portion of these are immediate rejects(*), so this is a much larger set
of papers than expected. The number of workshop submissions also doubled
compared to last year, so ICML may grow significantly this year, if we can
manage to handle the load well. The prospect of making 900 good decisions is
fundamentally daunting, and success will rely heavily on theprogram
committeeandarea chairsat this point.For those who want to rubberneck a bit
more, here's a breakdown of submissions by primary topic of submitted
papers:66 Reinforcement Learning 52 Supervised Learning 51 Clustering 46
Kernel Methods 40 Optimization Algorithms 39 Feature Selection and
Dimensionality Reduction 33 Learning Theory 33 Graphical Models 33

<p>Introduction: …is discussed inthis nytimes article. I generally expect such approaches to
become more common since computers are getting faster, machine learning is
getting better, and data is becoming more plentiful. This is another example
where machine learning technology may have a huge economic impact. Some side
notes:We-in-research know almost nothing about how these things are done
(because it is typically a corporate secret).… but the limited discussion in
the article seem naive from a machine learning viewpoint.The learning process
used apparently often fails to take into account transaction costs.What little
of the approaches is discussed appears modeling based. It seems plausible that
more direct prediction methods can yield an edge.One difficulty with stock
picking as a research topic is that it is inherently a zero sum game (for
every winner, there is a loser). Much of the rest of research is positive sum
(basically, everyone wins).</p><p>6 0.077516347 <a title="99-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-12-Workshop_Summary%26%238212%3BPrinciples_of_Learning_Problem_Design.html">277 hunch net-2007-12-12-Workshop Summary&#8212;Principles of Learning Problem Design</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TheNew York Timeshas an article on thegrowth of spam. Interesting facts
include: 9/10 of all email is spam, spam source identification is nearly
useless due to botnet spam senders, and image based spam (emails which consist
of an image only) are on the growth.Estimates of the cost of spam are almost
certainly far to low, because they do not account for the cost in time lost by
people.The image based spam which is currently penetrating many filters should
be catchable with a more sophisticated application of machine learning
technology. For the spam I see, the rendered images come in only a few
formats, which would be easy to recognize via a support vector machine (with
RBF kernel), neural network, or even nearest-neighbor architecture. The
mechanics of setting this up to run efficiently is the only real challenge.
This is the next step in the spam war.The response to this system is to make
the image based spam even more random. We should (essentially) expect to

<p>Introduction: Francisco Pereirapoints out a funPrediction Competition. Francisco says:DARPA
is sponsoring a competition to analyze data from an unusual functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging experiment. Subjects watch videos inside the
scanner while fMRI data are acquired. Unbeknownst to these subjects, the
videos have been seen by a panel of other subjects that labeled each instant
with labels in categories such as representation (are there tools, body parts,
motion, sound), location, presence of actors, emotional content, etc.The
challenge is to predict all of these different labels on an instant-by-instant
basis from the fMRI data. A few reasons why this is particularly
interesting:This is beyond the current state of the art, but not inconceivably
hard.This is a new type of experiment design current analysis methods cannot
deal with.This is an opportunity to work with a heavily examined and
preprocessed neuroimaging dataset.DARPA is offering prizes!</p><p>6 0.45209339 <a title="99-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-21-NIPS_paper_evaluation_criteria.html">180 hunch net-2006-05-21-NIPS paper evaluation criteria</a></p>

are now flattened. The system we used to use (Brian's threaded comments)
appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress. I
haven't yet figured out a workaround.I setup afeedburner account.I added an
RSS aggregator for both Machine Learning and other research blogs that I like
to follow. This is something that I've wanted to do for awhile.Many other
minor changes in font and format, with some help fromAlina.If you have any
suggestions for site tweaks, please speak up.</p><p>3 0.53029346 <a title="99-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-22-KDD_2010.html">406 hunch net-2010-08-22-KDD 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There were several papers that seemed fairly interesting atKDD this year. The
ones that caught my attention are:Xin Jin, Mingyang Zhang,Nan Zhang, andGautam
Das,Versatile Publishing For Privacy Preservation. This paper provides a
conservative method for safely determining which data is publishable from any
complete source of information (for example, a hospital) such that it does not
violate privacy rules in a natural language. It is not differentially private,
so no external sources of join information can exist. However, it is a
mechanism forpublishingdata rather than (say) the output of a learning
algorithm.Arik FriedmanAssaf Schuster,Data Mining with Differential Privacy.
This paper shows how to create effective differentially private decision
trees. Progress in differentially private datamining is pretty impressive, as
it wasdefined in 2006.David Chan, Rong Ge, Ori Gershony,Tim Hesterberg,Diane
Lambert,Evaluating Online Ad Campaigns in a Pipeline: Causal Models At

<p>Introduction: Since we last discussedthe other online learning,Stanfordhas very visibly
started pushing mass teaching inAI,Machine Learning, andDatabases. In
retrospect, it's not too surprising that the next step up in serious online
teaching experiments are occurring at the computer science department of a
university embedded in the land of startups. Numbers on the order of100000are
quite significant--similar in scale to the number ofcomputer science
undergraduate students/yearin the US. Although these populations surely
differ, the fact that theycouldoverlap is worth considering for the
future.It's too soon to say how successful these classes will be and there are
many easy criticisms to make:Registration != Learning… but if only 1/10th
complete these classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of any
traditional process.1st year excitement != nth year routine… but if only
1/10th take future classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of
any traditional process.Hello, che</p><p>5 0.44561273 <a title="99-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-24-A_Fundamentalist_Organization_of_Machine_Learning.html">158 hunch net-2006-02-24-A Fundamentalist Organization of Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are several different flavors of Machine Learning classes. Many classes
are of the 'zoo' sort: many different learning algorithms are presented.
Others avoid the zoo by not covering the full scope of machine learning.This
is my view of what makes a good machine learning class, along with why. I'd
like to specifically invite comment on whether things are missing,
misemphasized, or misplaced.PhaseSubjectWhy?IntroductionWhat is a machine
learning problem?A good understanding of the characteristics of machine
learning problems seems essential. Characteristics include: a data source,
some hope the data is predictive, and a need for generalization. This is
probably best taught in a case study manner: lay out the specifics of some
problem and then ask "Is this a machine learning problem?"IntroductionMachine
Learning Problem IdentificationIdentification and recognition of the type of
learning problems is (obviously) a very important step in solving such
problems. People need to be famili</p><p>6 0.44406685 <a title="99-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-07-20-Motivation_should_be_the_Responsibility_of_the_Reviewer.html">256 hunch net-2007-07-20-Motivation should be the Responsibility of the Reviewer</a></p>

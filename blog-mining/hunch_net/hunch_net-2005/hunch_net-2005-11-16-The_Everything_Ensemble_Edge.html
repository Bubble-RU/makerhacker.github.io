<p>Introduction: "Overfitting" is traditionally defined as training some flexible
representation so that it memorizes the data but fails to predict well in the
future. For this post, I will define overfitting more generally as over-
representing the performance of systems. There are two styles of general
overfitting: overrepresenting performance on particular datasets and
(implicitly) overrepresenting performance of a method on future datasets.We
should all be aware of these methods, avoid them where possible, and take them
into account otherwise. I have used "reproblem" and "old datasets", and may
have participated in "overfitting by review"--some of these are very difficult
to avoid.NameMethodExplanationRemedyTraditional overfittingTrain a complex

<p>Introduction: About 4 years ago, I speculated thatdecision trees qualify as a deep learning
algorithmbecause they can make decisions which are substantially nonlinear in
the input representation.Ping Lihasproved this correct, empiricallyatUAIby
showing that boosted decision trees can beat deep belief networks on versions
ofMnistwhich are artificially hardened so as to make them solvable only by
deep learning algorithms.This is an important point, because the ability to
solve these sorts of problems is probably the best objective definition of a
deep learning algorithm we have. I'm not that surprised. In my experience, if
you can accept the computational drawbacks of a boosted decision tree, they
can achieve pretty good performance.Geoff Hintononce told me that the great
thing about deep belief networks is that they work. I understand that Ping had
very substantial difficulty in getting this published, so I hope some
reviewers step up to the standard of valuing what works.</p><p>4 0.16288686 <a title="131-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-26-Machine_Learning_is_too_easy.html">347 hunch net-2009-03-26-Machine Learning is too easy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is. The
viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models,
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etc… share
little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within
one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.There are
two fundamental reasons why this is possible.For many problems, many
approaches work in the sense that they do something useful. This is true
empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different
approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor. It's also
true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in
a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors
does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples.There
is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field. In many other areas
there are unifying p</p><p>5 0.15015994 <a title="131-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-21-Problem%3A_Cross_Validation.html">26 hunch net-2005-02-21-Problem: Cross Validation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The essential problem here is the large gap between experimental observation
and theoretical understanding.MethodK-fold cross validation is a commonly used
technique which takes a set ofmexamples and partitions them intoKsets
("folds") of sizem/K. For each fold, a classifier is trained on the other
folds and then test on the fold.ProblemAssume only independent samples. Derive
a classifier from the K classifiers with a small bound on the true error

analyzed cross validation and found algorithm specific bounds. Not all of this
is online, but here is onepaper.Michael KearnsandDana Ronanalyzed cross
validationand found that under additional stability assumptions the bound for
the classifier which learns on all the data is not much worse than for a test
set of sizem/K.Avrim Blum,Adam Kalai, andmyselfanalyzed cross validationand

<p>Introduction: Foster Provostand I discussed the merits of ROC curves vs. accuracy
estimation. Here is a quick summary of our discussion.The "Receiver Operating
Characteristic" (ROC) curve is an alternative to accuracy for the evaluation
of learning algorithms on natural datasets. The ROC curve is acurveand not a
single number statistic. In particular, this means that the comparison of two
algorithms on a dataset does not always produce an obvious order.Accuracy (= 1
- error rate) is a standard method used to evaluate learning algorithms. It is
a single-number summary of performance.AROC is the area under the ROC curve.
It is a single number summary of performance.The comparison of these metrics
is a subtle affair, because in machine learning, they are compared on
different natural datasets. This makes some sense if we accept the hypothesis
"Performance on past learning problems (roughly) predicts performance on
future learning problems."The ROC vs. accuracy discussion is often conflated

<p>Introduction: Joel Preddmentioned"Antilearning" byAdam Kowalczyk, which is interesting from
a foundational intuitions viewpoint.There is a pervasive intuition that
"nearby things tend to have the same label". This intuition is instantiated in
SVMs, nearest neighbor classifiers, decision trees, and neural networks. It
turns out there are natural problems where this intuition is opposite of the
truth.One natural situation where this occurs is in competition. For example,
whenIntelfails to meet its earnings estimate, is this evidence thatAMDis doing
badly also? Or evidence that AMD is doing well?This violation of the proximity
intuition means that when the number of examples is few,negatinga classifier
which attempts to exploit proximity can provide predictive power (thus, the
term "antilearning").</p><p>6 0.63689065 <a title="131-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-30-Should_the_Input_Representation_be_a_Vector%3F.html">152 hunch net-2006-01-30-Should the Input Representation be a Vector?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The DARPA grandchallenge is a big contest for autonomous robot vehicle
driving. It was run once in 2004 for the first time and all teams did badly.
This year was notably different with theStanfordandCMUteams succesfully
completing the course. A number of details arehereandwikipedia has continuing
coverage.A formal winner hasn't been declared yet although Stanford completed
the course quickest.The Stanford and CMU teams deserve a large round of
applause as they have strongly demonstrated the feasibility of autonomous
vehicles.The good news for machine learning is that the Stanford team (at
least) is using some machine learning techniques.</p><p>2 0.95511138 <a title="131-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-30-COLT_2007.html">242 hunch net-2007-04-30-COLT 2007</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Registration for COLT 2007 is now open.The conference will take place on 13-15
June, 2007, in San Diego, California, as part of the 2007 Federated Computing
Research Conference (FCRC), which includes STOC, Complexity, and EC.The
website for COLT: http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2007/index.htmlThe early
registration deadline is May 11, and the cutoff date for discounted hotel
rates is May 9.Before registering, take note that the fees are substantially
lower for members of ACM and/or SIGACT than for nonmembers. If you've been
contemplating joining either of these two societies (annual dues: $99 for ACM,
$18 for SIGACT), now would be a good time!</p><p>3 0.93749404 <a title="131-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-24-NLPers.html">166 hunch net-2006-03-24-NLPers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: (Unofficially, at least.) TheDeep Learning Workshopis being held the afternoon
before the rest of the workshops in Vancouver, BC. Separate registration is
needed, and open.What's happening fundamentally here is that there are too
many interesting workshops to fit into 2 days. Perhaps we can get it
officially expanded to 3 days next year.</p><p>same-blog 6 0.91237986 <a title="131-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-16-The_Everything_Ensemble_Edge.html">131 hunch net-2005-11-16-The Everything Ensemble Edge</a></p>

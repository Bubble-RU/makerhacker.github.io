<p>Introduction: How should we, as researchers in machine learning, organize ourselves?The most
immediate measurable objective of computer science research is publishing a
paper. The most difficult aspect of publishing a paper is having reviewers
accept and recommend it for publication. The simplest mechanism for doing this
is to show theoretical progress on some standard, well-known easily understood
problem.In doing this, we often fall into a local minima of the research
process. The basic problem in machine learning is that it is very unclear that
the mathematical model is the right one for the (or some) real problem. A good
mathematical model in machine learning should have one fundamental trait: it
should aid the design of effective learning algorithms. To date, our ability
to solve interesting learning problems (speech recognition, machine
translation, object recognition, etcâ&euro;Ś) remains limited (although improving),
so the "rightness" of our models is in doubt.If our mathematical models are

<p>Introduction: In everyday use a model is a system which explains the behavior of some
system, hopefully at the level where some alteration of the model predicts
some alteration of the real-world system. In machine learning "model" has
several variant definitions.Everyday. The common definition is sometimes
used.Parameterized. Sometimes model is a short-hand for "parameterized model".
Here, it refers to a model with unspecified free parameters. In the Bayesian
learning approach, you typically have a prior over (everyday)
models.Predictive. Even further from everyday use is the predictive model.
Examples of this are "my model is a decision tree" or "my model is a support
vector machine". Here, there is no real sense in which an SVM explains the
underlying process. For example, an SVM tells us nothing in particular about
how alterations to the real-world system would create a change.Which
definition is being used at any particular time is important information. For
example, if it's a parameterized or p</p><p>4 0.1423451 <a title="97-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-05-23-Three_levels_of_addressing_the_Netflix_Prize.html">301 hunch net-2008-05-23-Three levels of addressing the Netflix Prize</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In October 2006, the online movie renter, Netflix, announced theNetflix
Prizecontest. They published a comprehensive dataset including more than 100
million movie ratings, which were performed by about 480,000 real customers on
17,770 movies.Ã‚ÂCompetitors in the challenge are required to estimate a few
million ratings.Ã‚ÂTo win the "grand prize," they need to deliver a 10%
improvement in the prediction error compared with the results of Cinematch,
Netflix's proprietary recommender system. Best current results deliver
9.12%improvement, which is quite close to the 10% goal, yet painfully
distant.Ã‚ÂThe Netflix Prize breathed new life and excitement into recommender
systems research. The competition allowed the wide research community to
access a large scale, real life dataset. Beyond this, the competition changed
the rules of the game. Claiming that your nice idea could outperform some
mediocre algorithms on some toy dataset is no longer acceptable. Now

<p>Introduction: Maybe it's too early to call, but with four separate Neural Network sessions
at this year'sICML, it looks like Neural Networks are making a comeback. Here
are my highlights of these sessions. In general, my feeling is that these
papers both demystify deep learning and show its broader applicability.The
first observation I made is that the once disreputable "Neural" nomenclature
is being used againin lieu of"deep learning". Maybe it's because Adam Coates
et al. showed that single layer networks can work surprisingly well.An
Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning,Adam
Coates,Honglak Lee,Andrew Y. Ng(AISTATS 2011)The Importance of Encoding Versus
Training with Sparse Coding and Vector Quantization,Adam Coates,Andrew Y.

<p>Introduction: I had a chance to attendUAIthis year, where several papers interested me,
including:Hoifung PoonandPedro DomingosSum-Product Networks: A New Deep
Architecture. We'vealready discussed this one, but in a nutshell, they
identify a large class of efficiently normalizable distributions and do
learning with it.Yao-Liang YuandDale Schuurmans,Rank/norm regularization with
closed-form solutions: Application to subspace clustering. This paper is about
matrices, and in particular they prove that certain matrices are the solution
of matrix optimizations. I'm not matrix inclined enough to fully appreciate
this one, but I believe many others may be, and anytime closed form solutions
come into play, you get 2 order of magnitude speedups, as they show
experimentally.Laurent Charlin,Richard ZemelandCraig Boutilier,A Framework for
Optimizing Paper Matching. This is about what works in matching papers to
reviewers, as has been tested at several previous NIPS. We are looking into

claims of success appear somewhat overstated to me, but the method of attack
is valid and could plausibly be substantially improved so as to reveal the
movie preferences of a small fraction of Netflix users.The basic idea is to
use a heuristic similarity function between ratings in a public database (from
IMDB) and an anonymized database (Netflix) to link ratings in the private
database to public identities (in IMDB). They claim to have linked two of a
few dozen IMDB users to anonymized netflix users.The claims seem a bit
inflated to me, because (a) knowing the IMDB identity isn't equivalent to
knowing the person and (b) the claims of statistical significance are with
respect to a model of the world they created (rather than one they
created).Overall, this is another example showing that completeprivacy is
hard. It may be worth remembering that there are some substantial benefits
from the Netflix challenge as w</p><p>2 0.9131366 <a title="97-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-25-Presentation_of_Proofs_is_Hard..html">187 hunch net-2006-06-25-Presentation of Proofs is Hard.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When presenting part of theReinforcement Learning theory tutorialatICML 2006,
I was forcibly reminded of this.There are several difficulties.When creating
the presentation, the correct level of detail is tricky. With too much detail,
the proof takes too much time and people may be lost to boredom. With too
little detail, the steps of the proof involve too-great a jump. This is very
difficult to judge.What may be an easy step in the careful thought of a quiet
room is not so easy when you are occupied by the process of presentation.What
may be easy after having gone over this (and other) proofs is not so easy to
follow in the first pass by a viewer.These problems seem only correctable by
process of repeated test-and-revise.When presenting the proof, simply speaking
with sufficient precision is substantially harder than in normal conversation
(where precision is not so critical). Practice can help here.When presenting
the proof, going at the right pace for understanding is difficult. When</p><p>3 0.9123053 <a title="97-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-04-Watchword%3A_model.html">135 hunch net-2005-12-04-Watchword: model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In everyday use a model is a system which explains the behavior of some
system, hopefully at the level where some alteration of the model predicts
some alteration of the real-world system. In machine learning "model" has
several variant definitions.Everyday. The common definition is sometimes
used.Parameterized. Sometimes model is a short-hand for "parameterized model".
Here, it refers to a model with unspecified free parameters. In the Bayesian
learning approach, you typically have a prior over (everyday)
models.Predictive. Even further from everyday use is the predictive model.
Examples of this are "my model is a decision tree" or "my model is a support
vector machine". Here, there is no real sense in which an SVM explains the
underlying process. For example, an SVM tells us nothing in particular about
how alterations to the real-world system would create a change.Which
definition is being used at any particular time is important information. For
example, if it's a parameterized or p</p><p>4 0.91065764 <a title="97-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-31-Watchword%3A_Assumption.html">7 hunch net-2005-01-31-Watchword: Assumption</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Assumption" is another word to be careful with in machine learning because it
is used in several ways.Assumption = BiasThere are several ways to see that
some form of 'bias' (= preferring of one solution over another) is necessary.
This is obvious in an adversarial setting. A good bit of work has been
expended explaining this in other settings with "no free lunch" theorems. This
is a usage specialized to learning which is particularly common when talking
about priors for Bayesian Learning.Assumption = "if" of a theoremThe
assumptions are the 'if' part of the 'if-then' in a theorem. This is a fairly
common usage.Assumption = AxiomThe assumptions are the things that we assume
are true, but which we cannot verify. Examples are "the IID assumption" or "my
problem is a DNF on a small number of bits". This is the usage which I
prefer.One difficulty with any use of the word "assumption" is that you often
encounter "ifassumptionthenconclusionso ifnot assumptionthennot conclusion".

<p>Introduction: Several events are happening in the NY area.Barriers in Computational Learning
Theory Workshop, Aug 28.That's tomorrow near Princeton. I'm looking forward to
speaking at this one on "Getting around Barriers in Learning Theory", but
several other talks are of interest, particularly to the CS theory
inclined.Claudia Perlichis running theINFORMS Data Mining Contestwith a
deadline of Sept. 25. This is a contest using real health record data (they
partnered withHealthCare Intelligence) to predict transfers and mortality. In
the current US health care reform debate, the case studies of high costs we
hear strongly suggest machine learning & statistics can save many billions.The
Singularity Summit October 3&4\. This is for the AIists out there. Several of
the talks look interesting, although unfortunately I'll miss it
forALT.Predictive Analytics World, Oct 20-21. This is stretching the
definition of "New York Area" a bit, but the train to DC is reasonable. This

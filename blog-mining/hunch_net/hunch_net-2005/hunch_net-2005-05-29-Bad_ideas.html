In my experience, bad ideas are common  and  over confidence in ideas is common.  This overconfidence can take either the form of excessive condemnation or excessive praise.  Some of this is necessary to the process of research.  For example, some overconfidence in the value of your own research is expected and probably necessary to motivate your own investigation.  Since research is a rather risky business, much of it does not pan out.  Learning to accept when something does not pan out is a critical skill which is sometimes never acquired.

<p>Introduction: One viewpoint on academia is that it is inherently adversarial: there are finite research dollars, positions, and students to work with, implying a zero-sum game between different participants.  This is not a viewpoint that I want to promote, as I consider it flawed.  However, I know several people believe strongly in this viewpoint, and I have found it to have  substantial explanatory power.
 
For example:
  
 It explains why your paper was rejected based on poor logic.  The reviewer wasn’t concerned with research quality, but rather with rejecting a competitor. 
 It explains why professors rarely work together.  The goal of a non-tenured professor (at least) is to get tenure, and a case for tenure comes from a portfolio of work that is undisputably yours. 
 It explains why new research programs are not quickly adopted.  Adopting a competitor’s program is impossible, if your career is based on the competitor being wrong. 
  
Different academic groups subscribe to the adversarial viewp</p><p>5 0.096711025 <a title="76-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-18-Necessary_and_Sufficient_Research.html">370 hunch net-2009-09-18-Necessary and Sufficient Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea how to solve.  In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a solution to the larger problem.  This approach can go wrong in several ways. 
  
  Decomposition failure .  The solution to the decomposition does not in fact yield a solution to the overall problem. 
  Artificial hardness .  The subproblems created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are harder than necessary. 
  
As you can see, computational complexity forms a relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach sufficient but not necessary.
 
In my experience, the artificial hardness problem is very common.  Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a problem to work on to other people.

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

<p>Introduction: I attended the  IBM research 60th anniversary .  IBM research is, by any reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the most value to it’s parent company over the long term.  This can be seen by simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab which has not gone through a period of massive firing.  (Note that there are also  new research labs .)
 
Despite this impressive record, IBM research has failed, by far, to achieve it’s potential.  Examples which came up in this meeting include:
  
 It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented in the lab.  (In fact, Intel produced it first.) 
 Relational databases and SQL were invented and then languished.  It was only under external competition that IBM released it’s own relational database.  Why didn’t IBM grow an  Oracle division ? 
 An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing a  Cisco division .  Why not? 
  
And remember … IBM research is a s</p><p>5 0.69329226 <a title="76-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An amusing tidbit (reproduced without permission) from Herman Chernoff’s delightful monograph, “Sequential analysis and optimal design”:
 
The use of randomization raises a philosophical question which is articulated by the following probably apocryphal anecdote.
 
The metallurgist told his friend the statistician how he planned to test the effect of heat on the strength of a metal bar by sawing the bar into six pieces. The first two would go into the hot oven, the next two into the medium oven, and the last two into the cool oven. The statistician, horrified, explained how he should randomize to avoid the effect of a possible gradient of strength in the metal bar. The method of randomization was applied, and it turned out that the randomized experiment called for putting the first two pieces into the hot oven, the next two into the medium oven, and the last two into the cool oven. “Obviously, we can’t do that,” said the metallurgist. “On the contrary, you have to do that,” said the st</p><p>same-blog 2 0.85789418 <a title="76-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Bad_ideas.html">76 hunch net-2005-05-29-Bad ideas</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found these two essays on bad ideas interesting.  Neither of these is written from the viewpoint of research, but they are both highly relevant.
  
  Why smart people have bad ideas  by Paul Graham 
  Why smart people defend bad ideas  by Scott Berkun (which appeared on  slashdot ) 
  
In my experience, bad ideas are common  and  over confidence in ideas is common.  This overconfidence can take either the form of excessive condemnation or excessive praise.  Some of this is necessary to the process of research.  For example, some overconfidence in the value of your own research is expected and probably necessary to motivate your own investigation.  Since research is a rather risky business, much of it does not pan out.  Learning to accept when something does not pan out is a critical skill which is sometimes never acquired.
 
Excessive condemnation can be a real ill when it’s encountered.  This has two effects:

<p>Introduction: Sam Roweis ‘s comment reminds me of a more general issue that comes up in doing research: abstractions always break.  
  
 Real number’s aren’t.  Most real numbers can not be represented with any machine.  One implication of this is that many real-number based algorithms have difficulties when implemented with floating point numbers. 
 The box on your desk is not a turing machine. A turing machine can compute anything computable, given sufficient time.  A typical computer fails terribly when the state required for the computation exceeds some limit. 
 Nash equilibria aren’t equilibria.  This comes up when trying to predict human behavior based on the result of the equilibria computation.  Often, it doesn’t work. 
 The  probability  isn’t.  Probability is an abstraction expressing either our lack of knowledge (the Bayesian viewpoint) or fundamental randomization (the frequentist viewpoint).  From the frequentist viewpoint the lack of knowledge typically precludes actually knowing the fu</p><p>4 0.81994212 <a title="76-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-07-10-Thoughts_on_Artificial_Intelligence.html">486 hunch net-2013-07-10-Thoughts on Artificial Intelligence</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is about a technology which could develop in the future.
 
Right now, a new drug might be tested by finding patients with some diagnosis and giving or not giving them a drug according to a secret randomization.  The outcome is observed, and if the average outcome for those treated is measurably better than the average outcome for those not treated, the drug might become a standard treatment.
 
Generalizing this, a filter  F  sorts people into two groups: those for treatment  A  and those not for treatment  B  based upon observations  x .  To measure the outcome, you randomize between treatment and nontreatment of group  A  and measure the relative performance of the treatment.
 
A problem often arises: in many cases the treated group does not do better than the nontreated group.  A basic question is: does this mean the treatment is bad?  With respect to the filter  F  it may mean that, but with respect to another filter  F’ , the treatment might be very effective.

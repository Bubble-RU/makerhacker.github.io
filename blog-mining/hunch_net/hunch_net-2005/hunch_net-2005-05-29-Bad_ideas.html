<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point
of view of an undergraduate. The shift from a class-taking mentality to a
research mentality is very significant and not easy.Problem PosingPosing the
right problem is often as important as solving them. Many people can get by in
research by solving problems others have posed, but that's not sufficient for
really inspiring research. For learning in particular, there is a strong
feeling that we just haven't figured out which questions are the right ones to
ask. You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem
convincing.Gambling your lifeWhen you do research, you think very hard about
new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions. Many
conversations are of the form "I wonder what would happen ifâ€¦" These processes
can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours. The worst part is that
you'll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and
sometimes not even then be</p><p>3 0.10258421 <a title="76-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-18-Necessary_and_Sufficient_Research.html">370 hunch net-2009-09-18-Necessary and Sufficient Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea
how to solve. In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to
decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a
solution to the larger problem. This approach can go wrong in several
ways.Decomposition failure. The solution to the decomposition does not in fact
yield a solution to the overall problem.Artificial hardness. The subproblems
created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are
harder than necessary.As you can see, computational complexity forms a
relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach
sufficient but not necessary.In my experience, the artificial hardness problem
is very common. Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a
problem to work on to other people. This process starts very naturally as a
graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively little idea
about how to do</p><p>4 0.098870426 <a title="76-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-27-Adversarial_Academia.html">333 hunch net-2008-12-27-Adversarial Academia</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One viewpoint on academia is that it is inherently adversarial: there are
finite research dollars, positions, and students to work with, implying a
zero-sum game between different participants. This is not a viewpoint that I
want to promote, as I consider it flawed. However, I know several people
believe strongly in this viewpoint, and I have found it to have substantial
explanatory power.For example:It explains why your paper was rejected based on
poor logic. The reviewer wasn't concerned with research quality, but rather
with rejecting a competitor.It explains why professors rarely work together.
The goal of a non-tenured professor (at least) is to get tenure, and a case
for tenure comes from a portfolio of work that is undisputably yours.It
explains why new research programs are not quickly adopted. Adopting a
competitor's program is impossible, if your career is based on the competitor
being wrong.Different academic groups subscribe to the adversarial viewpoint
in different degrees</p><p>5 0.096442394 <a title="76-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example

<p>Introduction: In the quest to understand what good reviewing is, perhaps it's worthwhile to
think about what good research is. One way to think about good research is in
terms of a producer/consumer model.In the producer/consumer model of research,
for any element of research there are producers (authors and coauthors of
papers, for example) and consumers (people who use the papers to make new
papers or code solving problems). An produced bit of research is judged as
"good" if it is used by many consumers. There are two basic questions which
immediately arise:Is this a good model of research?Are there alternatives?The
producer/consumer model has some difficulties which can be (partially)
addressed.Disconnect.A group of people doing research on some subject may
become disconnected from the rest of the world. Each person uses the research
of other people in the group so it appears good research is being done, but
the group has no impact on the rest of the world. One way to detect this is by
looking at</p><p>4 0.7537021 <a title="76-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT
ResearchandLucenthad one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the
remainder ofBell Labs, triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine
learning group there. As the recession progresses, we may easily see more
firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer
support research.There are a couple positives to the recession as well.Both
the implosion of Wall Street (which siphoned off smart people) and the general
difficulty of getting a job coming out of an undergraduate education suggest

<p>Introduction: I attended theIBM research 60th anniversary. IBM research is, by any
reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the
most value to it's parent company over the long term. This can be seen by
simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab
which has not gone through a period of massive firing. (Note that there are
alsonew research labs.)Despite this impressive record, IBM research has
failed, by far, to achieve it's potential. Examples which came up in this
meeting include:It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented
in the lab. (In fact, Intel produced it first.)Relational databases and SQL
were invented and then languished. It was only under external competition that
IBM released it's own relational database. Why didn't IBM grow anOracle
division?An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing
aCisco division. Why not?And remember Ã¢&euro;Åš IBM research is a stark success story

Berkun (which appeared onslashdot)In my experience, bad ideas are
commonandover confidence in ideas is common. This overconfidence can take
either the form of excessive condemnation or excessive praise. Some of this is
necessary to the process of research. For example, some overconfidence in the
value of your own research is expected and probably necessary to motivate your
own investigation. Since research is a rather risky business, much of it does
not pan out. Learning to accept when something does not pan out is a critical
skill which is sometimes never acquired.Excessive condemnation can be a real
ill when it's encountered. This has two effects:When the penalty for being
wrong is too large, it means people have a great investment in defending

Yaser taught me machine learning, and I always found the lectures clear and
interesting, so I expect many people can benefit from watching. Relative
toAndrew Ng'sML classthere are somewhat different areas of emphasis but the
topic is the same, so picking and choosing the union may be helpful.</p><p>4 0.64506173 <a title="76-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-26-Fallback_Analysis_is_a_Secret_to_Useful_Algorithms.html">126 hunch net-2005-10-26-Fallback Analysis is a Secret to Useful Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The ideal of theoretical algorithm analysis is to construct an algorithm with
accompanying optimality theorems proving that it is a useful algorithm. This
ideal often fails, particularly for learning algorithms and theory. The
general form of a theorem is:IfpreconditionsThenpostconditionsWhen we design
learning algorithms it is very common to come up with precondition assumptions
such as "the data is IID", "the learning problem is drawn from a known
distribution over learning problems", or "there is a perfect classifier". All
of these example preconditions can be false for real-world problems in ways
that are not easily detectable. This means that algorithms derived and
justified by these very common forms of analysis may be prone to catastrophic
failure in routine (mis)application.Wecanhope for better. Several different
kinds of learning algorithm analysis have been developed some of which have
fewer preconditions. Simply demanding that these forms of analysis be used may
be too stron</p><p>5 0.56873542 <a title="76-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-26-The_SODA_Program_Committee.html">318 hunch net-2008-09-26-The SODA Program Committee</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Claireasked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite
a bit of work.I had a relatively light load--merely 49 theory papers. Many of
these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common
for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help
review the papers. I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally. There were a
couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed
off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.There are some
differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and
theory communities. In machine learning it is expected that a review be
detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case. Every
paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very
detailed.I'm sure not every author was happy with the outcome. While we did
our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make. For
example, if there is a</p><p>6 0.46529362 <a title="76-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

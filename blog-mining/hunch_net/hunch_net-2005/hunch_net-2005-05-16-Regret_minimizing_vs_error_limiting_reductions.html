reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there
arekpossible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2
possible labels. On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary
classifier with some error ratee. After subtracting the minimum possible

<p>Introduction: Forlearning reductionswe have been concentrating on reducing various complex
learning problems to binary classification. This choice needs to be actively
questioned, because it was not carefully considered.Binary clasification is
learning a classifierc:X -> {0,1}so as to minimize the probability of being
wrong,Prx,y~D(c(x)y).The primary alternative candidate seems to be squared
error regression. In squared error regression, you learn a regressors:X ->
[0,1]so as to minimize squared error,Ex,y~D(s(x)-y)2.It is difficult to judge
one primitive against another. The judgement must at least partially be made
on nontheoretical grounds because (essentially) we are evaluating a choice
between two axioms/assumptions.These two primitives are significantly related.
Classification can be reduced to regression in the obvious way: you use the
regressor to predictD(y=1|x), then threshold at0.5. For this simple reduction
a squared error regret ofrimplies a classification regret of at mostr0.5.

<p>Introduction: This post is about a reductions-related problem that I find mysterious. There
are two kinds of reductions analysis currently under consideration.Error
limiting reductions. Here, the goal is to bound the error rate of the created
classifier in terms of the error rate of the binary classifiers that you
reduce to. A very simple example of this is thaterror correcting output
codeswhere it is possible to prove that for certain codes, the multiclass
error rate is at most 4 * the binary classifier error rate.Regret minimizing
reductions. Here, the goal is to bound theregretof the created classifier in
terms of theregretof the binary classifiers reduced to. The regret is the
error rate minus the minimum error rate. When the learning problem is noisy
the minimum error rate may not be0. An analagous result for reget is that for
aprobabilistic error correcting output code, multiclass regret is at most 4 *
(binary regret)0.5.The use of "regret" is more desirable than the use of error
rates, becaus</p><p>2 0.93701583 <a title="72-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-21-Netflix_finishes_%28and_starts%29.html">371 hunch net-2009-09-21-Netflix finishes (and starts)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I attended theNetflix prizeceremony this morning. The press conference part
iscovered fine elsewhere, with the basic outcome being thatBellKor's Pragmatic
Chaoswon overThe Ensembleby 15-20minutes, because they were tied in
performance on the ultimate holdout set. I'm sure the individual participants
will have many chances to speak about the solution. One of these is Bell at
theNYAS ML symposium on Nov. 6.Several additional details may interest ML
people.The degree of overfitting exhibited by the difference in performance on
theleaderboard test setand the ultimate hold out set was small, but
determining at .02 to .03%.A tie was possible, because the rules cut off
measurements below the fourth digit based on significance concerns. In
actuality, of course, the scores do differ before rounding, but everyone I
spoke to claimed not to know how. The complete dataset has beenreleased on
UCI, so each team could compute their own score to whatever accuracy desired.I

<p>Introduction: Yann LeCunand I are coteaching a class onLarge Scale Machine Learningstarting
late Januaryat NYU. This class will cover many tricks to get machine learning
working well on datasets with many features, examples, and classes, along with
several elements of deep learning and support systems enabling the
previous.This is not a beginning class--you really need to have taken a basic
machine learning class previously to follow along. Students will be able to
run and experiment with large scale learning algorithms sinceYahoo!has donated
servers which are being configured into a small scaleHadoopcluster. We are
planning to cover the frontier of research in scalable learning algorithms, so
good class projects could easily lead to papers.For me, this is a chance to
teach on many topics of past research. In general, it seems like researchers
should engage in at least occasional teaching of research, both as a proof of
teachability and to see their own research through that lens. More generally,

<p>Introduction: Several strong graduates are on the job market this year.Alekh Agarwalmade
themost scalable public learning algorithmas an intern two years ago. He has a
deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning as well as the
ability and will to make things happen programming-wise. I've been privileged
to have Alekh visiting me in NY where he will be sorely missed.John
DuchicreatedAdagradwhich is a commonly helpful improvement over online
gradient descent that is seeing wide adoption, including inVowpal Wabbit. He
has a similarly deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning with
significant industry experience atGoogle. Alekh and John have often coauthored
together.Stephane Rossvisited me a year ago over the summer, implementing many
new algorithms and working out the firstscale free online update rulewhich is
now the default in Vowpal Wabbit. Stephane isnoton the market--Google robbed
the cradle successfullyI'm sure that he will do great things.Anna

<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple. Viewed
representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear
separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or
perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural
networks or kernelized SVMs). Should we go beyond this, and start using "deep"
representations?What is deep learning?Intuitively, deep learning is about
learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the
input (observed) features.Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be
rather difficult. Consider the following cases:SVM with Gaussian Kernel. This
is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can't
succinctly represent certain decision surfaces. One ofYann LeCun's examples is
recognizing objects based on pixel values. An SVM will need a new support
vector for each significantly different background. Since the number of
distinct backgrounds i</p><p>6 0.90615118 <a title="72-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-20-Context_and_the_calculation_misperception.html">218 hunch net-2006-11-20-Context and the calculation misperception</a></p>

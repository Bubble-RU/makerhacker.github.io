<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>3 0.24869418 <a title="46-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-22-Create_Your_Own_ICML_Workshop.html">234 hunch net-2007-02-22-Create Your Own ICML Workshop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As usualICML 2007will be hosting aworkshop programto be held this year on June
24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you
propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I'd like
to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal
deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for
details.Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group
of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your
choosing. I've always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so
large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a
workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to
potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-
conference on a particular ML sub-area. Hope to see some interesting proposals
rolling in.</p><p>4 0.21828006 <a title="46-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-23-Why_Workshop%3F.html">285 hunch net-2008-01-23-Why Workshop?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I second thecall for workshops at ICML/COLT/UAI.Severaltimesbefore, details of
why and how to run a workshop have been mentioned.There is a simple reason to
prefer workshops here: attendance. The Helsinki colocation has placed
workshopsdirectly between ICML and COLT/UAI, which is optimal for getting
attendees from any conference. In addition,last year ICML had relatively few
workshopsand NIPS workshops were overloaded. In addition tothose that
happeneda similar number were rejected. The overload has strange consequences
--for example,the best attended workshopwasn't an official NIPS workshop.
Aside from intrinsic interest, the Deep Learning workshop benefited greatly
from being off schedule.</p><p>5 0.21588027 <a title="46-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-14-NIPS.html">71 hunch net-2005-05-14-NIPS</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For most people, a mathematical notation is like a language: you learn it and
stick with it. For people doing mathematical research, however, this is not
enough: they must design new notations for new problems. The design of good
notation is both hard and worthwhile since a bad initial notation can retard a
line of research greatly.Before we had mathematical notation, equations were
all written out in language. Since words have multiple meanings and variable
precedences, long equations written out in language can be extraordinarily
difficult and sometimes fundamentally ambiguous. A good representative example
of this is the legalese in the tax code. Since we want greater precision and
clarity, we adopt mathematical notation.One fundamental thing to understand
about mathematical notation, is that humans as logic verifiers, are barely
capable. This is the fundamental reason why one notation can be much better
than another. This observation is easier to miss than you might expect
because,</p><p>3 0.72043562 <a title="46-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-26-A_Variance_only_Deviation_Bound.html">392 hunch net-2010-03-26-A Variance only Deviation Bound</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At thePAC-Bayesworkshop earlier this week,Olivier Catonidescribed a result
that I hadn't believed was possible:a deviation bound dependingonlyon the
variance of a random variable.For people not familiar with deviation bounds,
this may be hard to appreciate. Deviation bounds, are one of the core
components for the foundations of machine learning theory, so developments
here have a potential to alter our understanding of how to learn and what is
learnable. My understanding is that the basic proof techniques started
withBernsteinand have evolved into several variants specialized for various
applications. All of the variants I knew had a dependence on the range, with
some also having a dependence on the variance of an IID or martingale random
variable. This one is the first I know of with a dependence on only the
variance.The basic idea is to use a biased estimator of the mean which is not
influenced much by outliers. Then, a deviation bound can be proved by using
the exponential moment me</p><p>4 0.63883191 <a title="46-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-07-Is_the_Google_way_the_way_for_machine_learning%3F.html">136 hunch net-2005-12-07-Is the Google way the way for machine learning?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Urs HoelzlefromGooglegave an invited presentation atNIPS. In the presentation,
he strongly advocates interacting with data in a particular scalable manner
which is something like the following:Make a cluster of machines.Build a
unified filesystem. (Google uses GFS, but NFS or other approaches work
reasonably well for smaller clusters.)Interact with data viaMapReduce.Creating
a cluster of machines is, by this point, relatively straightforward.Unified
filesystems are a little bit tricky--GFS is capable by design of essentially
unlimited speed throughput to disk. NFS can bottleneck because all of the data
has to move through one machine. Nevertheless, this may not be a limiting
factor for smaller clusters.MapReduce is a programming paradigm. Essentially,
it is a combination of a data element transform (map) and an
agreggator/selector (reduce). These operations are highly parallelizable and
the claim is that they support the forms of data interaction which are
necessary.Apparently, theNutc</p><p>5 0.5975222 <a title="46-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-07-KDD_and_MUCMD_2011.html">444 hunch net-2011-09-07-KDD and MUCMD 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: AtKDDI enjoyedStephen Boyd's invited talk about optimization quite a bit.
However, the most interesting talk for me wasDavid Haussler's. His talk
started out with a formidable load of biological complexity. About half-way
through you start wondering, "can this be used to help with cancer?" And at
the end he connects it directly to use with a call to arms for the audience:
cure cancer. The core thesis here is that cancer is a complex set of diseases
which can be distentangled via genetic assays, allowing attacking the specific
signature of individual cancers. However, the data quantity and complex
dependencies within the data require systematic and relatively automatic
prediction and analysis algorithms of the kind that we are best familiar
with.Some of the papers which interested me are:Kai-Wei ChangandDan
Roth,Selective Block Minimization for Faster Convergence of Limited Memory
Large-Scale Linear Models, which is about effectively using a hard-example
cache to speedup learning.Leland</p><p>6 0.59575707 <a title="46-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-22-Exemplar_programming.html">215 hunch net-2006-10-22-Exemplar programming</a></p>

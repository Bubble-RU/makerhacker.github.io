<p>Introduction: I second the  call for workshops at ICML/COLT/UAI .
 
 Several   times   before , details of why and how to run a  workshop have been mentioned.  
 
There is a simple reason to prefer workshops here: attendance.  The Helsinki colocation has placed workshops  directly between ICML and COLT/UAI , which is optimal for getting attendees from any conference.  In addition,  last year ICML had relatively few workshops  and NIPS workshops were overloaded.  In addition to  those that happened  a similar number were rejected.  The overload has strange consequences—for example,  the best attended workshop  wasn’t an official NIPS workshop.  Aside from intrinsic interest, the Deep Learning workshop benefited greatly from being off schedule.</p><p>3 0.33994627 <a title="46-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-23-ICML_2009_Workshops_%28and_Tutorials%29.html">379 hunch net-2009-11-23-ICML 2009 Workshops (and Tutorials)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m the  workshops chair  for  ICML  this year.  As such, I would like to personally encourage people to consider running a workshop.
 
My general view of workshops is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research directions—some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various problems.  My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops often come off much better than expected in the end.  Submissions are due January 18, two weeks before papers.
 
Similarly,  Ben Taskar  is looking for good  tutorials , which is complementary.  Workshops are about exploring a subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught essence, a vital part of the research process.  Tutorials are due February 13, two weeks after papers.</p><p>4 0.33215186 <a title="46-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult.  As a conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good papers—enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to (generally) to grow the conference.  For someone choosing to participate in a new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work out?  Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you are sure will work?
 
The conference founding problem is a joint agreement problem with a very significant barrier.  Workshops are a way around this problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective means for this.  A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available.  Presenting work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a confe</p><p>5 0.2887539 <a title="46-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-02-2006_NIPS_workshops.html">216 hunch net-2006-11-02-2006 NIPS workshops</a></p>

 Paper due date: June 3rd. (Tweaked thanks to  Fei Sha .) 
 Location: Vancouver (main program) Dec. 5-8 and Whistler (workshops) Dec 9-10, BC, Canada

<p>Introduction: Attendance at the  NIPS workshops  is highly recommended for both research and learning.   Unfortunately, there does not yet appear to be a public list of workshops. However, I found the following workshop webpages of interest:
  
  Machine Learning in Finance  
  Learning to Rank  
  Foundations of Active Learning  
  Machine Learning Based Robotics in Unstructured Environments  
  
There are  many  more workshops.  In fact, there are so many that it is not plausible anyone can attend every workshop they are interested in.  Maybe in future years the organizers can spread them out over more days to reduce overlap. 
 
Many of these workshops are accepting presentation proposals (due mid-October).</p><p>6 0.808842 <a title="46-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-02-2006_NIPS_workshops.html">216 hunch net-2006-11-02-2006 NIPS workshops</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.  This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.  Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention.  Roughly speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your interest.  The main conference program consists of elements related to someoneâ&euro;&trade;s interest (which is rarely your own).  Workshops are more about doing research while conferences are more about presenting research.  
 
Several conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due shortly.
  
 
  ICML workshops  
 Due April 1 
 
 
  IJCAI workshops  
 Deadlines Vary 
 
 
 KDD workshops 
 Not yet finalized 
 
  
Anyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops and see if any are of interest.  (If none are, then maybe you should organize one next year.)</p><p>2 0.85450202 <a title="46-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-29-ICML_survey_and_comments.html">468 hunch net-2012-06-29-ICML survey and comments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attending  ICML , except for  Dora  who arrived on Monday.  Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is going well.
 
For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like everyone),  Mark Reid  has setup the  ICML discussion  site where you can comment on any paper or subscribe to papers.  Authors are automatically subscribed to their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly after the fact, as people desire.
 
We also conducted a survey before the conference and have the  survey results  now.  This can be compared with the  ICML 2010 survey results .  Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4 being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and 2010.

<p>Introduction: To commemorate the  Twenty Fourth Annual International Conference on Machine  Learning  (ICML-07), the FOX Network has decided to  launch a new spin-off series in prime time.  Through unofficial  sources, I have obtained the  story arc  for the first season, which appears frighteningly realistic.</p><p>4 0.69938499 <a title="46-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-26-The_SODA_Program_Committee.html">318 hunch net-2008-09-26-The SODA Program Committee</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Claire  asked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite a bit of work.
 
I had a relatively light load—merely 49 theory papers.  Many of these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help review the papers.  I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally.  There were a couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.
 
There are some differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and theory communities.  In machine learning it is expected that a review be detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case.  Every paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very detailed.  
 
I’m sure not every author was happy with the outcome.  While we did our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make.  For exam</p><p>5 0.66884363 <a title="46-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-28-Somebody%26%238217%3Bs_Eating_Your_Lunch.html">445 hunch net-2011-09-28-Somebody&#8217;s Eating Your Lunch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since we last discussed  the other online learning ,  Stanford  has very visibly started pushing mass teaching in  AI ,  Machine Learning , and  Databases .  In retrospect, it’s not too surprising that the next step up in serious online teaching experiments are occurring at the computer science department of a university embedded in the land of startups.  Numbers on the order of  100000  are quite significant—similar in scale to the number of  computer science undergraduate students/year  in the US.  Although these populations surely differ, the fact that they  could  overlap is worth considering for the future.  
 
It’s too soon to say how successful these classes will be and there are many easy criticisms to make:
  
  Registration != Learning   … but if only 1/10th complete these classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of any traditional process. 
  1st year excitement != nth year routine  … but if only 1/10th take future classes, the scale of teaching still surpass</p><p>6 0.63809109 <a title="46-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-26-Compassionate_Reviewing.html">395 hunch net-2010-04-26-Compassionate Reviewing</a></p>

instance, if you're building a speech recognizer, it's easy enough to get raw
speech samples -- just walk around with a microphone -- but labeling even one
of these samples is a tedious process in which a human must examine the speech
signal and carefully segment it into phonemes. In the field of active
learning, the goal is as usual to construct an accurate classifier, but the
labels of the data points are initially hidden and there is a charge for each
label you want revealed. The hope is that by intelligent adaptive querying,
you can get away with significantly fewer labels than you would need in a
regular supervised learning framework.Here's an example. Suppose the data lie
on the real line, and the classifiers are simple thresholding functions, H =
{hw}:hw(x) = 1 if x > w, and 0 otherwise.VC theory tells us that if the
underlying distribution P can be classified perfectly by some hypothesis in H

<p>Introduction: Exploration is one of the big unsolved problems in machine learning. This
isn't for lack of trying--there are many models of exploration which have been
analyzed in many different ways by many different groups of people. At some
point, it is worthwhile to sit back and see what has been done across these
many models.Reinforcement Learning(1). Reinforcement learning has
traditionally focused on Markov Decision Processes where the next states'is
given by a conditional distributionP(s'|s,a)given the current statesand
actiona. The typical result here is that certain specific algorithms
controlling an agent can behave withineof optimal for horizonTexcept
forpoly(1/e,T,S,A)"wasted" experiences (with high probability). This started

assumptions, we can prove more", for exampleFactored-E3andMetric-E3. (It turns

<p>Introduction: Here are a few of the papers I enjoyed at ICML.Steffen Bickel, Michael
BrÃƒÂ¼eckner,Tobias Scheffer,Discriminative Learning for Differing Training
and Test DistributionsThere is a nice trick in this paper: they predict the
probability that an unlabeled sample is in the training set vs. the test set,
and then use this prediction to importance weight labeled samples in the
training set. This paper uses a specific parametric model, but the approach is
easily generalized.Steve HannekeA Bound on the Label Complexity of Agnostic
Active LearningThis paper bounds the number of labels required by the
A2algorithm for active learning in the agnostic case. Last year we figured out
agnostic active learning was possible. This year, it's quantified. Hopefull
soon, it will be practical.Sylvian Gelly,David SilverCombining Online and

<p>Introduction: Here are a few papers fromCOLT 2008that I found interesting.Maria-Florina
Balcan,Steve Hanneke, andJenn Wortman,The True Sample Complexity of Active
Learning. This paper shows that in an asymptotic setting, active learning
isalwaysbetter than supervised learning (although the gap may be small). This
is evidence that the only thing in the way of universal active learning is us
knowing how to do it properly.Nir AilonandMehryar Mohri,An Efficient Reduction
of Ranking to Classification. This paper shows how to robustly ranknobjects
withn log(n)classifications using a quicksort based algorithm. The result is
applicable to many ranking loss functions and has implications for
others.Michael KearnsandJennifer Wortman.Learning from Collective Behavior.
This is about learning in a new model, where the goal is to predict how a
collection of interacting agents behave. One claim is that learning in this
setting can be reduced to IID learning.Due to the relation withMetric-E3, I

<p>Introduction: A little over 4 years ago,Sanjoymade a postsaying roughly "we should study
active learning theoretically, because not much is understood".At the time, we
did not understand basic things such as whether or not it was possible to PAC-
learn with an active algorithm without making strong assumptions about the
noise rate. In other words, the fundamental question was "can we do it?"The
nature of the question has fundamentally changed in my mind. The answer is to
the previous question is "yes", both information theoretically and
computationally, most places where supervised learning could be applied.In
many situation, the question has now changed to: "is it worth it?" Is the
programming and computational overhead low enough to make the label cost
savings of active learning worthwhile? Currently, there are situations where
this question could go either way. Much of the challenge for the future is in
figuring out how to make active learning easier or more worthwhile.At

<p>Introduction: Andrej Bauer has setup aMathematics and ComputationBlog. As a first step he
has tried to address the persistent and annoying problem of math on the web.
As a basic tool for precisely stating and transfering understanding of
technical subjects, mathematics is very necessary. Despite this necessity,
every mechanism for expressing mathematics on the web seems unnaturally
clumsy. Here are some of the methods and their drawbacks:MathMLThis was
supposed to be the answer, but it has two severe drawbacks: "Internet
Explorer" doesn't read it and the language is an example of push-XML-to-the-
limit which no one would ever consider writing in. (In contrast, html is easy
to write in.) It's also very annoying that math fonts must be installed
independent of the browser, even for mozilla based browsers.Create inline
images. This has several big drawbacks: font size is fixed for all viewers,
you can't cut & paste inside the images, and you can't hyperlink from (say)
symbol to definition.Math Worldis</p><p>2 0.9744761 <a title="45-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-14-More_NIPS_Papers_II.html">140 hunch net-2005-12-14-More NIPS Papers II</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I thought this was a very good NIPS with many excellent papers. The following
are a few NIPS papers which I liked and I hope to study more carefully when I
get the chance. The list is not exhaustive and in no particular
order…Preconditioner Approximations for Probabilistic Graphical
Models.Pradeeep Ravikumar and John Lafferty.I thought the use of
preconditioner methods from solving linear systems in the context of
approximate inference was novel and interesting. The results look good and I'd
like to understand the limitations.Rodeo: Sparse nonparametric regression in
high dimensions.John Lafferty and Larry Wasserman.A very interesting approach
to feature selection in nonparametric regression from a frequentist framework.
The use of lengthscale variables in each dimension reminds me a lot of
'Automatic Relevance Determination' in Gaussian process regression -- it would
be interesting to compare Rodeo to ARD in GPs.Interpolating between types and

<p>Introduction: Compressed Sensing(CS) is a new framework developed byEmmanuel Candes,Terry
TaoandDavid Donoho. To summarize, if you acquire a signal in some basis that
is incoherent with the basis in which you know the signal to be sparse in, it
is very likely you will be able to reconstruct the signal from these
incoherent projections.Terry Tao, the recentFields medalist, does a very nice
job at explaining the frameworkhere. He goes further in the theory description
in thispostwhere he mentions the central issue of the Uniform Uncertainty
Principle. It so happens that random projections are on average incoherent,
within the UUP meaning, with most known basis (sines, polynomials, splines,
wavelets, curvelets …) and are therefore an ideal basis for Compressed
Sensing. [ For more in-depth information on the subject, the Rice group has
done a very good job at providing a central library of papers relevant to the
growing subject:http://www.dsp.ece.rice.edu/cs/]The Machine Learning community

<p>Introduction: Often, unlabeled data is easy to come by but labels are expensive. For
instance, if you're building a speech recognizer, it's easy enough to get raw
speech samples -- just walk around with a microphone -- but labeling even one
of these samples is a tedious process in which a human must examine the speech
signal and carefully segment it into phonemes. In the field of active
learning, the goal is as usual to construct an accurate classifier, but the
labels of the data points are initially hidden and there is a charge for each
label you want revealed. The hope is that by intelligent adaptive querying,
you can get away with significantly fewer labels than you would need in a
regular supervised learning framework.Here's an example. Suppose the data lie
on the real line, and the classifiers are simple thresholding functions, H =
{hw}:hw(x) = 1 if x > w, and 0 otherwise.VC theory tells us that if the
underlying distribution P can be classified perfectly by some hypothesis in H

<p>Introduction: "Search" is the other branch of AI research which has been succesful. Concrete
examples includeDeep Bluewhich beat the world chess champion andChinookthe
champion checkers program. A set of core search techniques exist including A*,
alpha-beta pruning, and others that can be applied to any of many different
search problems.Given this, it may be surprising to learn that there has been
relatively little succesful work on combining prediction and search. Given
also that humans typically solve search problems using a number of predictive
heuristics to narrow in on a solution, we might be surprised again. However,
the big successful search-based systems have typically not used "smart" search
algorithms. Insteady they have optimized for very fast search. This is not for
lack of tryingâ&euro;Ś many people have tried to synthesize search and prediction to
various degrees of success. For example,Knightcapachieves good-but-not-stellar
chess playing performance, andTD-gammonhas achieved near-optimal Bac</p><p>6 0.85923833 <a title="45-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-03-19-The_Ideal_Large_Scale_Learning_Class.html">426 hunch net-2011-03-19-The Ideal Large Scale Learning Class</a></p>

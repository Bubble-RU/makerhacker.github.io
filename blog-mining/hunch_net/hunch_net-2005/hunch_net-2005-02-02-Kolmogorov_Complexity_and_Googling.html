<p>Introduction: "Search" is the other branch of AI research which has been succesful. Concrete
examples includeDeep Bluewhich beat the world chess champion andChinookthe
champion checkers program. A set of core search techniques exist including A*,
alpha-beta pruning, and others that can be applied to any of many different
search problems.Given this, it may be surprising to learn that there has been
relatively little succesful work on combining prediction and search. Given
also that humans typically solve search problems using a number of predictive
heuristics to narrow in on a solution, we might be surprised again. However,
the big successful search-based systems have typically not used "smart" search
algorithms. Insteady they have optimized for very fast search. This is not for
lack of tryingâ&euro;Ś many people have tried to synthesize search and prediction to
various degrees of success. For example,Knightcapachieves good-but-not-stellar

<p>Introduction: Carnegie MellonSchool of Computer Sciencehas the first academicMachine
Learning department. This department already existed as theCenter for
Automated Learning and Discovery, but recently changed it's name.The reason
for changing the name is obvious: very few people think of themselves as
"Automated Learner and Discoverers", but there are number of people who think
of themselves as "Machine Learners". Machine learning is both more succinct
and recognizable--good properties for a name.A more interesting question is
"Should there be a Machine Learning Department?".Tom Mitchellhas a
relevantwhitepaperclaiming that machine learning is answering a different
question than other fields or departments. The fundamental debate here is "Is
machine learning different from statistics?"At a cultural level, there is no
real debate: they are different. Machine learning is characterized by several
very active large peer reviewed conferences, operating in a computer science
mode. Statistics tends to fun</p><p>5 0.095586658 <a title="10-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-17-New_Machine_Learning_mailing_list.html">278 hunch net-2007-12-17-New Machine Learning mailing list</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and
then trying to figure out how to get there.A big part of science fiction is
imagining how things could be different, and then working through the
implications.Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can
sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research. (And, hey, it's
fun.) Here's some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem
particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning
systems:Vernor Vinge, "True Names", "A Fire Upon the Deep"Marc Stiegler,
"David's Sling", "Earthweb"Charles Stross, "Singularity Sky"Greg Egan,
"Diaspora"Joe Haldeman, "Forever Peace"(There are surely many
others.)Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.
Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans
control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series). That didn't really happen in the
last 50 years. Instead, we gradually refined the degree to whi</p><p>3 0.48689219 <a title="10-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-05-25-Inappropriate_Mathematics_for_Machine_Learning.html">302 hunch net-2008-05-25-Inappropriate Mathematics for Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Reviewers and students are sometimes greatly concerned by the distinction
between:Anopen setand aclosed set.ASupremumand aMaximum.An event which happens
with probability 1 and an event that always happens.I don't appreciate this
distinction in machine learning & learning theory. All machine learning takes
place (by definition) on a machine where every parameter has finite precision.
Consequently, every set is closed, a maximal element always exists, and
probability 1 events always happen.The fundamental issue here is that
substantial parts of mathematics don't appear well-matched to computation in
the physical world, because the mathematics has concerns which are unphysical.
This mismatched mathematics makes irrelevant distinctions. We can ask "what
mathematics is appropriate to computation?"Andrejhas convinced me that a
pretty good answer to this question isconstructive mathematics.So, here's a
basic challenge: Can anyone name a situation where any of the distinctions
above (or simila</p><p>4 0.46142679 <a title="10-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-08-Big_machine_learning.html">178 hunch net-2006-05-08-Big machine learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: According to theNew York Times,Yahoo is releasing Project Panama shortly.
Project Panama is about better predicting which advertisements are relevant to
a search, implying a higher click through rate, implying larger income
forYahoo. There are two things that seem interesting here:A significant
portion of that improved accuracy is almost certainly machine learning at
work.The quantitative effect is huge--the estimate in the article is
$600*106.Googlealready has such improvements andMicrosoft Searchis surely
working on them, which suggest this is (perhaps) a $109per year machine
learning problem.The exact methodology under use is unlikely to be publicly
discussed in the near future because of the competitive enivironment.
Hopefully we'll have some public "war stories" at some point in the future
when this information becomes less sensitive. For now, it's reassuring to
simply note that machine learning is having a big impact.</p><p>5 0.44371614 <a title="10-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-20-Machine_Learning_in_the_News.html">125 hunch net-2005-10-20-Machine Learning in the News</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The New York Times had ashort interviewabout machine learning in datamining
being used pervasively by the IRS and large corporations to predict who to
audit and who to target for various marketing campaigns. This is a big
application area of machine learning. It can be harmful (learning + databases
= another way to invade privacy) or beneficial (as google demonstrates, better
targeting of marketing campaigns is far less annoying). This is yet more
evidence that we can not rely upon "I'm just another fish in the school" logic
for our expectations about treatment by government and large corporations.</p><p>6 0.44281143 <a title="10-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-10-Is_the_Goal_Understanding_or_Prediction%3F.html">55 hunch net-2005-04-10-Is the Goal Understanding or Prediction?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For theChicago 2005 machine learning summer schoolwe are organizing, at least
5 international students can not come due to visa issues. There seem to be two
aspects to visa issues:Inefficiency. The system rejected the student simply by
being incapable of evenstartingto evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of
time.Politics. Border controls became much tighter after the September 11
attack. Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will
do that.What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem
than (2). Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa
rejection. Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time
almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry
even people concerned with (2). The obvious fixes to overload are "spend more
money" and "make the system more efficient".With respect to (2), (which is a
more minor issue by the numbers) it is unclear that the political calc</p><p>5 0.74314225 <a title="10-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-19-Why_I_decided_to_run_a_weblog..html">1 hunch net-2005-01-19-Why I decided to run a weblog.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have decided to run a weblog on machine learning and learning theory
research. Here are some reasons:1) Weblogs enable new functionality:Public
comment on papers. No mechanism for this exists at conferences and most
journals. I have encountered it once for asciencepaper. Some communities have
mailing lists supporting this, but not machine learning or learning theory. I
have often read papers and found myself wishing there was some method to
consider other's questions and read the replies.Conference shortlists. One of
the most common conversations at a conference is "what did you find
interesting?" There is no explicit mechanism for sharing this information at
conferences, and it's easy to imagine that it would be handy to do
so.Evaluation and comment on research directions. Papers are almost

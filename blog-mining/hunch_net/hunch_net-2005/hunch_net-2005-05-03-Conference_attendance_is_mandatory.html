The big winner this year is Europe.   This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.  With  cuts to basic science  in the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside the US become more attractive.   Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english in place.  China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>3 0.23962089 <a title="66-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-26-Summer_Schools.html">4 hunch net-2005-01-26-Summer Schools</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are several summer schools related to machine learning.
 
We are running a two week  machine learning summer school  in Chicago, USA May 16-27.  
 
IPAM is running a more focused three week summer school on  Intelligent Extraction of Information from Graphs and High Dimensional Data  in Los Angeles, USA July 11-29.
 
A broad one-week school on  analysis of patterns  will be held in Erice, Italy, Oct. 28-Nov 6.</p><p>4 0.22511244 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-01-16-2011_Summer_Conference_Deadline_Season.html">422 hunch net-2011-01-16-2011 Summer Conference Deadline Season</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For anyone planning to do research, conference attendance is virtually mandatory for success.  Aside from exposing yourself to a large collection of different ideas, many interesting conversations leading to new research happen at conferences.  If you are a student, you should plan to go to at least one summer conference.  Your advisor should cover the costs.

Reviewer targeting is new this year.  The idea is that many poor decisions happen because the papers go to reviewers who are unqualified, and the hope is that allowing authors to point out who is qualified results in better decisions.  In my experience, this is a reasonable idea to test.
 
Both UAI and COLT are experimenting this year as well with double blind and author feedback, respectively.  Of the two, I believe author feedback is more important, as Iâve seen it make a difference.  However, I still consider double blind reviewing a net wi</p><p>3 0.44401211 <a title="66-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-10-Conferences%2C_Dates%2C_Locations.html">17 hunch net-2005-02-10-Conferences, Dates, Locations</a></p>

The big winner this year is Europe.   This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.  With  cuts to basic science  in the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside the US become more attractive.   Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english in place.  China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>4 0.43897915 <a title="66-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-19-Deadline_Season%2C_2010.html">387 hunch net-2010-01-19-Deadline Season, 2010</a></p>

ICML continues to experiment with the reviewing process, although perhaps less so than last year.  
 
The S âsort-ofâ for COLT is because author feedback occurs only after decisions are made.  
 
KDD is notable for being the most comprehensive in terms of {Tutorials, Workshops, Challenges, Panels, Papers (two tracks), Demos}.  The S for KDD is because there is sometimes author feedback at the decision of the SPC.

<p>Introduction: Suppose we had an infinitely powerful mathematician sitting in a room and proving theorems about learning.  Could he solve machine learning?
 
The answer is ânoâ.   This answer is both obvious and sometimes underappreciated.   
 
There are several ways to conclude that some  bias  is necessary in order to succesfully learn.  For example, suppose we are trying to solve classification.  At prediction time, we observe some features  X  and want to make a prediction of either  0  or  1 .   Bias is what makes us prefer one answer over the other based on past experience.  In order to learn we must:
  
 Have a bias.  Always predicting  0  is as likely as  1  is useless. 
 Have the ârightâ bias.  Predicting  1  when the answer is  0  is also not helpful. 
  
The implication of âhave a biasâ is that we can not design effective learning algorithms with âa uniform prior over all possibilitiesâ.  The implication of âhave the ârightâ biasâ is that our mathematician fails since ârightâ is defined wi</p><p>6 0.43812346 <a title="66-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-29-Deadline_Season.html">145 hunch net-2005-12-29-Deadline Season</a></p>

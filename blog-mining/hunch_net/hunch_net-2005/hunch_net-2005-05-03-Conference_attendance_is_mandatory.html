this year is Europe. This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the
general internationalization of science over the last few years. Withcuts to
basic sciencein the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside
the US become more attractive. Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the
immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english
in place. China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>3 0.14934933 <a title="66-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-27-Conferences%2C_Workshops%2C_and_Tutorials.html">174 hunch net-2006-04-27-Conferences, Workshops, and Tutorials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are
coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.It's entirely reasonable for
anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don't have a paper. For
students, visiting a conference is almost a 'must'--there is no where else
that a broad cross-section of research is on display.Workshops are also a very
good idea.ICML has 11,KDD has 9, andAAAI has 19. Workshops provide an
opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research. They
are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research
because they are so interactive.Tutorials are a good way to gain some
understanding of a long-standing direction of research. They are generally
more coherent than workshops.ICML has 7andAAAI has 15.</p><p>4 0.12627183 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-17-A_Short_Guide_to_PhD_Graduate_Study.html">73 hunch net-2005-05-17-A Short Guide to PhD Graduate Study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Graduate study is a mysterious and uncertain process. This easiest way to see
this is by noting that a very old advisor/student mechanism is preferred.
There is no known succesful mechanism for "mass producing" PhDs as is done (in
some sense) for undergraduate and masters study. Here are a few hints that
might be useful to prospective or current students based on my own
experience.Masters or PhD(a) You want a PhD if you want to do research. (b)
You want a masters if you want to make money. People wanting (b) will be
manifestly unhappy with (a) because it typically means years of low pay.
People wanting (a) should try to avoid (b) because it prolongs an already long
process.Attitude.Manystudents struggle for awhile with the wrong attitude
towards research. Most students come into graduate school with 16-19 years of
schooling where the principle means of success is proving that you know
something via assignments, tests, etcâ&euro;Ś Research doesnotwork this way. Research
is what a PhD is about.</p><p>5 0.10757435 <a title="66-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-29-To_Vidoelecture_or_not.html">416 hunch net-2010-10-29-To Vidoelecture or not</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (update:cross-postedonCACM)For the first time in several years,ICML 2010did
not havevideolecturesattending. Luckily, thetutorial on exploration and
learningwhichAlinaand I put together canbe viewed, since we also presented
atKDD 2010, which included videolecture support.ICML didn't cover the cost of
a videolecture, becausePASCALdidn't provide a grant for it this year. On the
other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs. The cost of
videolectures isn't cheap. Fora workshopthe baseline quote we have is 270 euro
per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman's travel and accomodation.
This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle
the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a
quoted 216 euro per hour.Youtubeis the most predominant free video site with a
cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.15 minute upload
limitsdo not match typical talk lengths. Videolectures also have side-by-side

<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and
giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.As a researcher, I am
most thankful for my education, without which I could not function. I want to
share this, because it provides some sense of how a researcher starts.My long
term memory seems to function particularly well, which makes any education I
get is particularly useful.I am naturally obsessive, which makes me chase down
details until I fully understand things. Natural obsessiveness can go wrong,
of course, but it's a great ally when you absolutely must get things right.My
childhood was all in one hometown, which was a conscious sacrifice on the part
of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated. I'm not
sure how important this was since travel has it's own benefits, but it bears
thought.I had several great teachers in grade school, and naturally gravitated
towards teachers over classmates, as they seemed more interesting. I</p><p>5 0.59328651 <a title="66-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-28-Running_A_Machine_Learning_Summer_School.html">75 hunch net-2005-05-28-Running A Machine Learning Summer School</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We just finished theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer School. The school
was 2 weeks long with about 130 (or 140 counting the speakers) participants.
For perspective, this is perhaps the largest graduate level machine learning
class I am aware of anywhere and anytime (previousMLSSs have been close).
Overall, it seemed to go well, although the students are the real authority on
this. For those who missed it, DVDs will be available from our Slovenian
friends. EmailMrs Spela Sitarof the Jozsef Stefan Institute for details.The
following are some notes for future planning and those interested.Good
DecisionsAcquiring the larger-than-necessary "Assembly Hall" atInternational
House. Our attendance came in well above our expectations, so this was a
critical early decision that made a huge difference.The invited speakers were
key. They made a huge difference in the quality of the content.Delegating

<p>Introduction: May 16 in Cambridge, is theNew England Machine Learning Day, a first regional
workshop/symposium on machine learning. To present a poster, submit an
abstract byMay 5.May 19 in New York,STOCis coming to town and rather
surprisingly havingworkshopswhich should be quite a bit of fun. I'll be
speaking atAlgorithms for Distributed and Streaming Data.</p><p>3 0.52060115 <a title="66-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-04-Science_in_the_Government.html">106 hunch net-2005-09-04-Science in the Government</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found the article on "Political Science" at theNew York Timesinteresting.
Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been
systematically distorting scientific views. With apetitionby some7000+
scientistsalleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.One
thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are
fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the
world. In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued. This value is
achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms. One example of a formal
mechanism is peer review.In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value
is agreement. It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be
passed or other actions can be taken. Since Science (with a capitol 'S') has
accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.
This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mechanism for
pushing agreement</p><p>4 0.31192014 <a title="66-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-07-06-Idempotent-capable_Predictors.html">253 hunch net-2007-07-06-Idempotent-capable Predictors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One way to distinguish different learning algorithms is by their ability or
inability to easily use an input variable as the predicted output. This is
desirable for at least two reasons:ModularityIf we want to build complex
learning systems via reuse of a subsystem, it's important to have compatible
I/O."Prior" knowledgeMachine learning is often applied in situations where we
do have some knowledge of what the right solution is, often in the form of an
existing system. In such situations, it's good to start with a learning
algorithm that can be at least as good as any existing system.When doing
classification, most learning algorithms can do this. For example, a decision
tree can split on a feature, and then classify. The real differences come up
when we attempt regression. Many of the algorithms we know and commonly use
are not idempotent predictors.Logistic regressors can not be idempotent,
because all input features are mapped through a nonlinearity.Linear regressors
can be idempote</p><p>5 0.31024826 <a title="66-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-08-Predictive_Analytics_World.html">335 hunch net-2009-01-08-Predictive Analytics World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Carla Vicens andEric Siegelcontacted me aboutPredictive Analytics Worldin San
Francisco February 18&19, which I wasn't familiar with. A quick look at
theagendareveals several people I know working on applications of machine
learning in businesses, covering deployed applications topics. It's
interesting to see a business-focused machine learning conference, as it says
that we are succeeding as a field. If you are interested in deployed
applications, you might attend.Eric and I did a quick interview by email.John
>I've mostly published and participated in academic machine learning
conferences like ICML, COLT, and NIPS. When I look at theset of speakers and
subjectsfor your conference I think "machine learning for business". Is that
your understanding of things? What I'm trying to ask is: what do you view as
the primary goal for this conference?Eric >You got it. This is the business
event focused on the commercial deployment of technology developed at the
research conferences you named. A</p><p>6 0.30469725 <a title="66-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-18-Parallel_ML_primitives.html">346 hunch net-2009-03-18-Parallel ML primitives</a></p>

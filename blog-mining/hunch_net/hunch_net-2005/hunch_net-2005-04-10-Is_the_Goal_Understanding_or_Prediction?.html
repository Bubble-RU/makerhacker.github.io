<p>Introduction: Reviewers and students are sometimes greatly concerned by the distinction between:
  
  An  open set  and a  closed set . 
 A  Supremum  and a  Maximum . 
 An event which happens with probability 1 and an event that always happens. 
  
I don’t appreciate this distinction in machine learning & learning theory.  All machine learning takes place (by definition) on a machine where every parameter has finite precision.  Consequently, every set is closed, a maximal element always exists, and probability 1 events always happen.
 
The fundamental issue here is that substantial parts of mathematics don’t appear well-matched to computation in the physical world, because the mathematics has concerns which are unphysical.  This mismatched mathematics makes irrelevant distinctions.  We can ask “what mathematics is appropriate to computation?”   Andrej  has convinced me that a pretty good answer to this question is  constructive mathematics .

<p>Introduction: Sham Kakade  points out that we are missing a bound.
 
Suppose we have  m  samples  x  drawn IID from some distribution  D .  Through the magic of exponential moment method we know that:
  
 If the range of  x  is bounded by an interval of size  I , a  Chernoff/Hoeffding style bound  gives us a bound on the deviations like  O(I/m 0.5 )  (at least in crude form).  A proof is on page 9  here . 
 If the range of  x  is bounded, and the variance (or a bound on the variance) is known, then  Bennett’s bound  can give tighter results (*).  This can be a huge improvment when the true variance small. 
  
What’s missing here is a bound that depends on the observed variance rather than a bound on the variance.  This means that many people attempt to use Bennett’s bound (incorrectly) by plugging the observed variance in as the true variance, invalidating the bound application.  Most of the time, they get away with it, but this is a dangerous move when doing machine learning.

<p>Introduction: Suppose we had an infinitely powerful mathematician sitting in a room and proving theorems about learning.  Could he solve machine learning?
 
The answer is “no”.   This answer is both obvious and sometimes underappreciated.   
 
There are several ways to conclude that some  bias  is necessary in order to succesfully learn.  For example, suppose we are trying to solve classification.  At prediction time, we observe some features  X  and want to make a prediction of either  0  or  1 .   Bias is what makes us prefer one answer over the other based on past experience.  In order to learn we must:
  
 Have a bias.  Always predicting  0  is as likely as  1  is useless. 
 Have the “right” bias.  Predicting  1  when the answer is  0  is also not helpful. 
  
The implication of “have a bias” is that we can not design effective learning algorithms with “a uniform prior over all possibilities”.  The implication of “have the ‘right’ bias” is that our mathematician fails since “right” is defined wi</p><p>5 0.092084922 <a title="55-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-12-Math_on_the_Web.html">70 hunch net-2005-05-12-Math on the Web</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At the  PAC-Bayes  workshop earlier this week,  Olivier Catoni  described a result that I hadn’t believed was possible:  a deviation bound depending  only  on the variance of a random variable .
 
For people not familiar with deviation bounds, this may be hard to appreciate.   Deviation bounds, are one of the core components for the foundations of machine learning theory, so developments here have a potential to alter our understanding of how to learn and what is learnable.  My understanding is that the basic proof techniques started with  Bernstein  and have evolved into several variants specialized for various applications.  All of the variants I knew had a dependence on the range, with some also having a dependence on the variance of an IID or martingale random variable.  This one is the first I know of with a dependence on only the variance.
 
The basic idea is to use a biased estimator of the mean which is not influenced much by outliers.  Then, a deviation bound can be proved by</p><p>5 0.64908284 <a title="55-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-05-09-The_Missing_Bound.html">244 hunch net-2007-05-09-The Missing Bound</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A reminder that the  New York Academy of Sciences  will be hosting the  7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium  tomorrow from 9:30am.
 
The main program will feature invited talks from  Peter Bartlett ,  William Freeman , and  Vladimir Vapnik , along with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main program,  hackNY  and  Microsoft Research  are sponsoring a networking hour with talks from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups (specifically  bit.ly ,  Buzzfeed ,  Chartbeat , and  Sense Networks ,  Visual Revenue ).  This should be of great interest to everyone considering working in machine learning.</p><p>2 0.95648235 <a title="55-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-09-Bad_Reviewing.html">38 hunch net-2005-03-09-Bad Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a difficult subject to talk about for many reasons, but a discussion may be helpful.
 
Bad reviewing is a problem in academia.  The first step in understanding this is admitting to the problem, so here is a short list of examples of bad reviewing. 
  
 Reviewer disbelieves theorem proof (ICML),  or disbelieve theorem with a trivially false counterexample. (COLT)  
 Reviewer internally swaps quantifiers in a theorem, concludes it has been done before and is trivial. (NIPS) 
 Reviewer believes a technique will not work despite experimental validation. (COLT) 
 Reviewers fail to notice flaw in theorem statement (CRYPTO).   
 Reviewer erroneously claims that it has been done before (NIPS, SODA, JMLR)—(complete with references!) 
 Reviewer inverts the message of a paper and concludes it says nothing important. (NIPS*2) 
 Reviewer fails to distinguish between a DAG and a tree (SODA). 
 Reviewer is enthusiastic about paper but clearly does not understand (ICML).

<p>Introduction: Steve Smale  and I have a debate about goals of learning theory.
 
Steve likes theorems with a dependence on unobservable quantities.  For example, if  D  is a distribution over a space  X x [0,1] , you can state a theorem about the error rate dependent on the variance,  E (x,y)~D  (y-E y’~D|x [y']) 2  .
 
I dislike this, because I want to use the theorems to produce code solving learning problems.  Since I don’t know (and can’t measure) the variance, a theorem depending on the variance does not help me—I would not know what variance to plug into the learning algorithm.
 
Recast more broadly, this is a debate between “declarative” and “operative” mathematics.  A strong example of “declarative” mathematics is  “a new kind of science” .  Roughly speaking, the goal of this kind of approach seems to be finding a way to explain the observations we make.  Examples include “some things are unpredictable”, “a phase transition exists”, etc…
 
“Operative” mathematics helps you make predictions a</p><p>4 0.8976441 <a title="55-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-26-Two_more_UAI_papers_of_interest.html">199 hunch net-2006-07-26-Two more UAI papers of interest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In addition to Ed Snelson’s paper, there were (at least) two other papers that caught my eye at UAI.
 
One was  this paper  by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Daniel Hsu and Nakul Verma at UCSD which shows in a surprisingly general and strong way that almost all linear projections of any jointly distributed vector random variable with finite first and second moments look sphereical and unimodal (in fact look like a scale mixture of Gaussians). Great result, as you’d expect from Sanjoy.
 
The other paper which I found intriguing but which I just haven’t groked yet is  this beast  by Manfred and Dima Kuzmin. 
You can check out the (beautiful)  slides  
if that helps. I feel like there is something deep here, but my brain is too small to understand it. The COLT and last NIPS papers/slides are also on Manfred’s page. Hopefully someone here can illuminate.</p><p>5 0.88946271 <a title="55-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-05-09-CI_Fellows%2C_again.html">434 hunch net-2011-05-09-CI Fellows, again</a></p>

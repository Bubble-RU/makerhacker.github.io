<p>Introduction: Probability is one of the most confusingly used words in machine learning.  There are at least 3 distinct ways the word is used. 
  
  Bayesian  The Bayesian notion of probability is a ‘degree of belief’.   The degree of belief that some event (i.e. “stock goes up” or “stock goes down”) occurs can be measured by asking a sequence of questions of the form “Would you bet the stock goes up or down at  Y  to 1 odds?” A consistent better will switch from ‘for’ to ‘against’ at some single value of  Y .  The probability is then  Y/(Y+1) .  Bayesian probabilities express lack of knowledge rather than randomization.  They are useful in learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly makes the learning algorithms work better.  Bayesian Learning uses ‘probability’ in this way exclusively. 
  Frequentist  The Frequentist notion of probability is a rate of occurence.  A rate of occurrence can be measured by doing an experiment many times.  If an event occurs  k  times in</p><p>3 0.19296248 <a title="39-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-02-Wielding_a_New_Abstraction.html">351 hunch net-2009-05-02-Wielding a New Abstraction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is partly meant as an advertisement for the  reductions tutorial   Alina ,  Bianca , and I are planning to do at  ICML .  Please come, if you are interested.
 
Many research programs can be thought of as finding and building new useful abstractions.  The running example I’ll use is  learning reductions  where I have experience.  The basic abstraction here is that we can build a learning algorithm capable of solving classification problems up to a small expected regret.   This is used repeatedly to solve more complex problems.
 
In working on a new abstraction, I think you typically run into many substantial problems of understanding, which make publishing particularly difficult.
  
 It is difficult to seriously discuss the reason behind or mechanism for abstraction in a conference paper with small page limits.  People rarely see such discussions and hence have little basis on which to think about new abstractions.    Another difficulty is that when building an abstraction, yo</p><p>4 0.12799132 <a title="39-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-27-Adversarial_Academia.html">333 hunch net-2008-12-27-Adversarial Academia</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One viewpoint on academia is that it is inherently adversarial: there are finite research dollars, positions, and students to work with, implying a zero-sum game between different participants.  This is not a viewpoint that I want to promote, as I consider it flawed.  However, I know several people believe strongly in this viewpoint, and I have found it to have  substantial explanatory power.
 
For example:
  
 It explains why your paper was rejected based on poor logic.  The reviewer wasn’t concerned with research quality, but rather with rejecting a competitor. 
 It explains why professors rarely work together.  The goal of a non-tenured professor (at least) is to get tenure, and a case for tenure comes from a portfolio of work that is undisputably yours. 
 It explains why new research programs are not quickly adopted.  Adopting a competitor’s program is impossible, if your career is based on the competitor being wrong. 
  
Different academic groups subscribe to the adversarial viewp</p><p>5 0.11817691 <a title="39-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-24-The_Humanloop_Spectrum_of_Machine_Learning.html">3 hunch net-2005-01-24-The Humanloop Spectrum of Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All branches of machine learning seem to be united in the idea of using data to make predictions.  However, people disagree to some extent about what this means.  One way to categorize these different goals is on an axis, where one extreme is “tools to aid a human in using data to do prediction” and the other extreme is “tools to do prediction with no human intervention”.  Here is my estimate of where various elements of machine learning fall on this spectrum.
  
 
 Human Necessary 
  
 Human partially necessary 
  
 Human unnecessary 
 
 
 Clustering, data visualization 
 Bayesian Learning, Probabilistic Models, Graphical Models 
 Kernel Learning (SVM’s, etc..) 
 Decision Trees? 
 Reinforcement Learning 
 
  
The exact position of each element is of course debatable.  My reasoning is that clustering and data visualization are nearly useless for prediction without a human in the loop.  Bayesian/probabilistic models/graphical models generally require a human to sit and think about what</p><p>6 0.10998069 <a title="39-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-23-Advantages_and_Disadvantages_of_Bayesian_Learning.html">60 hunch net-2005-04-23-Advantages and Disadvantages of Bayesian Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the central concerns of learning is to understand and to 
prevent overfitting. Various notion of “function complexity” often 
arise: VC dimension, Rademacher complexity, comparison classes of 
experts, and program length are just a few.
 
The term “complexity” to me seems somehow misleading; the terms never 
capture something that meets my intuitive notion of complexity. The 
Bayesian notion clearly captures what’s going on. Functions aren’t 
“complex”– they’re just “surprising”: we assign to them low 
probability. Most (all?) complexity notions I know boil down 
to some (generally loose) bound on the prior probability of the function.
 
In a sense, “complexity” fundementally arises because probability 
distributions must sum to one. You can’t believe in all possibilities 
at the same time, or at least not equally. Rather you have to 
carefully spread the probability mass over the options you’d like to 
consider. Large complexity classes means that beliefs are spread 
thinly. In</p><p>4 0.61198032 <a title="39-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-08-MaxEnt_contradicts_Bayes_Rule%3F.html">191 hunch net-2006-07-08-MaxEnt contradicts Bayes Rule?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I read  this . David Blei and I spent some time thinking hard about this a few years back (thanks to Kary Myers for pointing us to it):
 
 In short I was thinking that Ã¢â‚¬Å“bayesian belief updatingÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“maximum entropyÃ¢â‚¬Â were two othogonal principles. But it appear that they are not, and that they can even be in conflict ! 
Example (from Kass 1996); consider a Die (6 sides), consider prior knowledge E[X]=3.5. 
Maximum entropy leads to P(X)= (1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6). 
Now consider a new piece of evidence A=Ã¢â‚¬ÂX is an odd numberÃ¢â‚¬Â 
Bayesian posterior P(X|A)= P(A|X) P(X) = (1/3, 0, 1/3, 0, 1/3, 0). 
But MaxEnt with the constraints E[X]=3.5 and E[Indicator function of A]=1 leads to (.22, 0, .32, 0, .47, 0) !! (note that E[Indicator function of A]=P(A)) 
Indeed, for MaxEnt, because there is no more Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ6Ã¢â‚¬Â², big numbers must be more probable to ensure an average of 3.5. For bayesian updating, P(X|A) doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to have a 3.5</p><p>5 0.60682595 <a title="39-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-23-Advantages_and_Disadvantages_of_Bayesian_Learning.html">60 hunch net-2005-04-23-Advantages and Disadvantages of Bayesian Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I don’t consider myself a “Bayesian”, but I do try hard to understand why Bayesian learning works.  For the purposes of this post, Bayesian learning is a simple process of:
  
 Specify a prior over world models. 
 Integrate using Bayes law with respect to all observed information to compute a posterior over world models. 
 Predict according to the posterior. 
  
Bayesian learning has many advantages over other learning programs:
  
  Interpolation  Bayesian learning methods interpolate all the way to pure engineering.  When faced with any learning problem, there is a choice of how much time and effort a human vs. a computer puts in.  (For example, the mars rover pathfinding algorithms are almost entirely engineered.)  When creating an engineered system, you build a model of the world and then find a good controller in that model.  Bayesian methods interpolate to this extreme because the Bayesian prior can be a delta function on one model of the world.  What this means is that a recipe</p><p>6 0.58174396 <a title="39-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-07-Objective_and_subjective_interpretations_of_probability.html">205 hunch net-2006-09-07-Objective and subjective interpretations of probability</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An amusing tidbit (reproduced without permission) from Herman Chernoff’s delightful monograph, “Sequential analysis and optimal design”:
 
The use of randomization raises a philosophical question which is articulated by the following probably apocryphal anecdote.
 
The metallurgist told his friend the statistician how he planned to test the effect of heat on the strength of a metal bar by sawing the bar into six pieces. The first two would go into the hot oven, the next two into the medium oven, and the last two into the cool oven. The statistician, horrified, explained how he should randomize to avoid the effect of a possible gradient of strength in the metal bar. The method of randomization was applied, and it turned out that the randomized experiment called for putting the first two pieces into the hot oven, the next two into the medium oven, and the last two into the cool oven. “Obviously, we can’t do that,” said the metallurgist. “On the contrary, you have to do that,” said the st</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89909041 <a title="39-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-10-Breaking_Abstractions.html">39 hunch net-2005-03-10-Breaking Abstractions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sam Roweis ‘s comment reminds me of a more general issue that comes up in doing research: abstractions always break.  
  
 Real number’s aren’t.  Most real numbers can not be represented with any machine.  One implication of this is that many real-number based algorithms have difficulties when implemented with floating point numbers. 
 The box on your desk is not a turing machine. A turing machine can compute anything computable, given sufficient time.  A typical computer fails terribly when the state required for the computation exceeds some limit. 
 Nash equilibria aren’t equilibria.  This comes up when trying to predict human behavior based on the result of the equilibria computation.  Often, it doesn’t work. 
 The  probability  isn’t.  Probability is an abstraction expressing either our lack of knowledge (the Bayesian viewpoint) or fundamental randomization (the frequentist viewpoint).  From the frequentist viewpoint the lack of knowledge typically precludes actually knowing the fu</p><p>3 0.85002613 <a title="39-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Bad_ideas.html">76 hunch net-2005-05-29-Bad ideas</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found these two essays on bad ideas interesting.  Neither of these is written from the viewpoint of research, but they are both highly relevant.
  
  Why smart people have bad ideas  by Paul Graham 
  Why smart people defend bad ideas  by Scott Berkun (which appeared on  slashdot ) 
  
In my experience, bad ideas are common  and  over confidence in ideas is common.  This overconfidence can take either the form of excessive condemnation or excessive praise.  Some of this is necessary to the process of research.  For example, some overconfidence in the value of your own research is expected and probably necessary to motivate your own investigation.  Since research is a rather risky business, much of it does not pan out.  Learning to accept when something does not pan out is a critical skill which is sometimes never acquired.
 
Excessive condemnation can be a real ill when it’s encountered.  This has two effects:

<p>Introduction: This post is about a technology which could develop in the future.
 
Right now, a new drug might be tested by finding patients with some diagnosis and giving or not giving them a drug according to a secret randomization.  The outcome is observed, and if the average outcome for those treated is measurably better than the average outcome for those not treated, the drug might become a standard treatment.
 
Generalizing this, a filter  F  sorts people into two groups: those for treatment  A  and those not for treatment  B  based upon observations  x .  To measure the outcome, you randomize between treatment and nontreatment of group  A  and measure the relative performance of the treatment.
 
A problem often arises: in many cases the treated group does not do better than the nontreated group.  A basic question is: does this mean the treatment is bad?  With respect to the filter  F  it may mean that, but with respect to another filter  F’ , the treatment might be very effective.

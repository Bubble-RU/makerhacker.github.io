<p>Introduction: Multitask learning is the learning to predict multiple outputs given the same
input. Mathematically, we might think of this as trying to learn a functionf:X
-> {0,1}n. Structured learning is similar at this level of abstraction. Many
people have worked on solving multitask learning (for exampleRich Caruana)
using methods which share an internal representation. On other words, the the
computation and learning of theith prediction is shared with the computation
and learning of thejth prediction. Another way to ask this question is: can we
avoid sharing the internal representation?For example, itmightbe feasible to
solve multitask learning by some process feeding theith predictionf(x)iinto
thejth predictorf(x,f(x)i)j,If the answer is "no", then it implies we can not
take binary classification as a basic primitive in the process of solving
prediction problems. If the answer is "yes", then we can reuse binary
classification algorithms to solve multitask learning problems.Finding a

<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on thispostand some of the previousproblems/research
directionsabout where learning theory might make large strides.Why theory?The
essential reason for theory is "intuition extension". A very good applied
learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the
best computer algorithms for solving that problem. A very good theory can take
the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend
them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion. To do this, we take
these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:Explains the
basic intuitions.Makes new testable predictions about how to learn.Succeeds in
so learning.This is "intuition extension": taking what we have learned
somewhere else and applying it in new domains. It is fundamentally useful to
everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving
problems.Where next for learning theory?I like the analogy with physics. Back

<p>Introduction: Reviewers and students are sometimes greatly concerned by the distinction
between:Anopen setand aclosed set.ASupremumand aMaximum.An event which happens
with probability 1 and an event that always happens.I don't appreciate this
distinction in machine learning & learning theory. All machine learning takes
place (by definition) on a machine where every parameter has finite precision.
Consequently, every set is closed, a maximal element always exists, and
probability 1 events always happen.The fundamental issue here is that
substantial parts of mathematics don't appear well-matched to computation in
the physical world, because the mathematics has concerns which are unphysical.
This mismatched mathematics makes irrelevant distinctions. We can ask "what
mathematics is appropriate to computation?"Andrejhas convinced me that a
pretty good answer to this question isconstructive mathematics.So, here's a
basic challenge: Can anyone name a situation where any of the distinctions

<p>Introduction: There are several different flavors of Machine Learning classes. Many classes
are of the 'zoo' sort: many different learning algorithms are presented.
Others avoid the zoo by not covering the full scope of machine learning.This
is my view of what makes a good machine learning class, along with why. I'd
like to specifically invite comment on whether things are missing,
misemphasized, or misplaced.PhaseSubjectWhy?IntroductionWhat is a machine
learning problem?A good understanding of the characteristics of machine
learning problems seems essential. Characteristics include: a data source,
some hope the data is predictive, and a need for generalization. This is
probably best taught in a case study manner: lay out the specifics of some
problem and then ask "Is this a machine learning problem?"IntroductionMachine

<p>Introduction: Steve Smaleand I have a debate about goals of learning theory.Steve likes
theorems with a dependence on unobservable quantities. For example, ifDis a
distribution over a spaceX x [0,1], you can state a theorem about the error
rate dependent on the variance,E(x,y)~D(y-Ey'~D|x[y'])2.I dislike this,
because I want to use the theorems to produce code solving learning problems.
Since I don't know (and can't measure) the variance, a theorem depending on
the variance does not help me--I would not know what variance to plug into the
learning algorithm.Recast more broadly, this is a debate between "declarative"
and "operative" mathematics. A strong example of "declarative" mathematics
is"a new kind of science". Roughly speaking, the goal of this kind of approach
seems to be finding a way to explain the observations we make. Examples
include "some things are unpredictable", "a phase transition exists",
etcâ&euro;Ś"Operative" mathematics helps you make predictions about the world. A

<p>Introduction: Multitask learning is the problem of jointly predicting multiple labels
simultaneously with one system. A basic question iswhether or not multitask
learning can be decomposed into one (or more) single prediction problems. It
seems the answer to this is "yes", in a fairly straightforward manner.The
basic idea is that a controlled input feature is equivalent to an extra
output. Suppose we have some process generating examples:(x,y1,y2) in
Swherey1andy2are labels for two different tasks. Then, we could reprocess the
data to the formSb(S) = {((x,i),yi): (x,y1,y2) in S, i in {1,2}}and then learn
a classifierc:X x {1,2} -> Y. Note that(x,i)is the (composite) input. At
testing time, given an inputx, we can querycfor the predicted values of y1and
y2using(x,1)and(x,2).A strong form of equivalence can be stated between these
tasks. In particular, suppose we have a multitask learning algorithmMLwhich
learns a multitask predictorm:X -> Y x Y. Then the following theorem can be

<p>Introduction: Suppose we had an infinitely powerful mathematician sitting in a room and
proving theorems about learning. Could he solve machine learning?The answer is
"no". This answer is both obvious and sometimes underappreciated.There are
several ways to conclude that somebiasis necessary in order to succesfully
learn. For example, suppose we are trying to solve classification. At
prediction time, we observe some featuresXand want to make a prediction of
either0or1. Bias is what makes us prefer one answer over the other based on
past experience. In order to learn we must:Have a bias. Always predicting0is
as likely as1is useless.Have the "right" bias. Predicting1when the answer
is0is also not helpful.The implication of "have a bias" is that we can not
design effective learning algorithms with "a uniform prior over all
possibilities". The implication of "have the 'right' bias" is that our
mathematician fails since "right" is defined with respect to the solutions to
problems encountered in the real</p><p>2 0.99948025 <a title="90-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-29-Academic_Mechanism_Design.html">48 hunch net-2005-03-29-Academic Mechanism Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of "mechanism design": setting up the
structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane
things (rather than obviously counterproductive things). Application of this
principle to academic research may be fruitful.What is misdesigned about
academic research?TheJMLGguides give many hints.The common nature ofbad
reviewingalso suggests the system isn't working optimally.There are many ways
to experimentally"cheat" in machine learning.Funding Prisoner's Delimma. Good
researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing
research. Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant
proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written. This is
essentially a "prisoner's delimma": anyone not writing grant proposals loses,
but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction. If everyone
wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution of funding
would occur, and time w</p><p>3 0.99923921 <a title="90-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-10-Interesting_papers%2C_ICML_2008.html">309 hunch net-2008-07-10-Interesting papers, ICML 2008</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are some papers fromICML 2008that I found interesting.Risi
KondorandKarsten Borgwardt,The Skew Spectrum of Graphs. This paper is about a
new family of functions on graphs which is invariant under node label
permutation. They show that these quantities appear to yield good features for
learning.Sanjoy DasguptaandDaniel Hsu.Hierarchical sampling for active
learning.This is the first published practical consistent active learning
algorithm. The abstract is also pretty impressive.Lihong Li,Michael Littman,
andThomas WalshKnows What It Knows: A Framework For Self-Aware Learning.This
is an attempt to create learning algorithms that know when they err, (other
work includesVovk). It's not yet clear to me what the right model forfeature-
dependent confidence intervalsis.Novi Quadrianto,Alex Smola,TIberio Caetano,
andQuoc Viet LeEstimating Labels from Label Proportions. This is an example of
learning in a specialization of the offline contextual bandit setting.Filip

<p>Introduction: IJCAIis running January 6-12 in Hyderabad India rather than a more traditional
summer date. (Presumably, this is to avoid melting people in the Indian
summer.)The paper deadline(June 23 abstract / June 30 submission) are
particularly inconvenient if you attendCOLTorICML. But on the other hand, it's
a good excuse to visit India.</p><p>5 0.998357 <a title="90-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-06-Don%26%238217%3Bt_mix_the_solution_into_the_problem.html">67 hunch net-2005-05-06-Don&#8217;t mix the solution into the problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common defect of many pieces of research is defining the problem in terms of
the solution. Here are some examples in learning:"The learning problem is
finding a good seperating hyperplane.""The goal of learning is to
minimize(y-p)2+ C w2wherey= the observation,p= the prediction andw= a
parameter vector."Defining thelossfunction to be the one that your algorithm
optimizes rather than the one imposed by the world.The fundamental reason why
this is a defect is that it creates artificial boundaries to problem solution.
Artificial boundaries lead to the possibility of being blind-sided. For
example, someone committing (1) or (2) above might find themselves themselves
surprised to find a decision tree working well on a problem. Example (3) might
result in someone else solving a learning problem better for real world
purposes, even if it's worse with respect to the algorithm optimization. This
defect should be avoided so as to not artificially limit your learning
kungfu.The way to avoid thi</p><p>6 0.99737275 <a title="90-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-26-ML_Symposium_and_Strata-Hadoop_World.html">475 hunch net-2012-10-26-ML Symposium and Strata-Hadoop World</a></p>

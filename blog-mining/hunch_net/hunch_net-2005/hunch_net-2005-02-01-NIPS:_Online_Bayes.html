<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made sinceSanjoypointed out the
significantlack of theoretical understanding of active learning. This is an
update on the progress I know of. As a refresher, active learning as meant
here is:There is a source of unlabeled data.There is an oracle from which
labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source.The goal is
to perform well with minimal use of the oracle.Here is what I've
learned:Sanjoy has developed sufficient and semi-necessary conditions for
active learning given the assumptions of IID data and "realizability" (that
one of the classifiers is a correct classifier).Nina,Alina, and I developed an
algorithm for active learning relying on only the assumption of IID data. A
draft ishere.Nicolo,Claudio, andLucashowed that it is possible to do active
learning in an entirely adversarial setting for linear threshold
classifiershere. This was published a year or two ago and I recently learned
about it.All of these results are relative</p><p>3 0.1535196 <a title="8-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-24-Online_convex_optimization_at_COLT.html">186 hunch net-2006-06-24-Online convex optimization at COLT</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I don't consider myself a "Bayesian", but I do try hard to understand why
Bayesian learning works. For the purposes of this post, Bayesian learning is a
simple process of:Specify a prior over world models.Integrate using Bayes law
with respect to all observed information to compute a posterior over world
models.Predict according to the posterior.Bayesian learning has many
advantages over other learning programs:InterpolationBayesian learning methods
interpolate all the way to pure engineering. When faced with any learning
problem, there is a choice of how much time and effort a human vs. a computer
puts in. (For example, the mars rover pathfinding algorithms are almost
entirely engineered.) When creating an engineered system, you build a model of
the world and then find a good controller in that model. Bayesian methods
interpolate to this extreme because the Bayesian prior can be a delta function
on one model of the world. What this means is that a recipe of "think harder"

number of strategies)with respect to the best strategy in a set." This is
sometimes called online learning with experts.Online Optimization

<p>Introduction: (I'm channeling forJean-Yves Audiberthere, with some minor tweaking for
clarity.)SinceNemirovski'sSaint Flour lecture notes, numerous researchers have
studied the following problem in least squares regression: predict as well
as(MS) the best of d given functions (like in prediction with expert advice;
model = finite set of d functions)(C) the best convex combination of these
functions (i.e., model = convex hull of the d functions)(L) the best linear
combination of these functions (i.e., model = linear span of the d
functions)It is now well known (see, e.g., Sacha Tsybakov's COLT'03 paper)
that these tasks can be achieved since there exist estimators having an excess
risk of order (log d)/n for (MS), min( sqrt((log d)/n), d/n ) for (C) and d/n
for (L), where n is the training set size. Here, "risk" is amount of extra
loss per example which may be suffered due to the choice of random sample.The
practical use of these results seems rather limited to trivial statements

<p>Introduction: Accountability is a social problem. When someone screws up, do you fire them?
Or do you accept the error and let them continue? This is a very difficult
problem and we all know of stories where the wrong decision was made.Online
learning(as meant here), is a subfield of learning theory which analyzes the
online learning model.In the online learning model, there are a set of
hypotheses or "experts". On any instantancex, each expert makes a predictiony.
A master algorithmAuses these predictions to form it's own predictionyAand
then learns the correct predictiony*. This process repeats.The goal of online
learning is to find a master algorithmAwhich uses the advice of the experts to
make good predictions. In particular, we typically want to guarantee that the
master algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert. IfL(e)is the loss
of experteandL(A)is the loss of the master algorithm, it is often possible to
prove:L(A) less than mineL(e) + log(number of experts)over all sequences.In

<p>Introduction: One nice use for this blog is to consider and discuss papers that that have
appeared at recent conferences. I really enjoyed Andrew Ng and Sham Kakade's
paperOnline Bounds for Bayesian Algorithms. From the paper:The philosophy
taken in the Bayesian methodology is often at odds withthat in the online
learning community…. the online learning settingmakes rather minimal
assumptions on the conditions under which thedata are being presented to the
learner â€”usually, Nature could provideexamples in an adversarial manner. We
study the performance ofBayesian algorithms in a more adversarial setting… We
providecompetitive bounds when the cost function is the log loss, and
wecompare our performance to the best model in our model class (as inthe
experts setting).It's a very nice analysis of some of my favorite algorithms
that all hinges around a beautiful theorem:Let Q be any distribution over
parameters theta. Then for all sequences S:L_{Bayes}(S) leq L_Q(S) +
KL(Q|P)where P is our prior and th</p><p>2 0.93900162 <a title="8-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-02-Mad_%28Neuro%29science.html">168 hunch net-2006-04-02-Mad (Neuro)science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the questions facing machine learning as a field is "Can we produce a
generalized learning system that can solve a wide array of standard learning
problems?" The answer is trivial: "yes, just have children".Of course, that
wasn't really the question. The refined question is "Are there simple-to-
implement generalized learning systems that can solve a wide array of standard
learning problems?" The answer to this is less clear. The ability of animals
(and people ) to learn might be due to megabytes encoded in the DNA. If this
algorithmic complexity isnecessaryto solve machine learning, the field faces a
daunting task in replicating it on a computer.This observation suggests a
possibility: if you can show that few bits of DNA are needed for learning in
animals, then this provides evidence that machine learning (as a field) has a
hope of big success with relatively little effort.It is well known that
specific portions of the brain have specific functionality across individuals.

<p>Introduction: In reinforcement learning (and sometimes other settings), there is a notion of
"state". Based upon the state various predictions are made such as "Which
action should be taken next?" or "How much cumulative reward do I expect if I
take some action from this state?" Given the importance of state, it is
important to examine the meaning. There are actually several distinct options
and it turns out the definition variation is very important in motivating
different pieces of work.Newtonian State. State is the physical pose of the
world. Under this definition, there areverymany states, often too many for
explicit representation. This is also the definition typically used in
games.Abstracted State. State is an abstracted physical state of the world.
"Is the door open or closed?" "Are you in room A or not?" The number of states
is much smaller here. A basic issue here is: "How do you compute the state
from observations?"Mathematical State. State is a sufficient statistic of
observations for ma</p><p>5 0.84151697 <a title="8-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-19-Choice_of_Metrics.html">259 hunch net-2007-08-19-Choice of Metrics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we judge success in Machine Learning? AsAaronnotes, the best way is to
use the loss imposed on you by the world. This turns out to be infeasible
sometimes for various reasons. The ones I've seen are:The learned prediction
is used in some complicated process that does not give the feedback necessary
to understand the prediction's impact on the loss.The prediction is used by
some other system which expects some semantics to the predicted value. This is
similar to the previous example, except that the issue is design modularity
rather than engineering modularity.The correct loss function is simply unknown
(and perhaps unknowable, except by experimentation).In these situations, it's
unclear what metric for evaluation should be chosen. This post has some design
advice for this murkier case. I'm using the word "metric" here to distinguish
the fact that we are considering methods forevaluatingpredictive systems
rather than a loss imposed by the real world or a loss which is optimized b</p><p>6 0.84093285 <a title="8-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-03-19-The_Ideal_Large_Scale_Learning_Class.html">426 hunch net-2011-03-19-The Ideal Large Scale Learning Class</a></p>

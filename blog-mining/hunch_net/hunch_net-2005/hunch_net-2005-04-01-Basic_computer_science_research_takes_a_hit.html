<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>3 0.17882781 <a title="50-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-04-Research_Budget_Changes.html">154 hunch net-2006-02-04-Research Budget Changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is
encouraging. There is some discussion of this at theComputing Research
Policyblog.One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time,
presumably in dollar budgets. I don't believe that dollar budgets are the
right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers. A better way
to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a
measure of the relative emphasis on research.This graph was assembled by
dividing theNSF budgetby theUS GDP. For 2005 GDP, I used thecurrent
estimateand for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per
year. The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to
change.This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding
emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row. The reality has been significantly
more severe due toDARPA decreasing fundingand industrial research labs (ATnT

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT
ResearchandLucenthad one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the
remainder ofBell Labs, triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine
learning group there. As the recession progresses, we may easily see more
firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer
support research.There are a couple positives to the recession as well.Both

<p>Introduction: I've avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest. The
problem with discussing politics is that it's customary for people to say much
based upon little information. Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial
impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa). It's primary
election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the
issues are not.There are several policy decisions which substantially effect
development of science and technology in the US.EducationThe US has great
contrasts in education. The top universities are very good places, yet the
grade school education system produces mediocre results. For me, the contrast
between apublic educationandCaltechwas bracing. For many others attending
Caltech, it clearly was not. Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is
a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about. My own
experience is that a basic attitude of "no child unrealized" is better than
"no child lef</p><p>6 0.10921145 <a title="50-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-29-Academic_Mechanism_Design.html">48 hunch net-2005-03-29-Academic Mechanism Design</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I attended theIBM research 60th anniversary. IBM research is, by any
reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the
most value to it's parent company over the long term. This can be seen by
simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab
which has not gone through a period of massive firing. (Note that there are
alsonew research labs.)Despite this impressive record, IBM research has
failed, by far, to achieve it's potential. Examples which came up in this
meeting include:It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented
in the lab. (In fact, Intel produced it first.)Relational databases and SQL
were invented and then languished. It was only under external competition that
IBM released it's own relational database. Why didn't IBM grow anOracle
division?An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing
aCisco division. Why not?And remember â&euro;Ś IBM research is a stark success story

(with the NSF budget staying approximately constant in the interim).This is
the sort of policy decision which may make sense for the defense department,
but which means a large hit for basic research on information technology
development in the US. For example "darpa funded the invention of the
internet" is reasonably correct. This policy decision is particularly painful
in the context of NSF budget cuts and the end of extensive phone monopoly
funded research at Bell labs.The good news from a learning perspective is that
(based on anecdotal evidence) much of the remaining funding is aimed at
learning and learning-related fields. Methods of making good automated
predictions obviously have a l</p><p>2 0.78991699 <a title="50-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-04-Research_Budget_Changes.html">154 hunch net-2006-02-04-Research Budget Changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is
encouraging. There is some discussion of this at theComputing Research
Policyblog.One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time,
presumably in dollar budgets. I don't believe that dollar budgets are the
right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers. A better way
to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a
measure of the relative emphasis on research.This graph was assembled by
dividing theNSF budgetby theUS GDP. For 2005 GDP, I used thecurrent
estimateand for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per
year. The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to
change.This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding
emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row. The reality has been significantly
more severe due toDARPA decreasing fundingand industrial research labs (ATnT

<p>Introduction: 2012 was a tumultuous year for me, but it was undeniably a great year for deep
learning efforts. Signs of this include:Winning aKaggle competition.Wide
adoption ofdeep learning for speech recognition.Significantindustry
support.Gains inimagerecognition.This is a rare event in research: a
significant capability breakout. Congratulations are definitely in order for
those who managed to achieve it. At this point, deep learning algorithms seem
like a choice undeniably worth investigating for real applications with
significant data.</p><p>4 0.75059301 <a title="50-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-17-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">410 hunch net-2010-09-17-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is anothermachine learning meetupwhere I'll be speaking.
Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as "the future of
machine learning". In particular, it's all about how to learn in an
interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation,
etcâ&euro;ŚOn Sept 24, abstracts for theNew York Machine Learning Symposiumare due.
This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it's a great way to
have a conversation with other people.On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually
happens. This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more
time for posters. In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:David
Blei,Sanjoy Dasgupta,Tommi Jaakkola, andYann LeCun. After the meeting, a
latehackNYrelated event is planned where students and startups can meet.I'd
also like to point out the relatedCS/Econ symposiumas I have interests there
as well.</p><p>5 0.75005329 <a title="50-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-04-15-NEML_II.html">481 hunch net-2013-04-15-NEML II</a></p>

England. There is a poster session with abstracts due April 19. I understand

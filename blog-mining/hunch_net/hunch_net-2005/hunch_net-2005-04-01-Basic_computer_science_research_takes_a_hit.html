<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is encouraging.   There is some discussion of this at the  Computing Research Policy  blog.  
 
One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time, presumably in dollar budgets.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t believe that dollar budgets are the right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers.  A better way to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a measure of the relative emphasis on research.
 
  
 
This graph was assembled by dividing the  NSF budget  by the  US GDP .  For 2005 GDP, I used the  current estimate  and for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per year.  The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to change.
 
This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row.

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired. 
  
In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,  ATnT Research  and  Lucent  had one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the remainder of  Bell Labs , triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine learning group there.  As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.
 
There are a couple positives to the recession as well.

<p>Introduction: Lev Reyzin  points out  the  CI Fellows program is renewed .  CI Fellows are essentially  NSF  funded computer science postdocs for universities and industry research labs.  I’ve been lucky and happy to have Lev visit me for a year under  last year’s program , so I strongly recommend participating if it suits you.

<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of “mechanism design”: setting up the structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane things (rather than obviously counterproductive things).  Application of this principle to academic research may be fruitful.
 
What is misdesigned about academic research?
  
 The  JMLG  guides give many hints. 
 The common nature of  bad reviewing  also suggests the system isn’t working optimally. 
 There are many ways to experimentally  “cheat” in machine learning . 
  Funding Prisoner’s Delimma.  Good researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing research.  Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written.  This is essentially a “prisoner’s delimma”: anyone not writing grant proposals loses, but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction.  If everyone wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution</p><p>6 0.53625411 <a title="50-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-04-Science_in_the_Government.html">106 hunch net-2005-09-04-Science in the Government</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The New York Times has an interesting  article  about how DARPA has dropped funding for computer science to universities by about a factor of 2 over the last 5 years and become less directed towards basic research.  Partially in response, the number of grant submissions to NSF has grown by a factor of 3 (with the NSF budget staying approximately constant in the interim).
 
This is the sort of policy decision which may make sense for the defense department, but which means a large hit for basic research on information technology development in the US.  For example “darpa funded the invention of the internet” is reasonably correct.  This policy decision is particularly painful in the context of NSF budget cuts and the end of extensive phone monopoly funded research at Bell labs. 
 
The good news from a learning perspective is that (based on anecdotal evidence) much of the remaining funding is aimed at learning and learning-related fields.

<p>Introduction: A language is a set of primitives which can be combined to succesfully create complex objects.  Languages arise in all sorts of situations: mechanical construction, martial arts, communication, etc…  Languages appear to be the key to succesfully creating complex objects—it is difficult to come up with any convincing example of a complex object which is not built using some language.  Since languages are so crucial to success, it is interesting to organize various machine learning research programs by language.
 
The most common language in machine learning are languages for representing the solution to machine learning.   This includes:
  
  Bayes Nets and Graphical Models  A language for representing probability distributions.  The key concept supporting modularity is conditional independence.   Michael Kearns  has been working on extending this to game theory. 
  Kernelized Linear Classifiers  A language for representing linear separators, possibly in a large space.

<p>Introduction: Many decision problems can be represented in the form 
FOR  n =1,2,…: 
— Reality chooses a datum  x n  . 
— Decision Maker chooses his decision  d n  . 
— Reality chooses an observation  y n  . 
— Decision Maker suffers loss   L ( y n  , d n  ). 
END FOR. 
The observation  y n   can be, for example, tomorrow’s stock price and the decision  d n   the number of shares Decision Maker chooses to buy.  The datum  x n   ideally contains all information that might be relevant in making this decision.  We do not want to assume anything about the way Reality generates the observations and data.
 
Suppose there is a good and not too complex decision rule  D  mapping each datum  x  to a decision  D ( x ).  Can we perform as well, or almost as well, as  D , without knowing it?  This is essentially a special case of the problem of  on-line learning .
 
This is a simple result of this kind.  Suppose the data  x n   are taken from [0,1] and  L ( y , d )=| y – d |.

<p>Introduction: Since  John  did not attend  COLT  this year, I have been volunteered to report back on the hot stuff at this year’s meeting. The conference seemed to have pretty high quality stuff this year, and I found plenty of interesting papers on all the three days. I’m gonna pick some of my favorites going through the program in a chronological order.
 
The first session on matrices seemed interesting for two reasons. First, the papers were quite nice. But more interestingly, this is a topic that has had a lot of presence in Statistics and Compressed sensing literature recently. So it was good to see high-dimensional matrices finally make their entry at COLT. The paper of  Ohad  and  Shai  on  Collaborative Filtering with the Trace Norm: Learning, Bounding, and Transducing  provides non-trivial guarantees on trace norm regularization in an agnostic setup, while Rina and  Nati  show how Rademacher averages can be used to get sharper results for matrix completion problems in their paper  Concentr</p><p>4 0.11649922 <a title="88-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult.  As a conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good papers—enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to (generally) to grow the conference.  For someone choosing to participate in a new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work out?  Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you are sure will work?
 
The conference founding problem is a joint agreement problem with a very significant barrier.  Workshops are a way around this problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective means for this.  A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available.  Presenting work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a confe</p><p>5 0.10806571 <a title="88-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-04-15-NEML_II.html">481 hunch net-2013-04-15-NEML II</a></p>

<p>Introduction: By  Shie  and  Nati 
 
Following John’s advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is often the best place for theory papers.  We would like to emphasize that we both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs, and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers.  For many papers, ICML is the best venue.  But for many theory papers, COLT is a better and more appropriate place.
 
Why should you submit to COLT?
 
By-and-large, theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT is more focused then ICML with a single track session.  Unlike ICML, the norm in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks presented.  There is also often a lively discussion followi</p><p>3 0.62580025 <a title="88-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-24-COLT_Treasurer_is_now_Phil_Long.html">394 hunch net-2010-04-24-COLT Treasurer is now Phil Long</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For about 5 years, I’ve been the treasurer of the Association for Computational Learning, otherwise known as COLT, taking over from  John Case  before me.  A transfer of duties to  Phil Long  is now about complete.  This probably matters to almost no one, but I wanted to describe things a bit for those interested.
 
The immediate impetus for this decision was unhappiness over reviewing decisions at  COLT 2009 , one as an author and several as a member of the program committee.  I seem to have disagreements fairly often about what is important work, partly because I’m focused on learning theory with practical implications, partly because I define learning theory more broadly than is typical amongst COLT members, and partly because COLT suffers a bit from insider-clique issues.  The degree to which these issues come up varies substantially each year so last year is not predictive of this one.  And, it’s important to understand that COLT remains healthy with these issues not nearly so bad</p><p>4 0.58604056 <a title="88-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-09-A_Healthy__COLT.html">324 hunch net-2008-11-09-A Healthy  COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  while ago , we discussed the health of  COLT .   COLT 2008  substantially addressed my concerns.  The papers were diverse and several were interesting.  Attendance was up, which is particularly notable in Europe.  In my opinion, the colocation with UAI and ICML was the best colocation since 1998.
 
And, perhaps best of all, registration ended up being free for all students due to various grants from the  Academy of Finland ,  Google ,  IBM , and  Yahoo .
 
A basic question is: what went right?  There seem to be several answers.
  
 Cost-wise, COLT had sufficient grants to alleviate the high cost of the Euro and location at a university substantially reduces the cost compared to a hotel. 
 Organization-wise, the Finns were great with hordes of volunteers helping set everything up.  Having too many volunteers is a good failure mode. 
 Organization-wise, it was clear that all 3 program chairs were cooperating in designing the program. 
 Facilities-wise, proximity in time and space made</p><p>5 0.57212883 <a title="88-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: COLT  had an impromptu session which seemed as interesting or more interesting than any other single technical session (despite being only an hour long).  There are several roles that an impromptu session can play including:
  
 Announcing new work since the paper deadline. Letting this happen now rather than later helps aid the process of research. 
 Discussing a paper that was rejected.  Reviewers err sometimes and an impromptu session provides a means to remedy that. 
 Entertainment.  We all like to have a bit of fun. 
  
For design, the following seem important:
  
 Impromptu speakers should not have much time.  At COLT, it was 8 minutes, but I have seen even 5 work well. 
 The entire impromptu session should not last too long because the format is dense and promotes restlessness.  A half hour or hour can work well. 
  
Impromptu talks are a mechanism to let a little bit of chaos into the schedule.  They will be chaotic in content, presentation, and usefulness.

<p>Introduction: I realized that the tools needed to solve the  problem just posted  were just created.  I tried to sketch out the solution  here  (also in  .lyx  and  .tex ).  It is still quite sketchy (and probably only the few people who understand reductions well can follow).
 
One of the reasons why I started this weblog was to experiment with “research in the open”, and this is an opportunity to do so.  Over the next few days, I’ll be filling in details and trying to get things to make sense.  If you have additions or ideas, please propose them.</p><p>5 0.79301375 <a title="88-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-02-Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Googling.html">10 hunch net-2005-02-02-Kolmogorov Complexity and Googling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning makes the   New Scientist  . From the article: 
  

COMPUTERS can learn the meaning of words simply by plugging into Google. The finding could bring forward the day that true artificial intelligence is developedâ&euro;Ś. 
But Paul Vitanyi and Rudi Cilibrasi of the National Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, realised that a Google search can be used to measure how closely two words relate to each other. For instance, imagine a computer needs to understand what a hat is.

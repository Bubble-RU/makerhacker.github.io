<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made since  Sanjoy  pointed out the significant  lack of theoretical understanding of active learning .  This is an update on the progress I know of.  As a refresher, active learning as meant here is:
  
 There is a source of unlabeled data. 
 There is an oracle from which labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source. 
 The goal is to perform well with minimal use of the oracle. 
  
Here is what I’ve learned:
  
 Sanjoy has developed sufficient and semi-necessary conditions for active learning given the assumptions of IID data and “realizability” (that one of the classifiers is a correct classifier). 
  Nina ,  Alina , and I developed an algorithm for active learning relying on only the assumption of IID data.  A draft is  here . 
  Nicolo ,  Claudio , and  Luca  showed that it is possible to do active learning in an entirely adversarial setting for linear threshold classifiers  here .

<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is.  The viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etc… share little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.
 
There are two fundamental reasons why this is possible.
  
 For many problems, many approaches work in the sense that they do something useful.  This is true empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor.  It’s also true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples. 
 There is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field.  In many other areas there</p><p>6 0.10749428 <a title="7-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-15-The_State_of_Tight_Bounds.html">41 hunch net-2005-03-15-The State of Tight Bounds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is about a design flaw in several learning algorithms such as the Naive Bayes classifier and Hidden Markov Models.  A number of people are aware of it, but it seems that not everyone is.
 
Several learning systems have the property that they estimate some conditional probabilities  P(event | other events)  either explicitly or implicitly.  Then, at prediction time, these learned probabilities are multiplied together according to some formula to produce a final prediction.  The Naive Bayes classifier for binary data is the simplest of these, so it seems like a good example.  
 
When Naive Bayes is used, a set of probabilities of the form  Pr’(feature i | label)  are estimated via counting statistics and some prior.  Predictions are made according to the label maximizing: 
  Pr’(label) * Product features i  Pr’(feature i | label)  
 
(The  Pr’  notation indicates these are estimated values.) 
 
There is nothing wrong with this method as long as (a) the prior for the sample counts is</p><p>5 0.57651007 <a title="7-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-22-Do_you_believe_in_induction%3F.html">104 hunch net-2005-08-22-Do you believe in induction?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Foster Provost  gave a talk at the ICML  metalearning workshop  on “metalearning” and the “no free lunch theorem” which seems worth summarizing.
 
As a review: the no free lunch theorem is the most complicated way we know of to say that a  bias  is required in order to learn.  The simplest way to see this is in a nonprobabilistic setting.  If you are given examples of the form  (x,y)  and you wish to predict  y  from  x  then any prediction mechanism errs half the time in expectation over all sequences of examples.  The proof of this is very simple: on every example a predictor must make some prediction and by symmetry over the set of sequences it will be wrong half the time and right half the time.  The basic idea of this proof has been applied to many other settings.
 
The simplistic interpretation of this theorem which many people jump to is “machine learning is dead” since there can be no single learning algorithm which can solve all learning problems.  This is the wrong way to thi</p><p>6 0.57073289 <a title="7-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-26-Fallback_Analysis_is_a_Secret_to_Useful_Algorithms.html">126 hunch net-2005-10-26-Fallback Analysis is a Secret to Useful Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Introduction: “Assumption” is another word to be careful with in machine learning because it is used in several ways.
  
  Assumption = Bias  There are several ways to see that some form of ‘bias’ (= preferring of one solution over another) is necessary.   This is obvious in an adversarial setting.  A good bit of work has been expended explaining this in other settings with “ no free lunch ” theorems.  This is a usage specialized to learning which is particularly common when talking about priors for Bayesian Learning. 
  Assumption = “if” of a theorem  The assumptions are the ‘if’ part of the ‘if-then’ in a theorem.  This is a fairly common usage. 
  Assumption = Axiom  The assumptions are the things that we assume are true, but which we cannot verify.  Examples are “the IID assumption” or “my problem is a DNF on a small number of bits”.  This is the usage which I prefer. 
  
One difficulty with any use of the word “assumption” is that you often encounter “if  assumption  then  conclusion  so if  no</p><p>2 0.72525448 <a title="7-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-18-What_is_missing_for_online_collaborative_research%3F.html">208 hunch net-2006-09-18-What is missing for online collaborative research?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The internet has recently made the research process much smoother: papers are easy to obtain, citations are easy to follow, and unpublished “tutorials” are often available. Yet, new research fields can look very complicated to outsiders or newcomers. Every paper is like a small piece of an unfinished jigsaw puzzle: to understand just one publication, a researcher without experience in the field will typically have to follow several layers of citations, and many of the papers he encounters have a great deal of repeated information. Furthermore, from one publication to the next, notation and terminology may not be consistent which can further confuse the reader.
 
But the internet is now proving to be an extremely useful medium for collaboration and knowledge aggregation. Online forums allow users to ask and answer questions and to share ideas. The recent phenomenon of Wikipedia provides a proof-of-concept for the “anyone can edit” system. Can such models be used to facilitate research a</p><p>3 0.68396646 <a title="7-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-06-Branch_Prediction_Competition.html">190 hunch net-2006-07-06-Branch Prediction Competition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alan Fern  points out the  second branch prediction challenge  (due September 29) which is a follow up to the  first branch prediction competition .  Branch prediction is one of the fundamental learning problems of the computer age: without it our computers might run an order of magnitude slower.  This is a tough problem since there are sharp constraints on time and space complexity in an online environment.  For machine learning, the “idealistic track” may fit well.  Essentially, they remove these constraints to gain a weak upper bound on what might be done.</p><p>4 0.60096467 <a title="7-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-03-Microsoft_Research%2C_New_York_City.html">464 hunch net-2012-05-03-Microsoft Research, New York City</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people .  Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs, this is serious for  Yahoo! Research .  
 
We had advanced warning from  Prabhakar  through the  simple act of leaving .  Yahoo! Research was a world class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave.  My first thought when I saw the news was “Uhoh,  Rob  said that he knew it was serious when the head of ATnT Research left.”  In this case it was even more significant, because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high engagement with the company.  Prabhakar’s departure is a clear end to that experiment.
 
The result is ambiguous from a business perspective.  Y!R clearly was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses.  I’m not privy to the internal accounting of impact and this is the kind of subject where there c</p><p>5 0.55870503 <a title="7-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-02-Wielding_a_New_Abstraction.html">351 hunch net-2009-05-02-Wielding a New Abstraction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is partly meant as an advertisement for the  reductions tutorial   Alina ,  Bianca , and I are planning to do at  ICML .  Please come, if you are interested.
 
Many research programs can be thought of as finding and building new useful abstractions.  The running example I’ll use is  learning reductions  where I have experience.  The basic abstraction here is that we can build a learning algorithm capable of solving classification problems up to a small expected regret.   This is used repeatedly to solve more complex problems.
 
In working on a new abstraction, I think you typically run into many substantial problems of understanding, which make publishing particularly difficult.
  
 It is difficult to seriously discuss the reason behind or mechanism for abstraction in a conference paper with small page limits.  People rarely see such discussions and hence have little basis on which to think about new abstractions.    Another difficulty is that when building an abstraction, yo</p><p>6 0.52418226 <a title="7-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-10-03-Static_vs._Dynamic_multiclass_prediction.html">373 hunch net-2009-10-03-Static vs. Dynamic multiclass prediction</a></p>

 Integrate using Bayes law with respect to all observed information to compute a posterior over world models.

<p>Introduction: I’ve had serious conversations with several people who believe that the theory in machine learning is “only useful for getting papers published”.  That’s a compelling statement, as I’ve seen many papers where the algorithm clearly came first, and the theoretical justification for it came second, purely as a perceived means to improve the chance of publication. 
 
Naturally, I disagree and believe that learning theory has much more substantial applications.  
 
Even in core learning algorithm design, I’ve found learning theory to be useful, although it’s application is more subtle than many realize.  The most straightforward applications can fail, because (as expectation suggests) worst case bounds tend to be loose in practice (*).  In my experience, considering learning theory when designing an algorithm has two important effects in practice:
  
 It can help make your algorithm behave right at a crude level of analysis, leaving finer details to tuning or common sense.  The best example</p><p>5 0.17369002 <a title="95-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-28-Learning_Theory_standards_for_NIPS_2006.html">204 hunch net-2006-08-28-Learning Theory standards for NIPS 2006</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob Williamson  and I are the learning theory PC members at  NIPS  this year.  This is some attempt to state the standards and tests I applied to the papers.  I think it is a good idea to talk about this for two reasons:
  
 Making community standards a matter of public record seems healthy.  It give us a chance to debate what is and is not the right standard.  It might even give us a bit more consistency across the years. 
 It may save us all time.  There are a number of papers submitted which just aren’t there yet.  Avoiding submitting is the right decision in this case. 
  
There are several criteria for judging a paper.  All of these were active this year.  Some criteria are uncontroversial while others may be so.
  
 The paper must have a theorem establishing something new for which it is possible to derive high confidence in the correctness of the results.  A surprising number of papers fail this test.  This criteria seems essential to the definition of “theory”.

<p>Introduction: In everyday use a model is a system which explains the behavior of some system, hopefully at the level where some alteration of the model predicts some alteration of the real-world system.   In machine learning “model” has several variant definitions.
  
  Everyday .  The common definition is sometimes used. 
  Parameterized . Sometimes model is a short-hand for “parameterized model”.  Here, it refers to a model with unspecified free parameters.  In the Bayesian learning approach, you typically have a prior over (everyday) models. 
  Predictive .  Even further from everyday use is the predictive model.  Examples of this are “my model is a decision tree” or “my model is a support vector machine”.  Here, there is no real sense in which an SVM explains the underlying process.  For example, an SVM tells us nothing in particular about how alterations to the real-world system would create a change.

<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given framework or mathematical model.  It turns out that all of these models are significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning.  I’ve created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of machine learning.
 
The point here is not simply “woe unto us”.  There are several implications which seem important.
  
 The multitude of models is a point of continuing confusion.  It is common for people to learn about machine learning within one framework which often becomes there “home framework” through which they attempt to filter all machine learning.  (Have you met people who can only think in terms of kernels?  Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)  Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help resolve the confusion.  This is particularly important when reviewing and particularly important for students.

<p>Introduction: This is the  6 month point  in the “run a research blog” experiment, so it seems like a good point to take stock and assess.  
 
One fundamental question is: “Is it worth it?”  The idea of running a research blog will never become widely popular and useful unless it actually aids research.  On the negative side, composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount of time.  On the positive side, the process might yield better research because there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster thinking.
 
My answer at the moment is a provisional “yes”.  Running the blog has been incidentally helpful in several ways:
  
 It is sometimes educational.  example  
 More often, the process of composing thoughts well enough to post simply aids thinking.  This has resulted in a couple solutions to problems of  interest  (and perhaps more over time).  If you really want to solve a problem, letting the world know is helpful.  This isn’t necessarily</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9126693 <a title="95-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-14-What_Learning_Theory_might_do.html">95 hunch net-2005-07-14-What Learning Theory might do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on this  post  and some of the previous  problems/research directions  about where learning theory might make large strides.  
  
  Why theory?   The essential reason for theory is “intuition extension”.  A very good applied learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the best computer algorithms for solving that problem.  A very good theory can take the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion.  To do this, we take these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:
 
 Explains the basic intuitions. 
 Makes new testable predictions about how to learn. 
 Succeeds in so learning. 
 

This is “intuition extension”: taking what we have learned somewhere else and applying it in new domains.  It is fundamentally useful to everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving problems.

<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don’t fully understand the impact of computation, as demonstrated by a lack of  big-O  analysis of new learning algorithms.  This is important—some current active research programs are fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are directly motivated by it.  When considering a learning algorithm, I think about the following questions:
  
 How does the learning algorithm scale with the number of examples  m ?  Any algorithm using all of the data is at least  O(m) , but in many cases this is  O(m 2 )  (naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown (k-means or many other optimization algorithms).  The unknown case is very common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn’t convergent or simply that the amount of computation isn’t controlled. 
 The above question can also be asked for test cases.  In some applications, test-time performance is of great importance. 
 How does the algorithm scale with the number of</p><p>4 0.8563481 <a title="95-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-03-Learning_Theory%2C_by_assumption.html">12 hunch net-2005-02-03-Learning Theory, by assumption</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One way to organize learning theory is by assumption (in the  assumption = axiom sense ), from no assumptions to many assumptions.   As you travel down this list, the statements become stronger, but the scope of applicability decreases.
  
   No assumptions 
 
  Online learning  There exist a meta prediction algorithm which compete well with the best element of any set of prediction algorithms. 
  Universal Learning  Using a “bias” of 2 - description length of turing machine  in learning is equivalent to all other computable biases up to some constant. 
  Reductions  The ability to predict well on classification problems is equivalent to the ability to predict well on many other learning problems.
 
 
 
  Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) Data 
 
  Performance Prediction  Based upon past performance, you can predict future performance. 
  Uniform Convergence  Performance prediction works even after choosing classifiers based on the data from large sets of classifiers.</p><p>5 0.84925449 <a title="95-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-27-Not_goal_metrics.html">98 hunch net-2005-07-27-Not goal metrics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the confusing things about research is that progress is very hard to measure.  One of the consequences of being in a hard-to-measure environment is that the wrong things are often measured.  
  
  Lines of Code  The classical example of this phenomenon is the old lines-of-code-produced metric for programming.  It is easy to imagine systems for producing many lines of code with very little work that accomplish very little. 
  Paper count  In academia, a “paper count” is an analog of “lines of code”, and it suffers from the same failure modes.  The obvious failure mode here is that we end up with a large number of uninteresting papers since people end up spending a lot of time optimizing this metric. 
  Complexity  Another metric, is “complexity” (in the eye of a reviewer) of a paper.  There is a common temptation to make a method appear more complex than it is in order for reviewers to judge it worthy of publication.  The failure mode here is unclean thinking.

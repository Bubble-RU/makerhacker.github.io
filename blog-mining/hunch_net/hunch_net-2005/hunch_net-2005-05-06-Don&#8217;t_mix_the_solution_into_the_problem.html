<p>Introduction: This post is about a reductions-related problem that I find mysterious. There
are two kinds of reductions analysis currently under consideration.Error
limiting reductions. Here, the goal is to bound the error rate of the created
classifier in terms of the error rate of the binary classifiers that you
reduce to. A very simple example of this is thaterror correcting output
codeswhere it is possible to prove that for certain codes, the multiclass
error rate is at most 4 * the binary classifier error rate.Regret minimizing
reductions. Here, the goal is to bound theregretof the created classifier in
terms of theregretof the binary classifiers reduced to. The regret is the
error rate minus the minimum error rate. When the learning problem is noisy
the minimum error rate may not be0. An analagous result for reget is that for
aprobabilistic error correcting output code, multiclass regret is at most 4 *
(binary regret)0.5.The use of "regret" is more desirable than the use of error
rates, becaus</p><p>3 0.12897947 <a title="67-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-26-Machine_Learning_is_too_easy.html">347 hunch net-2009-03-26-Machine Learning is too easy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is. The
viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models,
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etcâ€¦ share
little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within
one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.There are
two fundamental reasons why this is possible.For many problems, many
approaches work in the sense that they do something useful. This is true
empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different
approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor. It's also
true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in
a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors
does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples.There
is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field. In many other areas
there are unifying p</p><p>4 0.1137517 <a title="67-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-21-Research_Styles_in_Machine_Learning.html">44 hunch net-2005-03-21-Research Styles in Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is a field with an impressively diverse set of reseearch
styles. Understanding this may be important in appreciating what you see at a
conference.Engineering. How can I solve this problem? People in the
engineering research style try to solve hard problems directly by any means
available and then describe how they did it. This is typical of problem-
specific conferences and communities.Scientific. What are the principles for
solving learning problems? People in this research style test techniques on
many different problems. This is fairly common at ICML and NIPS.Mathematical.
How can the learning problem be mathematically understood? People in this
research style prove theorems with implications for learning but often do not
implement (or test algorithms). COLT is a typical conference for this
style.Many people manage to cross these styles, and that is often
beneficial.Whenver we list a set of alternative, it becomes natural to think
"which is best?" In this case of le</p><p>5 0.11122604 <a title="67-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-18-Necessary_and_Sufficient_Research.html">370 hunch net-2009-09-18-Necessary and Sufficient Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea
how to solve. In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to
decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a
solution to the larger problem. This approach can go wrong in several
ways.Decomposition failure. The solution to the decomposition does not in fact
yield a solution to the overall problem.Artificial hardness. The subproblems
created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are
harder than necessary.As you can see, computational complexity forms a
relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach
sufficient but not necessary.In my experience, the artificial hardness problem
is very common. Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a
problem to work on to other people. This process starts very naturally as a

<p>Introduction: This title is a lie, but it is a special lie which has a bit of
truth.Ifnplayers each play each other, you have a tournament. How do you order
the players from weakest to strongest?The standard first attempt is "find the
ordering which agrees with the tournament on as many player pairs as
possible". This is called the "minimum feedback arcset" problem in the CS
theory literature and it is a well known NP-hard problem. A basic guarantee
holds for the solution to this problem: if there is some "true" intrinsic
ordering, and the outcome of the tournament disagreesktimes (due to noise for
instance), then the output ordering will disagree with the original ordering
on at most2kedges (and no solution can be better).One standard approach to
tractably solving an NP-hard problem is to find another algorithm with an
approximation guarantee. For example,Don Coppersmith,Lisa FleischerandAtri
Rudraproved thatordering players according to the number of wins is a
5-approximation to the NP-hard proble</p><p>3 0.69782174 <a title="67-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-21-Problem%3A_Cross_Validation.html">26 hunch net-2005-02-21-Problem: Cross Validation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The essential problem here is the large gap between experimental observation
and theoretical understanding.MethodK-fold cross validation is a commonly used
technique which takes a set ofmexamples and partitions them intoKsets
("folds") of sizem/K. For each fold, a classifier is trained on the other
folds and then test on the fold.ProblemAssume only independent samples. Derive
a classifier from the K classifiers with a small bound on the true error
rate.Past Work(I'll add more as I remember/learn.)Devroye, Rogers, and Wagner
analyzed cross validation and found algorithm specific bounds. Not all of this
is online, but here is onepaper.Michael KearnsandDana Ronanalyzed cross
validationand found that under additional stability assumptions the bound for
the classifier which learns on all the data is not much worse than for a test
set of sizem/K.Avrim Blum,Adam Kalai, andmyselfanalyzed cross validationand

<p>Introduction: A common defect of many pieces of research is defining the problem in terms of
the solution. Here are some examples in learning:"The learning problem is
finding a good seperating hyperplane.""The goal of learning is to
minimize(y-p)2+ C w2wherey= the observation,p= the prediction andw= a
parameter vector."Defining thelossfunction to be the one that your algorithm
optimizes rather than the one imposed by the world.The fundamental reason why
this is a defect is that it creates artificial boundaries to problem solution.
Artificial boundaries lead to the possibility of being blind-sided. For
example, someone committing (1) or (2) above might find themselves themselves
surprised to find a decision tree working well on a problem. Example (3) might
result in someone else solving a learning problem better for real world
purposes, even if it's worse with respect to the algorithm optimization. This
defect should be avoided so as to not artificially limit your learning

<p>Introduction: IJCAIis running January 6-12 in Hyderabad India rather than a more traditional
summer date. (Presumably, this is to avoid melting people in the Indian
summer.)The paper deadline(June 23 abstract / June 30 submission) are
particularly inconvenient if you attendCOLTorICML. But on the other hand, it's
a good excuse to visit India.</p><p>3 0.9986859 <a title="67-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-27-Watchword%3A_Supervised_Learning.html">299 hunch net-2008-04-27-Watchword: Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently discovered that supervised learning is a controversial term. The
two definitions are:Known LossSupervised learning corresponds to the situation
where you have unlabeled examples plus knowledge of the loss of each possible
predicted choice. This is the definition I'm familiar and comfortable with.
One reason to prefer this definition is that the analysis of sample complexity
for this class of learning problems are all pretty similar.Any kind of
signalSupervised learning corresponds to the situation where you have
unlabeled examples plus any source of side information about what the right
choice is. This notion of supervised learning seems to subsume reinforcement
learning, which makes me uncomfortable, because it means there are two words
for the same class. This also means there isn't a convenient word to describe
the first definition.Reviews suggest there are people who are dedicated to the
second definition out there, so it can be important to discriminate which you
mean.</p><p>4 0.9986493 <a title="67-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-29-Academic_Mechanism_Design.html">48 hunch net-2005-03-29-Academic Mechanism Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of "mechanism design": setting up the
structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane
things (rather than obviously counterproductive things). Application of this
principle to academic research may be fruitful.What is misdesigned about
academic research?TheJMLGguides give many hints.The common nature ofbad
reviewingalso suggests the system isn't working optimally.There are many ways
to experimentally"cheat" in machine learning.Funding Prisoner's Delimma. Good
researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing
research. Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant
proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written. This is
essentially a "prisoner's delimma": anyone not writing grant proposals loses,
but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction. If everyone
wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution of funding
would occur, and time w</p><p>5 0.99864137 <a title="67-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-26-ML_Symposium_and_Strata-Hadoop_World.html">475 hunch net-2012-10-26-ML Symposium and Strata-Hadoop World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheNew York ML symposiumwas last Friday. There were 303 registrations, up a
bit fromlast year. I particularly enjoyed talks byBill Freemanon vision and
ML,Jon Lenchneron strategy in Jeopardy, andTara N. Sainathand Brian Kingsbury
ondeep learning for speech recognition. If anyone has suggestions or thoughts
for next year, please speak up.I also attendedStrata + Hadoop Worldfor the
first time. This is primarily a trade conference rather than an academic
conference, but I found it pretty interesting as a first time attendee. This
is ground zero for theBig databuzzword, and I see now why. It's about data,
and the word "big" is so ambiguous that everyone can lay claim to it. There
were essentially zero academic talks. Instead, the focus was on war stories,
product announcements, and education. The general level of education is much
lower--explaining Machine Learning to the SQL educated is the primary
operating point. Nevertheless that's happening, and the fact that machine
learning is consi</p><p>6 0.99812937 <a title="67-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-09-Some_NIPS_papers.html">138 hunch net-2005-12-09-Some NIPS papers</a></p>

At snowbird, the talk on  Sum-Product  networks by  Hoifung Poon  stood out to me ( Pedro Domingos  is a coauthor.).

As an algorithm, this is noticeably cleaner than deep belief networks with a claim to being an order of magnitude faster and working better on an image completion task.

<p>Introduction: Parallel machine learning is a subject rarely addressed at machine learning conferences.  Nevertheless, it seems likely to increase in importance because:
  
 Data set sizes appear to be growing substantially faster than computation.  Essentially, this happens because more and more sensors of various sorts are being hooked up to the internet. 
 Serial speedups of processors seem are relatively stalled.  The new trend is to make processors more powerful by making them  multicore .
 
 Both  AMD  and  Intel  are making dual core designs standard, with plans for more parallelism in the future. 
 IBM’s  Cell processor  has (essentially) 9 cores. 
 Modern graphics chips can have an order of magnitude more separate execution units. 
 

The meaning of ‘core’ varies a bit from processor to processor, but the overall trend seems quite clear.

 
  
So, how do we parallelize machine learning algorithms?
  
 The simplest and most common technique is to simply run the same learning algorithm with di</p><p>4 0.12386163 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-20-The_Large_Scale_Learning_Survey_Tutorial.html">442 hunch net-2011-08-20-The Large Scale Learning Survey Tutorial</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Ron Bekkerman  initiated an effort to create an  edited book on parallel machine learning  that  Misha  and I have been helping with.  The breadth of efforts to parallelize machine learning surprised me: I was only aware of a small fraction initially.
 
This put us in a unique position, with knowledge of a wide array of different efforts, so it is natural to put together a  survey tutorial on the subject of parallel learning  for  KDD , tomorrow.  This tutorial is  not  limited to the book itself however, as several interesting new algorithms have come out since we started inviting chapters.  
 
This tutorial should interest anyone trying to use machine learning on significant quantities of data, anyone interested in developing algorithms for such, and of course who has bragging rights to the fastest learning algorithm on planet earth   
 
(Also note the Modeling with Hadoop tutorial just before ours which deals with one way of trying to speed up learning algorithms.  We have almost no</p><p>5 0.12353014 <a title="54-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-18-Parallel_ML_primitives.html">346 hunch net-2009-03-18-Parallel ML primitives</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Previously, we discussed  parallel machine learning  a bit.  As parallel ML is rather difficult, I’d like to describe my thinking at the moment, and ask for advice from the rest of the world.  This is particularly relevant right now, as I’m attending a workshop tomorrow on parallel ML.
 
Parallelizing slow algorithms seems uncompelling.  Parallelizing many algorithms also seems uncompelling, because the effort required to parallelize is substantial.  This leaves the question: Which one fast algorithm is the best to parallelize?  What is a substantially different second?
 
One compellingly fast simple algorithm is online gradient descent on a linear representation.  This is the core of Leon’s  sgd  code and  Vowpal Wabbit .   Antoine Bordes  showed a variant was competitive in the  large scale learning challenge .  It’s also a decades old primitive which has been reused in many algorithms, and continues to be reused.  It also applies to online  learning  rather than just online  optimiz</p><p>6 0.09556289 <a title="54-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-04-More_Presentation_Preparation.html">307 hunch net-2008-07-04-More Presentation Preparation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Geoff Gordon made an interesting presentation at the  snowbird learning workshop  discussing the use of no-regret algorithms for the use of several robot-related learning problems.    There seems to be a draft  here .  This seems interesting in two ways:
  
  Drawback Removal  One of the significant problems with these online algorithms is that they can’t cope with structure very easily.  This drawback is addressed for certain structures. 
  Experiments  One criticism of such algorithms is that they are too “worst case”.   Several experiments suggest that protecting yourself against this worst case does not necessarily incur a great loss.</p><p>5 0.47887173 <a title="54-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-04-More_Presentation_Preparation.html">307 hunch net-2008-07-04-More Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We’ve discussed  presentation preparation before , but I have one more thing to add:  transitioning .  For a research presentation, it is substantially helpful for the audience if transitions are clear.  A common outline for a research presentation in machine leanring is:
  
  The problem .  Presentations which don’t describe the problem almost immediately lose people, because the context is missing to understand the detail. 
  Prior relevant work .  In many cases, a paper builds on some previous bit of work which must be understood in order to understand what the paper does.  A common failure mode seems to be spending too much time on prior work.  Discuss just the relevant aspects of prior work in the language of your work.  Sometimes this is missing when unneeded. 
  What we did . For theory papers in particular, it is often not possible to really cover the details.  Prioritizing what you present can be very important. 
  How it worked .  Many papers in Machine Learning have some sor</p><p>6 0.47285342 <a title="54-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-20-The_Workshop_on_Cores%2C_Clusters%2C_and_Clouds.html">404 hunch net-2010-08-20-The Workshop on Cores, Clusters, and Clouds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: 2012 was a tumultuous year for me, but it was undeniably a great year for deep learning efforts.  Signs of this include:
  
 Winning a  Kaggle competition . 
 Wide adoption of  deep learning for speech recognition . 
 Significant  industry support . 
 Gains in  image   recognition . 
  
This is a rare event in research: a significant capability breakout.  Congratulations are definitely in order for those who managed to achieve it.  At this point, deep learning algorithms seem like a choice undeniably worth investigating for real applications with significant data.</p><p>3 0.72105068 <a title="54-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-16-MLSS_2008.html">273 hunch net-2007-11-16-MLSS 2008</a></p>
<p>Introduction: … is in Kioloa, Australia from March 3 to March 14.  It’s a great chance to learn something about Machine Learning and I’ve enjoyed several  previous Machine Learning Summer Schools .

<p>Introduction: We are releasing the  Vowpal Wabbit (Fast Online Learning) code  as open source under a BSD (revised) license.  This is a  project at Yahoo! Research  to build a useful large scale learning algorithm which  Lihong Li ,  Alex Strehl , and I have been working on.
 
To appreciate the meaning of “large”, it’s useful to define “small” and “medium”.  A “small” supervised learning problem is one where a human could use a labeled dataset and come up with a reasonable predictor.  A “medium” supervised learning problem dataset fits into the RAM of a modern desktop computer.  A “large” supervised learning problem is one which does not fit into the RAM of a normal machine.  VW tackles large scale learning problems by this definition of large.  I’m not aware of any other open source Machine Learning tools which can handle this scale (although they may exist).  A few close ones are:

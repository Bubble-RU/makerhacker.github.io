<p>Introduction: Previously, we discussedparallel machine learninga bit. As parallel ML is
rather difficult, I'd like to describe my thinking at the moment, and ask for
advice from the rest of the world. This is particularly relevant right now, as
I'm attending a workshop tomorrow on parallel ML.Parallelizing slow algorithms
seems uncompelling. Parallelizing many algorithms also seems uncompelling,
because the effort required to parallelize is substantial. This leaves the
question: Which one fast algorithm is the best to parallelize? What is a
substantially different second?One compellingly fast simple algorithm is
online gradient descent on a linear representation. This is the core of
Leon'ssgdcode andVowpal Wabbit.Antoine Bordesshowed a variant was competitive
in thelarge scale learning challenge. It's also a decades old primitive which
has been reused in many algorithms, and continues to be reused. It also
applies to onlinelearningrather than just onlineoptimization, implying the

<p>Introduction: Ron Bekkermaninitiated an effort to create anedited book on parallel machine
learningthatMishaand I have been helping with. The breadth of efforts to
parallelize machine learning surprised me: I was only aware of a small
fraction initially.This put us in a unique position, with knowledge of a wide
array of different efforts, so it is natural to put together asurvey tutorial
on the subject of parallel learningforKDD, tomorrow. This tutorial
isnotlimited to the book itself however, as several interesting new algorithms
have come out since we started inviting chapters.This tutorial should interest
anyone trying to use machine learning on significant quantities of data,
anyone interested in developing algorithms for such, and of course who has
bragging rights to the fastest learning algorithm on planet earth(Also note
the Modeling with Hadoop tutorial just before ours which deals with one way of
trying to speed up learning algorithms. We have almost no overlap.)</p><p>4 0.11290443 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-26-Parallel_Machine_Learning_Problems.html">229 hunch net-2007-01-26-Parallel Machine Learning Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Parallel machine learning is a subject rarely addressed at machine learning
conferences. Nevertheless, it seems likely to increase in importance
because:Data set sizes appear to be growing substantially faster than
computation. Essentially, this happens because more and more sensors of
various sorts are being hooked up to the internet.Serial speedups of
processors seem are relatively stalled. The new trend is to make processors
more powerful by making themmulticore.BothAMDandIntelare making dual core
designs standard, with plans for more parallelism in the future.IBM'sCell
processorhas (essentially) 9 cores.Modern graphics chips can have an order of
magnitude more separate execution units.The meaning of 'core' varies a bit
from processor to processor, but the overall trend seems quite clear.So, how
do we parallelize machine learning algorithms?The simplest and most common
technique is to simply run the same learning algorithm with different
parameters on different processors. Cluster m</p><p>5 0.091908768 <a title="54-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-04-Watchword%3A_model.html">135 hunch net-2005-12-04-Watchword: model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In everyday use a model is a system which explains the behavior of some
system, hopefully at the level where some alteration of the model predicts
some alteration of the real-world system. In machine learning "model" has
several variant definitions.Everyday. The common definition is sometimes
used.Parameterized. Sometimes model is a short-hand for "parameterized model".
Here, it refers to a model with unspecified free parameters. In the Bayesian
learning approach, you typically have a prior over (everyday)
models.Predictive. Even further from everyday use is the predictive model.
Examples of this are "my model is a decision tree" or "my model is a support
vector machine". Here, there is no real sense in which an SVM explains the
underlying process. For example, an SVM tells us nothing in particular about
how alterations to the real-world system would create a change.Which
definition is being used at any particular time is important information. For
example, if it's a parameterized or p</p><p>6 0.088648871 <a title="54-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-07-The_Call_of_the_Deep.html">201 hunch net-2006-08-07-The Call of the Deep</a></p>

<p>Introduction: While everyone is silently working on ICML submissions, I found this
discussion about afast physics simulatorchip interesting from a learning
viewpoint. In many cases, learning attempts to predict the outcome of physical
processes. Access to a fast simulator for these processes might be quite
helpful in predicting the outcome. Bayesian learning in particular may
directly benefit while many other algorithms (like support vector machines)
might have their speed greatly increased.The biggest drawback is that writing
software for these odd architectures is always difficult and time consuming,
but a several-orders-of-magnitude speedup might make that worthwhile.</p><p>6 0.48338208 <a title="54-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-12-13-Vowpal_Wabbit_version_6.1_%26%23038%3B_the_NIPS_tutorial.html">451 hunch net-2011-12-13-Vowpal Wabbit version 6.1 &#038; the NIPS tutorial</a></p>

information onthe program.The Simons Institute has created a number of
"Research Fellowships" for youngresearchers (within at most six years of the
award of their PhD) who wish toparticipate in Institute programs, including
the Big Data program. Individualswho already hold postdoctoral positions or
who are junior faculty are welcometo apply, as are finishing PhDs.Please note
that the application deadline is January 15, 2013. Further detailsare

<p>Introduction: I just madeversion 6.1ofVowpal Wabbit. Relative to6.0, there are few new
features, but many refinements.The cluster parallel learning code better
supports multiple simultaneous runs, and other forms of parallelism have been
mostly removed. This incidentally significantly simplifies the learning
core.The online learning algorithms are more general, with support for l1(via
a truncated gradient variant) and l2regularization, and a generalized form of
variable metric learning.There is a solid persistent server mode which can
train online, as well as serve answers to many simultaneous queries, either in
text or binary.This should be a very good release if you are just getting
started, as we've made it compile more automatically out of the box, have
several newexamplesand updated documentation.Aspertradition, we're planning to
do a tutorial at NIPS during the break at theparallel learning workshopat 2pm
Spanish time Friday. I'll cover the basics, leaving the fun stuff for
others.Mirowill cov</p><p>6 0.66044194 <a title="54-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-06-Branch_Prediction_Competition.html">190 hunch net-2006-07-06-Branch Prediction Competition</a></p>

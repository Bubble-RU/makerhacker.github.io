<p>Introduction: Let me kick things off by posing this question to ML researchers:What do you
think are some important holy grails of machine learning?For example:- "A
classifier with SVM-level performance but much more scalable"- "Practical
confidence bounds (or learning bounds) for classification"- "A reinforcement
learning algorithm that can handle the ___ problem"- "Understanding
theoretically why ___ works so well in practice"etc.I pose this question
because I believe that when goals are stated explicitly and well (thus
providing clarity as well as opening up the problems to more people), rather
than left implicit, they are likely to be achieved much more quickly. I would
also like to know more about the internal goals of the various machine
learning sub-areas (theory, kernel methods, graphical models, reinforcement
learning, etc) as stated by people in these respective areas. This could help
people cross sub-areas.</p><p>4 0.12587522 <a title="100-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-29-AI_Safety.html">380 hunch net-2009-11-29-AI Safety</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Reevesintroduced me toMichael Vassarwho ran theSingularity Summitand
educated me a bit on the subject of AI safety which theSingularity
Institutehassmall grants for.I still believe thatinterstellar space travel is
necessary for long term civilization survival, and the AI is necessary for
interstellar space travel. On these grounds alone, we could judge that
developing AI is much more safe than not. Nevertheless, there is a basic
reasonable fear, as expressed by some commenters, that AI could go bad.A basic
scenario starts with someone inventing an AI and telling it to make as much
money as possible. The AI promptly starts trading in various markets to make
money. To improve, it crafts a virus that takes over most of the world's
computers using it as a surveillance network so that it can always make the
right decision. The AI also branches out into any form of distance work,
taking over the entire outsourcing process for all jobs that are entirely
digital. To further improve, the AI</p><p>5 0.12483467 <a title="100-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-05-What_is_state%3F.html">169 hunch net-2006-04-05-What is state?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In reinforcement learning (and sometimes other settings), there is a notion of
"state". Based upon the state various predictions are made such as "Which
action should be taken next?" or "How much cumulative reward do I expect if I
take some action from this state?" Given the importance of state, it is
important to examine the meaning. There are actually several distinct options
and it turns out the definition variation is very important in motivating
different pieces of work.Newtonian State. State is the physical pose of the
world. Under this definition, there areverymany states, often too many for
explicit representation. This is also the definition typically used in
games.Abstracted State. State is an abstracted physical state of the world.

is much smaller here. A basic issue here is: "How do you compute the state
from observations?"Mathematical State. State is a sufficient statistic of

<p>Introduction: In research, it's often the case that solving a problem helps you realize that
it wasn't the right problem to solve. This is the case for the "reduce RL to
classification" problem with the solution hinted athereand turned into a
paperhere.The essential difficulty is that the method of stating and analyzing
reductions ends up being nonalgorithmic (unlike previous reductions) unless
you work with learning from teleoperated robots asGreg Grudicdoes. The
difficulty here is due to the reduction being dependent on the optimal policy
(which a human teleoperator might simulate, but which is otherwise
unavailable).So, thisproblemis "open" again with the caveat that this time we
want a more algorithmic solution.Whether or not this is feasible at all is
still unclear and evidence in either direction would greatly interest me. A
positive answer might have many practical implications in the long run.</p><p>4 0.60686404 <a title="100-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-05-What_is_state%3F.html">169 hunch net-2006-04-05-What is state?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TheInternational Planning Competition(IPC) is a biennial event organized in
the context of theInternational Conference on Automated Planning and
Scheduling(ICAPS). This year, for the first time, there will a learning track
of the competition. For more information you can go to the competitionweb-
site.The competitions are typically organized around a number of planning
domains that can vary from year to year, where a planning domain is simply a
class of problems that share a common action schema--e.g. Blocksworld is a
well-known planning domain that contains a problem instance each possible
initial tower configuration and goal configuration. Some other domains have
included Logistics, Airport, Freecell, PipesWorld, and manyothers. For each
domain the competition includes a number of problems (say 40-50) and the
planners are run on each problem with a time limit for each problem (around 30
minutes). The problems are hard enough that many problems are not solved
within the time limit.Giv</p><p>6 0.57950896 <a title="100-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-08-Apprenticeship_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Control.html">101 hunch net-2005-08-08-Apprenticeship Reinforcement Learning for Control</a></p>

<p>Introduction: TheNYAS ML symposiumgrew again this year to 170 participants, despite the need
to outsmart or otherwise tunnel througha crowd.Perhaps the most distinct talk
was by Bob Bell on various aspects of theNetflix prizecompetition. I also
enjoyed several student posters includingMatt Hoffman's cool examples of blind
source separation for music.I'm somewhat surprised how much the workshop has
grown, as it is now comparable in size to a small conference, although in
style more similar to a workshop. At some point as an event grows, it becomes
owned by the community rather than the organizers, so if anyone has
suggestions on improving it, speak up and be heard.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.87503552 <a title="100-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-04-Why_Reinforcement_Learning_is_Important.html">100 hunch net-2005-08-04-Why Reinforcement Learning is Important</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One prescription for solving a problem well is:State the problem, in the
simplest way possible. In particular, this statement should involve no
contamination with or anticipation of the solution.Think about solutions to
the stated problem.Stating a problem in a succinct and crisp manner tends to
invite a simple elegant solution. When a problem can not be stated succinctly,
we wonder if the problem is even understood. (And when a problem is not
understood, we wonder if a solution can be meaningful.)Reinforcement learning
does step (1) well. It provides a clean simple language to state general AI
problems. In reinforcement learning there is a set of actionsA, a set of
observationsO, and a rewardr. The reinforcement learning problem, in general,
is defined by a conditional measureD( o, r | (o,r,a)*)which produces an
observationoand a rewardrgiven a history(o,r,a)*. The goal in reinforcement
learning is to find a policypi:(o,r,a)*-> amapping histories to actions so as
to maximize (or appro</p><p>3 0.84865719 <a title="100-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-28-A_COLT_paper.html">85 hunch net-2005-06-28-A COLT paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found Tong Zhang's paper onData Dependent Concentration Bounds for
Sequential Prediction Algorithmsinteresting. Roughly speaking, it states a
tight bound on the future error rate for online learning algorithms assuming
that samples are drawn independently. This bound is easily computed and will
make the progressive validation approaches usedheresignificantly more
practical.</p><p>4 0.80607277 <a title="100-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-16-Regularization_%3D_Robustness.html">185 hunch net-2006-06-16-Regularization = Robustness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Gibbs-Jaynes theorem is a classical result that tells us that the highest
entropy distribution (most uncertain, least committed, etc.) subject to
expectation constraints on a set of features is an exponential family
distribution with the features as sufficient statistics. In math,argmax_p
H(p)s.t. E_p[f_i] = c_iis given by e^{\sum \lambda_i f_i}/Z. (Z here is the
necessary normalization constraint, and the lambdas are free parameters we set
to meet the expectation constraints).A great deal of statistical mechanics
flows from this result, and it has proven very fruitful in learning as well.
(Motivating work in models in text learning and Conditional Random Fields, for
instance. ) The result has been demonstrated a number of ways. One of the most
elegant is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“geometricÃ¢â‚¬Â versionhere.In the case when the
expectation constraints come from data, this tells us that the maximum entropy
distribution is exactly the maximum likelihood distribution in the exponential
family. ItÃ</p><p>5 0.6399228 <a title="100-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-03-Bidding_Problems.html">315 hunch net-2008-09-03-Bidding Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers
is via bidding, which has steps something like:Invite people to reviewAccept
papersReviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are
interested in reviewing.Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get
approximately the papers they bid for.At the ICML business meeting,Andrew
McCallumsuggested getting rid of bidding for papers. A couple reasons were
given:PrivacyThe title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to
every participating reviewer. Some authors might be uncomfortable about this
for submitted papers. I'm not sympathetic to this reason: the point of
submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not
publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited.CliquesA bidding
system is gameable. If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your
submissions, you can each bid for your friend's papers and express a
disinterest in others. There</p><p>6 0.53741467 <a title="100-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-24-Top_graduates_this_season.html">384 hunch net-2009-12-24-Top graduates this season</a></p>

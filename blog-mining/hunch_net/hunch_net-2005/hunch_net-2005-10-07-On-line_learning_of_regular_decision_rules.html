<p>Introduction: After amajor financial crisis, there is much discussion about howfinance has
become a casinogambling with other's money, keeping the winnings, and walking
away when the money is lost.When thinking about financial reform, all the many
losers in the above scenario are apt to take the view that this activity
should be completely, or nearly completely curtailed. But, a more thoughtful
view is that sometimes there is a real sense in which there are right and
wrong decisions, and we as a society would really prefer that the people most
likely to make right decisions are making them. A crucial question then is:
"What is the difference between gambling and rewarding good
prediction?"Wediscussed this before the financial crisis. The cheat-sheet
sketch is that the online learning against an adversary problem, algorithm,
and theorems, provide a good mathematical model for thinking about this
question. What I would like to do here is map this onto various types of
financial transactions. The basic</p><p>3 0.13796321 <a title="118-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-26-Watchword%3A_Probability.html">5 hunch net-2005-01-26-Watchword: Probability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Probability is one of the most confusingly used words in machine learning.
There are at least 3 distinct ways the word is used.BayesianThe Bayesian
notion of probability is a 'degree of belief'. The degree of belief that some
event (i.e. "stock goes up" or "stock goes down") occurs can be measured by
asking a sequence of questions of the form "Would you bet the stock goes up or
down atYto 1 odds?" A consistent better will switch from 'for' to 'against' at
some single value ofY. The probability is thenY/(Y+1). Bayesian probabilities
express lack of knowledge rather than randomization. They are useful in
learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly
makes the learning algorithms work better. Bayesian Learning uses
'probability' in this way exclusively.FrequentistThe Frequentist notion of
probability is a rate of occurence. A rate of occurrence can be measured by
doing an experiment many times. If an event occursktimes innexperiments then
it has probability ab</p><p>4 0.13718192 <a title="118-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-26-To_calibrate_or_not%3F.html">62 hunch net-2005-04-26-To calibrate or not?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A calibrated predictor is one which predicts the probability of a binary event
with the property: For all predictionsp, the proportion of the time that1is
observed isp.Since there are infinitely manyp, this definition must be
"softened" to make sense for any finite number of samples. The standard method
for "softening" is to consider all predictions in a small neighborhood about
each possiblep.A great deal of effort has been devoted to strategies for
achieving calibrated (such ashere) prediction. With statements like: (under
minimal conditions) you can always make calibrated predictions.Given the
strength of these statements, we might conclude we are done, but that would be
a "confusion of ends". A confusion of ends arises in the following way:We want
good probabilistic predictions.Good probabilistic predictions are
calibrated.Therefore, we want calibrated predictions.The "Therefore" step
misses the fact that calibration is a necessary but not

<p>Introduction: This post is really for peoplenotin machine learning (or related fields). It
is about a common misperception which affects people who have not thought
about the process of trying to predict somethinng. Hopefully, by precisely
stating it, we can remove it.Suppose we have a set of events, each described
by a vector of features.01011101011101000111110011000101110Suppose we want to
predict the value of the first feature given the others. One approach is to
bin the data byonefeature. For the above example, we might partition the data
according to feature 2, then observe that when feature 2 is 0 the label
(feature 1) is mostly 1. On the other hand, when feature 2 is 1, the label
(feature 1) is mostly 0. Using this simple rule we get an observed error rate
of 3/7.There are two issues here. The first is that this is really a training
error rate, and (hence) may be an overoptimistic prediction. This is not a
very serious issue as long as there are a reasonable number of representative
examples.</p><p>6 0.082366996 <a title="118-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-24-Specializations_of_the_Master_Problem.html">388 hunch net-2010-01-24-Specializations of the Master Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sam Roweis's comment reminds me of a more general issue that comes up in doing
research: abstractions always break.Real number's aren't. Most real numbers
can not be represented with any machine. One implication of this is that many
real-number based algorithms have difficulties when implemented with floating
point numbers.The box on your desk is not a turing machine. A turing machine
can compute anything computable, given sufficient time. A typical computer
fails terribly when the state required for the computation exceeds some
limit.Nash equilibria aren't equilibria. This comes up when trying to predict
human behavior based on the result of the equilibria computation. Often, it
doesn't work.Theprobabilityisn't. Probability is an abstraction expressing
either our lack of knowledge (the Bayesian viewpoint) or fundamental
randomization (the frequentist viewpoint). From the frequentist viewpoint the
lack of knowledge typically precludes actually knowing the fundamental
randomization. Fro</p><p>6 0.49022213 <a title="118-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-07-A_NIPS_paper.html">330 hunch net-2008-12-07-A NIPS paper</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This workshop asks for insights how far we may/can push the theoretical
boundary of using data in the design of learning machines. Can we express our
classification rule in terms of the sample, or do we have to stick to a core
assumption of classical statistical learning theory, namely that the
hypothesis space is to be defined independent from the sample? This workshop
is particularly interested in - but not restricted to - the 'luckiness
framework' and the recently introduced notion of 'compatibility functions' in
a semi-supervised learning context (more information can be found
athttp://www.kuleuven.be/wehys).</p><p>2 0.91545624 <a title="118-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-17-Reopening_RL-%3EClassification.html">82 hunch net-2005-06-17-Reopening RL->Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In research, it's often the case that solving a problem helps you realize that
it wasn't the right problem to solve. This is the case for the "reduce RL to
classification" problem with the solution hinted athereand turned into a
paperhere.The essential difficulty is that the method of stating and analyzing
reductions ends up being nonalgorithmic (unlike previous reductions) unless
you work with learning from teleoperated robots asGreg Grudicdoes. The
difficulty here is due to the reduction being dependent on the optimal policy
(which a human teleoperator might simulate, but which is otherwise
unavailable).So, thisproblemis "open" again with the caveat that this time we
want a more algorithmic solution.Whether or not this is feasible at all is
still unclear and evidence in either direction would greatly interest me. A
positive answer might have many practical implications in the long run.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.91409516 <a title="118-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-07-On-line_learning_of_regular_decision_rules.html">118 hunch net-2005-10-07-On-line learning of regular decision rules</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many decision problems can be represented in the formFORn=1,2,â&euro;Ś:-- Reality
chooses a datumxn.-- Decision Maker chooses his decisiondn.-- Reality chooses
an observationyn.-- Decision Maker suffers lossL(yn,dn).END FOR.The
observationyncan be, for example, tomorrow's stock price and the decisiondnthe
number of shares Decision Maker chooses to buy. The datumxnideally contains
all information that might be relevant in making this decision. We do not want
to assume anything about the way Reality generates the observations and
data.Suppose there is a good and not too complex decision ruleDmapping each
datumxto a decisionD(x). Can we perform as well, or almost as well, asD,
without knowing it? This is essentially a special case of the problem ofon-
line learning.This is a simple result of this kind. Suppose the dataxnare
taken from [0,1] andL(y,d)=|y-d|. A norm ||h|| of a functionhon [0,1] is
defined by||h||2= (Integral01h(t)dt)2+ Integral01(h'(t))2dt.Decision Maker has

<p>Introduction: TheNew York Timeshas an article on thegrowth of spam. Interesting facts
include: 9/10 of all email is spam, spam source identification is nearly
useless due to botnet spam senders, and image based spam (emails which consist
of an image only) are on the growth.Estimates of the cost of spam are almost
certainly far to low, because they do not account for the cost in time lost by
people.The image based spam which is currently penetrating many filters should
be catchable with a more sophisticated application of machine learning
technology. For the spam I see, the rendered images come in only a few
formats, which would be easy to recognize via a support vector machine (with
RBF kernel), neural network, or even nearest-neighbor architecture. The
mechanics of setting this up to run efficiently is the only real challenge.
This is the next step in the spam war.The response to this system is to make
the image based spam even more random. We should (essentially) expect to

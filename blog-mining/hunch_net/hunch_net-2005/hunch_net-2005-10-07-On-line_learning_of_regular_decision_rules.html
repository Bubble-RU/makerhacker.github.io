</p><p>6 Suppose there is a good and not too complex decision rule  D  mapping each datum  x  to a decision  D ( x ). [sent-9, score-0.83]
</p><p>7 A norm || h || of a function  h  on [0,1] is defined by   || h || 2    =   (Integral 0  1   h ( t )  dt ) 2    +   Integral 0  1  ( h '( t )) 2   dt . [sent-14, score-0.508]
</p><p>8 Decision Maker has a strategy that guarantees, for all  N  and all  D  with finite || D ||,   Sum  n =1   N    L ( y n  , d n  )  is at most  Sum  n =1   N    L ( y n  , D ( x n  )) +   (||2 D –1|| + 1)  N  1/2 . [sent-15, score-0.135]
</p><p>9 Therefore, Decision Maker is competitive with  D  provided the “mean slope” (Integral 0  1  ( D '( t )) 2  dt ) 1/2  of  D  is significantly less than  N  1/2 . [sent-16, score-0.226]
</p><p>10 This  can be extended  to general reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of decision rules and to many other loss functions. [sent-17, score-0.458]

</p><p>12 The alternative is to define probability in terms of games rather than measure (this was started by von Mises and greatly advanced by Ville, who in 1939 replaced von Mises’s awkward gambling strategies with what he called martingales). [sent-20, score-0.764]
</p><p>13 This  game-theoretic probability  allows one to state the most important laws of probability as continuous strategies for gambling against the forecaster: the gambler becomes rich if the forecasts violate the law. [sent-21, score-0.76]

</p><p>16 Takemura’s version was about binary observations, but it has been  greatly extended  since. [sent-25, score-0.167]

<p>Introduction: Probability is one of the most confusingly used words in machine learning.  There are at least 3 distinct ways the word is used. 
  
  Bayesian  The Bayesian notion of probability is a ‘degree of belief’.   The degree of belief that some event (i.e. “stock goes up” or “stock goes down”) occurs can be measured by asking a sequence of questions of the form “Would you bet the stock goes up or down at  Y  to 1 odds?” A consistent better will switch from ‘for’ to ‘against’ at some single value of  Y .  The probability is then  Y/(Y+1) .  Bayesian probabilities express lack of knowledge rather than randomization.  They are useful in learning because we often lack knowledge and expressing that lack flexibly makes the learning algorithms work better.  Bayesian Learning uses ‘probability’ in this way exclusively. 
  Frequentist  The Frequentist notion of probability is a rate of occurence.  A rate of occurrence can be measured by doing an experiment many times.

<p>Introduction: This post is really for people  not  in machine learning (or related fields).  It is about a common misperception which affects people who have not thought about the process of trying to predict somethinng.  Hopefully, by precisely stating it, we can remove it.
 
Suppose we have a set of events, each described by a vector of features.

Suppose we want to predict the value of the first feature given the others.  One approach is to bin the data by  one  feature.  For the above example, we might partition the data according to feature 2, then observe that when feature 2 is 0 the label (feature 1) is mostly 1. On the other hand, when feature 2 is 1, the label (feature 1) is mostly 0.  Using this simple rule we get an observed error rate of 3/7.

<p>Introduction: This post is really for people  not  in machine learning (or related fields).  It is about a common misperception which affects people who have not thought about the process of trying to predict somethinng.  Hopefully, by precisely stating it, we can remove it.
 
Suppose we have a set of events, each described by a vector of features.

Suppose we want to predict the value of the first feature given the others.  One approach is to bin the data by  one  feature.  For the above example, we might partition the data according to feature 2, then observe that when feature 2 is 0 the label (feature 1) is mostly 1. On the other hand, when feature 2 is 1, the label (feature 1) is mostly 0.  Using this simple rule we get an observed error rate of 3/7.

<p>Introduction: The New York Times has an interesting  article  about how DARPA has dropped funding for computer science to universities by about a factor of 2 over the last 5 years and become less directed towards basic research.  Partially in response, the number of grant submissions to NSF has grown by a factor of 3 (with the NSF budget staying approximately constant in the interim).
 
This is the sort of policy decision which may make sense for the defense department, but which means a large hit for basic research on information technology development in the US.  For example “darpa funded the invention of the internet” is reasonably correct.  This policy decision is particularly painful in the context of NSF budget cuts and the end of extensive phone monopoly funded research at Bell labs. 
 
The good news from a learning perspective is that (based on anecdotal evidence) much of the remaining funding is aimed at learning and learning-related fields.

<p>Introduction: Many decision problems can be represented in the form 
FOR  n =1,2,…: 
— Reality chooses a datum  x n  . 
— Decision Maker chooses his decision  d n  . 
— Reality chooses an observation  y n  . 
— Decision Maker suffers loss   L ( y n  , d n  ). 
END FOR. 
The observation  y n   can be, for example, tomorrow’s stock price and the decision  d n   the number of shares Decision Maker chooses to buy.  The datum  x n   ideally contains all information that might be relevant in making this decision.  We do not want to assume anything about the way Reality generates the observations and data.
 
Suppose there is a good and not too complex decision rule  D  mapping each datum  x  to a decision  D ( x ).  Can we perform as well, or almost as well, as  D , without knowing it?  This is essentially a special case of the problem of  on-line learning .
 
This is a simple result of this kind.  Suppose the data  x n   are taken from [0,1] and  L ( y , d )=| y – d |.

<p>Introduction: A language is a set of primitives which can be combined to succesfully create complex objects.  Languages arise in all sorts of situations: mechanical construction, martial arts, communication, etc…  Languages appear to be the key to succesfully creating complex objects—it is difficult to come up with any convincing example of a complex object which is not built using some language.  Since languages are so crucial to success, it is interesting to organize various machine learning research programs by language.
 
The most common language in machine learning are languages for representing the solution to machine learning.   This includes:
  
  Bayes Nets and Graphical Models  A language for representing probability distributions.  The key concept supporting modularity is conditional independence.   Michael Kearns  has been working on extending this to game theory.

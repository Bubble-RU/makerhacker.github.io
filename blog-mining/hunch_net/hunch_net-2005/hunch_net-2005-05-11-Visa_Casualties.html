<p>Introduction: Many of the large machine learning conferences were in the US this summer.  A common problem which students from abroad encounter is visa issues. 
Just getting a visa to visit can be pretty rough: you stand around in lines, sometimes for days.  Even worse is the timing with respect to ticket buying.  Airplane tickets typically need to be bought well in advance on nonrefundable terms to secure a reasonable rate for air travel.  When a visa is denied, as happens reasonably often, a very expensive ticket is burnt.
 
A serious effort is under way to raise this as in issue in need of fixing.  Over the long term, effectively driving research conferences to locate outside of the US seems an unwise policy.

<p>Introduction: I’ve avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest.  The problem with discussing politics is that it’s customary for people to say much based upon little information.  Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa).  It’s primary election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the issues are not.
 
There are several policy decisions which substantially effect development of science and technology in the US.
  
  Education  The US has great contrasts in education.  The top universities are very good places, yet the grade school education system produces mediocre results.  For me, the contrast between a  public education  and  Caltech  was bracing.  For many others attending Caltech, it clearly was not.  Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about.  My own experience is that a basic attitude of “no child unrealized” i</p><p>6 0.081560031 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-15-The_Other_Online_Learning.html">378 hunch net-2009-11-15-The Other Online Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Chicago ’05  ended a couple of weeks ago. This was the sixth  Machine Learning Summer School , and the second one that used a  wiki . (The first was Berder ’04, thanks to Gunnar Raetsch.) Wikis are relatively easy to set up, greatly aid social interaction, and should be used a lot more at summer schools and workshops. They can even be used as the meeting’s webpage, as a permanent record of its participants’ collaborations — see for example the wiki/website for last year’s  NVO Summer School .
 
A basic wiki is a collection of editable webpages, maintained by software called a   wiki engine . The engine used at both Berder and Chicago was  TikiWiki  — it is well documented and gets you something running fast. It uses PHP and MySQL, but doesn’t require you to know either. Tikiwiki has far more features than most wikis, as it is  really a full  Content Management System . (My thanks to Sebastian Stark for pointing this out.) Here are the features we found most useful:

<p>Introduction: Ed Snelson  won the  Predictive Uncertainty in Environmental Modelling Competition  in the temp(erature) category using  this algorithm .  Some characteristics of the algorithm are:
  
 Gradient descent 
 … on about 600 parameters 
 … with local minima 
 … to solve regression. 
  
This bears a strong resemblance to a neural network.  The two main differences seem to be:
  
 The system has a probabilistic interpretation (which may aid design). 
 There are (perhaps) fewer parameters than a typical neural network might have for the same problem (aiding speed).</p><p>2 0.91323072 <a title="69-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-22-New_Blog%3A_%5BLowerbounds%2CUpperbounds%5D.html">59 hunch net-2005-04-22-New Blog: [Lowerbounds,Upperbounds]</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For the  Chicago 2005 machine learning summer school  we are organizing, at least 5 international students can not come due to visa issues.  There seem to be two aspects to visa issues:
  
  Inefficiency . The system rejected the student simply by being incapable of even  starting  to evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of time. 
  Politics . Border controls became much tighter after the September 11 attack.  Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will do that. 
  
What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem than (2).  Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa rejection.  Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry even people concerned with (2).  The obvious fixes to overload are “spend more money” and “make the system more efficient”.
 
With respect to (2), (which is a more minor issue by the numbers) it i</p><p>4 0.81364 <a title="69-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-01-A_conversation_between_Theo_and_Pat.html">176 hunch net-2006-05-01-A conversation between Theo and Pat</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pat (the practitioner)  I need to do multiclass classification and I only have a decision tree.
 
 Theo (the thoeretician)  Use an  error correcting output code .
 
 Pat  Oh, that’s cool.  But the created binary problems seem unintuitive.  I’m not sure the decision tree can solve them.
 
 Theo  Oh?  Is your problem a decision list?  
 
 Pat  No, I don’t think so.
 
 Theo  Hmm.  Are the classes well separated by axis aligned splits?
 
 Pat  Err, maybe.  I’m not sure.
 
 Theo  Well, if they are, under the IID assumption I can tell you how many samples you need.
 
 Pat  IID?  The data is definitely not IID.
 
 Theo  Oh dear.
 
 Pat  Can we get back to the choice of ECOC?  I suspect we need to build it dynamically in response to which subsets of the labels are empirically separable from each other.
 
 Theo  Ok.  What do you know about your problem?
 
 Pat  Not much.  My friend just gave me the dataset.
 
 Theo  Then, no one can help you.

<p>Introduction: from brain cancer.  I asked  Misha  who worked with him to write about it. 
  
Partha Niyogi, Louis Block Professor in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Chicago passed away on October 1, 2010, aged 43. 
 
I first met Partha Niyogi almost exactly ten years ago when I was a graduate student in math and he had just started as a faculty in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Chicago. Strangely, we first talked at length due to a somewhat convoluted mathematical argument in a paper on pattern recognition. I asked him some questions about the paper, and, even though the topic was new to him, he had put serious thought into it and we started regular meetings. We made significant progress and developed a line of research stemming initially just from trying to understand that one paper and to simplify one derivation. I think this was typical of Partha, showing both his intellectual curiosity and his intuition for the serendipitous; having a sense and focus fo</p><p>6 0.68125719 <a title="69-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-10-ML_Symposium_and_ICML_details.html">447 hunch net-2011-10-10-ML Symposium and ICML details</a></p>

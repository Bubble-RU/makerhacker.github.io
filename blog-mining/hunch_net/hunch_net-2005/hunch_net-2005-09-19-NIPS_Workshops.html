<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.
This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.
Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance
can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention. Roughly
speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your
interest. The main conference program consists of elements related to
someone's interest (which is rarely your own). Workshops are more about doing
research while conferences are more about presenting research.Several
conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due
shortly.ICML workshopsDue April 1IJCAI workshopsDeadlines VaryKDD workshopsNot
yet finalizedAnyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops
and see if any are of interest. (If none are, then maybe you should organize
one next year.)</p><p>4 0.169848 <a title="113-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>5 0.16692808 <a title="113-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-10-26-NIPS_workshops.html">375 hunch net-2009-10-26-NIPS workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many of theNIPS workshopshave a deadline about now, and the NIPSearly
registration deadline is Nov. 6. Several interest me:Adaptive Sensing, Active
Learning, and Experimental Designdue 10/27.Discrete Optimization in Machine
Learning: Submodularity, Sparsity & Polyhedra, due Nov. 6.Large-Scale Machine
Learning: Parallelism and Massive Datasets, due 10/23 (i.e. past)Analysis and
Design of Algorithms for Interactive Machine Learning, due 10/30.And I'm sure
many of the others interest others. Workshops are great as a mechanism for
research, so take a look if there is any chance you might be interested.</p><p>6 0.16441225 <a title="113-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-22-Create_Your_Own_ICML_Workshop.html">234 hunch net-2007-02-22-Create Your Own ICML Workshop</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I second thecall for workshops at ICML/COLT/UAI.Severaltimesbefore, details of
why and how to run a workshop have been mentioned.There is a simple reason to
prefer workshops here: attendance. The Helsinki colocation has placed
workshopsdirectly between ICML and COLT/UAI, which is optimal for getting
attendees from any conference. In addition,last year ICML had relatively few
workshopsand NIPS workshops were overloaded. In addition tothose that
happeneda similar number were rejected. The overload has strange consequences
--for example,the best attended workshopwasn't an official NIPS workshop.
Aside from intrinsic interest, the Deep Learning workshop benefited greatly
from being off schedule.</p><p>5 0.60009307 <a title="113-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-08-31-Extreme_Classification_workshop_at_NIPS.html">488 hunch net-2013-08-31-Extreme Classification workshop at NIPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Manikand I are organizing theextreme classificationworkshop at NIPS this year.
We have a number of good speakers lined up, but I would further encourage
anyone working in the area to submit an abstract by October 9. I believe this
is an idea whose time has now come.The NIPS website doesn't have other
workshops listed yet, but I expect several others to be of significant
interest.</p><p>6 0.57312971 <a title="113-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: An amusing tidbit (reproduced without permission) from Herman Chernoff's
delightful monograph, "Sequential analysis and optimal design":The use of
randomization raises a philosophical question which is articulated by the
following probably apocryphal anecdote.The metallurgist told his friend the
statistician how he planned to test the effect of heat on the strength of a
metal bar by sawing the bar into six pieces. The first two would go into the
hot oven, the next two into the medium oven, and the last two into the cool
oven. The statistician, horrified, explained how he should randomize to avoid
the effect of a possible gradient of strength in the metal bar. The method of
randomization was applied, and it turned out that the randomized experiment
called for putting the first two pieces into the hot oven, the next two into
the medium oven, and the last two into the cool oven. "Obviously, we can't do
that," said the metallurgist. "On the contrary, you have to do that," said the

<p>Introduction: Attendance at theNIPS workshopsis highly recommended for both research and
learning. Unfortunately, there does not yet appear to be a public list of
workshops. However, I found the following workshop webpages of
interest:Machine Learning in FinanceLearning to RankFoundations of Active
LearningMachine Learning Based Robotics in Unstructured EnvironmentsThere
aremanymore workshops. In fact, there are so many that it is not plausible
anyone can attend every workshop they are interested in. Maybe in future years
the organizers can spread them out over more days to reduce overlap.Many of
these workshops are accepting presentation proposals (due mid-October).</p><p>5 0.81046045 <a title="113-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-01-The_Role_of_Impromptu_Talks.html">88 hunch net-2005-07-01-The Role of Impromptu Talks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: COLThad an impromptu session which seemed as interesting or more interesting
than any other single technical session (despite being only an hour long).
There are several roles that an impromptu session can play
including:Announcing new work since the paper deadline. Letting this happen
now rather than later helps aid the process of research.Discussing a paper
that was rejected. Reviewers err sometimes and an impromptu session provides a
means to remedy that.Entertainment. We all like to have a bit of fun.For
design, the following seem important:Impromptu speakers should not have much
time. At COLT, it was 8 minutes, but I have seen even 5 work well.The entire
impromptu session should not last too long because the format is dense and
promotes restlessness. A half hour or hour can work well.Impromptu talks are a
mechanism to let a little bit of chaos into the schedule. They will be chaotic
in content, presentation, and usefulness. The fundamental advantage of this
chaos is that it provid</p><p>6 0.63771784 <a title="113-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-31-Vowpal_Wabbit_Open_Source_Project.html">365 hunch net-2009-07-31-Vowpal Wabbit Open Source Project</a></p>

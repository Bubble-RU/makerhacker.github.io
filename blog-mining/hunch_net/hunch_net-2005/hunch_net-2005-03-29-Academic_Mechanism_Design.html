seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last

and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not

<p>Introduction: This is about the hard choices that graduate students must make.The cultural
definition of success in academic research is to:Produce good research which
many other people appreciate.Produce many students who go on to do the
same.There are fundamental reasons why this is success in the local culture.
Good research appreciated by others means access to jobs. Many students
succesful in the same way implies that there are a number of people who think
in a similar way and appreciate your work.In order to graduate, a phd student
must live in an academic culture for a period of several years. It is common
to adopt the culture's definition of success during this time. It's also
common for many phd students discover they are not suited to an academic
research lifestyle. This collision of values and abilities naturally results
in depression.The most fundamental advice when this happens is: change
something. Pick a new advisor. Pick a new research topic. Or leave the program

<p>Introduction: Yesterday, there was a discussion aboutfuture publication models at
NIPS.YannandZoubinhave specific detailed proposals which I'll add links to
when I get them (Yann's proposalandZoubin's proposal).What struck me about the
discussion is that there are many simultaneous concerns as well as many
simultaneous proposals, which makes it difficult to keep all the distinctions
straight in a verbal conversation. It also seemed like people were serious
enough about this that we may see some real movement. Certainly, my personal
experience motivates that as I'veposted many timesabout the substantial flaws
in our review process, including some very poor personal experiences.Concerns
include the following:(Several) Reviewers are overloaded, boosting the noise
in decision making.(Yann) A new system should run with as little built-in
delay and friction to the process of research as possible.(Hanna

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT
ResearchandLucenthad one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the
remainder ofBell Labs, triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine
learning group there. As the recession progresses, we may easily see more
firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer
support research.There are a couple positives to the recession as well.Both
the implosion of Wall Street (which siphoned off smart people) and the general
difficulty of getting a job coming out of an undergraduate education suggest
that the quality of admitted phd</p><p>4 0.67510301 <a title="48-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-28-The_Coming_Patent_Apocalypse.html">241 hunch net-2007-04-28-The Coming Patent Apocalypse</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in computer science believe that patents are problematic. The
truth is even worse--the patent system in the US is fundamentally broken in
ways that will require much more significant reform thanis being considered
now.The myth of the patent is the following: Patents are a mechanism for
inventors to be compensated according to the value of their inventions while
making the invention available to all. This myth sounds pretty desirable, but
the reality is a strange distortion slowly leading towards collapse.There are
many problems associated with patents, but I would like to focus on just two
of them:Patent TrollsThe way that patents have generally worked over the last
several decades is that they were a tool of large companies. Large companies
would amass a large number of patents and then cross-license each other's
patents--in effect saying "we agree to owe each other nothing". Smaller
companies would sometimes lose in this game, essentially because they didn't
have enough p</p><p>5 0.67484796 <a title="48-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-05-Funding_Research.html">36 hunch net-2005-03-05-Funding Research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of "mechanism design": setting up the
structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane
things (rather than obviously counterproductive things). Application of this
principle to academic research may be fruitful.What is misdesigned about
academic research?TheJMLGguides give many hints.The common nature ofbad
reviewingalso suggests the system isn't working optimally.There are many ways
to experimentally"cheat" in machine learning.Funding Prisoner's Delimma. Good
researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing
research. Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant
proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written. This is
essentially a "prisoner's delimma": anyone not writing grant proposals loses,
but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction. If everyone
wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution of funding
would occur, and time w</p><p>2 0.99981219 <a title="48-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-15-IJCAI_is_out_of_season.html">184 hunch net-2006-06-15-IJCAI is out of season</a></p>
<p>Introduction: IJCAIis running January 6-12 in Hyderabad India rather than a more traditional
summer date. (Presumably, this is to avoid melting people in the Indian
summer.)The paper deadline(June 23 abstract / June 30 submission) are
particularly inconvenient if you attendCOLTorICML. But on the other hand, it's
a good excuse to visit India.</p><p>3 0.99949509 <a title="48-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-06-Don%26%238217%3Bt_mix_the_solution_into_the_problem.html">67 hunch net-2005-05-06-Don&#8217;t mix the solution into the problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common defect of many pieces of research is defining the problem in terms of
the solution. Here are some examples in learning:"The learning problem is
finding a good seperating hyperplane.""The goal of learning is to
minimize(y-p)2+ C w2wherey= the observation,p= the prediction andw= a
parameter vector."Defining thelossfunction to be the one that your algorithm
optimizes rather than the one imposed by the world.The fundamental reason why
this is a defect is that it creates artificial boundaries to problem solution.
Artificial boundaries lead to the possibility of being blind-sided. For
example, someone committing (1) or (2) above might find themselves themselves
surprised to find a decision tree working well on a problem. Example (3) might
result in someone else solving a learning problem better for real world
purposes, even if it's worse with respect to the algorithm optimization. This
defect should be avoided so as to not artificially limit your learning
kungfu.The way to avoid thi</p><p>4 0.99907953 <a title="48-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-10-Interesting_papers%2C_ICML_2008.html">309 hunch net-2008-07-10-Interesting papers, ICML 2008</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are some papers fromICML 2008that I found interesting.Risi
KondorandKarsten Borgwardt,The Skew Spectrum of Graphs. This paper is about a
new family of functions on graphs which is invariant under node label
permutation. They show that these quantities appear to yield good features for
learning.Sanjoy DasguptaandDaniel Hsu.Hierarchical sampling for active
learning.This is the first published practical consistent active learning
algorithm. The abstract is also pretty impressive.Lihong Li,Michael Littman,
andThomas WalshKnows What It Knows: A Framework For Self-Aware Learning.This
is an attempt to create learning algorithms that know when they err, (other
work includesVovk). It's not yet clear to me what the right model forfeature-
dependent confidence intervalsis.Novi Quadrianto,Alex Smola,TIberio Caetano,
andQuoc Viet LeEstimating Labels from Label Proportions. This is an example of
learning in a specialization of the offline contextual bandit setting.Filip

<p>Introduction: TheNew York ML symposiumwas last Friday. There were 303 registrations, up a
bit fromlast year. I particularly enjoyed talks byBill Freemanon vision and
ML,Jon Lenchneron strategy in Jeopardy, andTara N. Sainathand Brian Kingsbury
ondeep learning for speech recognition. If anyone has suggestions or thoughts
for next year, please speak up.I also attendedStrata + Hadoop Worldfor the
first time. This is primarily a trade conference rather than an academic
conference, but I found it pretty interesting as a first time attendee. This
is ground zero for theBig databuzzword, and I see now why. It's about data,
and the word "big" is so ambiguous that everyone can lay claim to it. There
were essentially zero academic talks. Instead, the focus was on war stories,
product announcements, and education. The general level of education is much
lower--explaining Machine Learning to the SQL educated is the primary
operating point. Nevertheless that's happening, and the fact that machine
learning is consi</p><p>6 0.99896157 <a title="48-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-07-The_Limits_of_Learning_Theory.html">90 hunch net-2005-07-07-The Limits of Learning Theory</a></p>

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired. 
  
In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,  ATnT Research  and  Lucent  had one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the remainder of  Bell Labs , triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine learning group there.  As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.
 
There are a couple positives to the recession as well.

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is encouraging.   There is some discussion of this at the  Computing Research Policy  blog.  
 
One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time, presumably in dollar budgets.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t believe that dollar budgets are the right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers.  A better way to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a measure of the relative emphasis on research.
 
  
 
This graph was assembled by dividing the  NSF budget  by the  US GDP .  For 2005 GDP, I used the  current estimate  and for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per year.  The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to change.
 
This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row.  The reality has been significantly more severe due to  DARPA decreasing funding  and industrial</p><p>3 0.68173784 <a title="48-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-05-Funding_Research.html">36 hunch net-2005-03-05-Funding Research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many people in computer science believe that patents are problematic.  The truth is even worse—the patent system in the US is fundamentally broken in ways that will require much more significant reform than  is being considered now .
 
The myth of the patent is the following: Patents are a mechanism for inventors to be compensated according to the value of their inventions while making the invention available to all.  This myth sounds pretty desirable, but the reality is a strange distortion slowly leading towards collapse.
 
There are many problems associated with patents, but I would like to focus on just two of them: 
  
  Patent Trolls   The way that patents have generally worked over the last several decades is that they were a tool of large companies.  Large companies would amass a large number of patents and then cross-license each other’s patents—in effect saying “we agree to owe each other nothing”.  Smaller companies would sometimes lose in this game, essentially because they</p><p>6 0.64075637 <a title="48-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-01-Basic_computer_science_research_takes_a_hit.html">50 hunch net-2005-04-01-Basic computer science research takes a hit</a></p>

<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of “mechanism design”: setting up the structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane things (rather than obviously counterproductive things).  Application of this principle to academic research may be fruitful.
 
What is misdesigned about academic research?
  
 The  JMLG  guides give many hints. 
 The common nature of  bad reviewing  also suggests the system isn’t working optimally. 
 There are many ways to experimentally  “cheat” in machine learning . 
  Funding Prisoner’s Delimma.  Good researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing research.  Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written.  This is essentially a “prisoner’s delimma”: anyone not writing grant proposals loses, but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction.  If everyone wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution</p><p>2 0.86116242 <a title="48-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-03-27-Vowpal_Wabbit%2C_v5.1.html">428 hunch net-2011-03-27-Vowpal Wabbit, v5.1</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just created  version 5.1  of  vowpal wabbit .  This almost entirely a bugfix release, so it’s an easy upgrade from v5.0.

 There is now a  mailing list , which I and several other developers are subscribed to. 
 The main website has shifted to the wiki on github.  This means that anyone with a github account can now edit it. 
 I’m planning to give a tutorial tomorrow on it at  eHarmony / the LA machine learning meetup  at 10am.  Drop by if you’re interested. 
  
The status of VW amongst other open source projects has changed.  When VW first came out, it was relatively unique amongst existing projects in terms of features.  At this point, many other projects have started to appreciate the value of the design choices here.  This includes:
  
  Mahout , which now has an SGD implementation. 
  Shogun , where  Soeren  is keen on  incorporating features . 
  LibLinear , where they won the KDD best paper award for  out-of-core learning .

<p>Introduction: This is about the hard choices that graduate students must make.
 
The cultural definition of success in academic research is to:
  
 Produce good research which many other people appreciate. 
 Produce many students who go on to do the same. 
  
There are fundamental reasons why this is success in the local culture.   Good research appreciated by others means access to jobs.  Many students succesful in the same way implies that there are a number of people who think in a similar way and appreciate your work.
 
In order to graduate, a phd student must live in an academic culture for a period of several years. It is common to adopt the culture’s definition of success during this time.  It’s also common for many phd students discover they are not suited to an academic research lifestyle.  This collision of values and abilities naturally results in depression.
 
The most fundamental advice when this happens is: change something.  Pick a new advisor.  Pick a new research topic.  Or leave th</p><p>4 0.80888343 <a title="48-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-11-Yahoo%26%238217%3Bs_Learning_Problems..html">156 hunch net-2006-02-11-Yahoo&#8217;s Learning Problems.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just visited  Yahoo Research  which has several fundamental learning problems near to (or beyond) the set of problems we know how to solve well.  Here are 3 of them.
  
  Ranking   This is the canonical problem of all search engines.  It is made extra difficult for several reasons.
 
 There is relatively little “good” supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as click through rates). 
 The learning must occur in a partially adversarial environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top of 
rankings. 
 It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as ‘ranking’ or as ‘regression’ which is then used to produce a 
ranking. 
 
 
  Collaborative filtering  Yahoo has a large number of recommendation systems for music, movies, etc…  In these sorts of systems, users specify how they liked a set of things, and then the system can (hopefully) find some more examples of things they might like

<p>Introduction: One view of machine learning is that it’s about how to program computers to predict well.  This suggests a broader research program centered around the more pervasive goal of simply predicting well. 
There are many distinct strands of this broader research program which are only partially unified.  Here are the ones that I know of:
  
  Learning Theory .  Learning theory focuses on several topics related to the dynamics and process of prediction.  Convergence bounds like the  VC bound   give an intellectual foundation to many learning algorithms.  Online learning algorithms like  Weighted Majority  provide an alternate purely game theoretic foundation for learning.   Boosting algorithms  yield algorithms for purifying prediction abiliity.   Reduction algorithms  provide means for changing esoteric problems into well known ones. 
  Machine Learning .  A great deal of experience has accumulated in practical algorithm design from a mixture of paradigms, including bayesian, biological, opt</p><p>6 0.69982141 <a title="48-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-02-Reviewing_techniques_for_conferences.html">65 hunch net-2005-05-02-Reviewing techniques for conferences</a></p>

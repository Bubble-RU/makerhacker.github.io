<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>3 0.13494718 <a title="142-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example

<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-
issues for the moment.The number of posts is a bit over 20.The number of
people speaking up in discussions is about 10.The number of people viewing the
site is somewhat more than 100.I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many
things.Many of thepotential useshaven't been realized. This is partly a matter
of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no
open problems because it's hard to give them up), and partly a matter of
tradition. In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get
everything perfectly right before presentation. This is somewhat contradictory
to the nature of making many posts, and it's definitely contradictory to the
idea of doing "public research". If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must
be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to
continue experimenting, I'm going to use the next week as "open problems
week".Spam is a problem.</p><p>5 0.12034126 <a title="142-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT
ResearchandLucenthad one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the
remainder ofBell Labs, triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine
learning group there. As the recession progresses, we may easily see more
firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer
support research.There are a couple positives to the recession as well.Both
the implosion of Wall Street (which siphoned off smart people) and the general
difficulty of getting a job coming out of an undergraduate education suggest

<p>Introduction: I was not as personally close toBenasSam, but the level of tragedy is similar
and I can't help but be greatly saddened by the loss.Variousnewsstorieshave
coverage, but the synopsis is that he had a heart attack on Sunday and is
survived by his wife Anat and daughter Aviv. There is discussion of creating a

<p>Introduction: This post is about a trick that I learned fromDale Schuurmanswhich has been
repeatedly useful for me over time.The basic trick has to do with importance
weighting for monte carlo integration. Consider the problem of finding:N = Ex
~ Df(x)given samples fromDand knowledge off.Often, we don't have samples
fromDavailable. Instead, we must make do with samples from some other
distributionQ. In that case, we can still often solve the problem, as long as
Q(x) isn't 0 when D(x) is nonzero, using the importance weighting formula:Ex ~
Qf(x) D(x)/Q(x)A basic question is: How many samples fromQare required in
order to estimateNto some precision? In general the convergence rate is not
bounded, becausef(x) D(x)/Q(x)is not bounded given the
assumptions.Nevertheless, there is one special valueQ(x) = f(x) D(x) / Nwhere
the sample complexity turns out to be1, which is typically substantially
better than the sample complexity of the original problem.This observation
underlies the motivation for voluntary</p><p>same-blog 3 0.88863385 <a title="142-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-22-Yes_%2C_I_am_applying.html">142 hunch net-2005-12-22-Yes , I am applying</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Every year about now hundreds of applicants apply for a research/teaching job
with the timing governed by the university recruitment schedule. This time,
it's my turn--the hat's in the ring, I am a contender, etcâ&euro;Ś What I have heard
is that this year is good in both directions--both an increased supply and an
increased demand for machine learning expertise.I consider this post a bit of
an abuse as it is neither about general research nor machine learning. Please
forgive me this once.My hope is that I will learn about new places interested
in funding basic research--it's easy to imagine that I have overlooked
possibilities.I am not dogmatic about where I end up in any particular way.
Several earlier posts detail what I think of as a good research environment,
so I will avoid a repeat. A few more details seem important:Application. There
is often a tension between basic research and immediate application. This
tension is not as strong as might be expected in my case. As evidence, many of</p><p>4 0.71014035 <a title="142-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-24-Holy_grails_of_machine_learning%3F.html">2 hunch net-2005-01-24-Holy grails of machine learning?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let me kick things off by posing this question to ML researchers:What do you
think are some important holy grails of machine learning?For example:- "A
classifier with SVM-level performance but much more scalable"- "Practical
confidence bounds (or learning bounds) for classification"- "A reinforcement
learning algorithm that can handle the ___ problem"- "Understanding
theoretically why ___ works so well in practice"etc.I pose this question
because I believe that when goals are stated explicitly and well (thus
providing clarity as well as opening up the problems to more people), rather
than left implicit, they are likely to be achieved much more quickly. I would
also like to know more about the internal goals of the various machine
learning sub-areas (theory, kernel methods, graphical models, reinforcement
learning, etc) as stated by people in these respective areas. This could help
people cross sub-areas.</p><p>5 0.7052927 <a title="142-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-28-A_question_of_quantification.html">133 hunch net-2005-11-28-A question of quantification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about methods for phrasing and think about the scope of some theorems
in learning theory. The basic claim is that there are several different ways
of quantifying the scope which sound different yet are essentially the
same.For all sequences of examples. This is the standard quantification in
online learning analysis. Standard theorems would say something like "for all
sequences of predictions by experts, the algorithm A will perform almost as
well as the best expert."For all training sets. This is the standard
quantification for boosting analysis such asadaboostormulticlass
boosting.Standard theorems have the form "for all training sets the error rate
inequalities … hold".For all distributions over examples. This is the one that
we have been using for reductions analysis. Standard theorem statements have
the form "For all distributions over examples, the error rate inequalities …
hold".It is not quite true that each of these is equivalent. For example, in

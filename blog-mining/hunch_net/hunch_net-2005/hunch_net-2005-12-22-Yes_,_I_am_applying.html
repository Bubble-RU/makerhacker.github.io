<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired. 
  
In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,  ATnT Research  and  Lucent  had one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the remainder of  Bell Labs , triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine learning group there.  As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.
 
There are a couple positives to the recession as well.

This is somewhat contradictory to the nature of making many posts, and it’s definitely contradictory to the idea of doing “public research”.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people .  Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs, this is serious for  Yahoo! Research .  
 
We had advanced warning from  Prabhakar  through the  simple act of leaving .  Yahoo! Research was a world class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave.  My first thought when I saw the news was “Uhoh,  Rob  said that he knew it was serious when the head of ATnT Research left.”  In this case it was even more significant, because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high engagement with the company.  Prabhakar’s departure is a clear end to that experiment.
 
The result is ambiguous from a business perspective.  Y!R clearly was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses.  I’m not privy to the internal accounting of impact and this is the kind of subject where there c</p><p>6 0.63056356 <a title="142-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-05-Funding_Research.html">36 hunch net-2005-03-05-Funding Research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I attended the  IBM research 60th anniversary .  IBM research is, by any reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the most value to it’s parent company over the long term.  This can be seen by simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab which has not gone through a period of massive firing.  (Note that there are also  new research labs .)
 
Despite this impressive record, IBM research has failed, by far, to achieve it’s potential.  Examples which came up in this meeting include:
  
 It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented in the lab.  (In fact, Intel produced it first.) 
 Relational databases and SQL were invented and then languished.  It was only under external competition that IBM released it’s own relational database.  Why didn’t IBM grow an  Oracle division ? 
 An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing a  Cisco division .  Why not? 
  
And remember … IBM research is a s</p><p>3 0.92536372 <a title="142-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’d like to point out  Inherent Uncertainty , which I’ve added to the ML blog post scanner on the right.   My understanding from  Jake  is that the intention is to have a multiauthor blog which is more specialized towards learning theory/game theory than this one.  Nevertheless, several of the posts seem to be of wider interest.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.89393568 <a title="142-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-22-Yes_%2C_I_am_applying.html">142 hunch net-2005-12-22-Yes , I am applying</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Every year about now hundreds of applicants apply for a research/teaching job with the timing governed by the university recruitment schedule.  This time, it’s my turn—the hat’s in the ring, I am a contender, etc…  What I have heard is that this year is good in both directions—both an increased supply and an increased demand for machine learning expertise.
 
I consider this post a bit of an abuse as it is neither about general research nor machine learning.  Please forgive me this once.
 
My hope is that I will learn about new places interested in funding basic research—it’s easy to imagine that I have overlooked possibilities.
 
I am not dogmatic about where I end up in any particular way.  Several earlier posts detail what I think of as a good research environment, so I will avoid a repeat.  A few more details seem important:
  
 Application.  There is often a tension between basic research and immediate application.  This tension is not as strong as might be expected in my case.

<p>Introduction: Nikos  pointed out this  new york times  article about  poor clinical design killing people .  For those of us who study learning from exploration information this is a reminder that low regret algorithms are particularly important, as regret in clinical trials is measured by patient deaths.
 
Two obvious improvements on the experimental design are:
  
 With reasonable record keeping of existing outcomes for the standard treatments, there is no need to explicitly assign people to a control group with the standard treatment, as that approach is effectively explored with great certainty.  Asserting otherwise would imply that the nature of effective treatments for cancer has changed between now and a year ago, which denies the value of any clinical trial. 
 An optimal experimental design will smoothly phase between exploration and exploitation as evidence for a new treatment shows that it can be effective.  This is old tech, for example in the  EXP3.P algorithm (page 12 aka 59)  although</p><p>6 0.80289292 <a title="142-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-03-AOL%26%238217%3Bs_data_drop.html">200 hunch net-2006-08-03-AOL&#8217;s data drop</a></p>

rates assuming that data is drawn independently. In classical statistics, they
are calld confidence intervals.Why?Good Judgement. In many applications of
learning, it is desirable to know how well the learned predictor works in the
future. This helps you decide if the problem is solved or not.Learning

several families of bounds, based on how information is used.Testing Bounds.
These are methods which use labeled data not used in training to estimate the

<p>Introduction: Here are two papers that seem particularly interesting at this year's
COLT.Gilles BlanchardandFranÃƒÂ§ois Fleuret,Occam's Hammer. When we are
interested in very tight bounds on the true error rate of a classifier, it is
tempting to use a PAC-Bayes bound which can (empirically) bequite tight. A
disadvantage of the PAC-Bayes bound is that it applies to a classifier which
is randomized over a set of base classifiers rather than a single classifier.
This paper shows that a similar bound can be proved which holds for a single
classifier drawn from the set. The ability to safely use a single classifier
is very nice. This technique applies generically to any base bound, so it has
other applications covered in the paper.Adam Tauman Kalai.Learning Nested
Halfspaces and Uphill Decision Trees. Classification PAC-learning, where you
prove that any problem amongst some set is polytime learnable with respect to
any distribution over the inputXis extraordinarily challenging as judged by

samples are drawn IID from an unknown distributionD.Fix a set of
classifiersFind a high probability bound on the maximum true error rate (with
respect toD) as a function of the empirical error rate on the training
set.Many of these bounds become extremely complex and hairy.CurrentEveryone
working on this subject wants "tighter bounds", however there are different
definitions of "tighter". Some groups focus on "functional tightness" (getting
the right functional dependency between the size of the training set and a
parameterization of the hypothesis space) whileothersfocus on "practical
tightness" (finding bounds which work well on practical problems). (I am
definitely in the second camp.)One of the dangers of striving for "functional
tightness" is that the bound</p><p>5 0.14462054 <a title="85-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-05-09-The_Missing_Bound.html">244 hunch net-2007-05-09-The Missing Bound</a></p>

exponential moment method we know that:If the range ofxis bounded by an
interval of sizeI, aChernoff/Hoeffding style boundgives us a bound on the

the range ofxis bounded, and the variance (or a bound on the variance) is
known, thenBennett's boundcan give tighter results (*). This can be a huge
improvment when the true variance small.What's missing here is a bound that
depends on the observed variance rather than a bound on the variance. This
means that many people attempt to use Bennett's bound (incorrectly) by
plugging the observed variance in as the true variance, invalidating the bound
application. Most of the time, they get away with it, but this is a dangerous
move when doing machine learning. In machine learning, we are typically trying

<p>Introduction: In the online learning with experts setting, you observe a set of predictions,
make a decision, and then observe the truth. This process repeats
indefinitely. In this setting, it is possible to prove theorems of the
sort:master algorithm error count < = k* best predictor error count +
c*log(number of predictors)Is this a statement about learning or about
preservation of learning? We did some experiments to analyze the newBinning
algorithmwhich works in this setting. For several UCI datasets, we reprocessed
them so that features could be used as predictors and then applied several
master algorithms. The first graph confirms that Binning is indeed a better
algorithm according to the tightness of the upper bound.Here, "Best" is the
performance of the best expert. "V. Bound" is the bound forVovk's algorithm
(the previous best). "Bound" is the bound for the Binning algorithm. "Binning"
is the performance of the Binning algorithm. The Binning algorithm clearly has
a tighter bound, and the pe</p><p>6 0.64658427 <a title="85-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-14-Interesting_Papers_at_COLT_2007.html">247 hunch net-2007-06-14-Interesting Papers at COLT 2007</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One prescription for solving a problem well is:State the problem, in the
simplest way possible. In particular, this statement should involve no
contamination with or anticipation of the solution.Think about solutions to
the stated problem.Stating a problem in a succinct and crisp manner tends to
invite a simple elegant solution. When a problem can not be stated succinctly,
we wonder if the problem is even understood. (And when a problem is not
understood, we wonder if a solution can be meaningful.)Reinforcement learning
does step (1) well. It provides a clean simple language to state general AI
problems. In reinforcement learning there is a set of actionsA, a set of
observationsO, and a rewardr. The reinforcement learning problem, in general,
is defined by a conditional measureD( o, r | (o,r,a)*)which produces an
observationoand a rewardrgiven a history(o,r,a)*. The goal in reinforcement
learning is to find a policypi:(o,r,a)*-> amapping histories to actions so as

<p>Introduction: TheNYAS ML symposiumgrew again this year to 170 participants, despite the need
to outsmart or otherwise tunnel througha crowd.Perhaps the most distinct talk
was by Bob Bell on various aspects of theNetflix prizecompetition. I also
enjoyed several student posters includingMatt Hoffman's cool examples of blind
source separation for music.I'm somewhat surprised how much the workshop has
grown, as it is now comparable in size to a small conference, although in
style more similar to a workshop. At some point as an event grows, it becomes
owned by the community rather than the organizers, so if anyone has
suggestions on improving it, speak up and be heard.</p><p>4 0.81761461 <a title="85-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-16-Regularization_%3D_Robustness.html">185 hunch net-2006-06-16-Regularization = Robustness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Gibbs-Jaynes theorem is a classical result that tells us that the highest
entropy distribution (most uncertain, least committed, etc.) subject to
expectation constraints on a set of features is an exponential family
distribution with the features as sufficient statistics. In math,argmax_p
H(p)s.t. E_p[f_i] = c_iis given by e^{\sum \lambda_i f_i}/Z. (Z here is the
necessary normalization constraint, and the lambdas are free parameters we set
to meet the expectation constraints).A great deal of statistical mechanics
flows from this result, and it has proven very fruitful in learning as well.
(Motivating work in models in text learning and Conditional Random Fields, for
instance. ) The result has been demonstrated a number of ways. One of the most
elegant is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“geometricÃ¢â‚¬Â versionhere.In the case when the
expectation constraints come from data, this tells us that the maximum entropy
distribution is exactly the maximum likelihood distribution in the exponential
family. ItÃ</p><p>5 0.63913757 <a title="85-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-03-Bidding_Problems.html">315 hunch net-2008-09-03-Bidding Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers
is via bidding, which has steps something like:Invite people to reviewAccept
papersReviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are
interested in reviewing.Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get
approximately the papers they bid for.At the ICML business meeting,Andrew
McCallumsuggested getting rid of bidding for papers. A couple reasons were
given:PrivacyThe title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to
every participating reviewer. Some authors might be uncomfortable about this
for submitted papers. I'm not sympathetic to this reason: the point of
submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not
publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited.CliquesA bidding
system is gameable. If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your
submissions, you can each bid for your friend's papers and express a
disinterest in others. There</p><p>6 0.58325887 <a title="85-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-10-Interesting_papers%2C_ICML_2008.html">309 hunch net-2008-07-10-Interesting papers, ICML 2008</a></p>

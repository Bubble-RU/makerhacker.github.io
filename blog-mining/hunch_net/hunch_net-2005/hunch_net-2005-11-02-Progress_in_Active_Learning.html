<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made since  Sanjoy  pointed out the significant  lack of theoretical understanding of active learning .  This is an update on the progress I know of.  As a refresher, active learning as meant here is:
  
 There is a source of unlabeled data. 
 There is an oracle from which labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source.

<p>Introduction: A little over 4 years ago,  Sanjoy   made a post  saying roughly “we should  study active learning theoretically, because not much is understood”.   
 
At the time, we did not understand basic things such as whether or not it was possible to PAC-learn with an active algorithm without making strong assumptions about the noise rate.  In other words, the fundamental question was “can we do it?”
 
The nature of the question has fundamentally changed in my mind.   The answer is to the previous question is “yes”, both information theoretically and computationally, most places where supervised learning could be applied.  
 
In many situation, the question has now changed to: “is it worth it?”  Is the programming and computational overhead low enough to make the label cost savings of active learning worthwhile?  Currently, there are situations where this question could go either way.  Much of the challenge for the future is in figuring out how to make active learning easier or more worthwhile.</p><p>3 0.27394575 <a title="127-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-20-The_End_of_the_Beginning_of_Active_Learning.html">432 hunch net-2011-04-20-The End of the Beginning of Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is by Daniel Hsu and John Langford.
 
In selective sampling style active learning, a learning algorithm chooses which examples to label.  We now have an active learning algorithm that is:
  
  Efficient  in label complexity, unlabeled complexity, and computational complexity. 
  Competitive  with supervised learning anywhere that supervised learning works. 
  Compatible  with online learning, with any optimization-based learning algorithm, with any loss function, with offline testing, and even with changing learning algorithms. 
  Empirically  effective. 
  
The basic idea is to combine  disagreement region-based sampling  with  importance weighting : an example is selected to be labeled with probability proportional to how useful it is for distinguishing among near-optimal classifiers, and labeled examples are importance-weighted by the inverse of these probabilities.  The combination of these simple ideas removes the  sampling bias  problem that has plagued many previous he</p><p>4 0.19851036 <a title="127-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-22-Active_learning.html">45 hunch net-2005-03-22-Active learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Often, unlabeled data is easy to come by but labels are expensive. For instance, if you’re building a speech recognizer, it’s easy enough to get raw speech samples — just walk around with a microphone — but labeling even one of these samples is a tedious process in which a human must examine the speech signal and carefully segment it into phonemes. In the field of active learning, the goal is as usual to construct an accurate classifier, but the labels of the data points are initially hidden and there is a charge for each label you want revealed. The hope is that by intelligent adaptive querying, you can get away with significantly fewer labels than you would need in a regular supervised learning framework.
 
Here’s an example. Suppose the data lie on the real line, and the classifiers are simple thresholding functions, H = {h w }: 
  h w (x) = 1 if x > w, and 0 otherwise.

<p>Introduction: Exploration is one of the big unsolved problems in machine learning. This isn’t for lack of trying—there are many models of exploration which have been analyzed in many different ways by many different groups of people. At some point, it is worthwhile to sit back and see what has been done across these many models.
  
   Reinforcement Learning  (1) . Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on Markov Decision Processes where the next state  s’    is given by a conditional distribution  P(s’|s,a)  given the current state  s  and action  a .  The typical result here is that certain specific algorithms controlling an agent can behave within  e  of optimal for horizon  T  except for  poly(1/e,T,S,A)  “wasted” experiences (with high probability).  This started with  E 3   by  Satinder Singh  and  Michael Kearns .  Sham Kakade’s thesis  has significant discussion. Extensions have typically been of the form “under extra assumptions, we can prove more”, for example  Factored-E 3   and</p><p>6 0.17558891 <a title="127-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-31-Watchword%3A_Assumption.html">7 hunch net-2005-01-31-Watchword: Assumption</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The  second Netflix prize is canceled  due to  privacy problems .  I continue to believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was somewhat overstated.  I still haven’t seen any serious privacy failures on the scale of the  AOL search log release .
 
I expect privacy concerns to continue to be a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments.  The theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet in a state where the limits of what’s possible are clear let alone how to achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>2 0.98127294 <a title="127-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-01-NIPS_2008_workshop_on_%26%238216%3BLearning_over_Empirical_Hypothesis_Spaces%26%238217%3B.html">319 hunch net-2008-10-01-NIPS 2008 workshop on &#8216;Learning over Empirical Hypothesis Spaces&#8217;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This workshop asks for insights how far we may/can push the theoretical boundary of using data in the design of learning machines. Can we express our classification rule in terms of the sample, or do we have to stick to a core assumption of classical statistical learning theory, namely that the hypothesis space is to be defined independent from the sample? This workshop is particularly interested in – but not restricted to – the ‘luckiness framework’ and the recently introduced  notion of ‘compatibility functions’ in a semi-supervised learning context (more information can be found at  http://www.kuleuven.be/wehys ).</p><p>3 0.98099309 <a title="127-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-25-Why_Papers%3F.html">30 hunch net-2005-02-25-Why Papers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Makc asked a good  question  in comments—”Why bother to make a paper, at all?”  There are several reasons for writing papers which may not be immediately obvious to people not in academia.
 
The basic idea is that papers have considerably more utility than the obvious “present an idea”.
  
 Papers are a formalized units of work. Academics (especially young ones) are often judged on the number of papers they produce. 
 Papers have a formalized method of citing and crediting other—the bibliography.  Academics (especially older ones) are often judged on the number of citations they receive. 
 Papers enable a “more fair” anonymous review.  Conferences receive  many  papers, from which a subset are selected.  Discussion forums are inherently not anonymous for anyone who wants to build a reputation for good work. 
 Papers are an excuse to meet your friends.  Papers are the content of conferences, but much of what you do is talk to friends about interesting problems while there.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! is sponsoring two machine learning events that might interest people.  
  
 The  Key Scientific Challenges  program (due March 5) for  Machine Learning  and  Statistics  offers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working on a core problem of interest to Y!  If you are already working on one of these problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you arenâ&euro;&trade;t you might want to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary of the possible in Machine Learning.   There are 7 days left. 
 The  Learning to Rank challenge  (due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at an ICML workshop.  Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreak  the ensemble  encountered.  If you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all learn something.  There are 3 months left.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.96370602 <a title="127-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-02-Progress_in_Active_Learning.html">127 hunch net-2005-11-02-Progress in Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made since  Sanjoy  pointed out the significant  lack of theoretical understanding of active learning .  This is an update on the progress I know of.  As a refresher, active learning as meant here is:
  
 There is a source of unlabeled data. 
 There is an oracle from which labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source. 
 The goal is to perform well with minimal use of the oracle. 
  
Here is what I’ve learned:
  
 Sanjoy has developed sufficient and semi-necessary conditions for active learning given the assumptions of IID data and “realizability” (that one of the classifiers is a correct classifier). 
  Nina ,  Alina , and I developed an algorithm for active learning relying on only the assumption of IID data.  A draft is  here . 
  Nicolo ,  Claudio , and  Luca  showed that it is possible to do active learning in an entirely adversarial setting for linear threshold classifiers  here .  This was published a year or two ago and I r</p><p>6 0.95885491 <a title="127-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-24-ICML%2B50%25.html">456 hunch net-2012-02-24-ICML+50%</a></p>

<p>Introduction: "Assumption" is another word to be careful with in machine learning because it
is used in several ways.Assumption = BiasThere are several ways to see that
some form of 'bias' (= preferring of one solution over another) is necessary.
This is obvious in an adversarial setting. A good bit of work has been
expended explaining this in other settings with "no free lunch" theorems. This
is a usage specialized to learning which is particularly common when talking
about priors for Bayesian Learning.Assumption = "if" of a theoremThe
assumptions are the 'if' part of the 'if-then' in a theorem. This is a fairly
common usage.Assumption = AxiomThe assumptions are the things that we assume
are true, but which we cannot verify. Examples are "the IID assumption" or "my
problem is a DNF on a small number of bits". This is the usage which I
prefer.One difficulty with any use of the word "assumption" is that you often
encounter "ifassumptionthenconclusionso ifnot assumptionthennot conclusion".

active learning given the assumptions of IID data and "realizability" (that

<p>Introduction: One way to organize learning theory is by assumption (in theassumption = axiom
sense), from no assumptions to many assumptions. As you travel down this list,
the statements become stronger, but the scope of applicability decreases.No

<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is. The
viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models,
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etc… share
little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within
one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.There are
two fundamental reasons why this is possible.For many problems, many
approaches work in the sense that they do something useful. This is true
empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different
approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor. It's also
true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in
a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors
does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples.There
is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field. In many other areas
there are unifying p</p><p>6 0.11383069 <a title="57-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-14-Explorations_of_Exploration.html">183 hunch net-2006-06-14-Explorations of Exploration</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The ideal of theoretical algorithm analysis is to construct an algorithm with
accompanying optimality theorems proving that it is a useful algorithm. This
ideal often fails, particularly for learning algorithms and theory. The
general form of a theorem is:IfpreconditionsThenpostconditionsWhen we design
learning algorithms it is very common to come up with precondition assumptions
such as "the data is IID", "the learning problem is drawn from a known
distribution over learning problems", or "there is a perfect classifier". All
of these example preconditions can be false for real-world problems in ways
that are not easily detectable. This means that algorithms derived and
justified by these very common forms of analysis may be prone to catastrophic
failure in routine (mis)application.Wecanhope for better. Several different
kinds of learning algorithm analysis have been developed some of which have
fewer preconditions. Simply demanding that these forms of analysis be used may
be too stron</p><p>5 0.57478493 <a title="57-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-14-Explorations_of_Exploration.html">183 hunch net-2006-06-14-Explorations of Exploration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Exploration is one of the big unsolved problems in machine learning. This
isn't for lack of trying--there are many models of exploration which have been
analyzed in many different ways by many different groups of people. At some
point, it is worthwhile to sit back and see what has been done across these
many models.Reinforcement Learning(1). Reinforcement learning has
traditionally focused on Markov Decision Processes where the next states'is
given by a conditional distributionP(s'|s,a)given the current statesand
actiona. The typical result here is that certain specific algorithms
controlling an agent can behave withineof optimal for horizonTexcept

<p>Introduction: One of the most confusing things about understanding learning theory is the
vast array of differing assumptions. Some critical thought about which of
these assumptions are reasonable for real-world problems may be useful.Before
we even start thinking about assumptions, it's important to realize that the
word hasmultiple meanings. The meaning used here is "assumption = axiom" (i.e.
something you can not verify).AssumptionReasonable?Which

"almost IID" in the sense that IID analysis results in correct intuitions.

<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>5 0.58885413 <a title="57-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-21-Research_Styles_in_Machine_Learning.html">44 hunch net-2005-03-21-Research Styles in Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is a field with an impressively diverse set of reseearch
styles. Understanding this may be important in appreciating what you see at a
conference.Engineering. How can I solve this problem? People in the
engineering research style try to solve hard problems directly by any means
available and then describe how they did it. This is typical of problem-
specific conferences and communities.Scientific. What are the principles for
solving learning problems? People in this research style test techniques on
many different problems. This is fairly common at ICML and NIPS.Mathematical.
How can the learning problem be mathematically understood? People in this
research style prove theorems with implications for learning but often do not
implement (or test algorithms). COLT is a typical conference for this
style.Many people manage to cross these styles, and that is often
beneficial.Whenver we list a set of alternative, it becomes natural to think
"which is best?" In this case of le</p><p>6 0.54988581 <a title="57-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-27-Learning_Complete_Problems.html">6 hunch net-2005-01-27-Learning Complete Problems</a></p>

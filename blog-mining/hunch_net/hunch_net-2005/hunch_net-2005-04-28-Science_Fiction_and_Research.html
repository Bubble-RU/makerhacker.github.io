<p>Introduction: Carnegie MellonSchool of Computer Sciencehas the first academicMachine
Learning department. This department already existed as theCenter for
Automated Learning and Discovery, but recently changed it's name.The reason
for changing the name is obvious: very few people think of themselves as
"Automated Learner and Discoverers", but there are number of people who think
of themselves as "Machine Learners". Machine learning is both more succinct
and recognizable--good properties for a name.A more interesting question is
"Should there be a Machine Learning Department?".Tom Mitchellhas a
relevantwhitepaperclaiming that machine learning is answering a different
question than other fields or departments. The fundamental debate here is "Is
machine learning different from statistics?"At a cultural level, there is no
real debate: they are different. Machine learning is characterized by several
very active large peer reviewed conferences, operating in a computer science
mode. Statistics tends to fun</p><p>3 0.12010691 <a title="64-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-06-Research_Political_Issues.html">282 hunch net-2008-01-06-Research Political Issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest. The
problem with discussing politics is that it's customary for people to say much
based upon little information. Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial
impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa). It's primary
election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the
issues are not.There are several policy decisions which substantially effect
development of science and technology in the US.EducationThe US has great
contrasts in education. The top universities are very good places, yet the
grade school education system produces mediocre results. For me, the contrast
between apublic educationandCaltechwas bracing. For many others attending
Caltech, it clearly was not. Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is
a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about. My own
experience is that a basic attitude of "no child unrealized" is better than
"no child lef</p><p>4 0.10953779 <a title="64-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-11-26-Giving_Thanks.html">449 hunch net-2011-11-26-Giving Thanks</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and
giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.As a researcher, I am
most thankful for my education, without which I could not function. I want to
share this, because it provides some sense of how a researcher starts.My long
term memory seems to function particularly well, which makes any education I
get is particularly useful.I am naturally obsessive, which makes me chase down
details until I fully understand things. Natural obsessiveness can go wrong,
of course, but it's a great ally when you absolutely must get things right.My
childhood was all in one hometown, which was a conscious sacrifice on the part
of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated. I'm not
sure how important this was since travel has it's own benefits, but it bears
thought.I had several great teachers in grade school, and naturally gravitated
towards teachers over classmates, as they seemed more interesting. I</p><p>5 0.10387772 <a title="64-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-28-Nielsen%26%238217%3Bs_talk.html">340 hunch net-2009-01-28-Nielsen&#8217;s talk</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I found the article on "Political Science" at theNew York Timesinteresting.
Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been
systematically distorting scientific views. With apetitionby some7000+
scientistsalleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.One
thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are
fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the
world. In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued. This value is
achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms. One example of a formal
mechanism is peer review.In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value
is agreement. It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be
passed or other actions can be taken. Since Science (with a capitol 'S') has
accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.
This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mechanism for
pushing agreement</p><p>5 0.60303533 <a title="64-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-14-The_Predictionist_Viewpoint.html">112 hunch net-2005-09-14-The Predictionist Viewpoint</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Virtually every discipline of significant human endeavor has a way explaining
itself as fundamental and important. In all the cases I know of, they are both
right (they are vital) and wrong (they are not solely vital).Politics. This is
the one that everyone is familiar with at the moment. "What could be more
important than the process of making decisions?"Science and Technology. This
is the one that we-the-academics are familiar with. "The loss of modern
science and technology would be catastrophic."Military. "Without the military,
a nation will be invaded and destroyed."(insert your favorite here)Within
science and technology, the same thing happens again.Mathematics. "What could
be more important than a precise language for establishing truths?"Physics.
"Nothing is more fundamental than the laws which govern the universe.
Understanding them is the key to understanding everything else."Biology.
"Without life, we wouldn't be here, so clearly the study of life is
fundamental."Computer S</p><p>6 0.58259708 <a title="64-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-10-Conferences%2C_Dates%2C_Locations.html">17 hunch net-2005-02-10-Conferences, Dates, Locations</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just visitedISIwhereDaniel Marcuand others are working on machine
translation. Apparently, machine translation is rapidly improving. A
particularly dramatic year was 2002->2003 when systems switched from word-
based translation to phrase-based translation. From a (now famous) slide by
Charles Wayne atDARPA(which funds much of the work on machine translation)

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and
then trying to figure out how to get there.A big part of science fiction is
imagining how things could be different, and then working through the
implications.Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can
sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research. (And, hey, it's
fun.) Here's some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem
particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning
systems:Vernor Vinge, "True Names", "A Fire Upon the Deep"Marc Stiegler,
"David's Sling", "Earthweb"Charles Stross, "Singularity Sky"Greg Egan,
"Diaspora"Joe Haldeman, "Forever Peace"(There are surely many
others.)Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.
Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans
control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series). That didn't really happen in the
last 50 years. Instead, we gradually refined the degree to whi</p><p>3 0.63859797 <a title="64-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-19-Deadline_Season%2C_2010.html">387 hunch net-2010-01-19-Deadline Season, 2010</a></p>

author feedback occurs only after decisions are made.KDD is notable for being
the most comprehensive in terms of {Tutorials, Workshops, Challenges, Panels,
Papers (two tracks), Demos}. The S for KDD is because there is sometimes

something very striking: several previous error bounds arealwaysgreater than
1.BackgroundOne branch of learning theory focuses on theorems whichAssume
samples are drawn IID from an unknown distributionD.Fix a set of
classifiersFind a high probability bound on the maximum true error rate (with
respect toD) as a function of the empirical error rate on the training
set.Many of these bounds become extremely complex and hairy.CurrentEveryone
working on this subject wants "tighter bounds", however there are different
definitions of "tighter". Some groups focus on "functional tightness" (getting
the right functional dependency between the size of the training set and a
parameterization of the hypothesis space) whileothersfocus on "practical
tightness" (finding bounds which work well on practical problems). (I am
definitely in the second camp.)One of the dangers of striving for "functional
tightness" is that the bound</p><p>5 0.5803768 <a title="64-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-13-Regression_vs._Classification_as_a_Primitive.html">196 hunch net-2006-07-13-Regression vs. Classification as a Primitive</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Forlearning reductionswe have been concentrating on reducing various complex
learning problems to binary classification. This choice needs to be actively
questioned, because it was not carefully considered.Binary clasification is
learning a classifierc:X -> {0,1}so as to minimize the probability of being
wrong,Prx,y~D(c(x)y).The primary alternative candidate seems to be squared
error regression. In squared error regression, you learn a regressors:X ->
[0,1]so as to minimize squared error,Ex,y~D(s(x)-y)2.It is difficult to judge
one primitive against another. The judgement must at least partially be made
on nontheoretical grounds because (essentially) we are evaluating a choice
between two axioms/assumptions.These two primitives are significantly related.
Classification can be reduced to regression in the obvious way: you use the
regressor to predictD(y=1|x), then threshold at0.5. For this simple reduction
a squared error regret ofrimplies a classification regret of at mostr0.5.

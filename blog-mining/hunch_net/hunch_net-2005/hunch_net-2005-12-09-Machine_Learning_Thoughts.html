<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-
issues for the moment.The number of posts is a bit over 20.The number of
people speaking up in discussions is about 10.The number of people viewing the
site is somewhat more than 100.I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many
things.Many of thepotential useshaven't been realized. This is partly a matter
of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no
open problems because it's hard to give them up), and partly a matter of
tradition. In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get
everything perfectly right before presentation. This is somewhat contradictory
to the nature of making many posts, and it's definitely contradictory to the
idea of doing "public research". If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must
be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to
continue experimenting, I'm going to use the next week as "open problems
week".Spam is a problem.</p><p>3 0.22578186 <a title="137-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This

interest.September 23 and laterNIPS workshopsubmissions start coming due. As
usual, there are too many good ones, so I won't be able to attend all those
that interest me. I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming

<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied
machine learning using current technology. We just built a small one at TTI so
this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design
choices.ArchitectureThere are several architectural choices.AMD Athlon64 based
system. This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck. Maximum RAM is typically
2-3GB.AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to
buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB
of RAM. The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type.Intel PIV or
Xeon based system. The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the
above 2. Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit
hotter and be a bit more expensive.Dual core chips. Both Intel and AMD have
chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them.In the end, we decided
to go with option (2). Roughly speaking, the AMD system seemed like a bet</p><p>4 0.42367038 <a title="137-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-17-Partha_Niyogi_has_died.html">414 hunch net-2010-10-17-Partha Niyogi has died</a></p>
<p>Introduction: from brain cancer. I askedMishawho worked with him to write about it.Partha
Niyogi, Louis Block Professor in Computer Science and Statistics at the
University of Chicago passed away on October 1, 2010, aged 43.I first met
Partha Niyogi almost exactly ten years ago when I was a graduate student in
math and he had just started as a faculty in Computer Science and Statistics
at the University of Chicago. Strangely, we first talked at length due to a
somewhat convoluted mathematical argument in a paper on pattern recognition. I
asked him some questions about the paper, and, even though the topic was new
to him, he had put serious thought into it and we started regular meetings. We
made significant progress and developed a line of research stemming initially
just from trying to understand that one paper and to simplify one derivation.
I think this was typical of Partha, showing both his intellectual curiosity
and his intuition for the serendipitous; having a sense and focus for
inquiries wo</p><p>5 0.39779913 <a title="137-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-29-To_Vidoelecture_or_not.html">416 hunch net-2010-10-29-To Vidoelecture or not</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (update:cross-postedonCACM)For the first time in several years,ICML 2010did
not havevideolecturesattending. Luckily, thetutorial on exploration and
learningwhichAlinaand I put together canbe viewed, since we also presented
atKDD 2010, which included videolecture support.ICML didn't cover the cost of
a videolecture, becausePASCALdidn't provide a grant for it this year. On the
other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs. The cost of
videolectures isn't cheap. Fora workshopthe baseline quote we have is 270 euro
per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman's travel and accomodation.
This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle
the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a
quoted 216 euro per hour.Youtubeis the most predominant free video site with a
cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.15 minute upload
limitsdo not match typical talk lengths. Videolectures also have side-by-side

<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-issues for the moment.
 
The number of posts is a bit over 20. 
The number of people speaking up in discussions is about 10. 
The number of people viewing the site is somewhat more than 100.
 
I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many things.
  
 Many of the  potential uses  haven’t been realized.  This is partly a matter of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no open problems because it’s hard to give them up), and partly a matter of tradition.  In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get everything perfectly right before presentation.  This is somewhat contradictory to the nature of making many posts, and it’s definitely contradictory to the idea of doing “public research”.  If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to continue experimenting, I’m going to use the next week as “open problems we</p><p>3 0.19777873 <a title="137-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At the one year (+5 days) anniversary, the natural question is: “Was it helpful for research?”
 
Answer: Yes, and so it shall continue.
 
Some evidence is provided by noticing that I am about a factor of 2 more overloaded with paper ideas than I’ve ever previously been.  It is always hard to estimate counterfactual worlds, but I expect that this is also a factor of 2 more than “What if I had not started the blog?”
 
As for “Why?”, there seem to be two primary effects.
  
 A blog is a mechanism for connecting with people who either think like you or are interested in the same problems.  This allows for concentration of thinking which is very helpful in solving problems. 
 The process of stating things you don’t understand publicly is very helpful in understanding them.  Sometimes you are simply forced to express them in a way which aids understanding.  Sometimes someone else says something which helps.  And sometimes you discover that someone else has already solved the problem.

<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time.

<p>Introduction: Alex Smola  showed me this  ICML 2006  webpage.  This is  NOT  the ICML we know, but rather some people at “Enformatika”.  Investigation shows that they registered with an anonymous yahoo email account from  dotregistrar.com  the “Home of the $6.79 wholesale domain!” and their nameservers are by  Turkticaret , a Turkish internet company.
 
It appears the website has since been altered to “ ICNL ” (the above link uses the google cache).
 
They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so the organizers of the real  ICML 2006  must feel quite flattered.</p><p>4 0.78952271 <a title="137-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-04-Health_of_Conferences_Wiki.html">212 hunch net-2006-10-04-Health of Conferences Wiki</a></p>

<p>Introduction: and I can’t help but remember him.
 
I first met  Sam  as an undergraduate at  Caltech  where he was TA for  Hopfield ‘s class, and again when I visited  Gatsby , when he invited me to visit  Toronto , and at too many conferences to recount.  His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great ability to phrase a problem so it’s solution must be understood.  With respect to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to make  my first tutorial , leading to others, and to other things, all of which I’m grateful to him for.  In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.
 
His death is  being called a suicide  which is so incompatible with my understanding of Sam that it strains my credibility.  But we know that his many responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane researchers have legions of inner doubts.  Having been depressed now and then myself, it’s helpful to understand at least intellectually</p><p>6 0.34826544 <a title="137-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-12-01-NIPS_tutorials_and_Vowpal_Wabbit_7.4.html">492 hunch net-2013-12-01-NIPS tutorials and Vowpal Wabbit 7.4</a></p>

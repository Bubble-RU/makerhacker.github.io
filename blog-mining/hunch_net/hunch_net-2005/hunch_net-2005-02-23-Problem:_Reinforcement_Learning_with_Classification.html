<p>Introduction: What?  Reductions are machines which turn solvers for one problem into solvers for another problem. 
 Why?  Reductions are useful for several reasons.
  
  Laziness .  Reducing a problem to classification make at least 10 learning algorithms available to solve a problem.  Inventing 10 learning algorithms is quite a bit of work.  Similarly, programming a reduction is often trivial, while programming a learning algorithm is a great deal of work. 
  Crystallization .  The problems we often want to solve in learning are worst-case-impossible, but average case feasible.  By reducing all problems onto one or a few primitives, we can fine tune these primitives to perform well on real-world problems with greater precision due to the greater number of problems to validate on. 
  Theoretical Organization .  By studying what reductions are easy vs. hard vs. impossible, we can learn which problems are roughly equivalent in difficulty and which are much harder.

<p>Introduction: Several recent papers have shown that SVM-like optimizations can be used to handle several large family loss functions.
 
This is a good thing because it is implausible that the  loss  function imposed by the world can not be taken into account in the process of solving a prediction problem.  Even people used to the hard-core  Bayesian  approach to learning often note that some approximations are almost inevitable in specifying a  prior  and/or integrating to achieve a posterior.  Taking into account how the system will be evaluated can allow both computational effort and design effort to be focused so as to improve performance.

<p>Introduction: One prescription for solving a problem well is:
  
 State the problem, in the simplest way possible. In particular, this statement should involve no contamination with or anticipation of the solution. 
 Think about solutions to the stated problem. 
  
Stating a problem in a succinct and crisp manner tends to invite a simple elegant solution.  When a problem can not be stated succinctly, we  wonder if the problem is even understood. (And when a problem is not understood, we wonder if a solution can be meaningful.)
 
Reinforcement learning does step (1) well.  It provides a clean simple language to state general AI problems.  In reinforcement learning there is a set of actions  A , a set of observations  O , and a reward  r .  The reinforcement learning problem, in general, is defined by a conditional measure  D( o, r | (o,r,a) * )  which produces an observation  o  and a reward  r  given a history  (o,r,a) *  .  The goal in reinforcement learning is to find a policy  pi:(o,r,a) *  -> a</p><p>5 0.18025815 <a title="27-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-14-Explorations_of_Exploration.html">183 hunch net-2006-06-14-Explorations of Exploration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Exploration is one of the big unsolved problems in machine learning. This isn’t for lack of trying—there are many models of exploration which have been analyzed in many different ways by many different groups of people. At some point, it is worthwhile to sit back and see what has been done across these many models.
  
   Reinforcement Learning  (1) . Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on Markov Decision Processes where the next state  s’    is given by a conditional distribution  P(s’|s,a)  given the current state  s  and action  a .  The typical result here is that certain specific algorithms controlling an agent can behave within  e  of optimal for horizon  T  except for  poly(1/e,T,S,A)  “wasted” experiences (with high probability).  This started with  E 3   by  Satinder Singh  and  Michael Kearns .  Sham Kakade’s thesis  has significant discussion. Extensions have typically been of the form “under extra assumptions, we can prove more”, for example  Factored-E 3   and</p><p>6 0.16976093 <a title="27-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks_for_RL.html">148 hunch net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks for RL</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pieter Abbeel  presented a paper with  Andrew Ng  at  ICML  on  Exploration and Apprenticeship Learning in Reinforcement Learning .  The basic idea of this algorithm is:
  
 Collect data from a human controlling a machine. 
 Build a transition model based upon the experience. 
 Build a policy which optimizes the transition model. 
 Evaluate the policy.  If it works well, halt, otherwise add the experience into the pool and go to (2). 
  
The paper proves that this technique will converge to some policy with expected performance near human expected performance assuming the  world fits certain assumptions (MDP or linear dynamics).  
 
This general idea of apprenticeship learning (i.e. incorporating data from an expert) seems very compelling because (a) humans often learn this way and (b) much harder problems can be solved.   For (a), the notion of teaching is about transferring knowledge from an expert to novices, often via demonstration.

<p>Introduction: The hunch.net server has been updated.  I’ve taken the opportunity to upgrade the version of wordpress which caused cascading changes.
  
 Old threaded comments are now flattened.  The system we used to use ( Brian’s threaded comments ) appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress.  I haven’t yet figured out a workaround. 
 I setup a  feedburner account . 
 I added an RSS aggregator for both Machine Learning and other research blogs that I like to follow.  This is something that I’ve wanted to do for awhile. 
 Many other minor changes in font and format, with some help from  Alina . 
  
If you have any suggestions for site tweaks, please speak up.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9244141 <a title="27-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-23-Problem%3A_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Classification.html">27 hunch net-2005-02-23-Problem: Reinforcement Learning with Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At an intuitive level, the question here is “Can reinforcement learning be solved with classification?”  
 
 Problem  Construct a reinforcement learning algorithm with near-optimal expected sum of rewards in the  direct experience model  given access to a classifier learning algorithm which has a small error rate or regret on all posed classification problems.  The definition of “posed” here is slightly murky.  I consider a problem “posed” if there is an algorithm for constructing labeled classification examples.
 
 Past Work 
  
 There exists a  reduction of reinforcement learning to classification given a generative model.   A generative model is an inherently stronger assumption than the direct experience model. 
 Other  work on learning reductions  may be important. 
 Several algorithms for solving reinforcement learning in the direct experience model exist.  Most, such as  E 3  ,  Factored-E 3  , and  metric-E 3   and  Rmax  require that the observation be the state.

<p>Introduction: Compressed Sensing  (CS) is a new framework developed by  Emmanuel Candes ,  Terry Tao  and  David Donoho . To summarize, if you acquire a signal in some basis that is incoherent with the basis in which you know the signal to be sparse in, it is very likely you will be able to reconstruct the signal from these incoherent projections. 
 
Terry Tao, the recent  Fields medalist , does a very nice job at explaining the framework  here . He goes further in the theory description in this  post  where he mentions the central issue of the Uniform Uncertainty Principle. It so happens that random projections are on average incoherent, within the UUP meaning, with most known basis (sines, polynomials, splines, wavelets, curvelets …) and are therefore an ideal basis for Compressed Sensing. [ For more in-depth information on the subject, the Rice group has done a very good job at providing a central library of papers relevant to the growing subject:  http://www.dsp.ece.rice.edu/cs/  ]

<p>Introduction: For most people, a mathematical notation is like a language: you learn it and stick with it.  For people doing mathematical research, however, this is not enough: they must design new notations for new problems.  The design of good notation is both hard and worthwhile since a bad initial notation can retard a line of research greatly.  
 
Before we had mathematical notation, equations were all written out in language.  Since words have multiple meanings and variable precedences, long equations written out in language can be extraordinarily difficult and sometimes fundamentally ambiguous.  A good representative example of this is the legalese in the tax code.  Since we want greater precision and clarity, we adopt mathematical notation.
 
One fundamental thing to understand about mathematical notation, is that humans as logic verifiers, are barely capable.  This is the fundamental reason why one notation can be much better than another.  This observation is easier to miss than you might</p><p>5 0.83172888 <a title="27-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-28-Learning_Theory_standards_for_NIPS_2006.html">204 hunch net-2006-08-28-Learning Theory standards for NIPS 2006</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Bob Williamson  and I are the learning theory PC members at  NIPS  this year.  This is some attempt to state the standards and tests I applied to the papers.  I think it is a good idea to talk about this for two reasons:
  
 Making community standards a matter of public record seems healthy.  It give us a chance to debate what is and is not the right standard.  It might even give us a bit more consistency across the years. 
 It may save us all time.  There are a number of papers submitted which just aren’t there yet.  Avoiding submitting is the right decision in this case. 
  
There are several criteria for judging a paper.  All of these were active this year.  Some criteria are uncontroversial while others may be so.
  
 The paper must have a theorem establishing something new for which it is possible to derive high confidence in the correctness of the results.  A surprising number of papers fail this test.  This criteria seems essential to the definition of “theory”.

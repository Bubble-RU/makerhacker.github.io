<p>Introduction: Here are a few of the papers I enjoyed at ICML.Steffen Bickel, Michael
BrÃƒÂ¼eckner,Tobias Scheffer,Discriminative Learning for Differing Training
and Test DistributionsThere is a nice trick in this paper: they predict the
probability that an unlabeled sample is in the training set vs. the test set,
and then use this prediction to importance weight labeled samples in the
training set. This paper uses a specific parametric model, but the approach is
easily generalized.Steve HannekeA Bound on the Label Complexity of Agnostic
Active LearningThis paper bounds the number of labels required by the
A2algorithm for active learning in the agnostic case. Last year we figured out
agnostic active learning was possible. This year, it's quantified. Hopefull
soon, it will be practical.Sylvian Gelly,David SilverCombining Online and

<p>Introduction: Let's define a learning problem as making predictions given past data. There
are several ways to attack the learning problem which seem to be equivalent to
solving the learning problem.Find the InvariantThis viewpoint says that
learning is all about learning (or incorporating) transformations of objects
that do not change the correct prediction. The best possible invariant is the
one which says "all things of the same class are the same". Finding this is
equivalent to learning. This viewpoint is particularly common when working
with image features.Feature SelectionThis viewpoint says that the way to learn
is by finding the right features to input to a learning algorithm. The best
feature is the one which is the class to predict. Finding this is equivalent
to learning for all reasonable learning algorithms. This viewpoint is common
in several applications of machine learning. SeeGilad's and Bianca's
comments.Find the RepresentationThis is almost the same as feature selection,
except int</p><p>4 0.098597795 <a title="139-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-01-NIPS%3A_Online_Bayes.html">8 hunch net-2005-02-01-NIPS: Online Bayes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One nice use for this blog is to consider and discuss papers that that have
appeared at recent conferences. I really enjoyed Andrew Ng and Sham Kakade's
paperOnline Bounds for Bayesian Algorithms. From the paper:The philosophy
taken in the Bayesian methodology is often at odds withthat in the online
learning community…. the online learning settingmakes rather minimal
assumptions on the conditions under which thedata are being presented to the
learner â€”usually, Nature could provideexamples in an adversarial manner. We
study the performance ofBayesian algorithms in a more adversarial setting… We
providecompetitive bounds when the cost function is the log loss, and
wecompare our performance to the best model in our model class (as inthe
experts setting).It's a very nice analysis of some of my favorite algorithms
that all hinges around a beautiful theorem:Let Q be any distribution over
parameters theta. Then for all sequences S:L_{Bayes}(S) leq L_Q(S) +
KL(Q|P)where P is our prior and th</p><p>5 0.093369879 <a title="139-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-05-more_icml_papers.html">189 hunch net-2006-07-05-more icml papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.Topic Models:Dynamic Topic
ModelsDavid Blei, John LaffertyA nice model for how topics in LDA type models
can evolve over time,using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters
and a veryclever structured variational approximation (in which the mean
fieldparameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all
Bleipapers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive.Pachinko

<p>Introduction: Following up on Hal Daume's post and John's post on cool and interesting
things seen at NIPS I'll post my own little list of neat papers here as well.
Of course it's going to be biased towards what I think is interesting. Also, I
have to say that I hadn't been able to see many papers this year at nips due
to myself being too busy, so please feel free to contribute the papers that
you liked1. P. Mudigonda, V. Kolmogorov, P. Torr. An Analysis of Convex
Relaxations for MAP Estimation. A surprising paper which shows that many of
the more sophisticated convex relaxations that had been proposed recently
turns out to be subsumed by the simplest LP relaxation. Be careful next time
you try a cool new convex relaxation!2. D. Sontag, T. Jaakkola. New Outer

<p>Introduction: I thought this was a very good NIPS with many excellent papers. The following
are a few NIPS papers which I liked and I hope to study more carefully when I
get the chance. The list is not exhaustive and in no particular
order…Preconditioner Approximations for Probabilistic Graphical
Models.Pradeeep Ravikumar and John Lafferty.I thought the use of
preconditioner methods from solving linear systems in the context of
approximate inference was novel and interesting. The results look good and I'd
like to understand the limitations.Rodeo: Sparse nonparametric regression in
high dimensions.John Lafferty and Larry Wasserman.A very interesting approach
to feature selection in nonparametric regression from a frequentist framework.
The use of lengthscale variables in each dimension reminds me a lot of
'Automatic Relevance Determination' in Gaussian process regression -- it would
be interesting to compare Rodeo to ARD in GPs.Interpolating between types and
tokens by estimating power law generators</p><p>5 0.58007485 <a title="139-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-16-Regularization_%3D_Robustness.html">185 hunch net-2006-06-16-Regularization = Robustness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Gibbs-Jaynes theorem is a classical result that tells us that the highest
entropy distribution (most uncertain, least committed, etc.) subject to
expectation constraints on a set of features is an exponential family
distribution with the features as sufficient statistics. In math,argmax_p
H(p)s.t. E_p[f_i] = c_iis given by e^{\sum \lambda_i f_i}/Z. (Z here is the
necessary normalization constraint, and the lambdas are free parameters we set
to meet the expectation constraints).A great deal of statistical mechanics
flows from this result, and it has proven very fruitful in learning as well.
(Motivating work in models in text learning and Conditional Random Fields, for
instance. ) The result has been demonstrated a number of ways. One of the most
elegant is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“geometricÃ¢â‚¬Â versionhere.In the case when the
expectation constraints come from data, this tells us that the maximum entropy
distribution is exactly the maximum likelihood distribution in the exponential
family. ItÃ</p><p>6 0.57571757 <a title="139-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Maximum_Margin_Mismatch%3F.html">77 hunch net-2005-05-29-Maximum Margin Mismatch?</a></p>

this year is Europe. This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the
general internationalization of science over the last few years. Withcuts to
basic sciencein the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside
the US become more attractive. Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the
immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english
in place. China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>2 0.91850984 <a title="139-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-17-Rexa_is_live.html">173 hunch net-2006-04-17-Rexa is live</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rexais now publicly available. Anyone can create an account and login.Rexa is
similar toCiteseerandGoogle Scholarin functionality with more emphasis on the
use of machine learning for intelligent information extraction. For example,
Rexa can automatically display a picture on an author's homepage when the

<p>Introduction: I'm visiting Beijing for thePao-Lu Hsu Statistics Conferenceon Machine
Learning.I had several discussions about the state of Chinese research. Given
the large population and economy, you might expect substantial research--more
than has been observed at international conferences. The fundamental problem
seems to be theCultural Revolutionwhich lobotimized higher education, and the
research associated with it. There has been a process of slow recovery since
then, which has begun to be felt in the research world via increased
participation in international conferences and (now) conferences in China.The
amount of effort going into construction in Beijing is very impressive--people
are literally building a skyscraper at night outside the window of the hotel
I'm staying at (and this is not unusual). If a small fraction of this effort
is later focused onto supporting research, the effect could be very
substantial. General growth in China's research portfolio should be expected.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.89220977 <a title="139-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-11-More_NIPS_Papers.html">139 hunch net-2005-12-11-More NIPS Papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let me add to John's post with a few of my own favouritesfrom this year's
conference. First, let me say thatSanjoy's talk,Coarse Sample Complexity
Bounds for ActiveLearningwas also one of my favourites, as was theForgettron
paper.I also really enjoyed the last third ofChristos'talkon the complexity of
finding Nash equilibria.And, speaking of tagging, I thinkthe U.Mass Citeseer
replacement systemRexafrom the demo track is very cool.Finally, let me add my
recommendations for specific papers:Z. Ghahramani, K. Heller:Bayesian Sets[no
preprint](A very elegant probabilistic information retrieval style modelof
which objects are "most like" a given subset of objects.)T. Griffiths, Z.
Ghahramani:Infinite Latent Feature Models andthe Indian Buffet

withbeautiful exchangeability properties.)K. Weinberger, J. Blitzer, L.

<p>Introduction: NIPSis the big winter conference of learning.Paper due date: June 3rd.
(Tweaked thanks toFei Sha.)Location: Vancouver (main program) Dec. 5-8 and
Whistler (workshops) Dec 9-10, BC, CanadaNIPS is larger than all of the other
learning conferences, partly because it's the only one at that time of year. I
recommend the workshops which are often quite interesting and energetic.</p><p>6 0.87156612 <a title="139-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-18-A_paper_not_at_Snowbird.html">431 hunch net-2011-04-18-A paper not at Snowbird</a></p>

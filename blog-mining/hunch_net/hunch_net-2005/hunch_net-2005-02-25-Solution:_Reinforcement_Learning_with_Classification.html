<p>Introduction: I have decided to run a weblog on machine learning and learning theory
research. Here are some reasons:1) Weblogs enable new functionality:Public
comment on papers. No mechanism for this exists at conferences and most
journals. I have encountered it once for asciencepaper. Some communities have
mailing lists supporting this, but not machine learning or learning theory. I
have often read papers and found myself wishing there was some method to
consider other's questions and read the replies.Conference shortlists. One of
the most common conversations at a conference is "what did you find
interesting?" There is no explicit mechanism for sharing this information at
conferences, and it's easy to imagine that it would be handy to do
so.Evaluation and comment on research directions. Papers are almost
exclusively about new research, rather than evaluation (and consideration) of
research directions. This last role is satisfied by funding agencies to some
extent, but that is a private debate of</p><p>3 0.10482633 <a title="29-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-15-NIPS_workshops_extended_to_3_days.html">266 hunch net-2007-10-15-NIPS workshops extended to 3 days</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (Unofficially, at least.) TheDeep Learning Workshopis being held the afternoon
before the rest of the workshops in Vancouver, BC. Separate registration is
needed, and open.What's happening fundamentally here is that there are too
many interesting workshops to fit into 2 days. Perhaps we can get it
officially expanded to 3 days next year.</p><p>4 0.094667256 <a title="29-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-25-1_year.html">151 hunch net-2006-01-25-1 year</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the one year (+5 days) anniversary, the natural question is: "Was it
helpful for research?"Answer: Yes, and so it shall continue.Some evidence is
provided by noticing that I am about a factor of 2 more overloaded with paper
ideas than I've ever previously been. It is always hard to estimate
counterfactual worlds, but I expect that this is also a factor of 2 more than
"What if I had not started the blog?"As for "Why?", there seem to be two
primary effects.A blog is a mechanism for connecting with people who either
think like you or are interested in the same problems. This allows for
concentration of thinking which is very helpful in solving problems.The
process of stating things you don't understand publicly is very helpful in
understanding them. Sometimes you are simply forced to express them in a way
which aids understanding. Sometimes someone else says something which helps.
And sometimes you discover that someone else has already solved the
problem.There are drawbacks which shou</p><p>5 0.085678115 <a title="29-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-11-AAAI_blog.html">92 hunch net-2005-07-11-AAAI blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Martin Pooland I recently discussed the similarities and differences between
academia and open source programming.Similarities:Cost profileResearch and
programming share approximately the same cost profile: A large upfront effort
is required to produce something useful, and then "anyone" can use it. (The
"anyone" is not quite right for either group because only sufficiently
technical people could use it.)Wealth profileA "wealthy" academic or open
source programmer is someone who has contributed a lot to other people in
research or programs. Much of academia is a "gift culture": whoever gives the
most is most respected.ProblemsBoth academia and open source programming
suffer from similar problems.Whether or not (and which) open source program is
used are perhaps too-often personality driven rather than driven by capability
or usefulness. Similar phenomena can happen in academia with respect to
directions of research.Funding is often a problem for both groups. Academics

<p>Introduction: Watsonconvincingly beat the best championJeopardy!players. The apparent
significance of this varies hugely, depending on your background knowledge
about the related machine learning, NLP, and search technology. For a random
person, this might seem evidence of serious machine intelligence, while for
people working on the system itself, it probably seems like a reasonably good
assemblage of existing technologies with several twists to make the entire
system work.Above all, I think we should congratulate the people who managed
to put together and execute this project--many years of effort by a diverse
set of highly skilled people were needed to make this happen. In academia,
it's pretty difficult for one professor to assemble that quantity of talent,
and in industry it's rarely the case that such a capable group has both a
worthwhile project and the support needed to pursue something like this for
several years before success.Alinainvited me to the Jeopardy watching party

<p>Introduction: Consider the contextual bandit setting where, repeatedly:A contextxis
observed.An actionais taken given the contextx.A rewardris observed, dependent
onxanda.Where the goal of a learning agent is to find a policy for step 2
achieving a large expected reward.This setting is of obvious importance,
because in the real world we typically make decisions based on some set of
information and then get feedback only about the single action taken. It also
fundamentally differs from supervised learning settings because knowing the
value of one action is not equivalent to knowing the value of all actions.A
decade ago the best machine learning techniques for this setting where
implausibly inefficient.Dean Fosteronce told me he thought the area was a

of being able to routinely attack these problems, in almost exactly the same

<p>Introduction: The prevailing wisdom in machine learning seems to be that motivating a paper
is the responsibility of the author. I think this is a harmful view--instead,
it's healthier for the community to regard this as the responsibility of the
reviewer.There are lots of reasons to prefer a reviewer-responsibility
approach.Authors are the most biased possible source of information about the
motivation of the paper. Systems which rely upon very biased sources of
information are inherently unreliable.Authors are highly variable in their
ability and desire to express motivation for their work. This adds greatly to
variance on acceptance of an idea, and it can systematically discriminate or
accentuate careers. It's great if you have a career accentuated by awesome
wording choice, but wise decision making by reviewers is important for the
field.The motivation section in a paper doesn'tdoanything in some sense--it's
there to get the paper in. Reading the motivation of a paper is of little use
in helping</p><p>4 0.60615373 <a title="29-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-28-Somebody%26%238217%3Bs_Eating_Your_Lunch.html">445 hunch net-2011-09-28-Somebody&#8217;s Eating Your Lunch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since we last discussedthe other online learning,Stanfordhas very visibly
started pushing mass teaching inAI,Machine Learning, andDatabases. In
retrospect, it's not too surprising that the next step up in serious online
teaching experiments are occurring at the computer science department of a
university embedded in the land of startups. Numbers on the order of100000are
quite significant--similar in scale to the number ofcomputer science
undergraduate students/yearin the US. Although these populations surely
differ, the fact that theycouldoverlap is worth considering for the
future.It's too soon to say how successful these classes will be and there are
many easy criticisms to make:Registration != Learning… but if only 1/10th
complete these classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of any
traditional process.1st year excitement != nth year routine… but if only
1/10th take future classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of
any traditional process.Hello, che</p><p>5 0.59500217 <a title="29-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-16-The_Everything_Ensemble_Edge.html">131 hunch net-2005-11-16-The Everything Ensemble Edge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rich Caruana,Alexandru Niculescu, Geoff Crew, and Alex Ksikes have donea lot
of empirical testingwhich shows thatusing all methods to make a predictionis
more powerful than using any single method. This is in rough agreement with
the Bayesian way of solving problems, but based upon a different (essentially
empirical) motivation. A rough summary is:Take all of {decision trees, boosted
decision trees, bagged decision trees, boosted decision stumps, K nearest
neighbors, neural networks, SVM} with all reasonable parameter settings.Run
the methods on each problem of 8 problems with a large test set, calibrating
margins using eithersigmoid fittingorisotonic regression.For each loss of
{accuracy, area under the ROC curve, cross entropy, squared error, etcâ&euro;Ś}
evaluate the average performance of the method.A series of conclusions can be
drawn from the observations.(Calibrated) boosted decision trees appear to
perform best, in general although support vector machines and neural networks

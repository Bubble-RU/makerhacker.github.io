<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea
how to solve. In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to
decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a
solution to the larger problem. This approach can go wrong in several
ways.Decomposition failure. The solution to the decomposition does not in fact
yield a solution to the overall problem.Artificial hardness. The subproblems
created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are
harder than necessary.As you can see, computational complexity forms a
relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach
sufficient but not necessary.In my experience, the artificial hardness problem
is very common. Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a
problem to work on to other people. This process starts very naturally as a
graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively little idea
about how to do</p><p>5 0.15115662 <a title="22-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-30-ICML_Posters_and_Scope.html">454 hunch net-2012-01-30-ICML Posters and Scope</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally, I don't indulge in posters forICML, but this year is naturally an
exception for me. If you want one, there are a small numberleft here, if you
sign up before February.It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the
scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting
papers. At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which
informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers. Program chairs setup
the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the
reviewing process. Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because
a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the
community determine the conference. Nevertheless, as a program chair this year
it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to
encourage (and occasionally discourage).At the highest level, I believe ICML
exists to further research into machine learning, which I generally think of

<p>Introduction: There are many ways that interesting research gets done. For example it's
common at a conference for someone to discuss a problem with a partial
solution, and for someone else to know how to solve a piece of it, resulting
in a paper. In some sense, these are the easiest results we can achieve, so we
should ask: Can all research be this easy?The answer is certainly no for
fields where research inherently requires experimentation to discover how the
real world works. However, mathematics, including parts of physics, computer
science, statistics, etcâ&euro;Ś which are effectively mathematics don't require
experimentation. In effect, a paper can be simply a pure expression of
thinking. Can all mathematical-style research be this easy?What's going on
here is research-by-communication. Someone knows something, someone knows
something else, and as soon as someone knows both things, a problem is solved.
The interesting thing about research-by-communication is that it is becoming
radically easier with</p><p>3 0.81033927 <a title="22-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Bad_ideas.html">76 hunch net-2005-05-29-Bad ideas</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found these two essays on bad ideas interesting. Neither of these is written
from the viewpoint of research, but they are both highly relevant.Why smart
people have bad ideasby Paul GrahamWhy smart people defend bad ideasby Scott
Berkun (which appeared onslashdot)In my experience, bad ideas are
commonandover confidence in ideas is common. This overconfidence can take
either the form of excessive condemnation or excessive praise. Some of this is
necessary to the process of research. For example, some overconfidence in the
value of your own research is expected and probably necessary to motivate your
own investigation. Since research is a rather risky business, much of it does
not pan out. Learning to accept when something does not pan out is a critical
skill which is sometimes never acquired.Excessive condemnation can be a real
ill when it's encountered. This has two effects:When the penalty for being
wrong is too large, it means people have a great investment in defending

<p>Introduction: Here are a few papers fromCOLT 2008that I found interesting.Maria-Florina
Balcan,Steve Hanneke, andJenn Wortman,The True Sample Complexity of Active
Learning. This paper shows that in an asymptotic setting, active learning
isalwaysbetter than supervised learning (although the gap may be small). This
is evidence that the only thing in the way of universal active learning is us
knowing how to do it properly.Nir AilonandMehryar Mohri,An Efficient Reduction
of Ranking to Classification. This paper shows how to robustly ranknobjects
withn log(n)classifications using a quicksort based algorithm. The result is
applicable to many ranking loss functions and has implications for
others.Michael KearnsandJennifer Wortman.Learning from Collective Behavior.
This is about learning in a new model, where the goal is to predict how a
collection of interacting agents behave. One claim is that learning in this
setting can be reduced to IID learning.Due to the relation withMetric-E3, I

<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point
of view of an undergraduate. The shift from a class-taking mentality to a
research mentality is very significant and not easy.Problem PosingPosing the
right problem is often as important as solving them. Many people can get by in
research by solving problems others have posed, but that's not sufficient for
really inspiring research. For learning in particular, there is a strong
feeling that we just haven't figured out which questions are the right ones to
ask. You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem
convincing.Gambling your lifeWhen you do research, you think very hard about
new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions. Many
conversations are of the form "I wonder what would happen if…" These processes
can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours. The worst part is that
you'll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and
sometimes not even then be</p><p>6 0.79022855 <a title="22-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

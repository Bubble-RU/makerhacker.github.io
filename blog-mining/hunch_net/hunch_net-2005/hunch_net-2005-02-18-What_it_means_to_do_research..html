<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is a field with an impressively diverse set of reseearch styles.  Understanding this may be important in appreciating what you see at a conference.
  
  Engineering . How can I solve this problem?  People in the engineering research style try to solve hard problems directly by any means available and then describe how they did it.  This is typical of problem-specific conferences and communities. 
  Scientific . What are the principles for solving learning problems? People in this research style test techniques on many different problems.  This is fairly common at ICML and NIPS. 
  Mathematical . How can the learning problem be mathematically understood?  People in this research style prove theorems with implications for learning but often do not implement (or test algorithms).  COLT is a typical conference for this style. 
  
Many people manage to cross these styles, and that is often beneficial.

<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea how to solve.  In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a solution to the larger problem.  This approach can go wrong in several ways. 
  
  Decomposition failure .  The solution to the decomposition does not in fact yield a solution to the overall problem. 
  Artificial hardness .  The subproblems created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are harder than necessary. 
  
As you can see, computational complexity forms a relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach sufficient but not necessary.
 
In my experience, the artificial hardness problem is very common.  Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a problem to work on to other people.  This process starts very naturally as a graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively l</p><p>5 0.14338394 <a title="22-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-30-ICML_Posters_and_Scope.html">454 hunch net-2012-01-30-ICML Posters and Scope</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally, I don’t indulge in posters for  ICML , but this year is naturally an exception for me.   If you want one, there are a small number  left here , if you sign up before February.
 
It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting papers.  At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers.  Program chairs setup the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the reviewing process.  Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the community determine the conference.  Nevertheless, as a program chair this year it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to encourage (and occasionally discourage).

<p>Introduction: I found these two essays on bad ideas interesting.  Neither of these is written from the viewpoint of research, but they are both highly relevant.
  
  Why smart people have bad ideas  by Paul Graham 
  Why smart people defend bad ideas  by Scott Berkun (which appeared on  slashdot ) 
  
In my experience, bad ideas are common  and  over confidence in ideas is common.  This overconfidence can take either the form of excessive condemnation or excessive praise.  Some of this is necessary to the process of research.  For example, some overconfidence in the value of your own research is expected and probably necessary to motivate your own investigation.  Since research is a rather risky business, much of it does not pan out.  Learning to accept when something does not pan out is a critical skill which is sometimes never acquired.
 
Excessive condemnation can be a real ill when it’s encountered.  This has two effects:

<p>Introduction: There are many ways that interesting research gets done.  For example it’s common at a conference for someone to discuss a problem with a partial solution, and for someone else to know how to solve a piece of it, resulting in a paper.  In some sense,  these are the easiest results we can achieve, so we should ask: Can all research be this easy?  
 
The answer is certainly no for fields where research inherently requires  experimentation to discover how the real world works.  However, mathematics, including parts of physics, computer science, statistics, etc… which are effectively mathematics don’t require experimentation. In effect, a paper can be simply a pure expression of thinking.  Can all mathematical-style research be this easy?
 
What’s going on here is research-by-communication.  Someone knows something, someone knows something else, and as soon as someone knows both things, a problem is solved.  The interesting thing about research-by-communication is that it is becoming radic</p><p>4 0.78108311 <a title="22-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-08-Debugging_Your_Brain.html">147 hunch net-2006-01-08-Debugging Your Brain</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One part of doing research is debugging your understanding of reality.  This is hard work: How do you even discover where you misunderstand?  If you discover a misunderstanding, how do you go about removing it?
 
The process of debugging computer programs is quite analogous to debugging reality misunderstandings.   This is natural—a bug in a computer program is a misunderstanding between you and the computer about what you said.  Many of the familiar techniques from debugging have exact parallels.
  
  Details  When programming, there are often signs that some bug exists like: “the graph my program output is shifted a little bit” = maybe you have an indexing error.  In debugging yourself, we often have some impression that something is “not right”. These impressions should be addressed directly and immediately.  (Some people have the habit of suppressing worries in favor of excess certainty.  That’s not healthy for research.)

<p>Introduction: I’m visiting Beijing for the  Pao-Lu Hsu Statistics Conference  on Machine Learning.
 
I had several discussions about the state of Chinese research.  Given the large population and economy, you might expect substantial research—more than has been observed at international conferences.  The fundamental problem seems to be the  Cultural Revolution  which  lobotimized higher education, and the research associated with it.  There has been a process of slow recovery since then, which has begun to be felt in the research world via increased participation in international conferences and (now) conferences in China.
 
The amount of effort going into construction in Beijing is very impressive—people are literally building a skyscraper at night outside the window of the hotel I’m staying at (and this is not unusual).  If a small fraction of this effort is later focused onto supporting research, the effect could be very substantial.  General growth in China’s research portfolio should be expecte</p><p>2 0.94013816 <a title="22-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-30-COLT_2007.html">242 hunch net-2007-04-30-COLT 2007</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Registration for COLT 2007 is now open.
 
The conference will take place on 13-15 June, 2007, in San Diego, California, as part of the 2007 Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC), which includes STOC, Complexity, and EC.
 
The website for COLT: http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2007/index.html
 
The early registration deadline is May 11, and the cutoff date for discounted hotel rates is May 9.
 
Before registering, take note that the fees are substantially lower for members of ACM and/or SIGACT than for nonmembers. If youâ&euro;&trade;ve been contemplating joining either of these two societies (annual dues: $99 for ACM, $18 for SIGACT), now would be a good time!</p><p>3 0.93140668 <a title="22-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-29-The_Benefits_of_Double-Blind_Review.html">485 hunch net-2013-06-29-The Benefits of Double-Blind Review</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is a (near) transcript of a talk that I gave at the  ICML 2013 Workshop on Peer Review and Publishing Models . Although there’s a  PDF available on my website , I’ve chosen to post a slightly modified version here as well in order to better facilitate discussion.
 
 Disclaimers and Context 
 
I want to start with a couple of disclaimers and some context.
 
First, I want to point out that although I’ve read a lot about double-blind review, this isn’t my research area and the research discussed in this post is not my own. As a result, I probably can’t answer super detailed questions about these studies.
 
I also want to note that I’m not opposed to open peer review — I was a free and open source software developer for over ten years and I care a great deal about openness and transparency. Rather, my motivation in writing this post is simply to create awareness of and to initiate discussion about the benefits of double-blind review.
 
Lastly, and most importantly, I think it’s e</p><p>4 0.88508785 <a title="22-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-06-Research_Political_Issues.html">282 hunch net-2008-01-06-Research Political Issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest.  The problem with discussing politics is that it’s customary for people to say much based upon little information.  Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa).  It’s primary election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the issues are not.
 
There are several policy decisions which substantially effect development of science and technology in the US.
  
  Education  The US has great contrasts in education.  The top universities are very good places, yet the grade school education system produces mediocre results.  For me, the contrast between a  public education  and  Caltech  was bracing.  For many others attending Caltech, it clearly was not.  Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about.  My own experience is that a basic attitude of “no child unrealized” i</p><p>same-blog 5 0.86262596 <a title="22-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-18-What_it_means_to_do_research..html">22 hunch net-2005-02-18-What it means to do research.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point of view of an undergraduate.  The shift from a class-taking mentality to a research mentality is very significant and not easy.  
  
  Problem Posing  Posing the right problem is often as important as solving them.  Many people can get by in research by solving problems others have posed, but that’s not sufficient for really inspiring research.  For learning in particular, there is a strong feeling that we just haven’t figured out which questions are the right ones to ask.  You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem convincing. 
  Gambling your life  When you do research, you think very hard about new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions.  Many conversations are of the form “I wonder what would happen if…” These processes can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours.  The worst part is that you’ll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and some</p><p>6 0.85097826 <a title="22-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-04-The_Health_of_COLT.html">89 hunch net-2005-07-04-The Health of COLT</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4,
2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245
participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a
lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see
ourWIKIfor more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as
organizers to screw it up too bad. Also, since we have pretty good
infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and
Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it
was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this
two-week long party of machine learning.In the end of MLSS we distributed a
survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this
survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from
participants.The first question is designed to find out how our participants
learned about MLSS 2006 Taipei.</p><p>5 0.14084029 <a title="81-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-04-Health_of_Conferences_Wiki.html">212 hunch net-2006-10-04-Health of Conferences Wiki</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There will be no New York ML Symposium this year. The core issue is thatNYASis
disorganized by people leaving, pushing back the date, with the current
candidate a spring symposium on March 28.Gunnarand I were outvoted here--we
were gung ho on organizing a fall symposium, but the rest of the committee
wants to wait.In some good news, most of theICML 2012 videoshave been restored
from a deep backup.</p><p>2 0.94878465 <a title="81-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-04-Vowpal_Wabbit%2C_version_5.0%2C_and_the_second_heresy.html">419 hunch net-2010-12-04-Vowpal Wabbit, version 5.0, and the second heresy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've releasedversion 5.0of theVowpal Wabbitonline learning software. The major
number has changed since thelast releasebecause I regard all earlier versions
as obsolete--there are several new algorithms & features including substantial
changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.The biggest changes are
new algorithms:Nikosand I improved the default algorithm. The basic update
rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully
controlled so that it's impossible to overrun the label. In addition, the
normalization has changed. Computationally, these changes are virtually free
and yield better results, sometimes much better. Less careful updates can be
reenabled with -loss_function classic, although results are still not
identical to previous due to normalization changes.Nikos also implemented the
per-feature learning rates as per thesetwopapers. Often, this works better
than the default algorithm. It isn't the default because it isn't (yet) as
adaptable</p><p>3 0.91413504 <a title="81-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-24-Online_convex_optimization_at_COLT.html">186 hunch net-2006-06-24-Online convex optimization at COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: AtICML 2003,Marty Zinkevichproposedthe online convex optimization setting and
showed that a particular gradient descent algorithm has regret O(T0.5) with
respect to the best predictor where T is the number of rounds. This seems to
be a nice model for online learning, and there has been some significant
follow-up work.AtCOLT 2006Elad Hazan,Adam Kalai,Satyen Kale, andAmit
Agarwalpresenteda modification which takes a Newton stepguaranteeing O(log T)
regret when the first and second derivatives are bounded.Then they applied
these algorithms to portfolio managementatICML 2006(withRobert Schapire)
yielding some very fun graphs.</p><p>4 0.91169727 <a title="81-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Maximum_Margin_Mismatch%3F.html">77 hunch net-2005-05-29-Maximum Margin Mismatch?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John makes a fascinating point about structured classification (and slightly
scooped my post!). Maximum Margin Markov Networks (M3N) are an interesting
example of the second class of structured classifiers (where the
classification of one label depends on the others), and one of my favorite
papers. I'm not alone: the paper won the best student paper award at NIPS in
2003.There are some things I find odd about the paper. For instance, it says
of probabilistic models"cannot handle high dimensional feature spaces and lack
strong theoretical guarrantees."I'm aware of no such limitations.
Also:"Unfortunately, even probabilistic graphical models that are trained
discriminatively do not achieve the same level of performance as SVMs,
especially when kernel features are used."This is quite interesting and
contradicts my own experience as well as that of a number of
peopleIgreatlyrespect. I wonder what the root cause is: perhaps there is
something different about the data Ben+Carlos were working</p><p>5 0.90432435 <a title="81-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-16-The_value_of_the_orthodox_view_of_Boosting.html">179 hunch net-2006-05-16-The value of the orthodox view of Boosting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The term "boosting" comes from the idea of using a meta-algorithm which takes
"weak" learners (that may be able to only barely predict slightly better than
random) and turn them into strongly capable learners (which predict very
well).Adaboostin 1995 was the first widely used (and useful) boosting
algorithm, although there were theoretical boosting algorithms floating around
since 1990 (see the bottom ofthis page).Since then, many different
interpretations of why boosting works have arisen. There is significant
discussion about these different views in theannals of statistics, including
aresponsebyYoav FreundandRobert Schapire.I believe there is a great deal of
value to be found in the original view of boosting (meta-algorithm for
creating a strong learner from a weak learner). This is not a claim that one
particular viewpoint obviates the value of all others, but rather that no
other viewpoint seems to really capture important properties.Comparing with
all other views of boosting is t</p><p>same-blog 6 0.90331227 <a title="81-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-13-Wikis_for_Summer_Schools_and_Workshops.html">81 hunch net-2005-06-13-Wikis for Summer Schools and Workshops</a></p>

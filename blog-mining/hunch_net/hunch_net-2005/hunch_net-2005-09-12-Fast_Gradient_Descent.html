<p>Introduction: We are releasing theVowpal Wabbit (Fast Online Learning) codeas open source
under a BSD (revised) license. This is aproject at Yahoo! Researchto build a
useful large scale learning algorithm whichLihong Li,Alex Strehl, and I have
been working on.To appreciate the meaning of "large", it's useful to define
"small" and "medium". A "small" supervised learning problem is one where a
human could use a labeled dataset and come up with a reasonable predictor. A
"medium" supervised learning problem dataset fits into the RAM of a modern
desktop computer. A "large" supervised learning problem is one which does not
fit into the RAM of a normal machine. VW tackles large scale learning problems
by this definition of large. I'm not aware of any other open source Machine
Learning tools which can handle this scale (although they may exist). A few
close ones are:IBM's Parallel Machine Learning Toolboxisn't quite open source.
The approach used by this toolbox is essentially map-reduce style computation,</p><p>5 0.17442065 <a title="111-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-19-Loss_Functions_for_Discriminative_Training_of_Energy-Based_Models.html">23 hunch net-2005-02-19-Loss Functions for Discriminative Training of Energy-Based Models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is apaperby Yann LeCun and Fu Jie Huang published atAISTAT 2005. I found
this paper very difficult to read, but it does have some point about a
computational shortcut.This paper takes for granted that the method of solving
a problem is gradient descent on parameters. Given this assumption, the
question arises: Do you want to do gradient descent on a probabilistic model
or something else?All (conditional) probabilistic models have the formp(y|x) =
f(x,y)/Z(x)whereZ(x) = sumyf(x,y)(the paper calls- log f(x,y)an "energy").
Iffis parameterized by somew, the gradient has a term forZ(x), and hence for
every value ofy. The paper claims, that such models can be optimized for
classification purposes using only the correctyand the othery' not ywhich
maximizesf(x,y). This can even be done on unnormalizable models. The paper
further claims that this can be done with an approximate maximum. These claims
are plausible based on experimental results and intuition.It wouldn't surprise
me to learn</p><p>6 0.17402562 <a title="111-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-16-The_value_of_the_orthodox_view_of_Boosting.html">179 hunch net-2006-05-16-The value of the orthodox view of Boosting</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the basic observations from theatomic learning workshopis that
gradient-based optimization is pervasive. For example, at least 7 (of 12)
speakers used the word 'gradient' in their talk and several others may be
approximating a gradient. The essential useful quality of a gradient is that
it decouples local updates from global optimization. Restated: Given a
gradient, we can determine how to change individual parameters of the system
so as to improve overall performance.It's easy to feel depressed about this
and think "nothing has happened", but that appears untrue. Many of the talks
were about clever techniques for computing gradients where your calculus
textbook breaks down.Sometimes there are clever approximations of the
gradient. (Simon Osindero)Sometimes we can compute constrained gradients via
iterated gradient/project steps. (Ben Taskar)Sometimes we can compute
gradients anyways over mildly nondifferentiable functions. (Drew Bagnell)Even
given a gradient, the choice of upda</p><p>4 0.73352754 <a title="111-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-16-The_value_of_the_orthodox_view_of_Boosting.html">179 hunch net-2006-05-16-The value of the orthodox view of Boosting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The term "boosting" comes from the idea of using a meta-algorithm which takes
"weak" learners (that may be able to only barely predict slightly better than
random) and turn them into strongly capable learners (which predict very
well).Adaboostin 1995 was the first widely used (and useful) boosting
algorithm, although there were theoretical boosting algorithms floating around
since 1990 (see the bottom ofthis page).Since then, many different
interpretations of why boosting works have arisen. There is significant
discussion about these different views in theannals of statistics, including
aresponsebyYoav FreundandRobert Schapire.I believe there is a great deal of
value to be found in the original view of boosting (meta-algorithm for
creating a strong learner from a weak learner). This is not a claim that one
particular viewpoint obviates the value of all others, but rather that no
other viewpoint seems to really capture important properties.Comparing with
all other views of boosting is t</p><p>5 0.69232106 <a title="111-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated_Gradient.html">258 hunch net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>

Dinculescuhas linked it in from the ICML site. Last year's attempt appears to
have been an acceptable but not wild success as a little bit of fruitful
discussion occurred. I'm hoping this year will be a bit more of a success--

<p>Introduction: Nic Schaudolphhas been developing a fast gradient descent algorithm
calledStochastic Meta-Descent(SMD).Gradient descent is currently untrendy in
the machine learning community, but there remains a large number of people
using gradient descent on neural networks or other architectures from when it
was trendy in the early 1990s. There are three problems with gradient
descent.Gradient descent does not necessarily produce easily reproduced
results. Typical algorithms start with "set the initial parameters to small
random values".The design of the representation that gradient descent is
applied to is often nontrivial. In particular, knowing exactly how to build a
large neural network so that it will perform well requires knowledge which has
not been made easily applicable.Gradient descent can be slow. Obviously,
taking infinitesimal steps in the direction of the gradient would take
forever, so some finite step size must be used. What exactly this step size
should be is unclear. Many people</p><p>3 0.71656871 <a title="111-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-26-Compositional_Machine_Learning_Algorithm_Design.html">311 hunch net-2008-07-26-Compositional Machine Learning Algorithm Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There weretwopapersat ICML presenting learning algorithms for acontextual
bandit-style setting, where the loss for all labels is not known, but the loss
for one label is known. (The first might require aexploration
scavengingviewpoint to understand if the experimental assignment was
nonrandom.) I strongly approve of these papers and further work in this
setting and its variants, because I expect it to become more important than
supervised learning. As a quick review, we are thinking about situations where
repeatedly:The world reveals feature values (aka context information).A policy
chooses an action.The world provides a reward.Sometimes this is done in an
online fashion where the policy can change based on immediate feedback and
sometimes it's done in a batch setting where many samples are collected before
the policy can change. If you haven't spent time thinking about the setting,
you might want to because there are many natural applications.I'm going to
pick on the Banditron paper (</p><p>4 0.66249055 <a title="111-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-18-Necessary_and_Sufficient_Research.html">370 hunch net-2009-09-18-Necessary and Sufficient Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea
how to solve. In trying to come up with a solution, a natural approach is to
decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a
solution to the larger problem. This approach can go wrong in several
ways.Decomposition failure. The solution to the decomposition does not in fact
yield a solution to the overall problem.Artificial hardness. The subproblems
created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem, but they are
harder than necessary.As you can see, computational complexity forms a
relatively new (in research-history) razor by which to judge an approach
sufficient but not necessary.In my experience, the artificial hardness problem
is very common. Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a
problem to work on to other people. This process starts very naturally as a
graduate student, when an incoming student might have relatively little idea
about how to do</p><p>5 0.60451353 <a title="111-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-10-Predictive_Search_is_Coming.html">120 hunch net-2005-10-10-Predictive Search is Coming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Search" is the other branch of AI research which has been succesful. Concrete
examples includeDeep Bluewhich beat the world chess champion andChinookthe
champion checkers program. A set of core search techniques exist including A*,
alpha-beta pruning, and others that can be applied to any of many different
search problems.Given this, it may be surprising to learn that there has been
relatively little succesful work on combining prediction and search. Given
also that humans typically solve search problems using a number of predictive
heuristics to narrow in on a solution, we might be surprised again. However,
the big successful search-based systems have typically not used "smart" search
algorithms. Insteady they have optimized for very fast search. This is not for
lack of tryingâ&euro;Ś many people have tried to synthesize search and prediction to
various degrees of success. For example,Knightcapachieves good-but-not-stellar
chess playing performance, andTD-gammonhas achieved near-optimal Bac</p><p>6 0.60015661 <a title="111-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-07-Is_the_Google_way_the_way_for_machine_learning%3F.html">136 hunch net-2005-12-07-Is the Google way the way for machine learning?</a></p>

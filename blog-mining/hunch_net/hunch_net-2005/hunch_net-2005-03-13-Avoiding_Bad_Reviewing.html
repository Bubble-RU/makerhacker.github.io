<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively

<p>Introduction: The many reviews following the many paper deadlines are just about over. AAAI
and ICML in particular were experimenting with several reviewing
techniques.Double Blind: AAAI and ICML were both double blind this year. It
seemed (overall) beneficial, but two problems arose.For theoretical papers,
with a lot to say, authors often leave out the proofs. This is very hard to
cope with under a double blind review because (1) you can not trust the
authors got the proof right but (2) a blanket "reject" hits many probably-good
papers. Perhaps authors should more strongly favor proof-complete papers sent
to double blind conferences.On the author side, double blind reviewing is
actually somewhat disruptive to research. In particular, it discourages the
author from talking about the subject, which is one of the mechanisms of
research. This is not a great drawback, but it is one not previously
appreciated.Author feedback: AAAI and ICML did author feedback this year. It
seemed helpful for several pape</p><p>5 0.30034703 <a title="40-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research. They provide many
roles including "announcing research", "meeting people", and "point of
reference". Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: "to what
extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?" This question is
very difficult to answer in any satisfying way. What we can do is compare
details of the process across multiple conferences.CommentsThe average quality
of comments across conferences can vary dramatically. At one extreme, the
tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback. At
the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing
detailed constructive feedback. Detailed feedback can give authors significant
guidance about how to improve research. This is the most subjective
entry.BlindVirtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors
do not know reviewers. Some also providedouble blindreview where reviewers do
not know authors. T</p><p>6 0.27683306 <a title="40-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-14-Who_is_Responsible_for_a_Bad_Review%3F.html">320 hunch net-2008-10-14-Who is Responsible for a Bad Review?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: as of last night, late.When the reviewing deadline passed Wednesday night 15%
of reviews were still missing, much higher than I expected. Between late
reviews coming in, ACs working overtime through the weekend, and people
willing to help in the pinch another ~390 reviews came in, reducing the
missing mass to 0.2%. Nailing that last bit and a similar quantity of papers
with uniformly low confidence reviews is what remains to be done in terms of
basic reviews. We are trying to make all of those happen this week so authors
have some chance to respond.I was surprised by the quantity of late reviews,
and I think that's an area where ICML needs to improve in future years. Good
reviews are not done in a rush--they are done by setting aside time (like an
afternoon), and carefully reading the paper while thinking about implications.
Many reviewers do this well but a significant minority aren't good at
scheduling their personal time. In this situation there are several ways to
fail:Give early w</p><p>5 0.81569958 <a title="40-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-03-Bidding_Problems.html">315 hunch net-2008-09-03-Bidding Problems</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers
is via bidding, which has steps something like:Invite people to reviewAccept
papersReviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are
interested in reviewing.Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get
approximately the papers they bid for.At the ICML business meeting,Andrew
McCallumsuggested getting rid of bidding for papers. A couple reasons were
given:PrivacyThe title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to
every participating reviewer. Some authors might be uncomfortable about this
for submitted papers. I'm not sympathetic to this reason: the point of
submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not
publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited.CliquesA bidding
system is gameable. If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your
submissions, you can each bid for your friend's papers and express a
disinterest in others. There</p><p>6 0.81426758 <a title="40-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>

seemed (overall) beneficial, but two problems arose.For theoretical papers,
with a lot to say, authors often leave out the proofs. This is very hard to
cope with under a double blind review because (1) you can not trust the
authors got the proof right but (2) a blanket "reject" hits many probably-good
papers. Perhaps authors should more strongly favor proof-complete papers sent
to double blind conferences.On the author side, double blind reviewing is
actually somewhat disruptive to research. In particular, it discourages the
author from talking about the subject, which is one of the mechanisms of
research. This is not a great drawback, but it is one not previously
appreciated.Author feedback: AAAI and ICML did author feedback this year. It

<p>Introduction: If we accept that bad reviewing often occurs and want to fix it, the question
is "how"?Reviewing is done by paper writers just like yourself, so a good
proxy for this question is asking "How can I be a better reviewer?" Here are a
few things I've learned by trial (and error), as a paper writer, and as a
reviewer.The secret ingredient is careful thought. There is no good
substitution for a deep and careful understanding.Avoid reviewing papers that
you feel competitive about. You almost certainly will be asked to review
papers that feel competitive if you work on subjects of common interest. But,
the feeling of competition can easily lead to bad judgement.If you feel biased
for some other reason, then you should avoid reviewing. For exampleâ&euro;ŚFeeling
angry or threatened by a paper is a form of bias. See above.Double blind
yourself (avoid looking at the name even in a single-blind situation). The
significant effect of a name you recognize is making you pay close attention
to a paper. Since</p><p>4 0.9505983 <a title="40-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-09-The_Stock_Prediction_Machine_Learning_Problem.html">193 hunch net-2006-07-09-The Stock Prediction Machine Learning Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: …is discussed inthis nytimes article. I generally expect such approaches to
become more common since computers are getting faster, machine learning is
getting better, and data is becoming more plentiful. This is another example
where machine learning technology may have a huge economic impact. Some side
notes:We-in-research know almost nothing about how these things are done
(because it is typically a corporate secret).… but the limited discussion in
the article seem naive from a machine learning viewpoint.The learning process
used apparently often fails to take into account transaction costs.What little
of the approaches is discussed appears modeling based. It seems plausible that
more direct prediction methods can yield an edge.One difficulty with stock
picking as a research topic is that it is inherently a zero sum game (for
every winner, there is a loser). Much of the rest of research is positive sum
(basically, everyone wins).</p><p>5 0.84709537 <a title="40-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-08-24-Mass_Customized_Medicine_in_the_Future%3F.html">314 hunch net-2008-08-24-Mass Customized Medicine in the Future?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about a technology which could develop in the future.Right now, a
new drug might be tested by finding patients with some diagnosis and giving or
not giving them a drug according to a secret randomization. The outcome is
observed, and if the average outcome for those treated is measurably better
than the average outcome for those not treated, the drug might become a
standard treatment.Generalizing this, a filterFsorts people into two groups:
those for treatmentAand those not for treatmentBbased upon observationsx. To
measure the outcome, you randomize between treatment and nontreatment of
groupAand measure the relative performance of the treatment.A problem often
arises: in many cases the treated group does not do better than the nontreated
group. A basic question is: does this mean the treatment is bad? With respect
to the filterFit may mean that, but with respect to another filterF', the
treatment might be very effective. For example, a drug might work great for

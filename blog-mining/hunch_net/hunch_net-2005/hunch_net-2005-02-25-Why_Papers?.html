<p>Introduction: How many papers do you remember from 2006? 2005? 2002? 1997? 1987? 1967?  One way to judge this would be to look at the citations of the papers you write—how many came from which year?  For myself, the answers on recent papers are:

This spectrum is fairly typical of papers in general.  There are many reasons that citations are focused on recent papers.
  
 The number of papers being published continues to grow.  This is not a very significant effect, because the rate of publication has not grown nearly as fast. 
 Dead men don’t reject your papers for not citing them.  This reason seems lame, because it’s a distortion from the ideal of science.  Nevertheless, it must be stated because the effect can be significant. 
 In 1997, I started as a PhD student.  Naturally, papers after 1997 are better remembered because they were absorbed in real time.

<p>Introduction: One of the confusing things about research is that progress is very hard to measure.  One of the consequences of being in a hard-to-measure environment is that the wrong things are often measured.  
  
  Lines of Code  The classical example of this phenomenon is the old lines-of-code-produced metric for programming.  It is easy to imagine systems for producing many lines of code with very little work that accomplish very little. 
  Paper count  In academia, a “paper count” is an analog of “lines of code”, and it suffers from the same failure modes.  The obvious failure mode here is that we end up with a large number of uninteresting papers since people end up spending a lot of time optimizing this metric. 
  Complexity  Another metric, is “complexity” (in the eye of a reviewer) of a paper.  There is a common temptation to make a method appear more complex than it is in order for reviewers to judge it worthy of publication.  The failure mode here is unclean thinking.

<p>Introduction: Claire  asked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite a bit of work.
 
I had a relatively light load—merely 49 theory papers.  Many of these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help review the papers.  I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally.  There were a couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.
 
There are some differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and theory communities.  In machine learning it is expected that a review be detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case.  Every paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very detailed.  
 
I’m sure not every author was happy with the outcome.  While we did our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make.

<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time.

<p>Introduction: One of the enduring stereotypes of academia is that people spend a great deal of intelligence, time, and effort finding complexity rather than simplicity.  This is at least anecdotally true in my experience.
  
  Math++  Several people have found that adding useless math makes their paper more publishable as evidenced by a reject-add-accept sequence. 
  8 page minimum  Who submitted a paper to  ICML  violating the 8 page minimum?  Every author fears that the reviewers won’t take their work seriously unless the allowed length is fully used.  The best minimum violation I know is  Adam ‘s paper at SODA on  generating random factored numbers , but this is deeply exceptional.  It’s a fair bet that 90% of papers submitted are exactly at the page limit.  We could imagine that this is because papers naturally take more space, but few people seem to be clamoring for more space.

<p>Introduction: The internet has significantly effected the way we do research but it’s capabilities have not yet been fully realized.
 
First, let’s acknowledge some known effects.
  
  Self-publishing  By default, all researchers in machine learning (and more generally computer science and physics) place their papers online for anyone to download.  The exact mechanism differs—physicists tend to use a central repository ( Arxiv ) while computer scientists tend to place the papers on their webpage.  Arxiv has been slowly growing in subject breadth so it now sometimes used by computer scientists. 
  Collaboration  Email has enabled working remotely with coauthors.  This has allowed collaborationis which would not otherwise have been possible and generally speeds research. 
  
Now, let’s look at attempts to go further.
  
  Blogs  (like this one) allow public discussion about topics which are not easily categorized as “a new idea in machine learning” (like this topic).

<p>Introduction: Yann and I have arranged so that people who are interested in our  large scale machine learning class  and not able to attend in person can follow along via two methods.
  
  Videos  will be posted with about a 1 day delay on  techtalks .  This is a side-by-side capture of video+slides from  Weyond . 
 We are experimenting with  Piazza  as a discussion forum.  Anyone is welcome to subscribe to Piazza and ask questions there, where I will be monitoring things.   update2 : Sign up  here . 
  
The first lecture is up now, including the  revised version of the slides  which fixes a few typos and rounds out references.</p><p>2 0.9758876 <a title="30-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-12-Netflix_Challenge_2_Canceled.html">390 hunch net-2010-03-12-Netflix Challenge 2 Canceled</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  second Netflix prize is canceled  due to  privacy problems .  I continue to believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was somewhat overstated.  I still haven’t seen any serious privacy failures on the scale of the  AOL search log release .
 
I expect privacy concerns to continue to be a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments.  The theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet in a state where the limits of what’s possible are clear let alone how to achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>3 0.97275066 <a title="30-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-01-NIPS_2008_workshop_on_%26%238216%3BLearning_over_Empirical_Hypothesis_Spaces%26%238217%3B.html">319 hunch net-2008-10-01-NIPS 2008 workshop on &#8216;Learning over Empirical Hypothesis Spaces&#8217;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This workshop asks for insights how far we may/can push the theoretical boundary of using data in the design of learning machines. Can we express our classification rule in terms of the sample, or do we have to stick to a core assumption of classical statistical learning theory, namely that the hypothesis space is to be defined independent from the sample? This workshop is particularly interested in – but not restricted to – the ‘luckiness framework’ and the recently introduced  notion of ‘compatibility functions’ in a semi-supervised learning context (more information can be found at  http://www.kuleuven.be/wehys ).</p><p>same-blog 4 0.94485271 <a title="30-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-25-Why_Papers%3F.html">30 hunch net-2005-02-25-Why Papers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Makc asked a good  question  in comments—”Why bother to make a paper, at all?”  There are several reasons for writing papers which may not be immediately obvious to people not in academia.
 
The basic idea is that papers have considerably more utility than the obvious “present an idea”.
  
 Papers are a formalized units of work. Academics (especially young ones) are often judged on the number of papers they produce. 
 Papers have a formalized method of citing and crediting other—the bibliography.  Academics (especially older ones) are often judged on the number of citations they receive. 
 Papers enable a “more fair” anonymous review.  Conferences receive  many  papers, from which a subset are selected.  Discussion forums are inherently not anonymous for anyone who wants to build a reputation for good work. 
 Papers are an excuse to meet your friends.  Papers are the content of conferences, but much of what you do is talk to friends about interesting problems while there.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! is sponsoring two machine learning events that might interest people.  
  
 The  Key Scientific Challenges  program (due March 5) for  Machine Learning  and  Statistics  offers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working on a core problem of interest to Y!  If you are already working on one of these problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you arenâ&euro;&trade;t you might want to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary of the possible in Machine Learning.   There are 7 days left. 
 The  Learning to Rank challenge  (due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at an ICML workshop.  Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreak  the ensemble  encountered.  If you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all learn something.  There are 3 months left.</p><p>6 0.88729656 <a title="30-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-24-ICML%2B50%25.html">456 hunch net-2012-02-24-ICML+50%</a></p>

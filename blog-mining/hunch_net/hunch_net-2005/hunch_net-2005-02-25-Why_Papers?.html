<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This
blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from about 13K unique
sites p</p><p>5 0.11870697 <a title="30-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-18-What_it_means_to_do_research..html">22 hunch net-2005-02-18-What it means to do research.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point
of view of an undergraduate. The shift from a class-taking mentality to a
research mentality is very significant and not easy.Problem PosingPosing the
right problem is often as important as solving them. Many people can get by in
research by solving problems others have posed, but that's not sufficient for
really inspiring research. For learning in particular, there is a strong
feeling that we just haven't figured out which questions are the right ones to
ask. You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem
convincing.Gambling your lifeWhen you do research, you think very hard about
new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions. Many
conversations are of the form "I wonder what would happen if…" These processes
can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours. The worst part is that
you'll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and
sometimes not even then be</p><p>6 0.11828494 <a title="30-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-01-The_Webscience_Future.html">134 hunch net-2005-12-01-The Webscience Future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the enduring stereotypes of academia is that people spend a great deal
of intelligence, time, and effort finding complexity rather than simplicity.
This is at least anecdotally true in my experience.Math++Several people have
found that adding useless math makes their paper more publishable as evidenced
by a reject-add-accept sequence.8 page minimumWho submitted a paper
toICMLviolating the 8 page minimum? Every author fears that the reviewers
won't take their work seriously unless the allowed length is fully used. The
best minimum violation I know isAdam's paper at SODA ongenerating random
factored numbers, but this is deeply exceptional. It's a fair bet that 90% of
papers submitted are exactly at the page limit. We could imagine that this is
because papers naturally take more space, but few people seem to be clamoring
for more space.JournalongHas anyone been asked to review a 100 page journal
paper? I have. Journal papers can be nice, because they give an author the
opportunity</p><p>4 0.74415839 <a title="30-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-07-20-Motivation_should_be_the_Responsibility_of_the_Reviewer.html">256 hunch net-2007-07-20-Motivation should be the Responsibility of the Reviewer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The prevailing wisdom in machine learning seems to be that motivating a paper
is the responsibility of the author. I think this is a harmful view--instead,
it's healthier for the community to regard this as the responsibility of the
reviewer.There are lots of reasons to prefer a reviewer-responsibility
approach.Authors are the most biased possible source of information about the
motivation of the paper. Systems which rely upon very biased sources of
information are inherently unreliable.Authors are highly variable in their
ability and desire to express motivation for their work. This adds greatly to
variance on acceptance of an idea, and it can systematically discriminate or
accentuate careers. It's great if you have a career accentuated by awesome
wording choice, but wise decision making by reviewers is important for the
field.The motivation section in a paper doesn'tdoanything in some sense--it's
there to get the paper in. Reading the motivation of a paper is of little use
in helping</p><p>5 0.704126 <a title="30-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-27-Not_goal_metrics.html">98 hunch net-2005-07-27-Not goal metrics</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A reminder that theNew York Academy of Scienceswill be hosting the7th Annual
Machine Learning Symposiumtomorrow from 9:30am.The main program will feature
invited talks fromPeter Bartlett,William Freeman, andVladimir Vapnik, along
with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main
program,hackNYandMicrosoft Researchare sponsoring a networking hour with talks
from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups
(specificallybit.ly,Buzzfeed,Chartbeat, andSense Networks,Visual Revenue).
This should be of great interest to everyone considering working in machine
learning.</p><p>3 0.87446499 <a title="30-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-28-Live_ML_Class.html">261 hunch net-2007-08-28-Live ML Class</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Makc asked a goodquestionin comments--"Why bother to make a paper, at all?"
There are several reasons for writing papers which may not be immediately
obvious to people not in academia.The basic idea is that papers have
considerably more utility than the obvious "present an idea".Papers are a
formalized units of work. Academics (especially young ones) are often judged
on the number of papers they produce.Papers have a formalized method of citing
and crediting other--the bibliography. Academics (especially older ones) are
often judged on the number of citations they receive.Papers enable a "more
fair" anonymous review. Conferences receivemanypapers, from which a subset are
selected. Discussion forums are inherently not anonymous for anyone who wants
to build a reputation for good work.Papers are an excuse to meet your friends.
Papers are the content of conferences, but much of what you do is talk to
friends about interesting problems while there. Sometimes you even solve
them.Papers are</p><p>5 0.73167413 <a title="30-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-11-09-Graduates_and_Postdocs.html">490 hunch net-2013-11-09-Graduates and Postdocs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several strong graduates are on the job market this year.Alekh Agarwalmade
themost scalable public learning algorithmas an intern two years ago. He has a
deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning as well as the
ability and will to make things happen programming-wise. I've been privileged
to have Alekh visiting me in NY where he will be sorely missed.John
DuchicreatedAdagradwhich is a commonly helpful improvement over online
gradient descent that is seeing wide adoption, including inVowpal Wabbit. He
has a similarly deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning with
significant industry experience atGoogle. Alekh and John have often coauthored
together.Stephane Rossvisited me a year ago over the summer, implementing many
new algorithms and working out the firstscale free online update rulewhich is
now the default in Vowpal Wabbit. Stephane isnoton the market--Google robbed
the cradle successfullyI'm sure that he will do great things.Anna

<p>Introduction: There are at least3summer schools related to machine learning this summer.The
firstis atUniversity of ChicagoJune 1-11 organized byMisha Belkin,Partha
Niyogi, andSteve Smale. Registration is closed for this one, meaning they met
their capacity limit. The format is essentially an extended Tutorial/Workshop.
I was particularly interested to seeValiantamongst the speakers. I'm also
presenting Saturday June 6, on logarithmic time prediction.Praveen
Srinivasanpoints out the second atPeking Universityin Beijing, China, July
20-27.This onediffers substantially, as it is about vision, machine learning,
and their intersection. The deadline for applications is June 10 or 15. This
is also another example of the growth of research in China, with active
support fromNSF.The third one is atCambridge, England, August 29-September 10.
It's in theMLSS series. Compared to the Chicago one, this one is more about
the Bayesian side of ML, although effort has been made to create a good cross
section of topic</p><p>6 0.51899225 <a title="130-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-16-MLSS_2008.html">273 hunch net-2007-11-16-MLSS 2008</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Much of the success and popularity of machine learning has been driven by its
practical impact. Of course, the evaluation of empirical work is an integral
part of the field. But are the existing mechanisms for evaluating algorithms
and comparing results good enough? We (PercyandJake) believe there are
currently a number of shortcomings:Incomplete Disclosure:You read a paper that
proposes Algorithm A which is shown to outperform SVMs on two datasets.
Great.  But what about on other datasets?  How sensitive is this result?
What about compute time - does the algorithm take two seconds on a laptop or
two weeks on a 100-node cluster?Lack of Standardization:Algorithm A beats
Algorithm B on one version of a dataset.  Algorithm B beats Algorithm A on
another version yet uses slightly different preprocessing.  Though doing a
head-on comparison would be ideal, it would be tedious since the programs
probably use different dataset formats and have a large array of options.  And

<p>Introduction: I recently discovered that supervised learning is a controversial term. The
two definitions are:Known LossSupervised learning corresponds to the situation
where you have unlabeled examples plus knowledge of the loss of each possible
predicted choice. This is the definition I'm familiar and comfortable with.
One reason to prefer this definition is that the analysis of sample complexity
for this class of learning problems are all pretty similar.Any kind of
signalSupervised learning corresponds to the situation where you have
unlabeled examples plus any source of side information about what the right
choice is. This notion of supervised learning seems to subsume reinforcement
learning, which makes me uncomfortable, because it means there are two words
for the same class. This also means there isn't a convenient word to describe
the first definition.Reviews suggest there are people who are dedicated to the
second definition out there, so it can be important to discriminate which you

<p>Introduction: Say we have two random variablesX,Ywith mutual informationI(X,Y). Let's say we
want to represent them with a bayes net of the formX< -M->Y, such that the
entropy ofMequals the mutual information, i.e.H(M)=I(X,Y). Intuitively, we
would like our hidden state to be as simple as possible (entropy wise). The
data processing inequality means thatH(M)>=I(X,Y), so the mutual information
is a lower bound on how simple theMcould be. Furthermore, if such a
construction existed it would have a nice coding interpretation -- one could
jointly codeXandYby first coding the mutual information, then codingXwith this
mutual info (withoutY) and codingYwith this mutual info (withoutX).It turns
out that such a construction does not exist in general (ThxAlina
Beygelzimerfor a counterexample! see below for the sketch).What are the
implications of this? Well, it's hard for me to say, but it does suggest to me
that the 'generative' model philosophy might be burdened with a harder
modeling task. If all we care a</p><p>6 0.17795084 <a title="130-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-26-ML_Symposium_and_Strata-Hadoop_World.html">475 hunch net-2012-10-26-ML Symposium and Strata-Hadoop World</a></p>

The big winner this year is Europe.   This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.  With  cuts to basic science  in the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside the US become more attractive.   Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english in place.  China and India are possible future winners.</p><br/><h2>Summary: the most important sentenses genereted by tfidf model</h2><p>sentIndex sentText sentNum sentScore</p><p>1 This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.

<p>Introduction: For anyone planning to do research, conference attendance is virtually mandatory for success.  Aside from exposing yourself to a large collection of different ideas, many interesting conversations leading to new research happen at conferences.  If you are a student, you should plan to go to at least one summer conference.  Your advisor should cover the costs.

The big winner this year is Europe.   This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.  With  cuts to basic science  in the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside the US become more attractive.   Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english in place.  China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>2 0.885948 <a title="17-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-09-Progress_in_Machine_Translation.html">171 hunch net-2006-04-09-Progress in Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I just visited  ISI  where  Daniel Marcu  and others are working on machine translation.  Apparently, machine translation is rapidly improving.   A particularly dramatic year was 2002->2003 when systems switched from word-based translation to phrase-based translation.  From a (now famous) slide by Charles Wayne at  DARPA  (which funds much of the work on machine translation) here is some anecdotal evidence:

<p>Introduction: Textbooks invariably seem to carry the proof that uses Markov’s inequality, moment-generating functions, and Taylor approximations. Here’s an easier way.
 
For  , let   be the KL divergence between a coin of bias   and one of bias  :  
 
 Theorem:  Suppose you do   independent tosses of a coin of bias  . The probability of seeing   heads or more, for  , is at most  . So is the probability of seeing   heads or less, for  .
 
 Remark:  By Pinsker’s inequality,  .
 
 Proof  Let’s do the   case; the other is identical.
 
Let   be the distribution over   induced by a coin of bias  , and likewise   for a coin of bias  . Let   be the set of all sequences of   tosses which contain   heads or more. We’d like to show that   is unlikely under  .
 
Pick any  , with say   heads. Then: 
 
 
Since   for every  , we have   and we’re done.</p><p>4 0.67785001 <a title="17-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-06-30-ICML_has_a_comment_system.html">305 hunch net-2008-06-30-ICML has a comment system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Reid  has stepped up and created a  comment system for ICML papers  which  Greger Linden  has tightly integrated.  
 
My understanding is that Mark spent quite  a bit of time on the details, and there are some cool features like working latex math mode.  This is an excellent chance for the ICML community to experiment with making ICML year-round, so I hope it works out.  Please do consider experimenting with it.</p><p>5 0.51590282 <a title="17-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-23-Interesting_papers_at_ACL.html">97 hunch net-2005-07-23-Interesting papers at ACL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  recent discussion  indicated that one goal of this blog might be to allow people to post comments about recent papers that they liked.  I think this could potentially be very useful, especially for those with diverse interests but only finite time to read through conference proceedings.   ACL 2005  recently completed, and here are four papers from that conference that I thought were either good or perhaps of interest to a machine learning audience.
 
David Chiang,   A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation  . (Best paper award.) This paper takes the standard phrase-based MT model that is popular in our field (basically, translate a sentence by individually translating phrases and reordering them according to a complicated statistical model) and extends it to take into account hierarchy in phrases, so that you can learn things like “X ‘s Y” -> “Y de X” in chinese, where X and Y are arbitrary phrases. This takes a step toward linguistic syntax for MT, whic</p><p>6 0.48934659 <a title="17-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>

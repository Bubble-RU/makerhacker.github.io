<p>Introduction: For anyone planning to do research, conference attendance is virtually
mandatory for success. Aside from exposing yourself to a large collection of
different ideas, many interesting conversations leading to new research happen
at conferences. If you are a student, you should plan to go to at least one
summer conference. Your advisor should cover the costs.ConferenceLocationEarly

<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeckpoints outCOLTregistrationwith a May 13 early registration
deadline. The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs
with a $300 registration fee.ICMLregistrationis also available, at about an x3
higher cost. My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a
larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as
long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference
organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>5 0.088908523 <a title="17-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-15-IJCAI_is_out_of_season.html">184 hunch net-2006-06-15-IJCAI is out of season</a></p>
<p>Introduction: IJCAIis running January 6-12 in Hyderabad India rather than a more traditional
summer date. (Presumably, this is to avoid melting people in the Indian
summer.)The paper deadline(June 23 abstract / June 30 submission) are
particularly inconvenient if you attendCOLTorICML. But on the other hand, it's
a good excuse to visit India.</p><p>6 0.088859856 <a title="17-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-30-Many_ways_to_Learn_this_summer.html">357 hunch net-2009-05-30-Many ways to Learn this summer</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and
then trying to figure out how to get there.A big part of science fiction is
imagining how things could be different, and then working through the
implications.Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can
sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research. (And, hey, it's
fun.) Here's some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem
particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning
systems:Vernor Vinge, "True Names", "A Fire Upon the Deep"Marc Stiegler,
"David's Sling", "Earthweb"Charles Stross, "Singularity Sky"Greg Egan,
"Diaspora"Joe Haldeman, "Forever Peace"(There are surely many
others.)Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.
Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans
control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series). That didn't really happen in the
last 50 years. Instead, we gradually refined the degree to whi</p><p>4 0.4710871 <a title="17-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-11-Visa_Casualties.html">69 hunch net-2005-05-11-Visa Casualties</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For theChicago 2005 machine learning summer schoolwe are organizing, at least
5 international students can not come due to visa issues. There seem to be two
aspects to visa issues:Inefficiency. The system rejected the student simply by
being incapable of evenstartingto evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of
time.Politics. Border controls became much tighter after the September 11
attack. Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will
do that.What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem
than (2). Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa
rejection. Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time
almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry
even people concerned with (2). The obvious fixes to overload are "spend more
money" and "make the system more efficient".With respect to (2), (which is a
more minor issue by the numbers) it is unclear that the political calc</p><p>5 0.45749947 <a title="17-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-07-17-MUCMD_and_BayLearn.html">470 hunch net-2012-07-17-MUCMD and BayLearn</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm visiting Beijing for thePao-Lu Hsu Statistics Conferenceon Machine
Learning.I had several discussions about the state of Chinese research. Given
the large population and economy, you might expect substantial research--more
than has been observed at international conferences. The fundamental problem
seems to be theCultural Revolutionwhich lobotimized higher education, and the
research associated with it. There has been a process of slow recovery since
then, which has begun to be felt in the research world via increased
participation in international conferences and (now) conferences in China.The
amount of effort going into construction in Beijing is very impressive--people
are literally building a skyscraper at night outside the window of the hotel
I'm staying at (and this is not unusual). If a small fraction of this effort
is later focused onto supporting research, the effect could be very

<p>Introduction: Let me add to John's post with a few of my own favouritesfrom this year's
conference. First, let me say thatSanjoy's talk,Coarse Sample Complexity
Bounds for ActiveLearningwas also one of my favourites, as was theForgettron
paper.I also really enjoyed the last third ofChristos'talkon the complexity of
finding Nash equilibria.And, speaking of tagging, I thinkthe U.Mass Citeseer
replacement systemRexafrom the demo track is very cool.Finally, let me add my
recommendations for specific papers:Z. Ghahramani, K. Heller:Bayesian Sets[no
preprint](A very elegant probabilistic information retrieval style modelof
which objects are "most like" a given subset of objects.)T. Griffiths, Z.
Ghahramani:Infinite Latent Feature Models andthe Indian Buffet
Process[preprint](A Dirichlet style prior over infinite binary matrices
withbeautiful exchangeability properties.)K. Weinberger, J. Blitzer, L.

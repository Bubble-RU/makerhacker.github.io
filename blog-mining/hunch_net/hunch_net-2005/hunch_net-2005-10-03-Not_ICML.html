<p>Introduction: I will joinYahoo Research(in New York) after my contract ends atTTI-
Chicago.The deciding reasons are:Yahoo is running into many hard learning
problems. This is precisely the situation where basic research might hope to
have the greatest impact.Yahoo Research understands research including
publishing, conferences, etcâ€¦Yahoo Research is growing, so there is a chance I
can help it grow well.Yahoo understands the internet, including (but not at
all limited to) experimenting with research blogs.In the end, Yahoo Research
seems like the place where I might have a chance to make the greatest
difference.Yahoo (as a company) has made a strong bet on Yahoo Research. We-
the-researchers all hope that bet will pay off, and this seems plausible. I'll
certainly have fun trying.</p><p>4 0.10104863 <a title="117-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-17-New_Machine_Learning_mailing_list.html">278 hunch net-2007-12-17-New Machine Learning mailing list</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.Topic Models:Dynamic Topic
ModelsDavid Blei, John LaffertyA nice model for how topics in LDA type models
can evolve over time,using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters
and a veryclever structured variational approximation (in which the mean
fieldparameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all
Bleipapers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive.Pachinko
AllocationWei Li, Andrew McCallumA very elegant (but computationally
challenging) model which inducescorrelation amongst topics using a multi-level
DAG whose interior nodesare "super-topics" and "sub-topics" and whose leaves
are thevocabulary words. Makes the slumbering monster of structure learning
stir.Sequence Analysis (I missed these talks since I was chairing another
session)Online Decoding of Markov Models with Latency ConstraintsMukund

<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are
coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.It's entirely reasonable for
anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don't have a paper. For
students, visiting a conference is almost a 'must'--there is no where else
that a broad cross-section of research is on display.Workshops are also a very
good idea.ICML has 11,KDD has 9, andAAAI has 19. Workshops provide an
opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research. They
are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research
because they are so interactive.Tutorials are a good way to gain some
understanding of a long-standing direction of research. They are generally
more coherent than workshops.ICML has 7andAAAI has 15.</p><p>4 0.5642395 <a title="117-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-29-ICML_survey_and_comments.html">468 hunch net-2012-06-29-ICML survey and comments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attendingICML, except forDorawho arrived
on Monday. Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is
going well.For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like
everyone),Mark Reidhas setup theICML discussionsite where you can comment on
any paper or subscribe to papers. Authors are automatically subscribed to
their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly
after the fact, as people desire.We also conducted a survey before the
conference and have thesurvey resultsnow. This can be compared with theICML
2010 survey results. Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes
order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4
being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and
2010.Glancing through them, I see:Most people found the papers they reviewed a
good fit for their expertise (-.037 w.r.t 2010). Achieving this was one of our

<p>Introduction: I recently had fun discussions with bothVikash MansinghkaandThomas Breuelabout
approaching AI with machine learning. The general interest in taking a crack
at AI with machine learning seems to be rising on many fronts
includingDARPA.As a matter of history, there was a great deal of interest in
AI which died down before I began research. There remain many projects and
conferences spawned in this earlier AI wave, as well as a good bit of
experience about what did not work, or at least did not work yet. Here are a
few examples of failure modes that people seem to run into:Supply/Product
confusion. Sometimes we think "Intelligences use X, so I'll create X and have
an Intelligence." An example of this is theCyc Projectwhich inspires some
people as "intelligences use ontologies, so I'll create an ontology and a
system using it to have an Intelligence." The flaw here is that
Intelligencescreateontologies, which they use, and without the ability to
create ontologies you don't have an Intellige</p><p>6 0.43599057 <a title="117-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-28-Programming_Languages_for_Machine_Learning_Implementations.html">210 hunch net-2006-09-28-Programming Languages for Machine Learning Implementations</a></p>

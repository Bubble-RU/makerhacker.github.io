<p>Introduction: I will join  Yahoo Research  (in New York) after my contract ends at  TTI-Chicago .
 
The deciding reasons are:
  
 Yahoo is running into many hard learning problems.  This is precisely the situation where basic research might hope to have the greatest impact. 
 Yahoo Research understands research including publishing, conferences, etc… 
 Yahoo Research is growing, so there is a chance I can help it grow well. 
 Yahoo understands the internet, including (but not at all limited to) experimenting with research blogs. 
  
In the end, Yahoo Research seems like the place where I might have a chance to make the greatest difference.  
 
Yahoo (as a company) has made a strong bet on Yahoo Research.  We-the-researchers all hope that bet will pay off, and this seems plausible.  I’ll certainly have fun trying.</p><p>3 0.11527304 <a title="117-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a quick reference for summer ML-related conferences sorted by due date:
  
 
 Conference 
 Due date 
 Location 
 Reviewing 
 
 
  KDD  
 Feb 10 
 August 12-16, Beijing, China 
 Single Blind 
 
 
  COLT  
 Feb 14 
 June 25-June 27, Edinburgh, Scotland 
 Single Blind? (historically) 
 
 
  ICML  
 Feb 24 
 June 26-July 1, Edinburgh, Scotland 
 Double Blind, author response, zero  SPOF  
 
 
  UAI  
 March 30 
 August 15-17, Catalina Islands, California 
 Double Blind, author response 
 
  
Geographically, this is greatly dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.
 
Machine Learning conferences are triannual now, between  NIPS ,  AIStat , and  ICML .  This has not always been the case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April conference.  
 
However, the first claim is not quite correct.  NIPS and AIStat have few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other conf</p><p>4 0.10278441 <a title="117-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-09-Machine_Learning_Thoughts.html">137 hunch net-2005-12-09-Machine Learning Thoughts</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Reid  has stepped up and created a  comment system for ICML papers  which  Greger Linden  has tightly integrated.  
 
My understanding is that Mark spent quite  a bit of time on the details, and there are some cool features like working latex math mode.  This is an excellent chance for the ICML community to experiment with making ICML year-round, so I hope it works out.  Please do consider experimenting with it.</p><p>3 0.62583554 <a title="117-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-06-20-2010_ICML_discussion_site.html">401 hunch net-2010-06-20-2010 ICML discussion site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A substantial difficulty with the 2009 and 2008  ICML discussion system  was a communication vacuum, where authors were not informed of comments, and commenters were not informed of responses to their comments without explicit monitoring.   Mark Reid  has setup a  new discussion system for 2010  with the goal of addressing this.
 
Mark didn’t want to make it to intrusive, so you must opt-in.  As an author,  find your paper  and “Subscribe by email” to the comments.  As a commenter, you have the option of providing an email for follow-up notification.</p><p>4 0.56666636 <a title="117-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-17-New_Machine_Learning_mailing_list.html">278 hunch net-2007-12-17-New Machine Learning mailing list</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Reid  has setup a  discussion site for ICML papers  again this year and  Monica Dinculescu  has linked it in from the ICML site.  Last year’s attempt appears to have been an acceptable but not wild success as a little bit of fruitful discussion occurred.  I’m hoping this year will be a bit more of a success—please don’t be shy   
 
I’d like to also point out that  ICML ‘s early  registration  deadline has a few hours left, while  UAI ‘s and  COLT ‘s are in a week.</p><p>6 0.51192594 <a title="117-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-07-12-ICML_Trends.html">254 hunch net-2007-07-12-ICML Trends</a></p>

<p>Introduction: and I can’t help but remember him.
 
I first met  Sam  as an undergraduate at  Caltech  where he was TA for  Hopfield ‘s class, and again when I visited  Gatsby , when he invited me to visit  Toronto , and at too many conferences to recount.  His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great ability to phrase a problem so it’s solution must be understood.  With respect to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to make  my first tutorial , leading to others, and to other things, all of which I’m grateful to him for.

<p>Introduction: …is discussed in  this nytimes article .  I generally expect such approaches to become more common since computers are getting faster, machine learning is getting better, and data is becoming more plentiful.   This is another example where machine learning technology may have a huge economic impact.  Some side notes:
  
 We-in-research know almost nothing about how these things are done (because it is typically a corporate secret). 
 … but the limited discussion in the article seem naive from a machine learning viewpoint.
 
 The learning process used apparently often fails to take into account transaction costs. 
 What little of the approaches is discussed appears modeling based.  It seems plausible that more direct prediction methods can yield an edge.

<p>Introduction: I’ve avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest.  The problem with discussing politics is that it’s customary for people to say much based upon little information.  Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa).  It’s primary election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the issues are not.
 
There are several policy decisions which substantially effect development of science and technology in the US.
  
  Education  The US has great contrasts in education.  The top universities are very good places, yet the grade school education system produces mediocre results.  For me, the contrast between a  public education  and  Caltech  was bracing.  For many others attending Caltech, it clearly was not.  Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about.  My own experience is that a basic attitude of “no child unrealized” i</p><p>4 0.12665066 <a title="112-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-08-Online_Learning_as_the_Mathematics_of_Accountability.html">109 hunch net-2005-09-08-Online Learning as the Mathematics of Accountability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Accountability is a social problem.  When someone screws up, do you fire them?  Or do you accept the error and let them continue?  This is a very difficult problem and we all know of stories where the wrong decision was made.
 
 Online learning  (as meant here), is a subfield of learning theory which analyzes the online learning model.  
 
In the online learning model, there are a set of hypotheses or “experts”.  On any instantance  x , each expert makes a prediction  y .  A master algorithm  A  uses these predictions to form it’s own prediction  y A   and then  learns the correct prediction  y *  .  This process repeats.
 
The goal of online learning is to find a master algorithm  A  which uses the advice of the experts to make good predictions.  In particular, we typically want to guarantee that the master algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert.  If  L(e)  is the loss of expert  e  and  L(A)  is the loss of the master algorithm, it is often possible to prove:   L(A) les</p><p>5 0.12242673 <a title="112-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-05-02-What%26%238217%3Bs_the_difference_between_gambling_and_rewarding_good_prediction%3F.html">397 hunch net-2010-05-02-What&#8217;s the difference between gambling and rewarding good prediction?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: After a  major financial crisis , there is much discussion about how  finance has become a casino  gambling with other’s money, keeping the winnings, and walking away when the money is lost.  
 
When thinking about financial reform, all the many losers in the above scenario are apt to take the view that this activity should be completely, or nearly completely curtailed.  But, a more thoughtful view is that sometimes there is a real sense in which there are right and wrong decisions, and we as a society would really prefer that the people most likely to make right decisions are making them.  A crucial question then is: “What is the  difference between gambling and rewarding good prediction?”
 
We  discussed this before the financial crisis . The cheat-sheet sketch is that the online learning against an adversary problem, algorithm, and theorems, provide a good mathematical model for thinking about this question.

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and then trying to figure out how to get there.  
 
A big part of science fiction is imagining how things could be different, and then working through the implications.  
 
Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research.  (And, hey, it’s fun.)  Here’s some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning systems:
  
 Vernor Vinge, “True Names”, “A Fire Upon the Deep” 
 Marc Stiegler, “David’s Sling”, “Earthweb” 
 Charles Stross, “Singularity Sky” 
 Greg Egan, “Diaspora” 
 Joe Haldeman, “Forever Peace” 
  
(There are surely many others.)  
 
Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.  Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series).  That didn’t really happen in the last 50 years.

<p>Introduction: I found the article on “ Political Science ” at the  New York Times  interesting.  Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been systematically distorting scientific views.   With a  petition  by some  7000+ scientists  alleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.
 
One thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the world.  In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued.  This value is achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms.  One example of a formal mechanism is peer review.
 
In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value is agreement.  It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be passed or other actions can be taken.  Since Science (with a capitol ‘S’) has accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.  This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mec</p><p>5 0.63722223 <a title="112-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-09-The_Stock_Prediction_Machine_Learning_Problem.html">193 hunch net-2006-07-09-The Stock Prediction Machine Learning Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’m releasing  version 4.0 ( tarball ) of  Vowpal Wabbit .  The biggest change (by far) in this release is experimental support for cluster parallelism, with notable help from  Daniel Hsu .  
 
I also took advantage of the major version number to introduce some incompatible changes, including switching to  murmurhash 2 , and other alterations to cachefiles.  You’ll need to delete and regenerate them.  In addition, the precise specification for a “tag” (i.e. string that can be used to identify an example) changed—you can’t have a space between the tag and the ‘|’ at the beginning of the feature namespace.  
 
And, of course, we made it faster.
 
For the future, I put up my  todo list  outlining the major future improvements I want to see in the code.  I’m planning to discuss the current mechanism and results of the cluster parallel implementation at the  large scale machine learning workshop  at  NIPS  later this week.

<p>Introduction: Virtually every discipline of significant human endeavor has a way explaining itself as fundamental and important.  In all the cases I know of, they are both right (they are vital) and wrong (they are not solely vital).
  
 Politics.  This is the one that everyone is familiar with at the moment.  “What could be more important than the process of making decisions?” 
 Science and Technology.  This is the one that we-the-academics are familiar with.  “The loss of modern science and technology would be catastrophic.” 
 Military.  “Without the military, a nation will be invaded and destroyed.” 
 (insert your favorite here) 
  
Within science and technology, the same thing happens again.
  
 Mathematics. “What could be more important than a precise language for establishing truths?” 
 Physics.  “Nothing is more fundamental than the laws which govern the universe.  Understanding them is the key to understanding everything else.” 
 Biology.  “Without life, we wouldn’t be here, so clearly the s</p><p>3 0.82705599 <a title="112-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-09-The_Machine_Learning_Forum.html">363 hunch net-2009-07-09-The Machine Learning Forum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dear Fellow Machine Learners,
 
For the past year or so I have become increasingly frustrated with the peer review system in our field. I constantly get asked to review papers in which I have no interest. At the same time, as an action editor in JMLR, I constantly have to harass people to review papers. When I send papers to conferences and to journals I often get rejected with reviews that, at least in my mind, make no sense. Finally, I have a very hard time keeping up with the best new work, because I don’t know where to look for it…
 
I decided to try an do something to improve the situation. I started a new web site, which I decided to call “The machine learning forum” the URL is  http://themachinelearningforum.org 
 
The main idea behind this web site is to remove anonymity from the review process. In this site, all opinions are attributed to the actual person that expressed them. I expect that this will improve the quality of the reviews. An obvious other effect is that there wil</p><p>4 0.52252847 <a title="112-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-04-Vowpal_Wabbit%2C_version_5.0%2C_and_the_second_heresy.html">419 hunch net-2010-12-04-Vowpal Wabbit, version 5.0, and the second heresy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve released  version 5.0  of the  Vowpal Wabbit  online learning software.  The major number has changed since the  last release  because I regard all earlier versions as obsolete—there are several new algorithms & features including substantial changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.  
 
The biggest changes are new algorithms:
  
  Nikos  and I improved the default algorithm.  The basic update rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully controlled so that it’s impossible to overrun the label.  In addition, the normalization has changed.  Computationally, these changes are virtually free and yield better results, sometimes much better.  Less careful updates can be reenabled with –loss_function classic, although results are still not identical to previous due to normalization changes. 
 Nikos also implemented the per-feature learning rates as per these  two   papers .  Often, this works better than the default algorithm.  It isn’t the defa</p><p>5 0.52069259 <a title="112-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-25-Turing%26%238217%3Bs_Club_for_Machine_Learning.html">286 hunch net-2008-01-25-Turing&#8217;s Club for Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don’t fully understand the impact of computation, as demonstrated by a lack of  big-O  analysis of new learning algorithms.  This is important—some current active research programs are fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are directly motivated by it.  When considering a learning algorithm, I think about the following questions:
  
 How does the learning algorithm scale with the number of examples  m ?  Any algorithm using all of the data is at least  O(m) , but in many cases this is  O(m 2 )  (naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown (k-means or many other optimization algorithms).  The unknown case is very common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn’t convergent or simply that the amount of computation isn’t controlled. 
 The above question can also be asked for test cases.  In some applications, test-time performance is of great importance. 
 How does the algorithm scale with the number of</p><p>6 0.51879692 <a title="112-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-05-16-Research_Directions_for_Machine_Learning_and_Algorithms.html">435 hunch net-2011-05-16-Research Directions for Machine Learning and Algorithms</a></p>

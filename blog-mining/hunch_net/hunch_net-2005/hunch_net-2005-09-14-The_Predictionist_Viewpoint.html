<p>Introduction: I've avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest. The
problem with discussing politics is that it's customary for people to say much
based upon little information. Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial
impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa). It's primary
election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the
issues are not.There are several policy decisions which substantially effect
development of science and technology in the US.EducationThe US has great
contrasts in education. The top universities are very good places, yet the
grade school education system produces mediocre results. For me, the contrast
between apublic educationandCaltechwas bracing. For many others attending
Caltech, it clearly was not. Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is
a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about. My own

<p>Introduction: …is discussed inthis nytimes article. I generally expect such approaches to
become more common since computers are getting faster, machine learning is
getting better, and data is becoming more plentiful. This is another example
where machine learning technology may have a huge economic impact. Some side
notes:We-in-research know almost nothing about how these things are done
(because it is typically a corporate secret).… but the limited discussion in
the article seem naive from a machine learning viewpoint.The learning process
used apparently often fails to take into account transaction costs.What little
of the approaches is discussed appears modeling based. It seems plausible that
more direct prediction methods can yield an edge.One difficulty with stock
picking as a research topic is that it is inherently a zero sum game (for
every winner, there is a loser). Much of the rest of research is positive sum
(basically, everyone wins).</p><p>4 0.12126136 <a title="112-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-05-02-What%26%238217%3Bs_the_difference_between_gambling_and_rewarding_good_prediction%3F.html">397 hunch net-2010-05-02-What&#8217;s the difference between gambling and rewarding good prediction?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Accountability is a social problem. When someone screws up, do you fire them?
Or do you accept the error and let them continue? This is a very difficult
problem and we all know of stories where the wrong decision was made.Online
learning(as meant here), is a subfield of learning theory which analyzes the
online learning model.In the online learning model, there are a set of
hypotheses or "experts". On any instantancex, each expert makes a predictiony.
A master algorithmAuses these predictions to form it's own predictionyAand
then learns the correct predictiony*. This process repeats.The goal of online
learning is to find a master algorithmAwhich uses the advice of the experts to
make good predictions. In particular, we typically want to guarantee that the
master algorithm performs almost as well as the best expert. IfL(e)is the loss
of experteandL(A)is the loss of the master algorithm, it is often possible to
prove:L(A) less than mineL(e) + log(number of experts)over all sequences.In

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and
then trying to figure out how to get there.A big part of science fiction is
imagining how things could be different, and then working through the
implications.Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can
sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research. (And, hey, it's
fun.) Here's some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem
particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning
systems:Vernor Vinge, "True Names", "A Fire Upon the Deep"Marc Stiegler,
"David's Sling", "Earthweb"Charles Stross, "Singularity Sky"Greg Egan,
"Diaspora"Joe Haldeman, "Forever Peace"(There are surely many
others.)Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.
Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans
control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series). That didn't really happen in the
last 50 years. Instead, we gradually refined the degree to whi</p><p>4 0.64796329 <a title="112-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-05-02-What%26%238217%3Bs_the_difference_between_gambling_and_rewarding_good_prediction%3F.html">397 hunch net-2010-05-02-What&#8217;s the difference between gambling and rewarding good prediction?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I found the article on "Political Science" at theNew York Timesinteresting.
Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been
systematically distorting scientific views. With apetitionby some7000+
scientistsalleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.One
thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are
fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the
world. In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued. This value is
achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms. One example of a formal
mechanism is peer review.In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value
is agreement. It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be
passed or other actions can be taken. Since Science (with a capitol 'S') has
accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.
This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mechanism for
pushing agreement</p><p>6 0.58266699 <a title="112-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-15-The_Machine_Learning_Department.html">228 hunch net-2007-01-15-The Machine Learning Department</a></p>

(and competition) which seems to be quite well designed. Features include:Many
participants (8 going on 12?)Standardized hardware. In theDARPA grand
challengecontestants entering with motorcycles are at a severe disadvantage to
those entering with a Hummer. Similarly, contestants using more powerful
sensors can gain huge advantages.Monthly contests, with full feedback (but
since the hardware is standardized, only code is shipped). One of the premises
of the program is that robust systems are desired. Monthly evaluations at
different locations can help measure this and provide data.Attacks a known
hard problem. (cross country driving)</p><p>2 0.89382035 <a title="112-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-14-Families_of_Learning_Theory_Statements.html">56 hunch net-2005-04-14-Families of Learning Theory Statements</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Virtually every discipline of significant human endeavor has a way explaining
itself as fundamental and important. In all the cases I know of, they are both
right (they are vital) and wrong (they are not solely vital).Politics. This is
the one that everyone is familiar with at the moment. "What could be more
important than the process of making decisions?"Science and Technology. This
is the one that we-the-academics are familiar with. "The loss of modern
science and technology would be catastrophic."Military. "Without the military,
a nation will be invaded and destroyed."(insert your favorite here)Within
science and technology, the same thing happens again.Mathematics. "What could
be more important than a precise language for establishing truths?"Physics.
"Nothing is more fundamental than the laws which govern the universe.
Understanding them is the key to understanding everything else."Biology.
"Without life, we wouldn't be here, so clearly the study of life is
fundamental."Computer S</p><p>4 0.8306672 <a title="112-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-16-Optimizing_Machine_Learning_Programs.html">262 hunch net-2007-09-16-Optimizing Machine Learning Programs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning is often computationally bounded which implies that the
ability to write fast code becomes important if you ever want to implement a
machine learning algorithm. Basic tactical optimizations are covered
wellelsewhere, but I haven't seen a reasonable guide to higher level
optimizations, which are the most important in my experience. Here are some of
the higher level optimizations I've often found useful.Algorithmic Improvement
First. This is Hard, but it is the most important consideration, and typically
yields the most benefits. Good optimizations here are publishable. In the
context of machine learning, you should be familiar with the arguments for
online vs. batch learning.Choice of Language. There are many arguments about
thechoice of language. Sometimes you don't have a choice when interfacing with
other people. Personally, I favor C/C++ when I want to write fast code. This
(admittedly) makes me a slower programmer than when using higher level
languages. (Sometimes</p><p>5 0.79487967 <a title="112-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-17-A_Short_Guide_to_PhD_Graduate_Study.html">73 hunch net-2005-05-17-A Short Guide to PhD Graduate Study</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Graduate study is a mysterious and uncertain process. This easiest way to see
this is by noting that a very old advisor/student mechanism is preferred.
There is no known succesful mechanism for "mass producing" PhDs as is done (in
some sense) for undergraduate and masters study. Here are a few hints that
might be useful to prospective or current students based on my own
experience.Masters or PhD(a) You want a PhD if you want to do research. (b)
You want a masters if you want to make money. People wanting (b) will be
manifestly unhappy with (a) because it typically means years of low pay.
People wanting (a) should try to avoid (b) because it prolongs an already long
process.Attitude.Manystudents struggle for awhile with the wrong attitude
towards research. Most students come into graduate school with 16-19 years of
schooling where the principle means of success is proving that you know
something via assignments, tests, etcâ&euro;Ś Research doesnotwork this way. Research
is what a PhD is about.</p><p>6 0.77276087 <a title="112-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-03-Carbon_in_Computer_Science_Research.html">366 hunch net-2009-08-03-Carbon in Computer Science Research</a></p>

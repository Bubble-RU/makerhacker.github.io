<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the "right" way to do
machine learning. This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.
The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a
reply2.The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and
general. Essentially, you first specify a priorP(D)over possible
processesDproducing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data
according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)After
this, hard decisions are made (such as "turn left" or "turn right") by
choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior)
loss.This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices
ofP(D)and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice
properties:There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual
distribution generating the data is drawn fromP(D)there is no better method.

<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given
framework or mathematical model. It turns out that all of these models are
significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning. I've
created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of
machine learning.The point here is not simply "woe unto us". There are several
implications which seem important.The multitude of models is a point of
continuing confusion. It is common for people to learn about machine learning
within one framework which often becomes there "home framework" through which
they attempt to filter all machine learning. (Have you met people who can only
think in terms of kernels? Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)
Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help
resolve the confusion. This is particularly important when reviewing and
particularly important for students.Algorithms which conform to multiple
approaches can have substantial</p><p>4 0.1635316 <a title="60-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-14-What_Learning_Theory_might_do.html">95 hunch net-2005-07-14-What Learning Theory might do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on thispostand some of the previousproblems/research
directionsabout where learning theory might make large strides.Why theory?The
essential reason for theory is "intuition extension". A very good applied
learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the
best computer algorithms for solving that problem. A very good theory can take
the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend
them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion. To do this, we take
these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:Explains the
basic intuitions.Makes new testable predictions about how to learn.Succeeds in
so learning.This is "intuition extension": taking what we have learned
somewhere else and applying it in new domains. It is fundamentally useful to
everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving
problems.Where next for learning theory?I like the analogy with physics. Back

<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I readthis. David Blei and I spent some time thinking hard
about this a few years back (thanks to Kary Myers for pointing us to it):In
short I was thinking that Ã¢â‚¬Å“bayesian belief updatingÃ¢â‚¬Â and
Ã¢â‚¬Å“maximum entropyÃ¢â‚¬Â were two othogonal principles. But it appear
that they are not, and that they can even be in conflict !Example (from Kass
1996); consider a Die (6 sides), consider prior knowledge E[X]=3.5.Maximum
entropy leads to P(X)= (1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6).Now consider a new piece
of evidence A=Ã¢â‚¬ÂX is an odd numberÃ¢â‚¬ÂBayesian posterior P(X|A)=
P(A|X) P(X) = (1/3, 0, 1/3, 0, 1/3, 0).But MaxEnt with the constraints
E[X]=3.5 and E[Indicator function of A]=1 leads to (.22, 0, .32, 0, .47, 0) !!
(note that E[Indicator function of A]=P(A))Indeed, for MaxEnt, because there
is no more Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ6Ã¢â‚¬Â², big numbers must be more probable to ensure an
average of 3.5. For bayesian updating, P(X|A) doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to have a
3.5 expectation.

<p>Introduction: Since we last discussedthe other online learning,Stanfordhas very visibly
started pushing mass teaching inAI,Machine Learning, andDatabases. In
retrospect, it's not too surprising that the next step up in serious online
teaching experiments are occurring at the computer science department of a
university embedded in the land of startups. Numbers on the order of100000are
quite significant--similar in scale to the number ofcomputer science
undergraduate students/yearin the US. Although these populations surely
differ, the fact that theycouldoverlap is worth considering for the
future.It's too soon to say how successful these classes will be and there are
many easy criticisms to make:Registration != Learning… but if only 1/10th
complete these classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of any
traditional process.1st year excitement != nth year routine… but if only
1/10th take future classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of
any traditional process.Hello, che</p><p>2 0.96880233 <a title="60-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-07-20-Motivation_should_be_the_Responsibility_of_the_Reviewer.html">256 hunch net-2007-07-20-Motivation should be the Responsibility of the Reviewer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The prevailing wisdom in machine learning seems to be that motivating a paper
is the responsibility of the author. I think this is a harmful view--instead,
it's healthier for the community to regard this as the responsibility of the
reviewer.There are lots of reasons to prefer a reviewer-responsibility
approach.Authors are the most biased possible source of information about the
motivation of the paper. Systems which rely upon very biased sources of
information are inherently unreliable.Authors are highly variable in their
ability and desire to express motivation for their work. This adds greatly to
variance on acceptance of an idea, and it can systematically discriminate or
accentuate careers. It's great if you have a career accentuated by awesome
wording choice, but wise decision making by reviewers is important for the
field.The motivation section in a paper doesn'tdoanything in some sense--it's
there to get the paper in. Reading the motivation of a paper is of little use

<p>Introduction: One thing common to much research is that the researcher must be the first
personeverto have some thought. How do you think of something that has never
been thought of? There seems to be no methodical manner of doing this, but
there are some tricks.The easiest method is to just have some connection come
to you. There is a trick here however: you should write it down and fill out
the idea immediately because it can just as easily go away.A harder method is
to set aside a block of time and simply think about an idea. Distraction
elimination is essential here because thinking about the unthought is hard
work which your mind will avoid.Another common method is in conversation.
Sometimes the process of verbalizing implies new ideas come up and sometimes
whoever you are talking to replies just the right way. This method is
dangerous though--you must speak to someone who helps you think rather than
someone who occupies your thoughts.Try to rephrase the problem so the answer
is simple. This is</p><p>4 0.95807368 <a title="60-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-16-The_Everything_Ensemble_Edge.html">131 hunch net-2005-11-16-The Everything Ensemble Edge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Rich Caruana,Alexandru Niculescu, Geoff Crew, and Alex Ksikes have donea lot
of empirical testingwhich shows thatusing all methods to make a predictionis
more powerful than using any single method. This is in rough agreement with
the Bayesian way of solving problems, but based upon a different (essentially
empirical) motivation. A rough summary is:Take all of {decision trees, boosted
decision trees, bagged decision trees, boosted decision stumps, K nearest
neighbors, neural networks, SVM} with all reasonable parameter settings.Run
the methods on each problem of 8 problems with a large test set, calibrating
margins using eithersigmoid fittingorisotonic regression.For each loss of
{accuracy, area under the ROC curve, cross entropy, squared error, etcâ&euro;Ś}
evaluate the average performance of the method.A series of conclusions can be
drawn from the observations.(Calibrated) boosted decision trees appear to
perform best, in general although support vector machines and neural networks

<p>Introduction: I don't consider myself a "Bayesian", but I do try hard to understand why
Bayesian learning works. For the purposes of this post, Bayesian learning is a
simple process of:Specify a prior over world models.Integrate using Bayes law
with respect to all observed information to compute a posterior over world
models.Predict according to the posterior.Bayesian learning has many
advantages over other learning programs:InterpolationBayesian learning methods
interpolate all the way to pure engineering. When faced with any learning
problem, there is a choice of how much time and effort a human vs. a computer
puts in. (For example, the mars rover pathfinding algorithms are almost
entirely engineered.) When creating an engineered system, you build a model of
the world and then find a good controller in that model. Bayesian methods
interpolate to this extreme because the Bayesian prior can be a delta function
on one model of the world. What this means is that a recipe of "think harder"

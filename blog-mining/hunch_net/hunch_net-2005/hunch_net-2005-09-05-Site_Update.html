<p>Introduction: The hunch.net server has been updated.  I’ve taken the opportunity to upgrade the version of wordpress which caused cascading changes.
  
 Old threaded comments are now flattened.  The system we used to use ( Brian’s threaded comments ) appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress.  I haven’t yet figured out a workaround. 
 I setup a  feedburner account . 
 I added an RSS aggregator for both Machine Learning and other research blogs that I like to follow.  This is something that I’ve wanted to do for awhile.

<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-issues for the moment.
 
The number of posts is a bit over 20. 
The number of people speaking up in discussions is about 10. 
The number of people viewing the site is somewhat more than 100.
 
I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many things.
  
 Many of the  potential uses  haven’t been realized.  This is partly a matter of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no open problems because it’s hard to give them up), and partly a matter of tradition.  In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get everything perfectly right before presentation.  This is somewhat contradictory to the nature of making many posts, and it’s definitely contradictory to the idea of doing “public research”.  If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must be significantly more succesful than previous methods.

<p>Introduction: NIPS  is the big winter conference of learning.  
  
 Paper due date: June 3rd. (Tweaked thanks to  Fei Sha .) 
 Location: Vancouver (main program) Dec. 5-8 and Whistler (workshops) Dec 9-10, BC, Canada 
  
NIPS is larger than all of the other learning conferences, partly because itâ&euro;&trade;s the only one at that time of year.  I recommend the workshops which are often quite interesting and energetic.</p><p>5 0.10052036 <a title="107-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-08-MaxEnt_contradicts_Bayes_Rule%3F.html">191 hunch net-2006-07-08-MaxEnt contradicts Bayes Rule?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I read  this . David Blei and I spent some time thinking hard about this a few years back (thanks to Kary Myers for pointing us to it):
 
 In short I was thinking that Ã¢â‚¬Å“bayesian belief updatingÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“maximum entropyÃ¢â‚¬Â were two othogonal principles. But it appear that they are not, and that they can even be in conflict ! 
Example (from Kass 1996); consider a Die (6 sides), consider prior knowledge E[X]=3.5. 
Maximum entropy leads to P(X)= (1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6). 
Now consider a new piece of evidence A=Ã¢â‚¬ÂX is an odd numberÃ¢â‚¬Â 
Bayesian posterior P(X|A)= P(A|X) P(X) = (1/3, 0, 1/3, 0, 1/3, 0). 
But MaxEnt with the constraints E[X]=3.5 and E[Indicator function of A]=1 leads to (.22, 0, .32, 0, .47, 0) !! (note that E[Indicator function of A]=P(A)) 
Indeed, for MaxEnt, because there is no more Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ6Ã¢â‚¬Â², big numbers must be more probable to ensure an average of 3.5. For bayesian updating, P(X|A) doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to have a 3.5</p><p>6 0.094774708 <a title="107-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-05-Server_Shift%2C_Site_Tweaks%2C_Suggestions%3F.html">182 hunch net-2006-06-05-Server Shift, Site Tweaks, Suggestions?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I tweaked the site in a number of ways today, including:
  
 Updating to  WordPress  1.5. 
 Installing and heavily tweaking the  Geekniche  theme.  Update: I switched back to a tweaked version of the old theme. 
 Adding the  Customizable Post Listings  plugin. 
 Installing the  StatTraq  plugin. 
 Updating some of the links.  I particularly recommend looking at the  computer research policy  blog. 
 Adding  threaded comments .  This doesn’t thread old comments obviously, but the extra structure may be helpful for new ones. 
  
Overall, I think this is an improvement, and it addresses a few of my  earlier problems .  If you have any difficulties or anything seems “not quite right”, please speak up.  A few other tweaks to the site may happen in the near future.</p><p>2 0.97891122 <a title="107-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-14-Families_of_Learning_Theory_Statements.html">56 hunch net-2005-04-14-Families of Learning Theory Statements</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The diagram above shows a very broad viewpoint of learning theory.

 Typical statement 
 Examples 
 
 
 Past->Past 
  Some prediction algorithm  A  does almost as well as any of a set of algorithms. 
 Weighted Majority 
 
 
 Past->Future 
 Assuming independent samples, past performance predicts future performance. 
 PAC analysis, ERM analysis 
 
 
 Future->Future 
 Future prediction performance on subproblems implies future prediction performance using algorithm  A . 
 ECOC, Probing 
 
  
A basic question is: Are there other varieties of statements of this type?   Avrim  noted that there are also “arrows between arrows”: generic methods for transforming between Past->Past statements and Past->Future statements.  Are there others?</p><p>3 0.97338259 <a title="107-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-09-Intuitions_from_applied_learning.html">16 hunch net-2005-02-09-Intuitions from applied learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since learning is far from an exact science, it’s good to pay attention to basic intuitions of applied learning.  Here are a few I’ve collected.
  
  Integration   In Bayesian learning, the posterior is computed by an integral, and the optimal thing to do is to predict according to this integral.  This phenomena seems to be far more general.  Bagging, Boosting, SVMs, and Neural Networks all take advantage of this idea to some extent.  The phenomena is more general: you can average over many different  classification predictors  to improve performance.  Sources:  Zoubin ,  Caruana  
  Differentiation  Different pieces of an average should differentiate to achieve good performance by different methods.  This is know as the ‘symmetry breaking’ problem for neural networks, and it’s why weights are initialized randomly.   Boosting explicitly attempts to achieve good differentiation by creating new, different, learning problems.  Sources:  Yann LeCun ,  Phil Long

<p>Introduction: One thing common to much research is that the researcher must be the first person  ever  to have some thought.  How do you think of something that has never been thought of?  There seems to be no methodical manner of doing this, but there are some tricks.
  
 The easiest method is to just have some connection come to you.  There is a trick here however: you should write it down and fill out the idea immediately because  it can just as easily go away. 
 A harder method is to set aside a block of time and simply think about an idea.  Distraction elimination is essential here because thinking about the unthought is hard work which your mind will avoid. 
 Another common method is in conversation.  Sometimes the process of verbalizing implies new ideas come up and sometimes whoever you are talking to replies just the right way.  This method is dangerous though—you must speak to someone who helps you think rather than someone who occupies your thoughts. 
 Try to rephrase the problem so the a</p><p>5 0.93787247 <a title="107-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-24-Holy_grails_of_machine_learning%3F.html">2 hunch net-2005-01-24-Holy grails of machine learning?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let me kick things off by posing this question to ML researchers:
 
   What do you think are some important holy grails of machine learning?
 
For example: 
 – “A classifier with SVM-level performance but much more scalable” 
 – “Practical confidence bounds (or learning bounds) for classification” 
 – “A reinforcement learning algorithm that can handle the ___ problem” 
 – “Understanding theoretically why ___ works so well in practice” 
etc.
 
I pose this question because I believe that when goals are stated explicitly and well (thus providing clarity as well as opening up the problems to more people), rather than left implicit, they are likely to be achieved much more quickly.  I would also like to know more about the internal goals of the various machine learning sub-areas (theory, kernel methods, graphical models, reinforcement learning, etc) as stated by people in these respective areas.  This could help people cross sub-areas.</p><p>6 0.91754383 <a title="107-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-16-Centmail_comments.html">367 hunch net-2009-08-16-Centmail comments</a></p>

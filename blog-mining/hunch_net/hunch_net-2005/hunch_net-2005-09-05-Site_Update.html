<p>Introduction: The hunch.net server has been updated. I've taken the opportunity to upgrade
the version of wordpress which caused cascading changes.Old threaded comments
are now flattened. The system we used to use (Brian's threaded comments)
appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress. I
haven't yet figured out a workaround.I setup afeedburner account.I added an
RSS aggregator for both Machine Learning and other research blogs that I like

<p>Introduction: NIPSis the big winter conference of learning.Paper due date: June 3rd.
(Tweaked thanks toFei Sha.)Location: Vancouver (main program) Dec. 5-8 and
Whistler (workshops) Dec 9-10, BC, CanadaNIPS is larger than all of the other
learning conferences, partly because it's the only one at that time of year. I

<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-
issues for the moment.The number of posts is a bit over 20.The number of
people speaking up in discussions is about 10.The number of people viewing the
site is somewhat more than 100.I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many
things.Many of thepotential useshaven't been realized. This is partly a matter
of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no
open problems because it's hard to give them up), and partly a matter of
tradition. In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get
everything perfectly right before presentation. This is somewhat contradictory
to the nature of making many posts, and it's definitely contradictory to the
idea of doing "public research". If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must
be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to
continue experimenting, I'm going to use the next week as "open problems
week".Spam is a problem.</p><p>5 0.10902565 <a title="107-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-09-The_Machine_Learning_Forum.html">363 hunch net-2009-07-09-The Machine Learning Forum</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dear Fellow Machine Learners,For the past year or so I have become
increasingly frustrated with the peer review system in our field. I constantly
get asked to review papers in which I have no interest. At the same time, as
an action editor in JMLR, I constantly have to harass people to review papers.
When I send papers to conferences and to journals I often get rejected with
reviews that, at least in my mind, make no sense. Finally, I have a very hard
time keeping up with the best new work, because I don't know where to look for
itâ&euro;ŚI decided to try an do something to improve the situation. I started a new
web site, which I decided to call "The machine learning forum" the URL
ishttp://themachinelearningforum.orgThe main idea behind this web site is to
remove anonymity from the review process. In this site, all opinions are
attributed to the actual person that expressed them. I expect that this will
improve the quality of the reviews. An obvious other effect is that there will
be fewer n</p><p>6 0.10866211 <a title="107-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-16-KDNuggets.html">342 hunch net-2009-02-16-KDNuggets</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A big ouch--all the videos for ICML 2012 were lost in a shuffle. Rajnish sends
the below, but if anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated.
----------------------------------------------------Sincere apologies to ICML
community for loosing 2012 archived videosWhat happened: In order to publish
2013 videos, we decided to move 2012 videos to another server. We have a
weekly backup service from the provider but after removing the videos from the
current server, when we tried to retrieve the 2012 videos from backup service,
the backup did not work because of provider-specific requirements that we had
ignored while removing the data from previous server.What are we doing about
this: At this point, we are still looking into raw footage to find if we can
retrieve some of the videos, but following are the steps we are taking to make
sure this does not happen again in future:(1) We are going to create a channel
on Vimeo (and potentially on YouTube) and we will publish there the p-in-p-</p><p>6 0.50175679 <a title="107-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thesecond Netflix prize is canceleddue toprivacy problems. I continue to
believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was
somewhat overstated. I still haven't seen any serious privacy failures on the
scale of theAOL search log release.I expect privacy concerns to continue to be
a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments. The
theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet
in a state where the limits of what's possible are clear let alone how to
achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>3 0.95486635 <a title="107-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-05-20-Google_Predict.html">399 hunch net-2010-05-20-Google Predict</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Slashdotpoints outGoogle Predict. I'm not privy to the details, but this has
the potential to be extremely useful, as in many applications simply having an
easy mechanism to apply existing learning algorithms can be extremely helpful.
This differs goalwise fromMLcomp--instead of public comparisons for research
purposes, it's about private utilization of good existing algorithms. It also
differs infrastructurally, since a system designed to do this is much less
awkward than using Amazon's cloud computing. The latter implies that datasets
several order of magnitude larger can be handled up to limits imposed by
network and storage.</p><p>4 0.91879809 <a title="107-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-13-Sam_Roweis_died.html">386 hunch net-2010-01-13-Sam Roweis died</a></p>
<p>Introduction: and I can't help but remember him.I first metSamas an undergraduate
atCaltechwhere he was TA forHopfield's class, and again when I visitedGatsby,
when he invited me to visitToronto, and at too many conferences to recount.
His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great
ability to phrase a problem so it's solution must be understood. With respect
to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to makemy first tutorial,
leading to others, and to other things, all of which I'm grateful to him for.
In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.His
death isbeing called a suicidewhich is so incompatible with my understanding
of Sam that it strains my credibility. But we know that his many
responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane
researchers have legions of inner doubts. Having been depressed now and then
myself, it's helpful to understand at least intellectually that the true

<p>Introduction: While everyone is silently working on ICML submissions, I found this
discussion about afast physics simulatorchip interesting from a learning
viewpoint. In many cases, learning attempts to predict the outcome of physical
processes. Access to a fast simulator for these processes might be quite
helpful in predicting the outcome. Bayesian learning in particular may
directly benefit while many other algorithms (like support vector machines)
might have their speed greatly increased.The biggest drawback is that writing
software for these odd architectures is always difficult and time consuming,
but a several-orders-of-magnitude speedup might make that worthwhile.</p><p>6 0.84824985 <a title="107-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-21-Dynamic_Programming_Generalizations_and_Their_Use.html">58 hunch net-2005-04-21-Dynamic Programming Generalizations and Their Use</a></p>

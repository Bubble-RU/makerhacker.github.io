because:Data set sizes appear to be growing substantially faster than

<p>Introduction: Suppose you have a dataset with 2 terafeatures (we only count nonzero entries
in a datamatrix), and want to learn a good linear predictor in a reasonable
amount of time. How do you do it? As a learning theorist, the first thing you
do is pray that this is too much data for the number of parameters--but that's
not the case, there are around 16 billion examples, 16 million parameters, and
people really care about a high quality predictor, so subsampling is not a
good strategy.Alekhvisited us last summer, and we had a breakthrough
(seeherefor details), coming up with the first learning algorithm I've seen
that is provably faster thanany futuresingle machine learning algorithm. The
proof of this is simple: We can output a optimal-up-to-precision linear
predictor faster than the data can be streamed through the network interface
of any single machine involved in the computation.It is necessary but not

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example

several issues come up:Large DefinitionMy personal definition of dataset size
is:smallA dataset is small if a human could look at the dataset and plausibly

sized. This might sound like a pissing match over dataset size, but I believe
it is more than that.The fundamental reason for these definitions is that they
correspond to transitions in the sorts of approaches which are feasible. From
small to medium, the ability to use a human as the learning algorithm
degrades. From medium to large, it becomes essential to have learning

<p>Introduction: Machine learning is often computationally bounded which implies that the
ability to write fast code becomes important if you ever want to implement a
machine learning algorithm. Basic tactical optimizations are covered
wellelsewhere, but I haven't seen a reasonable guide to higher level
optimizations, which are the most important in my experience. Here are some of
the higher level optimizations I've often found useful.Algorithmic Improvement
First. This is Hard, but it is the most important consideration, and typically
yields the most benefits. Good optimizations here are publishable. In the
context of machine learning, you should be familiar with the arguments for
online vs. batch learning.Choice of Language. There are many arguments about
thechoice of language. Sometimes you don't have a choice when interfacing with
other people. Personally, I favor C/C++ when I want to write fast code. This
(admittedly) makes me a slower programmer than when using higher level
languages. (Sometimes</p><p>4 0.66884357 <a title="128-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-26-Parallel_Machine_Learning_Problems.html">229 hunch net-2007-01-26-Parallel Machine Learning Problems</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.September
9,abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposiumare due. Send a 2 page
pdf, if interested, and note that we:widened submissions to be from anybody
rather than students.set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed
submissions.September 15, there is amachine learning meetup, where I'll be
discussing terascale learning at AOL.September 16, there is aCS&Econ; dayat New
York Academy of Sciences. This is not ML focused, but it's easy to imagine
interest.September 23 and laterNIPS workshopsubmissions start coming due. As
usual, there are too many good ones, so I won't be able to attend all those
that interest me. I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming
summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you. Here are a few that
interest me:Big Learningis about dealing with lots of data. Abstracts are

<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied
machine learning using current technology. We just built a small one at TTI so
this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design
choices.ArchitectureThere are several architectural choices.AMD Athlon64 based
system. This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck. Maximum RAM is typically
2-3GB.AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to
buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB
of RAM. The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type.Intel PIV or
Xeon based system. The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the
above 2. Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit
hotter and be a bit more expensive.Dual core chips. Both Intel and AMD have
chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them.In the end, we decided
to go with option (2). Roughly speaking, the AMD system seemed like a bet</p><p>4 0.83405131 <a title="128-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-29-To_Vidoelecture_or_not.html">416 hunch net-2010-10-29-To Vidoelecture or not</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (update:cross-postedonCACM)For the first time in several years,ICML 2010did
not havevideolecturesattending. Luckily, thetutorial on exploration and
learningwhichAlinaand I put together canbe viewed, since we also presented
atKDD 2010, which included videolecture support.ICML didn't cover the cost of
a videolecture, becausePASCALdidn't provide a grant for it this year. On the
other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs. The cost of
videolectures isn't cheap. Fora workshopthe baseline quote we have is 270 euro
per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman's travel and accomodation.
This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle
the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a
quoted 216 euro per hour.Youtubeis the most predominant free video site with a
cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.15 minute upload
limitsdo not match typical talk lengths. Videolectures also have side-by-side
synchronized slides &</p><p>5 0.81419289 <a title="128-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-17-Partha_Niyogi_has_died.html">414 hunch net-2010-10-17-Partha Niyogi has died</a></p>
<p>Introduction: from brain cancer. I askedMishawho worked with him to write about it.Partha
Niyogi, Louis Block Professor in Computer Science and Statistics at the
University of Chicago passed away on October 1, 2010, aged 43.I first met
Partha Niyogi almost exactly ten years ago when I was a graduate student in
math and he had just started as a faculty in Computer Science and Statistics
at the University of Chicago. Strangely, we first talked at length due to a
somewhat convoluted mathematical argument in a paper on pattern recognition. I
asked him some questions about the paper, and, even though the topic was new
to him, he had put serious thought into it and we started regular meetings. We
made significant progress and developed a line of research stemming initially
just from trying to understand that one paper and to simplify one derivation.
I think this was typical of Partha, showing both his intellectual curiosity
and his intuition for the serendipitous; having a sense and focus for
inquiries wo</p><p>6 0.76158345 <a title="128-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-21-Regretting_the_dead.html">411 hunch net-2010-09-21-Regretting the dead</a></p>

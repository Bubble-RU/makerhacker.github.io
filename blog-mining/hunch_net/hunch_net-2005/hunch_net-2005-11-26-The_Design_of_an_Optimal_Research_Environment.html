<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this

particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>4 0.25672305 <a title="132-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-12-The_unrealized_potential_of_the_research_lab.html">121 hunch net-2005-10-12-The unrealized potential of the research lab</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I attended theIBM research 60th anniversary. IBM research is, by any
reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the
most value to it's parent company over the long term. This can be seen by
simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab
which has not gone through a period of massive firing. (Note that there are
alsonew research labs.)Despite this impressive record, IBM research has
failed, by far, to achieve it's potential. Examples which came up in this
meeting include:It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented
in the lab. (In fact, Intel produced it first.)Relational databases and SQL
were invented and then languished. It was only under external competition that
IBM released it's own relational database. Why didn't IBM grow anOracle
division?An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing
aCisco division. Why not?And remember â&euro;Ś IBM research is a stark success story

<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point
of view of an undergraduate. The shift from a class-taking mentality to a
research mentality is very significant and not easy.Problem PosingPosing the
right problem is often as important as solving them. Many people can get by in
research by solving problems others have posed, but that's not sufficient for
really inspiring research. For learning in particular, there is a strong
feeling that we just haven't figured out which questions are the right ones to
ask. You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem
convincing.Gambling your lifeWhen you do research, you think very hard about
new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions. Many
conversations are of the form "I wonder what would happen if…" These processes
can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours. The worst part is that
you'll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and
sometimes not even then be</p><p>6 0.19518942 <a title="132-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-01-The_Producer-Consumer_Model_of_Research.html">51 hunch net-2005-04-01-The Producer-Consumer Model of Research</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I found these two essays on bad ideas interesting. Neither of these is written
from the viewpoint of research, but they are both highly relevant.Why smart
people have bad ideasby Paul GrahamWhy smart people defend bad ideasby Scott
Berkun (which appeared onslashdot)In my experience, bad ideas are
commonandover confidence in ideas is common. This overconfidence can take
either the form of excessive condemnation or excessive praise. Some of this is
necessary to the process of research. For example, some overconfidence in the
value of your own research is expected and probably necessary to motivate your
own investigation. Since research is a rather risky business, much of it does
not pan out. Learning to accept when something does not pan out is a critical
skill which is sometimes never acquired.Excessive condemnation can be a real
ill when it's encountered. This has two effects:When the penalty for being
wrong is too large, it means people have a great investment in defending

<p>Introduction: If we accept that bad reviewing often occurs and want to fix it, the question
is "how"?Reviewing is done by paper writers just like yourself, so a good
proxy for this question is asking "How can I be a better reviewer?" Here are a
few things I've learned by trial (and error), as a paper writer, and as a
reviewer.The secret ingredient is careful thought. There is no good
substitution for a deep and careful understanding.Avoid reviewing papers that
you feel competitive about. You almost certainly will be asked to review
papers that feel competitive if you work on subjects of common interest. But,
the feeling of competition can easily lead to bad judgement.If you feel biased
for some other reason, then you should avoid reviewing. For exampleâ&euro;ŚFeeling
angry or threatened by a paper is a form of bias. See above.Double blind
yourself (avoid looking at the name even in a single-blind situation). The
significant effect of a name you recognize is making you pay close attention
to a paper. Since</p><p>2 0.9603771 <a title="132-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-09-The_Stock_Prediction_Machine_Learning_Problem.html">193 hunch net-2006-07-09-The Stock Prediction Machine Learning Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: …is discussed inthis nytimes article. I generally expect such approaches to
become more common since computers are getting faster, machine learning is
getting better, and data is becoming more plentiful. This is another example
where machine learning technology may have a huge economic impact. Some side
notes:We-in-research know almost nothing about how these things are done
(because it is typically a corporate secret).… but the limited discussion in
the article seem naive from a machine learning viewpoint.The learning process
used apparently often fails to take into account transaction costs.What little
of the approaches is discussed appears modeling based. It seems plausible that
more direct prediction methods can yield an edge.One difficulty with stock
picking as a research topic is that it is inherently a zero sum game (for
every winner, there is a loser). Much of the rest of research is positive sum
(basically, everyone wins).</p><p>3 0.95776033 <a title="132-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-08-24-Mass_Customized_Medicine_in_the_Future%3F.html">314 hunch net-2008-08-24-Mass Customized Medicine in the Future?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about a technology which could develop in the future.Right now, a
new drug might be tested by finding patients with some diagnosis and giving or
not giving them a drug according to a secret randomization. The outcome is
observed, and if the average outcome for those treated is measurably better
than the average outcome for those not treated, the drug might become a
standard treatment.Generalizing this, a filterFsorts people into two groups:
those for treatmentAand those not for treatmentBbased upon observationsx. To
measure the outcome, you randomize between treatment and nontreatment of
groupAand measure the relative performance of the treatment.A problem often
arises: in many cases the treated group does not do better than the nontreated
group. A basic question is: does this mean the treatment is bad? With respect
to the filterFit may mean that, but with respect to another filterF', the
treatment might be very effective. For example, a drug might work great for
people wh</p><p>4 0.94164175 <a title="132-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-26-Compassionate_Reviewing.html">395 hunch net-2010-04-26-Compassionate Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Most long conversations between academics seem to converge on the topic of
reviewing where almost no one is happy. A basic question is: Should most
people be happy?The case against is straightforward. Anyone who watches the
flow of papers realizes that most papers amount to little in the longer term.
By it's nature research is brutal, where the second-best method is worthless,
and the second person to discover things typically gets no credit. If you
think about this for a moment, it's very different from most other human
endeavors. The second best migrant laborer, construction worker, manager,
conductor, quarterback, etcâ&euro;Ś all can manage quite well. If a reviewer has even
a vaguely predictive sense of what's important in the longer term, then most
people submitting papers will be unhappy.But this argument unravels, in my
experience. Perhaps half of reviews are thoughtless or simply wrong with a
small part being simply malicious. And yet, I'm sure that most reviewers
genuinely believe th</p><p>same-blog 5 0.92474705 <a title="132-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example

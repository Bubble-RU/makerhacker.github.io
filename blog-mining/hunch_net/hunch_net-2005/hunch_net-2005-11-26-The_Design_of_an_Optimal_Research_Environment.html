</p><p>13 This is true, but there are several important caveats:      The “hit rate” (in terms of big impact on everyones lives) for unmotivated research is much lower. [sent-37, score-0.468]
</p><p>14 University-based research is may do this best via giving the researchers the ability to form their own companies with partial ownership. [sent-47, score-0.453]
</p><p>15 In the context of machine learning, spam filtering is of obvious and significant common use, yet a researcher with a better spam filter can not easily create a company around the method. [sent-50, score-0.685]
</p><p>16 The benefit structure in industrial research labs is (perhaps) often even worse. [sent-59, score-0.929]
</p><p>17 University style research partially achieves this (a notable complaint of students is that they do not have enough freedom). [sent-78, score-0.443]

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired.

As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: I attended the  IBM research 60th anniversary .  IBM research is, by any reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the most value to it’s parent company over the long term.  This can be seen by simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab which has not gone through a period of massive firing.  (Note that there are also  new research labs .)
 
Despite this impressive record, IBM research has failed, by far, to achieve it’s potential.  Examples which came up in this meeting include:
  
 It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented in the lab.  (In fact, Intel produced it first.) 
 Relational databases and SQL were invented and then languished.  It was only under external competition that IBM released it’s own relational database.  Why didn’t IBM grow an  Oracle division ? 
 An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing a  Cisco division .  Why not?

<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point of view of an undergraduate.  The shift from a class-taking mentality to a research mentality is very significant and not easy.  
  
  Problem Posing  Posing the right problem is often as important as solving them.  Many people can get by in research by solving problems others have posed, but that’s not sufficient for really inspiring research.  For learning in particular, there is a strong feeling that we just haven’t figured out which questions are the right ones to ask.  You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem convincing. 
  Gambling your life  When you do research, you think very hard about new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions.  Many conversations are of the form “I wonder what would happen if…” These processes can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours.  The worst part is that you’ll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and some</p><p>6 0.18899602 <a title="132-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-12-06-The_Spam_Problem.html">223 hunch net-2006-12-06-The Spam Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is about the hard choices that graduate students must make.
 
The cultural definition of success in academic research is to:
  
 Produce good research which many other people appreciate. 
 Produce many students who go on to do the same. 
  
There are fundamental reasons why this is success in the local culture.   Good research appreciated by others means access to jobs.  Many students succesful in the same way implies that there are a number of people who think in a similar way and appreciate your work.
 
In order to graduate, a phd student must live in an academic culture for a period of several years. It is common to adopt the culture’s definition of success during this time.  It’s also common for many phd students discover they are not suited to an academic research lifestyle.  This collision of values and abilities naturally results in depression.
 
The most fundamental advice when this happens is: change something.  Pick a new advisor.  Pick a new research topic.  Or leave th</p><p>6 0.81443971 <a title="132-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Bad_ideas.html">76 hunch net-2005-05-29-Bad ideas</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The  From Data to Knowledge  workshop May 7-11 at  Berkeley  should be of interest to the many people encountering streaming data in different disciplines.  Itâ&euro;&trade;s run by a group of astronomers who encounter streaming data all the time.  I met  Josh Bloom  recently and he is broadly interested in a workshop covering all aspects of Machine Learning on streaming data.  The hope here is that techniques developed in one area turn out useful in another which seems quite plausible.  Particularly if you are in the bay area, consider checking it out.</p><p>2 0.95324665 <a title="132-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-07-KDD_and_MUCMD_2011.html">444 hunch net-2011-09-07-KDD and MUCMD 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At  KDD  I enjoyed  Stephen Boyd ‘s invited talk about optimization quite a bit.  However, the most interesting talk for me was  David Haussler ‘s.  His talk started out with a formidable load of biological complexity.  About half-way through you start wondering, “can this be used to help with cancer?”  And at the end he connects it directly to use with a call to arms for the audience: cure cancer.  The core thesis here is that cancer is a complex set of diseases which can be distentangled via genetic assays, allowing attacking the specific signature of individual cancers.  However, the data quantity and complex dependencies within the data require systematic and relatively automatic prediction and analysis algorithms of the kind that we are best familiar with.

<p>Introduction: I attended  KDD  this year.  The conference has always had a strong grounding in what works based on the  KDDcup , but it has developed a halo of workshops on various subjects.  It seems that KDD has become a place where the economy meets machine learning in a stronger sense than many other conferences.
 
There were several papers that other people might like to take a look at.
  
  Yehuda Koren   Collaborative Filtering with Temporal Dynamics .  This paper describes how to incorporate temporal dynamics into a couple of collaborative filtering approaches.  This was also a best paper award. 
  D. Sculley , Robert Malkin,  Sugato Basu ,  Roberto J. Bayardo ,  Predicting Bounce Rates in Sponsored Search Advertisements .  The basic claim of this paper is that the probability people immediately leave (“bounce”) after clicking on an advertisement is predictable.

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is encouraging.   There is some discussion of this at the  Computing Research Policy  blog.  
 
One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time, presumably in dollar budgets.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t believe that dollar budgets are the right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers.  A better way to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a measure of the relative emphasis on research.
 
  
 
This graph was assembled by dividing the  NSF budget  by the  US GDP .  For 2005 GDP, I used the  current estimate  and for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per year.  The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to change.
 
This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row.  The reality has been significantly more severe due to  DARPA decreasing funding  and industrial</p><p>same-blog 5 0.92518854 <a title="132-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

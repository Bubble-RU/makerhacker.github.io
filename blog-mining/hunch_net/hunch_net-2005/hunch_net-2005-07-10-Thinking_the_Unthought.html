<p>Introduction: At the one year (+5 days) anniversary, the natural question is: "Was it
helpful for research?"Answer: Yes, and so it shall continue.Some evidence is
provided by noticing that I am about a factor of 2 more overloaded with paper
ideas than I've ever previously been. It is always hard to estimate
counterfactual worlds, but I expect that this is also a factor of 2 more than
"What if I had not started the blog?"As for "Why?", there seem to be two
primary effects.A blog is a mechanism for connecting with people who either
think like you or are interested in the same problems. This allows for
concentration of thinking which is very helpful in solving problems.The
process of stating things you don't understand publicly is very helpful in
understanding them. Sometimes you are simply forced to express them in a way
which aids understanding. Sometimes someone else says something which helps.
And sometimes you discover that someone else has already solved the
problem.There are drawbacks which shou</p><p>3 0.12331333 <a title="91-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-01-Multitask_Poisoning.html">358 hunch net-2009-06-01-Multitask Poisoning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are many ways that interesting research gets done. For example it's
common at a conference for someone to discuss a problem with a partial
solution, and for someone else to know how to solve a piece of it, resulting
in a paper. In some sense, these are the easiest results we can achieve, so we
should ask: Can all research be this easy?The answer is certainly no for
fields where research inherently requires experimentation to discover how the
real world works. However, mathematics, including parts of physics, computer
science, statistics, etcâ&euro;Ś which are effectively mathematics don't require
experimentation. In effect, a paper can be simply a pure expression of
thinking. Can all mathematical-style research be this easy?What's going on
here is research-by-communication. Someone knows something, someone knows
something else, and as soon as someone knows both things, a problem is solved.
The interesting thing about research-by-communication is that it is becoming
radically easier with</p><p>4 0.1133232 <a title="91-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential
ingredients that I see.Stability. University-based research is relatively good
at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often
"ok"--a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up
to something very beneficial. However, it misses one of the big potentials of
research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.Stability comes
in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the
freedom to consider far horizon activities. An iron-clad guarantee of a
paycheck is not necessary--industrial research labs have succeeded well with
research positions of indefinite duration. Atnt research was a great example
of th</p><p>5 0.11192421 <a title="91-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>6 0.10030364 <a title="91-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-26-Prediction_Bounds_as_the_Mathematics_of_Science.html">115 hunch net-2005-09-26-Prediction Bounds as the Mathematics of Science</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We've discussedpresentation preparation before, but I have one more thing to
add:transitioning. For a research presentation, it is substantially helpful
for the audience if transitions are clear. A common outline for a research
presentation in machine leanring is:The problem. Presentations which don't
describe the problem almost immediately lose people, because the context is
missing to understand the detail.Prior relevant work. In many cases, a paper
builds on some previous bit of work which must be understood in order to
understand what the paper does. A common failure mode seems to be spending too
much time on prior work. Discuss just the relevant aspects of prior work in
the language of your work. Sometimes this is missing when unneeded.What we
did. For theory papers in particular, it is often not possible to really cover
the details. Prioritizing what you present can be very important.How it
worked. Many papers in Machine Learning have some sort of experimental test of

<p>Introduction: Many people, especially students, haven't had an opportunity to collaborate
with other researchers. Collaboration, especially with remote people can be
tricky. Here are some observations of what has worked for me on collaborations
involving a few people.Travel and DiscussAlmost all collaborations start with
in-person discussion. This implies that travel is often necessary. We can hope
that in the future we'll have better systems for starting collaborations
remotely (such as blogs), but we aren't quite there yet.Enable your
collaborator. A collaboration can fall apart because one collaborator disables
another. This sounds stupid (and it is), but it's far easier than you might
think.Avoid Duplication. Discovering that you and a collaborator have been
editing the same thing and now need to waste time reconciling changes is
annoying. The best way to avoid this to be explicit about who has write
permission to what. Most of the time, a write lock is held for the entire
document, just to be s</p><p>4 0.70316225 <a title="91-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-21-Presentation_Preparation.html">249 hunch net-2007-06-21-Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference. Since many
people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial
challenge. Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about
preparing a presentation on research.Motivate. Talks which don't start by
describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out.Prioritize. It
is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many
presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much. This is an
easy-to-understand failure mode as it's very natural to want to include
everything. A basic fact is: you can't. Example of this are:Your slides are so
densely full of equations and words that you can't cover them.Your talk runs
over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off.You motor-mouth
through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience
prioritizes in some uncontrolled fashion.The rate of flow of concepts simply
exceeds the infor</p><p>5 0.70227665 <a title="91-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-01-Multitask_Poisoning.html">358 hunch net-2009-06-01-Multitask Poisoning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The DARPA grandchallenge is a big contest for autonomous robot vehicle
driving. It was run once in 2004 for the first time and all teams did badly.
This year was notably different with theStanfordandCMUteams succesfully
completing the course. A number of details arehereandwikipedia has continuing
coverage.A formal winner hasn't been declared yet although Stanford completed
the course quickest.The Stanford and CMU teams deserve a large round of
applause as they have strongly demonstrated the feasibility of autonomous
vehicles.The good news for machine learning is that the Stanford team (at
least) is using some machine learning techniques.</p><p>2 0.97088426 <a title="91-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-24-NLPers.html">166 hunch net-2006-03-24-NLPers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Registration for COLT 2007 is now open.The conference will take place on 13-15
June, 2007, in San Diego, California, as part of the 2007 Federated Computing
Research Conference (FCRC), which includes STOC, Complexity, and EC.The
website for COLT: http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2007/index.htmlThe early
registration deadline is May 11, and the cutoff date for discounted hotel
rates is May 9.Before registering, take note that the fees are substantially
lower for members of ACM and/or SIGACT than for nonmembers. If you've been
contemplating joining either of these two societies (annual dues: $99 for ACM,
$18 for SIGACT), now would be a good time!</p><p>5 0.95831263 <a title="91-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-15-NIPS_workshops_extended_to_3_days.html">266 hunch net-2007-10-15-NIPS workshops extended to 3 days</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (Unofficially, at least.) TheDeep Learning Workshopis being held the afternoon
before the rest of the workshops in Vancouver, BC. Separate registration is
needed, and open.What's happening fundamentally here is that there are too
many interesting workshops to fit into 2 days. Perhaps we can get it
officially expanded to 3 days next year.</p><p>same-blog 6 0.92891198 <a title="91-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-10-Thinking_the_Unthought.html">91 hunch net-2005-07-10-Thinking the Unthought</a></p>

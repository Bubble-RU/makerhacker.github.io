</p><p>7 The elegance of M3N, I think, is unrelated to this probabilistic/margin distinction. [sent-11, score-0.092]
</p><p>8 M3N provided the first implementation of the margin concept that was computationally efficient for multiple output variables and provided a sample complexity result with a much weaker dependence than previous approaches. [sent-12, score-0.703]
</p><p>9 Further, the authors carry out some nice experiments that speak well for the practicality of their approach. [sent-13, score-0.192]
</p><p>10 In particular, M3N’s outperform Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in terms of per-variable (Hamming) loss. [sent-14, score-0.08]
</p><p>11 And I think this gets us to the crux of the matter, and ties back to John’s post. [sent-15, score-0.232]
</p><p>12 CRFs are trained by a MAP approach that is effectively per sequence, while the loss function at run time we care about is per variable. [sent-16, score-0.657]
</p><p>13 The mismatch the post title refers to is that, at test time, M3N’s are viterbi decoded: a per sequence decoding. [sent-17, score-0.909]
</p><p>14 Intuitively, viterbi is an algorithm that only gets paid for its services when it classifies an entire sequence correctly. [sent-18, score-0.945]
</p><p>15 This seems an odd mismatch, and makes one wonder: How well does a per-variable approach like the variable marginal likelihood approach mentioned previously of Roweis,Kakade, and Teh combined with runtime belief propagation compare with the M3N procedure? [sent-19, score-0.599]
</p><p>16 Does the mismatch matter, and if so, is there a more appropriate decoding procedure like BP, appropriate for margin-trained methods? [sent-20, score-0.731]
</p><p>17 And finally, it seems we need to answer John’s question convincingly: if you really care about per-variable probabilities or classifications, isn’t it possible that structuring the output space actually hurts? [sent-21, score-0.393]

<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.
 
Topic Models:
  
   
Dynamic Topic Models  
David Blei, John Lafferty 
A nice model for how topics in LDA type models can evolve over time, 
using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters and a very 
clever structured variational approximation (in which the mean field 
parameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all Blei 
papers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive. 
   
Pachinko Allocation  
Wei Li, Andrew McCallum 
A very elegant (but computationally challenging) model which induces 
correlation amongst topics using a multi-level DAG whose interior nodes 
are “super-topics” and “sub-topics” and whose leaves are the 
vocabulary words. Makes the slumbering monster of structure learning stir.

<p>Introduction: Suppose you are given a sequence of observations  x 1 ,…,x T   from some space and wish to predict a sequence of labels  y 1 ,…,y T   so as to minimize the Hamming loss:  sum i=1 to T  I(y i  != c(x 1 ,…,x T ) i )  where  c(x 1 ,…,x T ) i   is the  i th predicted component.  For simplicity, suppose each label  y i   is in  {0,1} .
 
We can optimize the Hamming loss by simply optimizing the error rate in predicting each individual component  y i   independently since the loss is a linear combination of losses on each individual component  i .  From a learning reductions viewpoint, we can learn a different classifier for each individual component.  An average error rate of  e  over these classifiers implies an expected Hamming loss of  Te .  This breakup into  T  different prediction problems is  not  the standard form of modularity in structured prediction.
 
A more typical form of modularity is to predict  y i   given  x i , y i-1 , y i+1   where the circularity (predicting given other</p><p>4 0.11750229 <a title="77-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-20-Cool_and_Interesting_things_at_NIPS%2C_take_three.html">280 hunch net-2007-12-20-Cool and Interesting things at NIPS, take three</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given framework or mathematical model.  It turns out that all of these models are significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning.  I’ve created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of machine learning.
 
The point here is not simply “woe unto us”.  There are several implications which seem important.
  
 The multitude of models is a point of continuing confusion.  It is common for people to learn about machine learning within one framework which often becomes there “home framework” through which they attempt to filter all machine learning.  (Have you met people who can only think in terms of kernels?  Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)  Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help resolve the confusion.  This is particularly important when reviewing and particularly important for students.

<p>Introduction: I thought this was a very good NIPS with many excellent papers. The following are a few NIPS papers which I liked and I hope to study more carefully when I get the chance. The list is not exhaustive and in no particular order…
  
 Preconditioner Approximations for Probabilistic Graphical Models. 
Pradeeep Ravikumar and John Lafferty. 
I thought the use of preconditioner methods from solving linear systems in the context of approximate inference was novel and interesting. The results look good and I’d like to understand the limitations.
 
 Rodeo: Sparse nonparametric regression in high dimensions. 
John Lafferty and Larry Wasserman. 
A very interesting approach to feature selection in nonparametric regression from a frequentist framework. The use of lengthscale variables in each dimension reminds me a lot of  ‘Automatic Relevance Determination’ in Gaussian process regression — it would be interesting to compare Rodeo to ARD in GPs.

<p>Introduction: The Gibbs-Jaynes theorem is a classical result that tells us that the highest entropy distribution (most uncertain, least committed, etc.) subject to expectation constraints on a set of features is an exponential family distribution with the features as sufficient statistics. In math,
 
argmax_p H(p) 
s.t. E_p[f_i] = c_i
 
is given by e^{\sum \lambda_i f_i}/Z. (Z here is the necessary normalization constraint, and the lambdas are free parameters we set to meet the expectation constraints).
 
A great deal of statistical mechanics flows from this result, and it has proven very fruitful in learning as well. (Motivating work in models in text learning and Conditional Random Fields, for instance. ) The result has been demonstrated a number of ways. One of the most elegant is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“geometricÃ¢â‚¬Â version  here .
 
In the case when the expectation constraints come from data, this tells us that the maximum entropy distribution is exactly the maximum likelihood distribution in the expone</p><p>6 0.66862816 <a title="77-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-11-More_NIPS_Papers.html">139 hunch net-2005-12-11-More NIPS Papers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many people in computer science believe that patents are problematic.  The truth is even worse—the patent system in the US is fundamentally broken in ways that will require much more significant reform than  is being considered now .
 
The myth of the patent is the following: Patents are a mechanism for inventors to be compensated according to the value of their inventions while making the invention available to all.  This myth sounds pretty desirable, but the reality is a strange distortion slowly leading towards collapse.
 
There are many problems associated with patents, but I would like to focus on just two of them: 
  
  Patent Trolls   The way that patents have generally worked over the last several decades is that they were a tool of large companies.  Large companies would amass a large number of patents and then cross-license each other’s patents—in effect saying “we agree to owe each other nothing”.  Smaller companies would sometimes lose in this game, essentially because they</p><p>same-blog 2 0.89190292 <a title="77-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Maximum_Margin_Mismatch%3F.html">77 hunch net-2005-05-29-Maximum Margin Mismatch?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John makes a fascinating point about structured classification (and slightly scooped my post!). Maximum Margin Markov Networks (M3N) are an interesting example of the second class of structured classifiers (where the classification of one label depends on the others), and one of my favorite papers. I’m not alone: the paper won the best student paper award at NIPS in 2003. 
 
There are some things I find odd about the paper. For instance, it says of probabilistic models 
  
“cannot handle high dimensional feature spaces and lack strong theoretical guarrantees.” 
  
I’m aware of no such limitations. Also: 
  

“Unfortunately, even probabilistic graphical models that are trained discriminatively do not achieve the same level of performance as SVMs, especially when kernel features are used.”

  
This is quite interesting and contradicts my own experience as well as that of a number of people  I   greatly  
 respect . I wonder what the root cause is: perhaps there is something different abo</p><p>3 0.6946556 <a title="77-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML.  I did manage to catch one interesting paper:
 
 Richard Socher ,  Cliff Lin ,  Andrew Y. Ng , and  Christopher D. Manning   Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks .
 
I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so hopefully we’ll hear from him soon.  In the meantime,  Paul  and  Hal  have posted some lists.
 
 the future 
 
 Joelle  and I are program chairs for ICML 2012 in  Edinburgh , which I previously enjoyed visiting in  2005 .  This is a huge responsibility, that we hope to accomplish well.  A part of this (perhaps the most fun part), is imagining how we can make ICML better.  A key and critical constraint is choosing things that can be accomplished.  So far we have:
  
  Colocation . The first thing we looked into was potential colocations.  We quickly discovered that many other conferences precomitted their location.

<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some conception of what good reviewing is.  As far as I can tell, this is almost always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a “good paper” looks like for that area) rather than general principles.  Neither individual papers or areas are sufficiently general for a large conference—every paper differs in the details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?
 
An unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too large.  In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper which someone thinks might be of interest.  This reason for reviewing exists independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual conferences.  Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively meaningless over the long term — growing conferences simply use more rooms and/or change fo</p><p>5 0.68780345 <a title="77-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a quick reference for summer ML-related conferences sorted by due date:
  
 
 Conference 
 Due date 
 Location 
 Reviewing 
 
 
  KDD  
 Feb 10 
 August 12-16, Beijing, China 
 Single Blind 
 
 
  COLT  
 Feb 14 
 June 25-June 27, Edinburgh, Scotland 
 Single Blind? (historically) 
 
 
  ICML  
 Feb 24 
 June 26-July 1, Edinburgh, Scotland 
 Double Blind, author response, zero  SPOF  
 
 
  UAI  
 March 30 
 August 15-17, Catalina Islands, California 
 Double Blind, author response 
 
  
Geographically, this is greatly dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.
 
Machine Learning conferences are triannual now, between  NIPS ,  AIStat , and  ICML .  This has not always been the case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April conference.  
 
However, the first claim is not quite correct.  NIPS and AIStat have few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other conf</p><p>6 0.68672436 <a title="77-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>

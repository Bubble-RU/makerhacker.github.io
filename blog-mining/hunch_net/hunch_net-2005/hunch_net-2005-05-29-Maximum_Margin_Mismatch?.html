</p><p>7 The elegance of M3N, I think, is unrelated to this probabilistic/margin distinction. [sent-11, score-0.098]
</p><p>8 M3N provided the first implementation of the margin concept that was computationally efficient for multiple output variables and provided a sample complexity result with a much weaker dependence than previous approaches. [sent-12, score-0.695]
</p><p>9 Further, the authors carry out some nice experiments that speak well for the practicality of their approach. [sent-13, score-0.196]
</p><p>10 In particular, M3N's outperform Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in terms of per-variable (Hamming) loss. [sent-14, score-0.078]
</p><p>11 And I think this gets us to the crux of the matter, and ties back to John's post. [sent-15, score-0.23]
</p><p>12 CRFs are trained by a MAP approach that is effectively per sequence, while the loss function at run time we care about is per variable. [sent-16, score-0.657]
</p><p>13 The mismatch the post title refers to is that, at test time, M3N's are viterbi decoded: a per sequence decoding. [sent-17, score-0.977]
</p><p>14 Intuitively, viterbi is an algorithm that only gets paid for its services when it classifies an entire sequence correctly. [sent-18, score-0.933]
</p><p>15 This seems an odd mismatch, and makes one wonder: How well does a per-variable approach like the variable marginal likelihood approach mentioned previously of Roweis,Kakade, and Teh combined with runtime belief propagation compare with the M3N procedure? [sent-19, score-0.598]
</p><p>16 Does the mismatch matter, and if so, is there a more appropriate decoding procedure like BP, appropriate for margin-trained methods? [sent-20, score-0.724]
</p><p>17 And finally, it seems we need to answer John's question convincingly: if you really care about per-variable probabilities or classifications, isn't it possible that structuring the output space actually hurts? [sent-21, score-0.311]
</p><p>18 (It seems clear to me that it can help when you insist on getting the entire sequence right, although perhaps others don't concur with that. [sent-22, score-0.341]

<p>Introduction: Suppose you are given a sequence of observationsx1,…,xTfrom some space and
wish to predict a sequence of labelsy1,…,yTso as to minimize the Hamming
loss:sumi=1 to TI(yi!= c(x1,…,xT)i)wherec(x1,…,xT)iis theith predicted
component. For simplicity, suppose each labelyiis in{0,1}.We can optimize the
Hamming loss by simply optimizing the error rate in predicting each individual
componentyiindependently since the loss is a linear combination of losses on
each individual componenti. From a learning reductions viewpoint, we can learn
a different classifier for each individual component. An average error rate
ofeover these classifiers implies an expected Hamming loss ofTe. This breakup
intoTdifferent prediction problems isnotthe standard form of modularity in
structured prediction.A more typical form of modularity is to
predictyigivenxi, yi-1, yi+1where the circularity (predicting given other
predictions) is handled in various ways. This is often represented with a
graphical model like so:This</p><p>4 0.12647621 <a title="77-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-20-Cool_and_Interesting_things_at_NIPS%2C_take_three.html">280 hunch net-2007-12-20-Cool and Interesting things at NIPS, take three</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Pieter Abbeelpresented a paper withAndrew NgatICMLonExploration and
Apprenticeship Learning in Reinforcement Learning. The basic idea of this
algorithm is:Collect data from a human controlling a machine.Build a
transition model based upon the experience.Build a policy which optimizes the
transition model.Evaluate the policy. If it works well, halt, otherwise add
the experience into the pool and go to (2).The paper proves that this
technique will converge to some policy with expected performance near human
expected performance assuming the world fits certain assumptions (MDP or
linear dynamics).This general idea of apprenticeship learning (i.e.
incorporating data from an expert) seems very compelling because (a) humans
often learn this way and (b) much harder problems can be solved. For (a), the
notion of teaching is about transferring knowledge from an expert to novices,
often via demonstration. To see (b), note that we can create intricate
reinforcement learning problems where a parti</p><p>6 0.098787397 <a title="77-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-03-19-The_Ideal_Large_Scale_Learning_Class.html">426 hunch net-2011-03-19-The Ideal Large Scale Learning Class</a></p>

<p>Introduction: AtICML 2003,Marty Zinkevichproposedthe online convex optimization setting and
showed that a particular gradient descent algorithm has regret O(T0.5) with
respect to the best predictor where T is the number of rounds. This seems to
be a nice model for online learning, and there has been some significant
follow-up work.AtCOLT 2006Elad Hazan,Adam Kalai,Satyen Kale, andAmit
Agarwalpresenteda modification which takes a Newton stepguaranteeing O(log T)
regret when the first and second derivatives are bounded.Then they applied
these algorithms to portfolio managementatICML 2006(withRobert Schapire)
yielding some very fun graphs.</p><p>2 0.96488863 <a title="77-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-04-Vowpal_Wabbit%2C_version_5.0%2C_and_the_second_heresy.html">419 hunch net-2010-12-04-Vowpal Wabbit, version 5.0, and the second heresy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've releasedversion 5.0of theVowpal Wabbitonline learning software. The major
number has changed since thelast releasebecause I regard all earlier versions
as obsolete--there are several new algorithms & features including substantial
changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.The biggest changes are
new algorithms:Nikosand I improved the default algorithm. The basic update
rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully
controlled so that it's impossible to overrun the label. In addition, the
normalization has changed. Computationally, these changes are virtually free
and yield better results, sometimes much better. Less careful updates can be
reenabled with -loss_function classic, although results are still not
identical to previous due to normalization changes.Nikos also implemented the
per-feature learning rates as per thesetwopapers. Often, this works better
than the default algorithm. It isn't the default because it isn't (yet) as
adaptable</p><p>same-blog 3 0.96104592 <a title="77-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Maximum_Margin_Mismatch%3F.html">77 hunch net-2005-05-29-Maximum Margin Mismatch?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John makes a fascinating point about structured classification (and slightly
scooped my post!). Maximum Margin Markov Networks (M3N) are an interesting
example of the second class of structured classifiers (where the
classification of one label depends on the others), and one of my favorite
papers. I'm not alone: the paper won the best student paper award at NIPS in
2003.There are some things I find odd about the paper. For instance, it says
of probabilistic models"cannot handle high dimensional feature spaces and lack
strong theoretical guarrantees."I'm aware of no such limitations.
Also:"Unfortunately, even probabilistic graphical models that are trained
discriminatively do not achieve the same level of performance as SVMs,
especially when kernel features are used."This is quite interesting and
contradicts my own experience as well as that of a number of
peopleIgreatlyrespect. I wonder what the root cause is: perhaps there is
something different about the data Ben+Carlos were working</p><p>4 0.95945895 <a title="77-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-09-20-No_NY_ML_Symposium_in_2013%2C_and_some_good_news.html">489 hunch net-2013-09-20-No NY ML Symposium in 2013, and some good news</a></p>

disorganized by people leaving, pushing back the date, with the current
candidate a spring symposium on March 28.Gunnarand I were outvoted here--we
were gung ho on organizing a fall symposium, but the rest of the committee
wants to wait.In some good news, most of theICML 2012 videoshave been restored

<p>Introduction: The term "boosting" comes from the idea of using a meta-algorithm which takes
"weak" learners (that may be able to only barely predict slightly better than
random) and turn them into strongly capable learners (which predict very
well).Adaboostin 1995 was the first widely used (and useful) boosting
algorithm, although there were theoretical boosting algorithms floating around
since 1990 (see the bottom ofthis page).Since then, many different
interpretations of why boosting works have arisen. There is significant
discussion about these different views in theannals of statistics, including
aresponsebyYoav FreundandRobert Schapire.I believe there is a great deal of
value to be found in the original view of boosting (meta-algorithm for
creating a strong learner from a weak learner). This is not a claim that one
particular viewpoint obviates the value of all others, but rather that no
other viewpoint seems to really capture important properties.Comparing with
all other views of boosting is t</p><p>6 0.90408319 <a title="77-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-21-What_is_the_right_form_of_modularity_in_structured_prediction%3F.html">74 hunch net-2005-05-21-What is the right form of modularity in structured prediction?</a></p>

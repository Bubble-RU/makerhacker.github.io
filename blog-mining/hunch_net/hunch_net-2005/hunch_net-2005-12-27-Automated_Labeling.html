The basic idea is to take a look at the unlabeled data and create many supervised problems.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Daniel Hsu and John Langford.
 
In selective sampling style active learning, a learning algorithm chooses which examples to label.  We now have an active learning algorithm that is:
  
  Efficient  in label complexity, unlabeled complexity, and computational complexity. 
  Competitive  with supervised learning anywhere that supervised learning works. 
  Compatible  with online learning, with any optimization-based learning algorithm, with any loss function, with offline testing, and even with changing learning algorithms. 
  Empirically  effective. 
  
The basic idea is to combine  disagreement region-based sampling  with  importance weighting : an example is selected to be labeled with probability proportional to how useful it is for distinguishing among near-optimal classifiers, and labeled examples are importance-weighted by the inverse of these probabilities.  The combination of these simple ideas removes the  sampling bias  problem that has plagued many previous he</p><p>4 0.15045857 <a title="143-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-22-Active_learning.html">45 hunch net-2005-03-22-Active learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Often, unlabeled data is easy to come by but labels are expensive. For instance, if you’re building a speech recognizer, it’s easy enough to get raw speech samples — just walk around with a microphone — but labeling even one of these samples is a tedious process in which a human must examine the speech signal and carefully segment it into phonemes. In the field of active learning, the goal is as usual to construct an accurate classifier, but the labels of the data points are initially hidden and there is a charge for each label you want revealed. The hope is that by intelligent adaptive querying, you can get away with significantly fewer labels than you would need in a regular supervised learning framework.
 
Here’s an example. Suppose the data lie on the real line, and the classifiers are simple thresholding functions, H = {h w }: 
  h w (x) = 1 if x > w, and 0 otherwise.

<p>Introduction: What?   Bounds are mathematical formulas relating observations to future error rates assuming that data is drawn independently.  In classical statistics, they are calld confidence intervals. 
 Why?  
  
  Good Judgement . In many applications of learning, it is desirable to know how well the learned predictor works in the future.  This helps you decide if the problem is solved or not. 
  Learning Essence .  The form of some of these bounds helps you understand what the essence of learning is. 
  Algorithm Design .  Some of these bounds suggest, motivate, or even directly imply learning algorithms. 
  
 What We Know Now 
 
There are several families of bounds, based on how information is used.
  
  Testing Bounds . These are methods which use labeled data not used in training to estimate the future error rate.  Examples include the  test set bound ,  progressive validation  also  here  and  here ,  train and test bounds , and cross-validation (but see the  big open problem ).

<p>Introduction: Exploration is one of the big unsolved problems in machine learning. This isn’t for lack of trying—there are many models of exploration which have been analyzed in many different ways by many different groups of people. At some point, it is worthwhile to sit back and see what has been done across these many models.
  
   Reinforcement Learning  (1) . Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on Markov Decision Processes where the next state  s’    is given by a conditional distribution  P(s’|s,a)  given the current state  s  and action  a .  The typical result here is that certain specific algorithms controlling an agent can behave within  e  of optimal for horizon  T  except for  poly(1/e,T,S,A)  “wasted” experiences (with high probability).  This started with  E 3   by  Satinder Singh  and  Michael Kearns .  Sham Kakade’s thesis  has significant discussion. Extensions have typically been of the form “under extra assumptions, we can prove more”, for example  Factored-E 3   and</p><p>5 0.63987005 <a title="143-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-09-Some_NIPS_papers.html">138 hunch net-2005-12-09-Some NIPS papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here is a set of papers that I found interesting (and why).
  
  A PAC-Bayes approach to the Set Covering Machine  improves the set covering machine.  The set covering machine approach is a new way to do classification characterized by a very close connection between theory and algorithm.  At this point, the approach seems to be competing well with SVMs in about all dimensions: similar computational speed, similar accuracy, stronger learning theory guarantees, more general information source (a kernel has strictly more structure than a metric), and more sparsity.  Developing a classification algorithm is not very easy, but the results so far are encouraging. 
  Off-Road Obstacle Avoidance through End-to-End Learning  and  Learning Depth from Single Monocular Images  both effectively showed that depth information can be predicted from camera images (using notably different techniques).  This ability is strongly enabling because cameras are cheap, tiny, light, and potentially provider lo</p><p>6 0.63614488 <a title="143-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-20-The_End_of_the_Beginning_of_Active_Learning.html">432 hunch net-2011-04-20-The End of the Beginning of Active Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Al Gore ‘s  film  and gradually more assertive and thorough science has managed to mostly shift the debate on climate change from “Is it happening?” to “What should be done?”  In that context, it’s worthwhile to think a bit about what can be done within computer science research.
 
There are two things we can think about:
  
  Doing Research  At a cartoon level, computer science research consists of some combination of commuting to&from; work, writing programs, running them on computers, writing papers, and presenting them at conferences.  A typical computer has a power usage on the order of 100 Watts, which works out to 2.4 kiloWatt-hours/day.  Looking up  David MacKay ‘s  reference on power usage per person , it becomes clear that this is a relatively minor part of the lifestyle, although it could become substantial if many more computers are required.  Much larger costs are associated with commuting (which is in common with many people) and attending conferences.  Since local commuti</p><p>2 0.89498037 <a title="143-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-07-06-Idempotent-capable_Predictors.html">253 hunch net-2007-07-06-Idempotent-capable Predictors</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One way to distinguish different learning algorithms is by their ability or inability to easily use an input variable as the predicted output.  This is desirable for at least two reasons:
  
  Modularity   If we want to build complex learning systems via reuse of a subsystem, it’s important to have compatible I/O. 
  “Prior” knowledge   Machine learning is often applied in situations where we do have some knowledge of what the right solution is, often in the form of an existing system.  In such situations, it’s good to start with a learning algorithm that can be at least as good as any existing system. 
  
When doing classification, most learning algorithms can do this.  For example, a decision tree can split on a feature, and then classify.  The real differences come up when we attempt regression.  Many of the algorithms we know and commonly use are not idempotent predictors.
  
 Logistic regressors can not be idempotent, because all input features are mapped through a nonlinearity.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.89204001 <a title="143-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-27-Automated_Labeling.html">143 hunch net-2005-12-27-Automated Labeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the common trends in machine learning has been an emphasis on the use of unlabeled data.  The argument goes something like “there aren’t many labeled web pages out there, but there are a  huge  number of web pages, so we must find a way to take advantage of them.”  There are several standard approaches for doing this:
  
  Unsupervised Learning .  You use only unlabeled data.  In a typical application, you cluster the data and hope that the clusters somehow correspond to what you care about. 
 Semisupervised Learning.  You use both unlabeled and labeled data to build a predictor.  The unlabeled data influences the learned predictor in some way. 
  Active Learning . You have unlabeled data and access to a labeling oracle.  You interactively choose which examples to label so as to optimize prediction accuracy. 
  
It seems there is a fourth approach worth serious investigation—automated labeling.  The approach goes as follows:

<p>Introduction: The  NYAS ML symposium  grew again this year to 170 participants, despite the need to outsmart or otherwise tunnel through  a crowd .  
 
Perhaps the most distinct talk was by Bob Bell on various aspects of the  Netflix prize  competition.  I also enjoyed several student posters including  Matt Hoffman ‘s cool examples of blind source separation for music.
 
I’m somewhat surprised how much the workshop has grown, as it is now comparable in size to a small conference, although in style more similar to a workshop.  At some point as an event grows, it becomes owned by the community rather than the organizers, so if anyone has suggestions on improving it, speak up and be heard.</p><p>5 0.78203225 <a title="143-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-25-Turing%26%238217%3Bs_Club_for_Machine_Learning.html">286 hunch net-2008-01-25-Turing&#8217;s Club for Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don’t fully understand the impact of computation, as demonstrated by a lack of  big-O  analysis of new learning algorithms.  This is important—some current active research programs are fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are directly motivated by it.  When considering a learning algorithm, I think about the following questions:
  
 How does the learning algorithm scale with the number of examples  m ?  Any algorithm using all of the data is at least  O(m) , but in many cases this is  O(m 2 )  (naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown (k-means or many other optimization algorithms).  The unknown case is very common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn’t convergent or simply that the amount of computation isn’t controlled. 
 The above question can also be asked for test cases.  In some applications, test-time performance is of great importance. 
 How does the algorithm scale with the number of</p><p>6 0.77671635 <a title="143-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-14-What_Learning_Theory_might_do.html">95 hunch net-2005-07-14-What Learning Theory might do</a></p>

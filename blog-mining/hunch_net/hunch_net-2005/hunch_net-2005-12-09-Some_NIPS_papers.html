<p>Introduction: One of the common trends in machine learning has been an emphasis on the use
of unlabeled data. The argument goes something like "there aren't many labeled
web pages out there, but there are ahugenumber of web pages, so we must find a
way to take advantage of them." There are several standard approaches for
doing this:Unsupervised Learning. You use only unlabeled data. In a typical
application, you cluster the data and hope that the clusters somehow
correspond to what you care about.Semisupervised Learning. You use both
unlabeled and labeled data to build a predictor. The unlabeled data influences
the learned predictor in some way.Active Learning. You have unlabeled data and
access to a labeling oracle. You interactively choose which examples to label
so as to optimize prediction accuracy.It seems there is a fourth approach
worth serious investigation--automated labeling. The approach goes as

others.Build a predictor.U</p><p>3 0.10580519 <a title="138-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-10-A_Deep_Belief_Net_Learning_Problem.html">227 hunch net-2007-01-10-A Deep Belief Net Learning Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Deep learning" is used to describe learning architectures which have
significant depth (as a circuit).One claimis that shallow architectures (one
or two layers) can not concisely represent some functions while a circuit with
more depth can concisely represent these same functions. Proving lower bounds
on the size of a circuit is substantially harder than upper bounds (which are
constructive), but some results are known.Luca Trevisan'sclass notesdetail how
XOR is not concisely representable by "AC0â&euro;ł (= constant depth unbounded fan-in
AND, OR, NOT gates). This doesn't quite prove that depth is necessary for the
representations commonly used in learning (such as a thresholded weighted
sum), but it is strongly suggestive that this is so.Examples like this are a
bit disheartening because existing algorithms for deep learning (deep belief
nets, gradient descent on deep neural networks, and a perhaps decision trees
depending on who you ask) can't learn XOR very easily. Evidence so far

<p>Introduction: There weretwopapersat ICML presenting learning algorithms for acontextual
bandit-style setting, where the loss for all labels is not known, but the loss
for one label is known. (The first might require aexploration
scavengingviewpoint to understand if the experimental assignment was
nonrandom.) I strongly approve of these papers and further work in this
setting and its variants, because I expect it to become more important than
supervised learning. As a quick review, we are thinking about situations where
repeatedly:The world reveals feature values (aka context information).A policy
chooses an action.The world provides a reward.Sometimes this is done in an
online fashion where the policy can change based on immediate feedback and
sometimes it's done in a batch setting where many samples are collected before
the policy can change. If you haven't spent time thinking about the setting,
you might want to because there are many natural applications.I'm going to
pick on the Banditron paper (</p><p>5 0.1041488 <a title="138-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-19-Choice_of_Metrics.html">259 hunch net-2007-08-19-Choice of Metrics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we judge success in Machine Learning? AsAaronnotes, the best way is to
use the loss imposed on you by the world. This turns out to be infeasible
sometimes for various reasons. The ones I've seen are:The learned prediction
is used in some complicated process that does not give the feedback necessary
to understand the prediction's impact on the loss.The prediction is used by
some other system which expects some semantics to the predicted value. This is
similar to the previous example, except that the issue is design modularity
rather than engineering modularity.The correct loss function is simply unknown
(and perhaps unknowable, except by experimentation).In these situations, it's
unclear what metric for evaluation should be chosen. This post has some design
advice for this murkier case. I'm using the word "metric" here to distinguish
the fact that we are considering methods forevaluatingpredictive systems
rather than a loss imposed by the real world or a loss which is optimized b</p><p>6 0.094757296 <a title="138-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-25-Turing%26%238217%3Bs_Club_for_Machine_Learning.html">286 hunch net-2008-01-25-Turing&#8217;s Club for Machine Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Manifold based dimension-reduction algorithms share the following general
outline.Given: a metricd()and a set of pointsSConstruct a graph with a point
in every node and every edge connecting to the node of one of thek-nearest
neighbors. Associate with the edge a weight which is the distance between the
points in the connected nodes.Digest the graph. This might include computing
the shortest path between all points or figuring out how to linearly
interpolate the point from it's neighbors.Find a set of points in a low
dimensional space which preserve the digested properties.Examples include LLE,
Isomap (which I worked on), Hessian-LLE, SDE, and many others. The hope with
these algorithms is that they can recover the low dimensional structure of
point sets in high dimensional spaces. Many of them can be shown to work in
interesting ways producing various compelling pictures.Despite doing some
early work in this direction, I suffer from a motivational problem: Why do we

<p>Introduction: One standard approach for clustering data with a set of gaussians is using EM.
Roughly speaking, you pick a set ofkrandom guassians and then use alternating
expectation maximization to (hopefully) find a set of guassians that "explain"
the data well. This process is difficult to work with because EM can become
"stuck" in local optima. There are various hacks like "rerun withtdifferent
random starting points".One cool observation is that this can often be solved
via other algorithm which donotsuffer from local optima. This is an
earlypaperwhich shows this. Ravi Kannan presented anew papershowing this is
possible in a much more adaptive setting.A very rough summary of these papers
is that by projecting into a lower dimensional space, it is computationally
tractable to pick out the gross structure of the data. It is unclear how well
these algorithms work in practice, but they might be effective, especially if
used as a subroutine of the form:Project to low dimensional space.Pick out

<p>Introduction: Several talks seem potentially interesting to ML folks at this year's SODA
.Maria-Florina Balcan,Avrim Blum, andAnupam Gupta,Approximate Clustering
without the Approximation. This paper gives reasonable algorithms with
provable approximation guarantees for k-median and other notions of
clustering. It's conceptually interesting, because it's the second example
I've seen where NP hardness is subverted by changing the problem definition
subtle but reasonable way. Essentially, they show that if any near-
approximation to an optimal solution is good, then it's computationally easy
to find a near-optimal solution. This subtle shift bears serious thought. A
similar one occurred inour ranking paperwith respect to minimum feedback
arcset. With two known examples, it suggests that many more NP-complete
problems might be finessed into irrelevance in this style.Yury

<p>Introduction: Here is a set of papers that I found interesting (and why).A PAC-Bayes
approach to the Set Covering Machineimproves the set covering machine. The set
covering machine approach is a new way to do classification characterized by a
very close connection between theory and algorithm. At this point, the
approach seems to be competing well with SVMs in about all dimensions: similar
computational speed, similar accuracy, stronger learning theory guarantees,
more general information source (a kernel has strictly more structure than a
metric), and more sparsity. Developing a classification algorithm is not very
easy, but the results so far are encouraging.Off-Road Obstacle Avoidance
through End-to-End LearningandLearning Depth from Single Monocular Imagesboth
effectively showed that depth information can be predicted from camera images
(using notably different techniques). This ability is strongly enabling
because cameras are cheap, tiny, light, and potentially provider longer range

<p>Introduction: Say we have two random variablesX,Ywith mutual informationI(X,Y). Let's say we
want to represent them with a bayes net of the formX< -M->Y, such that the
entropy ofMequals the mutual information, i.e.H(M)=I(X,Y). Intuitively, we
would like our hidden state to be as simple as possible (entropy wise). The
data processing inequality means thatH(M)>=I(X,Y), so the mutual information
is a lower bound on how simple theMcould be. Furthermore, if such a
construction existed it would have a nice coding interpretation -- one could
jointly codeXandYby first coding the mutual information, then codingXwith this
mutual info (withoutY) and codingYwith this mutual info (withoutX).It turns
out that such a construction does not exist in general (ThxAlina
Beygelzimerfor a counterexample! see below for the sketch).What are the
implications of this? Well, it's hard for me to say, but it does suggest to me
that the 'generative' model philosophy might be burdened with a harder
modeling task. If all we care a</p><p>3 0.99867648 <a title="138-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-27-Watchword%3A_Supervised_Learning.html">299 hunch net-2008-04-27-Watchword: Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently discovered that supervised learning is a controversial term. The
two definitions are:Known LossSupervised learning corresponds to the situation
where you have unlabeled examples plus knowledge of the loss of each possible
predicted choice. This is the definition I'm familiar and comfortable with.
One reason to prefer this definition is that the analysis of sample complexity
for this class of learning problems are all pretty similar.Any kind of
signalSupervised learning corresponds to the situation where you have
unlabeled examples plus any source of side information about what the right
choice is. This notion of supervised learning seems to subsume reinforcement
learning, which makes me uncomfortable, because it means there are two words
for the same class. This also means there isn't a convenient word to describe
the first definition.Reviews suggest there are people who are dedicated to the
second definition out there, so it can be important to discriminate which you
mean.</p><p>4 0.99860626 <a title="138-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-06-Don%26%238217%3Bt_mix_the_solution_into_the_problem.html">67 hunch net-2005-05-06-Don&#8217;t mix the solution into the problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common defect of many pieces of research is defining the problem in terms of
the solution. Here are some examples in learning:"The learning problem is
finding a good seperating hyperplane.""The goal of learning is to
minimize(y-p)2+ C w2wherey= the observation,p= the prediction andw= a
parameter vector."Defining thelossfunction to be the one that your algorithm
optimizes rather than the one imposed by the world.The fundamental reason why
this is a defect is that it creates artificial boundaries to problem solution.
Artificial boundaries lead to the possibility of being blind-sided. For
example, someone committing (1) or (2) above might find themselves themselves
surprised to find a decision tree working well on a problem. Example (3) might
result in someone else solving a learning problem better for real world
purposes, even if it's worse with respect to the algorithm optimization. This
defect should be avoided so as to not artificially limit your learning
kungfu.The way to avoid thi</p><p>5 0.99839818 <a title="138-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-26-ML_Symposium_and_Strata-Hadoop_World.html">475 hunch net-2012-10-26-ML Symposium and Strata-Hadoop World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheNew York ML symposiumwas last Friday. There were 303 registrations, up a
bit fromlast year. I particularly enjoyed talks byBill Freemanon vision and
ML,Jon Lenchneron strategy in Jeopardy, andTara N. Sainathand Brian Kingsbury
ondeep learning for speech recognition. If anyone has suggestions or thoughts
for next year, please speak up.I also attendedStrata + Hadoop Worldfor the
first time. This is primarily a trade conference rather than an academic
conference, but I found it pretty interesting as a first time attendee. This
is ground zero for theBig databuzzword, and I see now why. It's about data,
and the word "big" is so ambiguous that everyone can lay claim to it. There
were essentially zero academic talks. Instead, the focus was on war stories,
product announcements, and education. The general level of education is much
lower--explaining Machine Learning to the SQL educated is the primary
operating point. Nevertheless that's happening, and the fact that machine
learning is consi</p><p>6 0.99830723 <a title="138-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-15-IJCAI_is_out_of_season.html">184 hunch net-2006-06-15-IJCAI is out of season</a></p>

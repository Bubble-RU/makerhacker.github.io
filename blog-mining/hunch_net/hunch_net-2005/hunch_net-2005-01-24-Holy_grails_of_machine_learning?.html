<p>Introduction: I've had serious conversations with several people who believe that the theory
in machine learning is "only useful for getting papers published". That's a
compelling statement, as I've seen many papers where the algorithm clearly
came first, and the theoretical justification for it came second, purely as a
perceived means to improve the chance of publication.Naturally, I disagree and
believe that learning theory has much more substantial applications.Even in
core learning algorithm design, I've found learning theory to be useful,
although it's application is more subtle than many realize. The most
straightforward applications can fail, because (as expectation suggests) worst
case bounds tend to be loose in practice (*). In my experience, considering
learning theory when designing an algorithm has two important effects in
practice:It can help make your algorithm behave right at a crude level of
analysis, leaving finer details to tuning or common sense. The best example I
have of this is</p><p>5 0.13390914 <a title="2-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-04-Why_Reinforcement_Learning_is_Important.html">100 hunch net-2005-08-04-Why Reinforcement Learning is Important</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One prescription for solving a problem well is:State the problem, in the
simplest way possible. In particular, this statement should involve no
contamination with or anticipation of the solution.Think about solutions to
the stated problem.Stating a problem in a succinct and crisp manner tends to
invite a simple elegant solution. When a problem can not be stated succinctly,
we wonder if the problem is even understood. (And when a problem is not
understood, we wonder if a solution can be meaningful.)Reinforcement learning
does step (1) well. It provides a clean simple language to state general AI
problems. In reinforcement learning there is a set of actionsA, a set of
observationsO, and a rewardr. The reinforcement learning problem, in general,
is defined by a conditional measureD( o, r | (o,r,a)*)which produces an
observationoand a rewardrgiven a history(o,r,a)*. The goal in reinforcement
learning is to find a policypi:(o,r,a)*-> amapping histories to actions so as
to maximize (or appro</p><p>6 0.12450973 <a title="2-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks_for_RL.html">148 hunch net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks for RL</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, Drew Bagnell and I started theRLBench projectto setup a
suite of reinforcement learning benchmark problems. We haven't been able to
touch it (due to lack of time) for a year so the project is on hold. Luckily,
there are several other projects such asCLSquareandRL-Gluewith a similar goal,
and we strongly endorse their continued development.I would like to explain
why, especially in the context of criticism of other learning benchmarks. For
example, sometimes theUCI Machine Learning Repositoryis criticized. There are
two criticisms I know of:Learning algorithms have overfit to the problems in
the repository. It is easy to imagine a mechanism for this happening
unintentionally. Strong evidence of this would be provided by learning
algorithms which perform great on the UCI machine learning repository but very
badly (relative to other learning algorithms) on non-UCI learning problems. I
have seen little evidence of this but it remains a point of concern. There is

<p>Introduction: All branches of machine learning seem to be united in the idea of using data
to make predictions. However, people disagree to some extent about what this
means. One way to categorize these different goals is on an axis, where one
extreme is "tools to aid a human in using data to do prediction" and the other
extreme is "tools to do prediction with no human intervention". Here is my
estimate of where various elements of machine learning fall on this
spectrum.Human NecessaryHuman partially necessaryHuman unnecessaryClustering,
data visualizationBayesian Learning, Probabilistic Models, Graphical
ModelsKernel Learning (SVM's, etc..)Decision Trees?Reinforcement LearningThe
exact position of each element is of course debatable. My reasoning is that
clustering and data visualization are nearly useless for prediction without a
human in the loop. Bayesian/probabilistic models/graphical models generally
require a human to sit and think about what is a good prior/structure. Kernel

<p>Introduction: Every year about now hundreds of applicants apply for a research/teaching job
with the timing governed by the university recruitment schedule. This time,
it's my turn--the hat's in the ring, I am a contender, etcâ&euro;Ś What I have heard
is that this year is good in both directions--both an increased supply and an
increased demand for machine learning expertise.I consider this post a bit of
an abuse as it is neither about general research nor machine learning. Please
forgive me this once.My hope is that I will learn about new places interested
in funding basic research--it's easy to imagine that I have overlooked
possibilities.I am not dogmatic about where I end up in any particular way.
Several earlier posts detail what I think of as a good research environment,
so I will avoid a repeat. A few more details seem important:Application. There

<p>Introduction: This post is about a trick that I learned fromDale Schuurmanswhich has been
repeatedly useful for me over time.The basic trick has to do with importance
weighting for monte carlo integration. Consider the problem of finding:N = Ex
~ Df(x)given samples fromDand knowledge off.Often, we don't have samples
fromDavailable. Instead, we must make do with samples from some other
distributionQ. In that case, we can still often solve the problem, as long as
Q(x) isn't 0 when D(x) is nonzero, using the importance weighting formula:Ex ~
Qf(x) D(x)/Q(x)A basic question is: How many samples fromQare required in
order to estimateNto some precision? In general the convergence rate is not
bounded, becausef(x) D(x)/Q(x)is not bounded given the
assumptions.Nevertheless, there is one special valueQ(x) = f(x) D(x) / Nwhere
the sample complexity turns out to be1, which is typically substantially
better than the sample complexity of the original problem.This observation
underlies the motivation for voluntary</p><p>3 0.93229747 <a title="2-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-11-21-Ben_Taskar_is_gone.html">491 hunch net-2013-11-21-Ben Taskar is gone</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was not as personally close toBenasSam, but the level of tragedy is similar
and I can't help but be greatly saddened by the loss.Variousnewsstorieshave
coverage, but the synopsis is that he had a heart attack on Sunday and is
survived by his wife Anat and daughter Aviv. There is discussion of creating a
memorial fund for them, which I hope comes to fruition, and plan to contribute
to.I will remember Ben as someone who thought carefully and comprehensively
about new ways to do things, then fought hard and successfully for what he
believed in. It is an ideal we strive for, that Ben accomplished.Edit:

<p>Introduction: Let me kick things off by posing this question to ML researchers:What do you
think are some important holy grails of machine learning?For example:- "A
classifier with SVM-level performance but much more scalable"- "Practical
confidence bounds (or learning bounds) for classification"- "A reinforcement
learning algorithm that can handle the ___ problem"- "Understanding
theoretically why ___ works so well in practice"etc.I pose this question
because I believe that when goals are stated explicitly and well (thus
providing clarity as well as opening up the problems to more people), rather
than left implicit, they are likely to be achieved much more quickly. I would
also like to know more about the internal goals of the various machine
learning sub-areas (theory, kernel methods, graphical models, reinforcement
learning, etc) as stated by people in these respective areas. This could help
people cross sub-areas.</p><p>5 0.82806808 <a title="2-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-28-A_question_of_quantification.html">133 hunch net-2005-11-28-A question of quantification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about methods for phrasing and think about the scope of some theorems
in learning theory. The basic claim is that there are several different ways
of quantifying the scope which sound different yet are essentially the
same.For all sequences of examples. This is the standard quantification in
online learning analysis. Standard theorems would say something like "for all
sequences of predictions by experts, the algorithm A will perform almost as
well as the best expert."For all training sets. This is the standard
quantification for boosting analysis such asadaboostormulticlass
boosting.Standard theorems have the form "for all training sets the error rate
inequalities … hold".For all distributions over examples. This is the one that
we have been using for reductions analysis. Standard theorem statements have
the form "For all distributions over examples, the error rate inequalities …
hold".It is not quite true that each of these is equivalent. For example, in
the online learning se</p><p>6 0.82075173 <a title="2-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-03-23-Interactive_Machine_Learning.html">293 hunch net-2008-03-23-Interactive Machine Learning</a></p>

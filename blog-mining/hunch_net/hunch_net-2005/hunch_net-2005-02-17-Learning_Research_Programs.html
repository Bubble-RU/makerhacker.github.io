<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is a field with an impressively diverse set of reseearch
styles. Understanding this may be important in appreciating what you see at a
conference.Engineering. How can I solve this problem? People in the
engineering research style try to solve hard problems directly by any means
available and then describe how they did it. This is typical of problem-
specific conferences and communities.Scientific. What are the principles for
solving learning problems? People in this research style test techniques on
many different problems. This is fairly common at ICML and NIPS.Mathematical.
How can the learning problem be mathematically understood? People in this
research style prove theorems with implications for learning but often do not
implement (or test algorithms). COLT is a typical conference for this
style.Many people manage to cross these styles, and that is often
beneficial.Whenver we list a set of alternative, it becomes natural to think
"which is best?" In this case of le</p><p>3 0.14432612 <a title="21-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>

are triannual now, betweenNIPS,AIStat, andICML. This has not always been the
case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started
with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April
conference.However, the first claim is not quite correct. NIPS and AIStat have
few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other
conferences accepting machine learning related papers. SinceJoelleand I are

<p>Introduction: The health ofCOLT(Conference on Learning Theory or Computational Learning
Theory depending on who you ask) has been questioned over the last few years.
Low points for the conference occurred whenEuroCOLTmerged with COLT in 2001,
and the attendance at the 2002 Sydney COLT fell to a new low. This occurred in
the general context of machine learning conferences rising in both number and
size over the last decade.Any discussion ofwhyCOLT has had difficulties is
inherently controversial as is any story about well-intentioned people making
the wrong decisions. Nevertheless, this may be worth discussing in the hope of
avoiding problems in the future and general understanding. In any such
discussion there is a strong tendency to identify with a conference/community
in a patriotic manner that is detrimental to thinking. Keep in mind that
conferences exist to further research.My understanding (I wasn't around) is
that COLT started as a subcommunity of the computer science theory community.

<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research. They provide many
roles including "announcing research", "meeting people", and "point of
reference". Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: "to what
extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?" This question is
very difficult to answer in any satisfying way. What we can do is compare
details of the process across multiple conferences.CommentsThe average quality
of comments across conferences can vary dramatically. At one extreme, the
tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback. At
the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing
detailed constructive feedback. Detailed feedback can give authors significant
guidance about how to improve research. This is the most subjective
entry.BlindVirtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors
do not know reviewers. Some also providedouble blindreview where reviewers do
not know authors. T</p><p>6 0.13371225 <a title="21-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-04-Health_of_Conferences_Wiki.html">212 hunch net-2006-10-04-Health of Conferences Wiki</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Some of the "sister conference" presentations atAAAIhave been great. Roughly
speaking, the conference organizers asked other conference organizers to come
give a summary of their conference. Many different AI-related conferences
accepted. The presenters typically discuss some of the background and goals of
the conference then mention the results from a few papers they liked. This is
great because it provides a mechanism to get a digested overview of the work
of several thousand researchers--something which is simply available nowhere
else.Based on these presentations, it looks like there is a significant
component of (and opportunity for) applied machine learning inAIIDE,IUI,
andACL.There was also some discussion of having a super-colocation event
similar toFCRC, but centered on AI & Learning. This seems like a fine idea.
The field is fractured across so many different conferences that the mixing of
a supercolocation seems likely helpful for research.</p><p>3 0.6183781 <a title="21-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-04-Health_of_Conferences_Wiki.html">212 hunch net-2006-10-04-Health of Conferences Wiki</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As part of aPASCALproject, the Slovenians have been filming various machine
learning events and placing them on the webhere. This includes, for example,
theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer Schoolas well as a number of other
summer schools, workshops, and conferences.There are some significant caveats
here--for example, I can't access it from Linux. Based upon the webserver
logs, I expect that is a problem for most people--Computer scientists are
particularly nonstandard in their choice of computing platform.Nevertheless,
the core idea here is excellent and details of compatibility can be fixed
later. With modern technology toys, there is no fundamental reason why the
process of announcing new work at a conference should happen only once and
only for the people who could make it to that room in that conference. The
problems solved include:The multitrack vs. single-track debate. ("Sometimes
the single track doesn't interest me" vs. "When it's multitrack I miss good

moment-generating functions, and Taylor approximations. Here's an easier
way.For, letbe the KL divergence between a coin of biasand one of

probability of seeingheads or more, for, is at most. So is the probability of
seeingheads or less, for.Remark:By Pinsker's inequality,.ProofLet's do
thecase; the other is identical.Letbe the distribution overinduced by a coin
of bias, and likewisefor a coin of bias. Letbe the set of all sequences

<p>Introduction: After amajor financial crisis, there is much discussion about howfinance has
become a casinogambling with other's money, keeping the winnings, and walking
away when the money is lost.When thinking about financial reform, all the many
losers in the above scenario are apt to take the view that this activity
should be completely, or nearly completely curtailed. But, a more thoughtful
view is that sometimes there is a real sense in which there are right and
wrong decisions, and we as a society would really prefer that the people most
likely to make right decisions are making them. A crucial question then is:
"What is the difference between gambling and rewarding good
prediction?"Wediscussed this before the financial crisis. The cheat-sheet
sketch is that the online learning against an adversary problem, algorithm,
and theorems, provide a good mathematical model for thinking about this
question. What I would like to do here is map this onto various types of
financial transactions. The basic</p><p>same-blog 3 0.88599646 <a title="21-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-17-Learning_Research_Programs.html">21 hunch net-2005-02-17-Learning Research Programs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an attempt to organize the broad research programs related to machine
learning currently underway. This isn't easy--this map is partial, the
categories often overlap, and there are many details left out. Nevertheless,
it is (perhaps) helpful to have some map of what is happening where. The word
'typical' should not be construed narrowly here.Learning TheoryFocuses on
analyzing mathematical models of learning, essentially no experiments. Typical

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference. Since many
people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial
challenge. Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about
preparing a presentation on research.Motivate. Talks which don't start by
describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out.Prioritize. It
is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many
presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much. This is an
easy-to-understand failure mode as it's very natural to want to include
everything. A basic fact is: you can't. Example of this are:Your slides are so
densely full of equations and words that you can't cover them.Your talk runs
over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off.You motor-mouth
through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience
prioritizes in some uncontrolled fashion.The rate of flow of concepts simply
exceeds the infor</p><p>5 0.81896818 <a title="21-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-22-Explicit_Randomization_in_Learning_algorithms.html">219 hunch net-2006-11-22-Explicit Randomization in Learning algorithms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are a number of learning algorithms which explicitly incorporate
randomness into their execution. This includes at amongst others:Neural
Networks. Neural networks use randomization to assign initial
weights.Boltzmann Machines/Deep Belief Networks. Boltzmann machines are
something like a stochastic version of multinode logistic regression. The use
of randomness is more essential in Boltzmann machines, because the predicted
value at test time also uses randomness.Bagging. Bagging is a process where a
learning algorithm is run several different times on several different
datasets, creating a final predictor which makes a majority vote.Policy
descent. Several algorithms in reinforcement learning such asConservative
Policy Iterationuse random bits to create stochastic policies.Experts
algorithms. Randomized weighted majority use random bits as a part of the
prediction process to achieve better theoretical guarantees.A basic question
is: "Should there be explicit randomization in learn</p><p>6 0.80049765 <a title="21-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-08-18-Radford_Neal_starts_a_blog.html">313 hunch net-2008-08-18-Radford Neal starts a blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is about a reductions-related problem that I find mysterious. There
are two kinds of reductions analysis currently under consideration.Error
limiting reductions. Here, the goal is to bound the error rate of the created
classifier in terms of the error rate of the binary classifiers that you
reduce to. A very simple example of this is thaterror correcting output
codeswhere it is possible to prove that for certain codes, the multiclass
error rate is at most 4 * the binary classifier error rate.Regret minimizing
reductions. Here, the goal is to bound theregretof the created classifier in
terms of theregretof the binary classifiers reduced to. The regret is the
error rate minus the minimum error rate. When the learning problem is noisy
the minimum error rate may not be0. An analagous result for reget is that for
aprobabilistic error correcting output code, multiclass regret is at most 4 *
(binary regret)0.5.The use of "regret" is more desirable than the use of error
rates, becaus</p><p>3 0.238757 <a title="14-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-23-Problem%3A_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Classification.html">27 hunch net-2005-02-23-Problem: Reinforcement Learning with Classification</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.BackgroundA
reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there
arekpossible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2
possible labels. On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary
classifier with some error ratee. After subtracting the minimum possible
(Bayes) error rateb, we get a regretr = e - b. ThePECOC(Probabilistic Error
Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regretrimplies
multiclass regret at most4r0.5.The problemThis is not the "rightest" answer.
Consider thek=2case, where we reduce binary to binary. There exists a
reduction (the identity) with the property that regretrimplies regretr. This
is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which
suggests that a better reduction may exist for generalk. For example, we can
not rule out the possibility that a reductionRexists with regret transform

<p>Introduction: Forlearning reductionswe have been concentrating on reducing various complex
learning problems to binary classification. This choice needs to be actively
questioned, because it was not carefully considered.Binary clasification is
learning a classifierc:X -> {0,1}so as to minimize the probability of being
wrong,Prx,y~D(c(x)y).The primary alternative candidate seems to be squared
error regression. In squared error regression, you learn a regressors:X ->
[0,1]so as to minimize squared error,Ex,y~D(s(x)-y)2.It is difficult to judge
one primitive against another. The judgement must at least partially be made
on nontheoretical grounds because (essentially) we are evaluating a choice
between two axioms/assumptions.These two primitives are significantly related.
Classification can be reduced to regression in the obvious way: you use the
regressor to predictD(y=1|x), then threshold at0.5. For this simple reduction
a squared error regret ofrimplies a classification regret of at mostr0.5.

<p>Introduction: Several recent papers have shown that SVM-like optimizations can be used to
handle several large family loss functions.This is a good thing because it is
implausible that thelossfunction imposed by the world can not be taken into
account in the process of solving a prediction problem. Even people used to
the hard-coreBayesianapproach to learning often note that some approximations
are almost inevitable in specifying apriorand/or integrating to achieve a
posterior. Taking into account how the system will be evaluated can allow both
computational effort and design effort to be focused so as to improve
performance.A current laundry list of capabilities includes:2002multiclass SVM

<p>Introduction: A type of prediction problem is specified by the type of samples produced by a
data source (Example:X x {0,1},X x [0,1],X x {1,2,3,4,5}, etc…) and a loss
function (0/1 loss, squared error loss, cost sensitive losses, etc…). For
simplicity, we'll assume that all losses have a minimum of zero.For this post,
we can think of a learning reduction asA mappingRfrom samples of one
typeT(like multiclass classification) to another typeT'(like binary
classification).A mappingQfrom predictors for typeT'to predictors for
typeT.The simplest sort of learning reduction is a "loss reduction". The idea
in a loss reduction is to prove a statement of the form:TheoremFor all base
predictorsb, for all distributionsDover examples of typeT:E(x,y) ~
DLT(y,Q(b,x)) <= f(E(x',y')~R(D)LT'(y',b(x')))HereLTis the loss for the
typeTproblem andLT'is the loss for the typeT'problem. Also,R(D)is the
distribution over samples induced by first drawing fromDand then mapping the
sample viaR. The functionf()is the loss transf</p><p>5 0.74532598 <a title="14-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-15-The_Efficient_Robust_Conditional_Probability_Estimation_Problem.html">391 hunch net-2010-03-15-The Efficient Robust Conditional Probability Estimation Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm offering a reward of $1000 for a solution to this problem. This joins
thecross validation problemwhich I'm offering a$500 rewardfor. I believe both
of these problems are hard but plausibly solvable, and plausibly with a
solution of substantial practical value. While it's unlikely these rewards are
worth your time on an hourly wage basis, the recognition for solving them
definitely should beThe ProblemThe problem is finding a general, robust, and
efficient mechanism for estimating a conditional probabilityP(y|x)where
robustness and efficiency are measured using techniques from learning
reductions.In particular, suppose we have access to a binary regression

one for testing. Training information is specified asB(x',y')wherex'is a

<p>Introduction: As usualICML 2007will be hosting aworkshop programto be held this year on June
24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you
propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I'd like
to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal
deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for
details.Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group
of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your
choosing. I've always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so
large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a
workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to
potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-
conference on a particular ML sub-area. Hope to see some interesting proposals
rolling in.</p><p>2 0.94577807 <a title="14-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-05-10-Aggregation_of_estimators%2C_sparsity_in_high_dimension_and_computational_feasibility.html">398 hunch net-2010-05-10-Aggregation of estimators, sparsity in high dimension and computational feasibility</a></p>
<p>Introduction: (I'm channeling forJean-Yves Audiberthere, with some minor tweaking for
clarity.)SinceNemirovski'sSaint Flour lecture notes, numerous researchers have
studied the following problem in least squares regression: predict as well
as(MS) the best of d given functions (like in prediction with expert advice;
model = finite set of d functions)(C) the best convex combination of these
functions (i.e., model = convex hull of the d functions)(L) the best linear
combination of these functions (i.e., model = linear span of the d
functions)It is now well known (see, e.g., Sacha Tsybakov's COLT'03 paper)
that these tasks can be achieved since there exist estimators having an excess
risk of order (log d)/n for (MS), min( sqrt((log d)/n), d/n ) for (C) and d/n
for (L), where n is the training set size. Here, "risk" is amount of extra
loss per example which may be suffered due to the choice of random sample.The
practical use of these results seems rather limited to trivial statements

<p>Introduction: What?Reductions are machines which turn solvers for one problem into solvers
for another problem.Why?Reductions are useful for several reasons.Laziness.
Reducing a problem to classification make at least 10 learning algorithms
available to solve a problem. Inventing 10 learning algorithms is quite a bit
of work. Similarly, programming a reduction is often trivial, while
programming a learning algorithm is a great deal of work.Crystallization. The
problems we often want to solve in learning are worst-case-impossible, but
average case feasible. By reducing all problems onto one or a few primitives,
we can fine tune these primitives to perform well on real-world problems with
greater precision due to the greater number of problems to validate
on.Theoretical Organization. By studying what reductions are easy vs. hard vs.
impossible, we can learn which problems are roughly equivalent in difficulty
and which are much harder.What we know now.Typesafe reductions. In the
beginning, there was th</p><p>4 0.88626742 <a title="14-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Future_Publication_Models_%40_NIPS.html">382 hunch net-2009-12-09-Future Publication Models @ NIPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yesterday, there was a discussion aboutfuture publication models at
NIPS.YannandZoubinhave specific detailed proposals which I'll add links to
when I get them (Yann's proposalandZoubin's proposal).What struck me about the
discussion is that there are many simultaneous concerns as well as many
simultaneous proposals, which makes it difficult to keep all the distinctions
straight in a verbal conversation. It also seemed like people were serious
enough about this that we may see some real movement. Certainly, my personal
experience motivates that as I'veposted many timesabout the substantial flaws
in our review process, including some very poor personal experiences.Concerns
include the following:(Several) Reviewers are overloaded, boosting the noise
in decision making.(Yann) A new system should run with as little built-in
delay and friction to the process of research as possible.(Hanna
Wallach(updated)) Double-blind review is particularly important for people who

<p>Introduction: Muthuinvited me to the workshop onalgorithms in the field, with the goal of
providing a sense of where near-term research should go. When the time came
though, I bargained for a post instead, which provides a chance for many other
people to comment.There are several things I didn't fully understand when I
went to Yahoo! about 5 years ago. I'd like to repeat them as people in
academia may not yet understand them intuitively.Almost all the big impact
algorithms operate in pseudo-linear or better time. Think about caching,
hashing, sorting, filtering, etcâ&euro;Ś and you have a sense of what some of the
most heavily used algorithms are. This matters quite a bit to Machine Learning
research, because people often work with superlinear time algorithms and
languages. Two very common examples of this are graphical models, where
inference is often a superlinear operation--think about then2dependence on the
number of states in aHidden Markov Modeland KernelizedSupport Vector

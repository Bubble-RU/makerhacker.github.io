<p>Introduction: I expect the  NIPS 2006 workshops  to be quite interesting, and recommend going for anyone interested in machine learning research.

<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.  This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.  Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention.  Roughly speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your interest.  The main conference program consists of elements related to someoneâ&euro;&trade;s interest (which is rarely your own).  Workshops are more about doing research while conferences are more about presenting research.  
 
Several conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due shortly.
  
 
  ICML workshops  
 Due April 1 
 
 
  IJCAI workshops  
 Deadlines Vary 
 
 
 KDD workshops 
 Not yet finalized 
 
  
Anyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops and see if any are of interest.  (If none are, then maybe you should organize one next year.)</p><p>4 0.21652168 <a title="71-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-23-Why_Workshop%3F.html">285 hunch net-2008-01-23-Why Workshop?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I second the  call for workshops at ICML/COLT/UAI .
 
 Several   times   before , details of why and how to run a  workshop have been mentioned.  
 
There is a simple reason to prefer workshops here: attendance.  The Helsinki colocation has placed workshops  directly between ICML and COLT/UAI , which is optimal for getting attendees from any conference.  In addition,  last year ICML had relatively few workshops  and NIPS workshops were overloaded.  In addition to  those that happened  a similar number were rejected.  The overload has strange consequences—for example,  the best attended workshop  wasn’t an official NIPS workshop.  Aside from intrinsic interest, the Deep Learning workshop benefited greatly from being off schedule.</p><p>5 0.21342845 <a title="71-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-23-ICML_2009_Workshops_%28and_Tutorials%29.html">379 hunch net-2009-11-23-ICML 2009 Workshops (and Tutorials)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m the  workshops chair  for  ICML  this year.  As such, I would like to personally encourage people to consider running a workshop.
 
My general view of workshops is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research directions—some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various problems.  My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops often come off much better than expected in the end.  Submissions are due January 18, two weeks before papers.
 
Similarly,  Ben Taskar  is looking for good  tutorials , which is complementary.  Workshops are about exploring a subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught essence, a vital part of the research process.  Tutorials are due February 13, two weeks after papers.</p><p>6 0.20875052 <a title="71-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-15-NIPS_workshops_extended_to_3_days.html">266 hunch net-2007-10-15-NIPS workshops extended to 3 days</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The  New York ML symposium  was last Friday.  There were 303 registrations, up a bit from  last year .  I particularly enjoyed talks by  Bill Freeman  on vision and ML,  Jon Lenchner  on strategy in Jeopardy, and  Tara N. Sainath  and Brian Kingsbury on  deep learning for speech recognition .  If anyone has suggestions or thoughts for next year, please speak up.
 
I also attended  Strata + Hadoop World  for the first time.  This is primarily a trade conference rather than an academic conference, but I found it pretty interesting as a first time attendee.  This is ground zero for the  Big data  buzzword, and I see now why.  It’s about data, and the word “big” is so ambiguous that everyone can lay claim to it.  There were essentially zero academic talks.  Instead, the focus was on war stories, product announcements, and education.  The general level of education is much lower—explaining Machine Learning to the SQL educated is the primary operating point.

Best current results deliver 9.12%  improvement , which is quite close to the 10% goal, yet painfully distant. 
   Ã‚Â   The Netflix Prize breathed new life and excitement into recommender systems research. The competition allowed the wide research community to access a large scale, real life dataset. Beyond this, the competition changed the rules of the game. Claiming that your nice idea could outperform some mediocre algorithms on some toy dataset is no longer acceptable.

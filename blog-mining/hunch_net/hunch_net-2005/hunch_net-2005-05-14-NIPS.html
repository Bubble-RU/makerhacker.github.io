before the rest of the workshops in Vancouver, BC. Separate registration is
needed, and open.What's happening fundamentally here is that there are too

<p>Introduction: I'm theworkshops chairforICMLthis year. As such, I would like to personally
encourage people to consider running a workshop.My general view of workshops
is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research
directions--some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and
several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various
problems. My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making
them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops
often come off much better than expected in the end. Submissions are due

<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.
This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.
Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance
can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention. Roughly
speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your
interest. The main conference program consists of elements related to
someone's interest (which is rarely your own). Workshops are more about doing
research while conferences are more about presenting research.Several
conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due
shortly.ICML workshopsDue April 1IJCAI workshopsDeadlines VaryKDD workshopsNot
yet finalizedAnyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops
and see if any are of interest. (If none are, then maybe you should organize
one next year.)</p><p>5 0.20830828 <a title="71-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-02-2006_NIPS_workshops.html">216 hunch net-2006-11-02-2006 NIPS workshops</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeckpoints outCOLTregistrationwith a May 13 early registration
deadline. The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs
with a $300 registration fee.ICMLregistrationis also available, at about an x3
higher cost. My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a
larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as
long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference
organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>5 0.61090446 <a title="71-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-24-The_Role_of_Workshops.html">46 hunch net-2005-03-24-The Role of Workshops</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm visiting Beijing for thePao-Lu Hsu Statistics Conferenceon Machine
Learning.I had several discussions about the state of Chinese research. Given
the large population and economy, you might expect substantial research--more
than has been observed at international conferences. The fundamental problem
seems to be theCultural Revolutionwhich lobotimized higher education, and the
research associated with it. There has been a process of slow recovery since
then, which has begun to be felt in the research world via increased
participation in international conferences and (now) conferences in China.The
amount of effort going into construction in Beijing is very impressive--people
are literally building a skyscraper at night outside the window of the hotel
I'm staying at (and this is not unusual). If a small fraction of this effort
is later focused onto supporting research, the effect could be very
substantial. General growth in China's research portfolio should be expected.</p><p>5 0.73655415 <a title="71-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-11-More_NIPS_Papers.html">139 hunch net-2005-12-11-More NIPS Papers</a></p>

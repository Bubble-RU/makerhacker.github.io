<p>Introduction: At thelast ICML,Tom Dietterichasked me to look into systems for commenting on
papers. I've been slow getting to this, but it's relevant now.The essential
observation is that we now have many tools for online collaboration, but they
are not yet much used in academic research. If we can find the right way to
use them, then perhaps great things might happen, with extra kudos to the
first conference that manages to really create an online community. Various
conferences have been poking at this. For example,UAI has setup a wiki, COLT
hasstarted usingJoomla, with some dynamic content, and AAAI has been setting
up a "student blog". Similarly,Dinoj Surendransetup a twiki for theChicago
Machine Learning Summer School, which was quite useful for coordinating events
and other things.I believe the most important thing is a willingness to
experiment. A good place to start seems to be enhancing existing conference
websites. For example, theICML 2007 papers pageis basically only useful via
grep. A mu</p><p>4 0.10157287 <a title="122-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-
issues for the moment.The number of posts is a bit over 20.The number of
people speaking up in discussions is about 10.The number of people viewing the
site is somewhat more than 100.I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many
things.Many of thepotential useshaven't been realized. This is partly a matter
of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no
open problems because it's hard to give them up), and partly a matter of
tradition. In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get
everything perfectly right before presentation. This is somewhat contradictory
to the nature of making many posts, and it's definitely contradictory to the
idea of doing "public research". If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must
be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to
continue experimenting, I'm going to use the next week as "open problems
week".Spam is a problem.</p><p>5 0.092917562 <a title="122-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-26-Efficient_Reinforcement_Learning_in_MDPs.html">328 hunch net-2008-11-26-Efficient Reinforcement Learning in MDPs</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Andrej Bauer has setup aMathematics and ComputationBlog. As a first step he
has tried to address the persistent and annoying problem of math on the web.
As a basic tool for precisely stating and transfering understanding of
technical subjects, mathematics is very necessary. Despite this necessity,
every mechanism for expressing mathematics on the web seems unnaturally
clumsy. Here are some of the methods and their drawbacks:MathMLThis was
supposed to be the answer, but it has two severe drawbacks: "Internet
Explorer" doesn't read it and the language is an example of push-XML-to-the-
limit which no one would ever consider writing in. (In contrast, html is easy
to write in.) It's also very annoying that math fonts must be installed
independent of the browser, even for mozilla based browsers.Create inline
images. This has several big drawbacks: font size is fixed for all viewers,
you can't cut & paste inside the images, and you can't hyperlink from (say)
symbol to definition.Math Worldis</p><p>5 0.49111453 <a title="122-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Maybe it's too early to call, but with four separate Neural Network sessions
at this year'sICML, it looks like Neural Networks are making a comeback. Here
are my highlights of these sessions. In general, my feeling is that these
papers both demystify deep learning and show its broader applicability.The
first observation I made is that the once disreputable "Neural" nomenclature
is being used againin lieu of"deep learning". Maybe it's because Adam Coates
et al. showed that single layer networks can work surprisingly well.An
Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning,Adam
Coates,Honglak Lee,Andrew Y. Ng(AISTATS 2011)The Importance of Encoding Versus
Training with Sparse Coding and Vector Quantization,Adam Coates,Andrew Y.

<p>Introduction: Manifold based dimension-reduction algorithms share the following general
outline.Given: a metricd()and a set of pointsSConstruct a graph with a point
in every node and every edge connecting to the node of one of thek-nearest
neighbors. Associate with the edge a weight which is the distance between the
points in the connected nodes.Digest the graph. This might include computing
the shortest path between all points or figuring out how to linearly
interpolate the point from it's neighbors.Find a set of points in a low
dimensional space which preserve the digested properties.Examples include LLE,
Isomap (which I worked on), Hessian-LLE, SDE, and many others. The hope with
these algorithms is that they can recover the low dimensional structure of
point sets in high dimensional spaces. Many of them can be shown to work in
interesting ways producing various compelling pictures.Despite doing some
early work in this direction, I suffer from a motivational problem: Why do we

<p>Introduction: Ron Bekkermaninitiated an effort to create anedited book on parallel machine
learningthatMishaand I have been helping with. The breadth of efforts to
parallelize machine learning surprised me: I was only aware of a small
fraction initially.This put us in a unique position, with knowledge of a wide
array of different efforts, so it is natural to put together asurvey tutorial
on the subject of parallel learningforKDD, tomorrow. This tutorial
isnotlimited to the book itself however, as several interesting new algorithms
have come out since we started inviting chapters.This tutorial should interest
anyone trying to use machine learning on significant quantities of data,
anyone interested in developing algorithms for such, and of course who has
bragging rights to the fastest learning algorithm on planet earth(Also note
the Modeling with Hadoop tutorial just before ours which deals with one way of
trying to speed up learning algorithms. We have almost no overlap.)</p><p>6 0.26508653 <a title="122-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-17-Going_all_the_Way%2C_Sometimes.html">42 hunch net-2005-03-17-Going all the Way, Sometimes</a></p>

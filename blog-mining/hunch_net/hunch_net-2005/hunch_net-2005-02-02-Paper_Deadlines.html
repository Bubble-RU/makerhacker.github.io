<p>Introduction: After a  major financial crisis , there is much discussion about how  finance has become a casino  gambling with other’s money, keeping the winnings, and walking away when the money is lost.  
 
When thinking about financial reform, all the many losers in the above scenario are apt to take the view that this activity should be completely, or nearly completely curtailed.  But, a more thoughtful view is that sometimes there is a real sense in which there are right and wrong decisions, and we as a society would really prefer that the people most likely to make right decisions are making them.  A crucial question then is: “What is the  difference between gambling and rewarding good prediction?”
 
We  discussed this before the financial crisis . The cheat-sheet sketch is that the online learning against an adversary problem, algorithm, and theorems, provide a good mathematical model for thinking about this question.  What I would like to do here is map this onto various types of financial t</p><p>3 0.38168514 <a title="11-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-21-Problem%3A_Cross_Validation.html">26 hunch net-2005-02-21-Problem: Cross Validation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The essential problem here is the large gap between experimental observation and theoretical understanding.
 
 Method   K-fold cross validation is a commonly used technique which takes a set of  m  examples and partitions them into  K  sets (“folds”) of size  m/K .  For each fold, a classifier is trained on the other folds and then test on the fold.
 
 Problem   Assume only independent samples.  Derive a classifier from the K classifiers with a small bound on the true error rate.
 
 Past Work  (I’ll add more as I remember/learn.)
  
  Devroye , Rogers, and Wagner analyzed cross validation and found algorithm specific bounds.  Not all of this is online, but here is one  paper .  
  Michael Kearns  and  Dana Ron   analyzed cross validation  and found that under additional stability assumptions the bound for the classifier which learns on all the data is not much worse than for a test set of size  m/K  .  
  Avrim Blum,   Adam Kalai , and  myself   analyzed cross validation  and found tha</p><p>4 0.3624692 <a title="11-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-29-Deadline_Season.html">145 hunch net-2005-12-29-Deadline Season</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Hal ,  Daniel , and I have been working on the algorithm  Searn  for structured prediction.  This was just conditionally accepted and then rejected from ICML, and we were quite surprised.  By any reasonable criteria, it seems this is an interesting algorithm.
  
 Prediction Performance: Searn performed better than any other algorithm on all the problems we tested against using the same feature set.  This is true even using the numbers reported by authors in their papers. 
 Theoretical underpinning.  Searn is a reduction which comes with a reduction guarantee: the good performance on a base classifiers implies good performance for the overall system.  No other theorem of this type has been made for other structured prediction algorithms, as far as we know. 
 Speed. Searn has no problem handling much larger datasets than other algorithms we tested against. 
 Simplicity.  Given code for a binary classifier and a problem-specific search algorithm, only a few tens of lines are necessary to</p><p>6 0.32999006 <a title="11-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-05-Site_Update.html">107 hunch net-2005-09-05-Site Update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A loss function is some function which, for any example, takes a prediction
and the correct prediction, and determines how much loss is incurred. (People
sometimes attempt to optimize functions of more than one example such as "area
under the ROC curve" or "harmonic mean of precision and recall".) Typically we
try to find predictors that minimize loss.There seems to be a strong dichotomy
between two views of what "loss" means in learning.Loss is determined by the
problem.Loss is a part of the specification of the learning problem. Examples
of problems specified by the loss function include "binary classification",
"multiclass classification", "importance weighted classification",
"l2regression", etcâ&euro;Ś This is the decision theory view of what loss means, and
the view that I prefer.Loss is determined by the solution.To solve a problem,
you optimize some particular loss functionnotgiven by the problem. Examples of
these loss functions are "hinge loss" (for SVMs), "log loss" (common in

<p>Introduction: COLT has acall for open problemsdue March 21. I encourage anyone with a
specifiable open problem to write it down and send it in. Just the effort of
specifying an open problem precisely and concisely has been very helpful for
my own solutions, and there is a substantial chance others will solve it. To
increase the chance someone will take it up, you can even put a bounty on the
solution. (Perhaps I should raise the$500 bountyon theK-fold cross-validation

<p>Introduction: As usualICML 2007will be hosting aworkshop programto be held this year on June
24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you
propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I'd like
to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal
deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for
details.Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group
of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your
choosing. I've always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so
large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a
workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to
potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-
conference on a particular ML sub-area. Hope to see some interesting proposals
rolling in.</p><p>6 0.033059116 <a title="11-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-07-Prediction_Competitions.html">129 hunch net-2005-11-07-Prediction Competitions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joel Predd   mentioned  “ Antilearning ” by  Adam Kowalczyk , which is interesting from a foundational intuitions viewpoint.
 
There is a pervasive intuition that “nearby things tend to have the same label”.  This intuition is instantiated in SVMs, nearest neighbor classifiers, decision trees, and neural networks.  It turns out there are natural problems where this intuition is opposite of the truth.

<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on this  post  and some of the previous  problems/research directions  about where learning theory might make large strides.  
  
  Why theory?   The essential reason for theory is “intuition extension”.  A very good applied learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the best computer algorithms for solving that problem.  A very good theory can take the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion.  To do this, we take these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:
 
 Explains the basic intuitions. 
 Makes new testable predictions about how to learn. 
 Succeeds in so learning. 
 

This is “intuition extension”: taking what we have learned somewhere else and applying it in new domains.  It is fundamentally useful to everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving problems.

 
  Where next for learning theory?  I like the a</p><p>3 0.089617945 <a title="32-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-05-The_design_of_a_computing_cluster.html">128 hunch net-2005-11-05-The design of a computing cluster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied machine learning using current technology.  We just built a small one at TTI so this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design choices.
  
  Architecture   There are several architectural choices.
 
 AMD Athlon64 based system.  This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck.  Maximum RAM is typically 2-3GB. 
 AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB of RAM.  The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type. 
 Intel PIV or Xeon based system.  The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the above 2.  Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit hotter and be a bit more expensive. 
 Dual core chips.  Both Intel and AMD have chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them. 

In the end, we decided to go with option (2).  Roughly speaking,</p><p>4 0.063432254 <a title="32-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-21-Problem%3A_Cross_Validation.html">26 hunch net-2005-02-21-Problem: Cross Validation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The essential problem here is the large gap between experimental observation and theoretical understanding.
 
 Method   K-fold cross validation is a commonly used technique which takes a set of  m  examples and partitions them into  K  sets (“folds”) of size  m/K .  For each fold, a classifier is trained on the other folds and then test on the fold.
 
 Problem   Assume only independent samples.  Derive a classifier from the K classifiers with a small bound on the true error rate.
 
 Past Work  (I’ll add more as I remember/learn.)
  
  Devroye , Rogers, and Wagner analyzed cross validation and found algorithm specific bounds.  Not all of this is online, but here is one  paper .  
  Michael Kearns  and  Dana Ron   analyzed cross validation  and found that under additional stability assumptions the bound for the classifier which learns on all the data is not much worse than for a test set of size  m/K  .

<p>Introduction: Rich Caruana ,  Alexandru Niculescu , Geoff Crew, and Alex Ksikes have done  a lot of empirical testing  which shows that  using all methods to make a prediction  is more powerful than using any single method.  This is in rough agreement with the Bayesian way of solving problems, but based upon a different (essentially empirical) motivation.  A rough summary is:
  
 Take all of {decision trees, boosted decision trees, bagged decision trees, boosted decision stumps, K nearest neighbors, neural networks, SVM} with all reasonable parameter settings. 
 Run the methods on each problem of 8 problems with a large test set, calibrating margins using either  sigmoid fitting  or  isotonic regression . 
 For each loss of {accuracy, area under the ROC curve, cross entropy, squared error, etc…} evaluate the average performance of the method. 
  
A series of conclusions can be drawn from the observations.

<p>Introduction: Here is a set of papers that I found interesting (and why).
  
  A PAC-Bayes approach to the Set Covering Machine  improves the set covering machine.  The set covering machine approach is a new way to do classification characterized by a very close connection between theory and algorithm.  At this point, the approach seems to be competing well with SVMs in about all dimensions: similar computational speed, similar accuracy, stronger learning theory guarantees, more general information source (a kernel has strictly more structure than a metric), and more sparsity.  Developing a classification algorithm is not very easy, but the results so far are encouraging. 
  Off-Road Obstacle Avoidance through End-to-End Learning  and  Learning Depth from Single Monocular Images  both effectively showed that depth information can be predicted from camera images (using notably different techniques).  This ability is strongly enabling because cameras are cheap, tiny, light, and potentially provider lo</p><p>4 0.48808232 <a title="32-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-24-The_Humanloop_Spectrum_of_Machine_Learning.html">3 hunch net-2005-01-24-The Humanloop Spectrum of Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: All branches of machine learning seem to be united in the idea of using data to make predictions.  However, people disagree to some extent about what this means.  One way to categorize these different goals is on an axis, where one extreme is “tools to aid a human in using data to do prediction” and the other extreme is “tools to do prediction with no human intervention”.  Here is my estimate of where various elements of machine learning fall on this spectrum.
  
 
 Human Necessary 
  
 Human partially necessary 
  
 Human unnecessary 
 
 
 Clustering, data visualization 
 Bayesian Learning, Probabilistic Models, Graphical Models 
 Kernel Learning (SVM’s, etc..) 
 Decision Trees? 
 Reinforcement Learning 
 
  
The exact position of each element is of course debatable.  My reasoning is that clustering and data visualization are nearly useless for prediction without a human in the loop.  Bayesian/probabilistic models/graphical models generally require a human to sit and think about what</p><p>5 0.48708025 <a title="32-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-18-Binomial_Weighting.html">43 hunch net-2005-03-18-Binomial Weighting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Suppose we have a set of classifiers  c  making binary predictions from an input  x  and we see examples in an online fashion.  In particular, we repeatedly see an unlabeled example  x , make a prediction  y’ (possibly based on the classifiers  c ), and then see the correct label  y .  
 
When one of these classifiers is perfect, there is a great algorithm available: predict according to the majority vote over every classifier  consistent with every previous example.  This is called the Halving algorithm.  It makes at most  log 2  |c|  mistakes since on any mistake, at least half of the classifiers are eliminated.
 
Obviously, we can’t generally hope that the there exists a classifier which never errs.  The  Binomial Weighting algorithm  is an elegant technique allowing a variant Halving algorithm  to cope with errors by creating a set of virtual classifiers for every classifier which occasionally disagree with the original classifier.  The Halving algorithm on this set of virtual clas</p><p>6 0.47943535 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-11-Interesting_Neural_Network_Papers_at_ICML_2011.html">438 hunch net-2011-07-11-Interesting Neural Network Papers at ICML 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joel Predd   mentioned  “ Antilearning ” by  Adam Kowalczyk , which is interesting from a foundational intuitions viewpoint.
 
There is a pervasive intuition that “nearby things tend to have the same label”.  This intuition is instantiated in SVMs, nearest neighbor classifiers, decision trees, and neural networks.  It turns out there are natural problems where this intuition is opposite of the truth.
 
One natural situation where this occurs is in competition.   For example, when  Intel  fails to meet its earnings estimate, is this evidence that  AMD  is doing badly also?  Or evidence that AMD is doing well?
 
This violation of the proximity intuition means that when the number of examples is few,  negating  a classifier which attempts to exploit proximity can provide predictive power (thus, the term “antilearning”).</p><p>4 0.76858008 <a title="32-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-11-More_NIPS_Papers.html">139 hunch net-2005-12-11-More NIPS Papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Let me add to John’s post with a few of my own favourites 
from this year’s conference. First, let me say that 
Sanjoy’s talk,  Coarse Sample Complexity Bounds for Active 
Learning  was also one of my favourites, as was the 
  
Forgettron paper .
 

I also really enjoyed the last third of 
 Christos’  talk 
on the complexity of finding Nash equilibria.

 

And, speaking of tagging, I think 
the U.Mass Citeseer replacement system 
 Rexa  from the demo track is very cool.

 

Finally, let me add my recommendations for specific papers:
  
  Z. Ghahramani, K. Heller:  Bayesian Sets  
[no preprint] 
(A very elegant probabilistic information retrieval style model 
of which objects are “most like” a given subset of objects.)
 
 T. Griffiths, Z. Ghahramani:  Infinite Latent Feature Models and 
the Indian Buffet Process  
[  
preprint ] 
(A Dirichlet style prior over infinite binary matrices with 
beautiful exchangeability properties.)

<p>Introduction: Apparently, the company  Spock  is setting up a  $50k entity resolution challenge .  $50k is much less than the Netflix challenge, but it’s effectively the same as Netflix until  someone reaches 10% .  It’s also nice that the Spock challenge has a short duration.  The (visible) test set is of size 25k and the training set has size 75k.</p><p>6 0.74529272 <a title="32-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-28-Yet_more_nips_thoughts.html">144 hunch net-2005-12-28-Yet more nips thoughts</a></p>

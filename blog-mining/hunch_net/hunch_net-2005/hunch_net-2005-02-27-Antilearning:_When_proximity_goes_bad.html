<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on thispostand some of the previousproblems/research
directionsabout where learning theory might make large strides.Why theory?The
essential reason for theory is "intuition extension". A very good applied
learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the
best computer algorithms for solving that problem. A very good theory can take
the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend
them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion. To do this, we take
these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:Explains the
basic intuitions.Makes new testable predictions about how to learn.Succeeds in
so learning.This is "intuition extension": taking what we have learned
somewhere else and applying it in new domains. It is fundamentally useful to
everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving
problems.Where next for learning theory?I like the analogy with physics. Back

<p>Introduction: Since learning is far from an exact science, it's good to pay attention to
basic intuitions of applied learning. Here are a few I've
collected.IntegrationIn Bayesian learning, the posterior is computed by an
integral, and the optimal thing to do is to predict according to this
integral. This phenomena seems to be far more general. Bagging, Boosting,
SVMs, and Neural Networks all take advantage of this idea to some extent. The
phenomena is more general: you can average over many differentclassification
predictorsto improve performance.
Sources:Zoubin,CaruanaDifferentiationDifferent pieces of an average should
differentiate to achieve good performance by different methods. This is know
as the 'symmetry breaking' problem for neural networks, and it's why weights
are initialized randomly. Boosting explicitly attempts to achieve good
differentiation by creating new, different, learning problems. Sources:Yann

<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple. Viewed
representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear
separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or
perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural
networks or kernelized SVMs). Should we go beyond this, and start using "deep"
representations?What is deep learning?Intuitively, deep learning is about
learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the
input (observed) features.Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be
rather difficult. Consider the following cases:SVM with Gaussian Kernel. This
is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can't
succinctly represent certain decision surfaces. One ofYann LeCun's examples is
recognizing objects based on pixel values. An SVM will need a new support
vector for each significantly different background. Since the number of
distinct backgrounds i</p><p>5 0.067362763 <a title="32-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-27-Interesting_things_at_NIPS_2009.html">385 hunch net-2009-12-27-Interesting things at NIPS 2009</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several papers at NIPS caught my attention.Elad HazanandSatyen Kale,Online
Submodular OptimizationThey define an algorithm for online optimization of
submodular functions with regret guarantees. This places submodular
optimization roughly on par with online convex optimization as tractable
settings for online learning.Elad HazanandSatyen KaleOn Stochastic and Worst-
Case Models of Investing. At it's core, this is yet another example of
modifying worst-case online learning to deal with variance, but the
application to financial models is particularly cool and it seems plausibly
superior other common approaches for financial modeling.Mark Palatucci,Dean
Pomerlau,Tom Mitchell, andGeoff HintonZero Shot Learning with Semantic Output
CodesThe goal here is predicting a label in a multiclass supervised setting
where the label never occurs in the training data. They have some basic
analysis and also a nice application to FMRI brain reading.Shobha

<p>Introduction: All branches of machine learning seem to be united in the idea of using data
to make predictions. However, people disagree to some extent about what this
means. One way to categorize these different goals is on an axis, where one
extreme is "tools to aid a human in using data to do prediction" and the other
extreme is "tools to do prediction with no human intervention". Here is my
estimate of where various elements of machine learning fall on this
spectrum.Human NecessaryHuman partially necessaryHuman unnecessaryClustering,
data visualizationBayesian Learning, Probabilistic Models, Graphical
ModelsKernel Learning (SVM's, etc..)Decision Trees?Reinforcement LearningThe
exact position of each element is of course debatable. My reasoning is that
clustering and data visualization are nearly useless for prediction without a
human in the loop. Bayesian/probabilistic models/graphical models generally
require a human to sit and think about what is a good prior/structure. Kernel

<p>Introduction: Rich Caruana,Alexandru Niculescu, Geoff Crew, and Alex Ksikes have donea lot
of empirical testingwhich shows thatusing all methods to make a predictionis
more powerful than using any single method. This is in rough agreement with
the Bayesian way of solving problems, but based upon a different (essentially
empirical) motivation. A rough summary is:Take all of {decision trees, boosted
decision trees, bagged decision trees, boosted decision stumps, K nearest
neighbors, neural networks, SVM} with all reasonable parameter settings.Run
the methods on each problem of 8 problems with a large test set, calibrating
margins using eithersigmoid fittingorisotonic regression.For each loss of
{accuracy, area under the ROC curve, cross entropy, squared error, etcâ&euro;Ś}
evaluate the average performance of the method.A series of conclusions can be
drawn from the observations.(Calibrated) boosted decision trees appear to
perform best, in general although support vector machines and neural networks

that's cool. But the created binary problems seem unintuitive. I'm not sure
the decision tree can solve them.TheoOh? Is your problem a decision

IID assumption I can tell you how many samples you need.PatIID? The data is
definitely not IID.TheoOh dear.PatCan we get back to the choice of ECOC? I
suspect we need to build it dynamically in response to which subsets of the
labels are empirically separable from each other.TheoOk. What do you know
about your problem?PatNot much. My friend just gave me the dataset.TheoThen,

truth.One natural situation where this occurs is in competition. For example,
whenIntelfails to meet its earnings estimate, is this evidence thatAMDis doing
badly also? Or evidence that AMD is doing well?This violation of the proximity
intuition means that when the number of examples is few,negatinga classifier
which attempts to exploit proximity can provide predictive power (thus, the
term "antilearning").</p><p>2 0.90820009 <a title="32-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-04-Fall_ML_Conferences.html">316 hunch net-2008-09-04-Fall ML Conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Mark Reidhas stepped up and created acomment system for ICML paperswhichGreger
Lindenhas tightly integrated.My understanding is that Mark spent quite a bit
of time on the details, and there are some cool features like working latex
math mode. This is an excellent chance for the ICML community to experiment
with making ICML year-round, so I hope it works out. Please do consider
experimenting with it.</p><p>4 0.77629453 <a title="32-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-02-27-The_Stats_Handicap.html">290 hunch net-2008-02-27-The Stats Handicap</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Graduating students in Statistics appear to be at a substantial handicap
compared to graduating students in Machine Learning, despite being in
substantially overlapping subjects.The problem seems to be cultural.
Statistics comes from a mathematics background which emphasizes large
publications slowly published under review at journals. Machine Learning comes
from a Computer Science background which emphasizes quick publishing at
reviewed conferences. This has a number of implications:Graduating statistics
PhDs often have 0-2 publications while graduating machine learning PhDs might
have 5-15.Graduating ML students have had a chance for others to build on
their work. Stats students have had no such chance.Graduating ML students have
attended a number of conferences and presented their work, giving them a
chance to meet people. Stats students have had fewer chances of this sort.In
short, Stats students have had relatively few chances to distinguish
themselves and are heavily reliant on t</p><p>5 0.70856392 <a title="32-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-14-Interesting_Papers_at_COLT_2007.html">247 hunch net-2007-06-14-Interesting Papers at COLT 2007</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are two papers that seem particularly interesting at this year's
COLT.Gilles BlanchardandFranÃƒÂ§ois Fleuret,Occam's Hammer. When we are
interested in very tight bounds on the true error rate of a classifier, it is
tempting to use a PAC-Bayes bound which can (empirically) bequite tight. A
disadvantage of the PAC-Bayes bound is that it applies to a classifier which
is randomized over a set of base classifiers rather than a single classifier.
This paper shows that a similar bound can be proved which holds for a single
classifier drawn from the set. The ability to safely use a single classifier
is very nice. This technique applies generically to any base bound, so it has
other applications covered in the paper.Adam Tauman Kalai.Learning Nested
Halfspaces and Uphill Decision Trees. Classification PAC-learning, where you
prove that any problem amongst some set is polytime learnable with respect to
any distribution over the inputXis extraordinarily challenging as judged by

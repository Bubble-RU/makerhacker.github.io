<p>Introduction: The 201314 isNew York Machine Learning Symposiumis finally happening on March
28th at theNew York Academy of Science. Every invited speaker interests me
personally. They are:Rayid Ghani(Chief Scientist at Obama 2012)Brian
Kingsbury(Speech Recognition @ IBM)Jorge Nocedal(who did LBFGS)We've been
somewhat disorganized in advertising this. As a consequence, anyone who has
not submitted an abstract but would like to do so may send one directly to me
(jl@hunch.net title NYASMLS) by Friday March 14. I will forward them to the
rest of the committee for consideration.</p><p>2 <a title="hunch_net-2014-493" href="./hunch_net-2014/hunch_net-2014-02-16-Metacademy%3A_a_package_manager_for_knowledge.html">hunch net-2014-02-16-Metacademy: a package manager for knowledge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In recent years, there’s been an explosion of free educational resources that
make high-level knowledge and skills accessible to an ever-wider group of
people. In your own field, you probably have a good idea of where to look for
the answer to any particular question. But outside your areas of expertise,
sifting through textbooks, Wikipedia articles, research papers, and online
lectures can be bewildering (unless you’re fortunate enough to have a
knowledgeable colleague to consult). What are the key concepts in the field,
how do they relate to each other, which ones should you learn, and where
should you learn them?Courses are a major vehicle for packaging educational
materials for a broad audience. The trouble is that they’re typically meant to
be consumed linearly, regardless of your specific background or goals. Also,
unless thousands of other people have had the same background and learning
goals, there may not even be a course that fits your needs. Recently, we

<p>Introduction: At NIPS I'm giving atutorial on Learning to Interact. In essence this is about
dealing with causality in a contextual bandit framework. Relative toprevious
tutorials, I'll be covering several new results that changed my understanding
of the nature of the problem. Note thatJudea PearlandElias Bareinboimhave
atutorial on causality. This might appear similar, but is quite different in
practice. Pearl and Bareinboim's tutorial will be about the general concepts
while mine will be about total mastery of the simplest nontrivial case,
including code. Luckily, they have the right order. I recommend going to bothI
also just released version 7.4 ofVowpal Wabbit. When I was a frustrated
learning theorist, I did not understand why people were not using learning
reductions to solve problems. I've been slowly discovering why with VW, and
addressing the issues. One of the issues is that machine learning itself was
not automatic enough, while another is that creating a very low overhead
process for do</p><p>4 <a title="hunch_net-2013-491" href="./hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-11-21-Ben_Taskar_is_gone.html">hunch net-2013-11-21-Ben Taskar is gone</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I was not as personally close toBenasSam, but the level of tragedy is similar
and I can't help but be greatly saddened by the loss.Variousnewsstorieshave
coverage, but the synopsis is that he had a heart attack on Sunday and is
survived by his wife Anat and daughter Aviv. There is discussion of creating a
memorial fund for them, which I hope comes to fruition, and plan to contribute
to.I will remember Ben as someone who thought carefully and comprehensively
about new ways to do things, then fought hard and successfully for what he
believed in. It is an ideal we strive for, that Ben accomplished.Edit:

<p>Introduction: Several strong graduates are on the job market this year.Alekh Agarwalmade
themost scalable public learning algorithmas an intern two years ago. He has a
deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning as well as the
ability and will to make things happen programming-wise. I've been privileged
to have Alekh visiting me in NY where he will be sorely missed.John
DuchicreatedAdagradwhich is a commonly helpful improvement over online
gradient descent that is seeing wide adoption, including inVowpal Wabbit. He
has a similarly deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning with
significant industry experience atGoogle. Alekh and John have often coauthored
together.Stephane Rossvisited me a year ago over the summer, implementing many
new algorithms and working out the firstscale free online update rulewhich is
now the default in Vowpal Wabbit. Stephane isnoton the market--Google robbed
the cradle successfullyI'm sure that he will do great things.Anna

<p>Introduction: There will be no New York ML Symposium this year. The core issue is thatNYASis
disorganized by people leaving, pushing back the date, with the current
candidate a spring symposium on March 28.Gunnarand I were outvoted here--we
were gung ho on organizing a fall symposium, but the rest of the committee
wants to wait.In some good news, most of theICML 2012 videoshave been restored
from a deep backup.</p><p>7 <a title="hunch_net-2013-488" href="./hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-08-31-Extreme_Classification_workshop_at_NIPS.html">hunch net-2013-08-31-Extreme Classification workshop at NIPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Manikand I are organizing theextreme classificationworkshop at NIPS this year.
We have a number of good speakers lined up, but I would further encourage
anyone working in the area to submit an abstract by October 9. I believe this
is an idea whose time has now come.The NIPS website doesn't have other
workshops listed yet, but I expect several others to be of significant
interest.</p><p>8 <a title="hunch_net-2013-487" href="./hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-07-24-ICML_2012_videos_lost.html">hunch net-2013-07-24-ICML 2012 videos lost</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A big ouch--all the videos for ICML 2012 were lost in a shuffle. Rajnish sends
the below, but if anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated.
----------------------------------------------------Sincere apologies to ICML
community for loosing 2012 archived videosWhat happened: In order to publish
2013 videos, we decided to move 2012 videos to another server. We have a
weekly backup service from the provider but after removing the videos from the
current server, when we tried to retrieve the 2012 videos from backup service,
the backup did not work because of provider-specific requirements that we had
ignored while removing the data from previous server.What are we doing about
this: At this point, we are still looking into raw footage to find if we can
retrieve some of the videos, but following are the steps we are taking to make
sure this does not happen again in future:(1) We are going to create a channel
on Vimeo (and potentially on YouTube) and we will publish there the p-in-p-</p><p>9 <a title="hunch_net-2013-486" href="./hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-07-10-Thoughts_on_Artificial_Intelligence.html">hunch net-2013-07-10-Thoughts on Artificial Intelligence</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is a (near) transcript of a talk that I gave at theICML 2013
Workshop on Peer Review and Publishing Models. Although there's aPDF available
on my website, I've chosen to post a slightly modified version here as well in
order to better facilitate discussion.Disclaimers and ContextI want to start
with a couple of disclaimers and some context.First, I want to point out that
although I've read a lot about double-blind review, this isn't my research
area and the research discussed in this post is not my own. As a result, I
probably can't answer super detailed questions about these studies.I also want
to note that I'm not opposed to open peer review -- I was a free and open
source software developer for over ten years and I care a great deal about
openness and transparency. Rather, my motivation in writing this post is
simply to create awareness of and to initiate discussion about the benefits of
double-blind review.Lastly, and most importantly, I think it's essential to

Gradient descent is currently untrendy in the machine learning community, but there remains a large number of people using gradient descent on neural networks or other architectures from when it was trendy in the early 1990s.  There are three problems with gradient descent.
  
 Gradient descent does not necessarily produce easily reproduced results.  Typical algorithms start with “set the initial parameters to small random values”.

<p>Introduction: The  Exponentiated Gradient  algorithm by  Manfred Warmuth  and  Jyrki Kivinen  came out just as I was starting graduate school, so I missed it both at a conference and in class.  It’s a fine algorithm which has a remarkable theoretical statement accompanying it.
 
The essential statement holds in the “online learning with an adversary” setting.  Initially, there are of set of  n  weights, which might have values  (1/n,…,1/n) , (or any other values from a probability distribution).  Everything happens in a round-by-round fashion.  On each round, the following happens:
  
 The world reveals a set of features  x in {0,1} n  .  In the online learning with an adversary literature, the features are called “experts” and thought of as subpredictors, but this interpretation isn’t necessary—you can just use feature values as experts (or maybe the feature value and the negation of the feature value as two experts).

<p>Introduction: The term “boosting” comes from the idea of using a meta-algorithm which takes “weak” learners (that may be able to only barely predict slightly better than random) and turn them into strongly capable learners (which predict very well).    Adaboost  in 1995 was the first widely used (and useful) boosting algorithm, although there were theoretical boosting algorithms floating around since 1990 (see the bottom of  this page ).
 
Since then, many different interpretations of why boosting works have arisen.  There is significant discussion about these different views in the  annals of statistics , including a  response  by  Yoav Freund  and  Robert Schapire .
 
I believe there is a great deal of value to be found in the original view of boosting (meta-algorithm for creating a strong learner from a weak learner).  This is not a claim that one particular viewpoint obviates the value of all others, but rather that no other viewpoint seems to really capture important properties.

<p>Introduction: One of the basic observations from the  atomic learning workshop  is that gradient-based optimization is pervasive.   For example, at least 7 (of 12) speakers used the word ‘gradient’ in their talk and several others may be approximating a gradient.  The essential useful quality of a gradient is that it decouples local updates from global optimization.  Restated: Given a gradient, we can determine how to change individual parameters of the system so as to improve overall performance.
 
It’s easy to feel depressed about this and think “nothing has happened”, but that appears untrue.  Many of the talks were about clever techniques for computing gradients where your calculus textbook breaks down.
  
 Sometimes there are clever approximations of the gradient. ( Simon Osindero ) 
 Sometimes we can compute constrained gradients via iterated gradient/project steps. ( Ben Taskar ) 
 Sometimes we can compute gradients anyways over mildly nondifferentiable functions. ( Drew Bagnell )

<p>Introduction: I’m not as naturally exuberant as  Muthu   2  or  David  about  CS/Econ  day, but I believe it and  ML day  were certainly successful.
 
At the CS/Econ day, I particularly enjoyed  Toumas Sandholm’s  talk which showed a commanding depth of understanding and application in automated auctions.
 
For the machine learning day, I enjoyed several talks and posters (I better, I helped pick them.).  What stood out to me was number of people attending: 158 registered, a level qualifying as “scramble to find seats”.  My rule of thumb for workshops/conferences is that the number of attendees is often something like the number of submissions.  That isn’t the case here, where there were just 4 invited speakers and 30-or-so posters.  Presumably, the difference is due to a critical mass of Machine Learning interested people in the area and the ease of their attendance.  
 
Are there other areas where a local Machine Learning day would fly?

<p>Introduction: Netflix is  running a contest  to improve recommender prediction systems.   A 10% improvement over their current system yields a $1M prize.  Failing that, the best smaller improvement yields a smaller $50K prize.  This contest looks quite real, and the $50K prize money is almost certainly achievable with a bit of thought.  The contest also comes with a dataset which is apparently 2 orders of magnitude larger than any other public recommendation system datasets.</p><p>4 0.76449442 <a title="167-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-10-Best_Practices_for_Collaboration.html">231 hunch net-2007-02-10-Best Practices for Collaboration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people, especially students, haven’t had an opportunity to collaborate with other researchers.  Collaboration, especially with remote people can be tricky.  Here are some observations of what has worked for me on collaborations involving a few people.
  
  Travel and Discuss  Almost all collaborations start with in-person discussion.  This implies that travel is often necessary.  We can hope that in the future we’ll have better systems for starting collaborations remotely (such as blogs), but we aren’t quite there yet. 
  Enable your collaborator .  A collaboration can fall apart because one collaborator disables another.  This sounds stupid (and it is), but it’s far easier than you might think.
 
  Avoid Duplication .  Discovering that you and a collaborator have been editing the same thing and now need to waste time reconciling changes is annoying.  The best way to avoid this to be explicit about who has write permission to what.  Most of the time, a write lock is held for the e</p><p>5 0.7497201 <a title="167-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-12-Fast_Gradient_Descent.html">111 hunch net-2005-09-12-Fast Gradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nic Schaudolph  has been developing a fast gradient descent algorithm called  Stochastic Meta-Descent  (SMD).
 
Gradient descent is currently untrendy in the machine learning community, but there remains a large number of people using gradient descent on neural networks or other architectures from when it was trendy in the early 1990s.  There are three problems with gradient descent.
  
 Gradient descent does not necessarily produce easily reproduced results.  Typical algorithms start with “set the initial parameters to small random values”. 
 The design of the representation that gradient descent is applied to is often nontrivial.  In particular, knowing exactly how to build a large neural network so that it will perform well requires knowledge which has not been made easily applicable. 
 Gradient descent can be slow.  Obviously, taking infinitesimal steps in the direction of the gradient would take forever, so some finite step size must be used.  What exactly this step size should be</p><p>6 0.44265723 <a title="167-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-23-ICML_2009_Workshops_%28and_Tutorials%29.html">379 hunch net-2009-11-23-ICML 2009 Workshops (and Tutorials)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A language is a set of primitives which can be combined to succesfully create
complex objects. Languages arise in all sorts of situations: mechanical
construction, martial arts, communication, etcâ&euro;Ś Languages appear to be the key
to succesfully creating complex objects--it is difficult to come up with any
convincing example of a complex object which is not built using some language.
Since languages are so crucial to success, it is interesting to organize
various machine learning research programs by language.The most common
language in machine learning are languages for representing the solution to
machine learning. This includes:Bayes Nets and Graphical ModelsA language for
representing probability distributions. The key concept supporting modularity
is conditional independence.Michael Kearnshas been working on extending this
to game theory.Kernelized Linear ClassifiersA language for representing linear

<p>Introduction: At NIPS I'm giving atutorial on Learning to Interact. In essence this is about
dealing with causality in a contextual bandit framework. Relative toprevious
tutorials, I'll be covering several new results that changed my understanding
of the nature of the problem. Note thatJudea PearlandElias Bareinboimhave
atutorial on causality. This might appear similar, but is quite different in
practice. Pearl and Bareinboim's tutorial will be about the general concepts
while mine will be about total mastery of the simplest nontrivial case,
including code. Luckily, they have the right order. I recommend going to bothI
also just released version 7.4 ofVowpal Wabbit. When I was a frustrated
learning theorist, I did not understand why people were not using learning
reductions to solve problems. I've been slowly discovering why with VW, and
addressing the issues. One of the issues is that machine learning itself was
not automatic enough, while another is that creating a very low overhead

<p>Introduction: This is a proposal for a workshop. It may or may not happen depending on the
level of interest. If you are interested, feel free to indicate so (by email
or comments).Description:Assume(*) that any system for solving large difficult
learning problems must decompose into repeated use of basic elements (i.e.
atoms). There are many basic questions which remain:What are the viable basic
elements?What makes a basic element viable?What are the viable principles for
the composition of these basic elements?What are the viable principles for
learning in such systems?What problems can this approach handle?Hal Daume
adds:Can composition of atoms be (semi-) automatically constructed[?]When
atoms are constructed through reductions, is there some notion of the
"naturalness" of the created leaning problems?Other than Markov
fields/graphical models/Bayes nets, is there a good language for representing
atoms and their compositions?The answer to these and related questions remain
unclear to me. A worksh</p><p>6 0.074820973 <a title="166-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-15-Normal_Deviate_and_the_UCSC_Machine_Learning_Summer_School.html">467 hunch net-2012-06-15-Normal Deviate and the UCSC Machine Learning Summer School</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Machine learning algorithms have a much better chance of being widely adopted
if they are implemented in some easy-to-use code. There are several important
concerns associated with machine learning which stress programming languages
on the ease-of-use vs. speed frontier.SpeedThe rate at which data sources are
growing seems to be outstripping the rate at which computational power is
growing, so it is important that we be able to eak out every bit of
computational power. Garbage collected languages (java,ocaml,perlandpython)
often have several issues here.Garbage collection often implies that floating
point numbers are "boxed": every float is represented by a pointer to a float.
Boxing can cause an order of magnitude slowdown because an extra nonlocalized
memory reference is made, and accesses to main memory can are many CPU cycles
long.Garbage collection often implies that considerably more memory is used
than is necessary. This has a variable effect. In some circumstances it
results in</p><p>4 0.57180524 <a title="166-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-22-New_Blog%3A_%5BLowerbounds%2CUpperbounds%5D.html">59 hunch net-2005-04-22-New Blog: [Lowerbounds,Upperbounds]</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Andrej Bauer has setup aMathematics and ComputationBlog. As a first step he
has tried to address the persistent and annoying problem of math on the web.
As a basic tool for precisely stating and transfering understanding of
technical subjects, mathematics is very necessary. Despite this necessity,
every mechanism for expressing mathematics on the web seems unnaturally
clumsy. Here are some of the methods and their drawbacks:MathMLThis was
supposed to be the answer, but it has two severe drawbacks: "Internet
Explorer" doesn't read it and the language is an example of push-XML-to-the-
limit which no one would ever consider writing in. (In contrast, html is easy
to write in.) It's also very annoying that math fonts must be installed
independent of the browser, even for mozilla based browsers.Create inline
images. This has several big drawbacks: font size is fixed for all viewers,
you can't cut & paste inside the images, and you can't hyperlink from (say)
symbol to definition.Math Worldis</p><p>6 0.40867406 <a title="166-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-13-Site_tweak.html">122 hunch net-2005-10-13-Site tweak</a></p>

needed, and open.What's happening fundamentally here is that there are too

<p>Introduction: The DARPA grandchallenge is a big contest for autonomous robot vehicle
driving. It was run once in 2004 for the first time and all teams did badly.
This year was notably different with theStanfordandCMUteams succesfully
completing the course. A number of details arehereandwikipedia has continuing
coverage.A formal winner hasn't been declared yet although Stanford completed
the course quickest.The Stanford and CMU teams deserve a large round of
applause as they have strongly demonstrated the feasibility of autonomous
vehicles.The good news for machine learning is that the Stanford team (at
least) is using some machine learning techniques.</p><p>4 0.77624571 <a title="166-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-30-COLT_2007.html">242 hunch net-2007-04-30-COLT 2007</a></p>

June, 2007, in San Diego, California, as part of the 2007 Federated Computing
Research Conference (FCRC), which includes STOC, Complexity, and EC.The
website for COLT: http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2007/index.htmlThe early
registration deadline is May 11, and the cutoff date for discounted hotel
rates is May 9.Before registering, take note that the fees are substantially
lower for members of ACM and/or SIGACT than for nonmembers. If you've been
contemplating joining either of these two societies (annual dues: $99 for ACM,
$18 for SIGACT), now would be a good time!</p><p>5 0.76085246 <a title="166-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-24-Alex_Smola_starts_a_blog.html">408 hunch net-2010-08-24-Alex Smola starts a blog</a></p>

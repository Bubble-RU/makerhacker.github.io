<p>Introduction: I want to comment on the "Bing copies Google" discussionhere,here, andhere,
because there are data-related issues which the general public may not
understand, and some of the framing seems substantially misleading to me.As a
not-distant-outsider, let me mention the sources of bias I may have. I work
atYahoo!, which has started usingBing. This might predispose me towards Bing,
but on the other hand I'm still at Yahoo!, and have been usingLinuxexclusively
as an OS for many years, including even a couple minor kernel patches. And,on
the gripping hand, I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about the
basicprinciples of incorporating user feedback in machine learning. Also note,
this post is not related to official Yahoo! policy, it's just my personal
view.The issueGoogle engineers inserted synthetic responses to synthetic

relatively little succesful work on combining prediction and search. Given
also that humans typically solve search problems using a number of predictive
heuristics to narrow in on a solution, we might be surprised again. However,

<p>Introduction: Thesecond Netflix prize is canceleddue toprivacy problems. I continue to
believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was
somewhat overstated. I still haven't seen any serious privacy failures on the
scale of theAOL search log release.I expect privacy concerns to continue to be
a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments. The
theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet
in a state where the limits of what's possible are clear let alone how to
achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>5 0.56149268 <a title="200-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-10-Predictive_Search_is_Coming.html">120 hunch net-2005-10-10-Predictive Search is Coming</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Learning reductionstransform a solver of one type of learning problem into a
solver of another type of learning problem. When we analyze these for
robustness we can make statement of the form "ReductionRhas the property that
regretr(or loss) on subproblems of typeAimplies regret at mostf ( r )on the
original problem of typeB".A lower bound for a learning reduction would have
the form "for all reductionsR, there exists a learning problem of typeBand
learning algorithm for problems of typeAwhere regretron induced problems
impliesat leastregretf ( r )forB".The pursuit of lower bounds is often
questionable because, unlike upper bounds, they do not yield practical
algorithms. Nevertheless, they may be helpful as a tool for thinking about
what is learnable and how learnable it is. This has already come
uphereandhere.At the moment, there is no coherent theory of lower bounds for
learning reductions, and we have little understanding of how feasible they are
or which techniques may be useful in</p><p>4 0.32172507 <a title="200-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-27-Watchword%3A_Supervised_Learning.html">299 hunch net-2008-04-27-Watchword: Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently discovered that supervised learning is a controversial term. The
two definitions are:Known LossSupervised learning corresponds to the situation
where you have unlabeled examples plus knowledge of the loss of each possible
predicted choice. This is the definition I'm familiar and comfortable with.
One reason to prefer this definition is that the analysis of sample complexity
for this class of learning problems are all pretty similar.Any kind of
signalSupervised learning corresponds to the situation where you have
unlabeled examples plus any source of side information about what the right
choice is. This notion of supervised learning seems to subsume reinforcement
learning, which makes me uncomfortable, because it means there are two words
for the same class. This also means there isn't a convenient word to describe
the first definition.Reviews suggest there are people who are dedicated to the
second definition out there, so it can be important to discriminate which you
mean.</p><p>5 0.32149279 <a title="200-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-23-On_Coding_via_Mutual_Information_%26%23038%3B_Bayes_Nets.html">150 hunch net-2006-01-23-On Coding via Mutual Information &#038; Bayes Nets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Say we have two random variablesX,Ywith mutual informationI(X,Y). Let's say we
want to represent them with a bayes net of the formX< -M->Y, such that the
entropy ofMequals the mutual information, i.e.H(M)=I(X,Y). Intuitively, we
would like our hidden state to be as simple as possible (entropy wise). The
data processing inequality means thatH(M)>=I(X,Y), so the mutual information
is a lower bound on how simple theMcould be. Furthermore, if such a
construction existed it would have a nice coding interpretation -- one could
jointly codeXandYby first coding the mutual information, then codingXwith this
mutual info (withoutY) and codingYwith this mutual info (withoutX).It turns
out that such a construction does not exist in general (ThxAlina
Beygelzimerfor a counterexample! see below for the sketch).What are the
implications of this? Well, it's hard for me to say, but it does suggest to me
that the 'generative' model philosophy might be burdened with a harder
modeling task. If all we care a</p><p>6 0.3214722 <a title="200-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-26-ML_Symposium_and_Strata-Hadoop_World.html">475 hunch net-2012-10-26-ML Symposium and Strata-Hadoop World</a></p>

<p>Introduction: “Deep learning” is used to describe learning architectures which have significant depth (as a circuit).  
 
 One claim  is that shallow architectures (one or two layers) can not concisely represent some functions while a circuit with more depth can concisely represent these same functions.  Proving lower bounds on the size of a circuit is substantially harder than upper bounds (which are constructive), but some results are known.   Luca Trevisan ‘s  class notes  detail how XOR is not concisely representable by “AC0″ (= constant depth unbounded fan-in AND, OR, NOT gates).  This doesn’t quite prove that depth is necessary for the representations commonly used in learning (such as a thresholded weighted sum), but it is strongly suggestive that this is so.
 
Examples like this are a bit disheartening because existing algorithms for deep learning (deep belief nets, gradient descent on deep neural networks, and a perhaps decision trees depending on who you ask) can’t learn XOR very easily.</p><p>3 0.12219325 <a title="150-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-02-Why_do_people_count_for_learning%3F.html">160 hunch net-2006-03-02-Why do people count for learning?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about a confusion of mine with respect to many commonly used machine learning algorithms.   
 
A simple example where this comes up is Bayes net prediction.  A Bayes net where a directed acyclic graph over a set of nodes where each node is associated with a variable and the edges indicate dependence.  The joint probability distribution over the variables is given by a set of conditional probabilities.  For example, a very simple Bayes net might express: 
 P(A,B,C) = P(A | B,C)P(B)P(C) 
 
What I don’t understand is the mechanism commonly used to estimate  P(A | B, C) .  If we let  N(A,B,C)  be the number of instances of  A,B,C  then people sometimes form an estimate according to: 
  P’(A | B,C) = N(A,B,C) / N /[N(B)/N * N(C)/N] = N(A,B,C) N /[N(B)  N(C)]   
… in other words, people just estimate  P’(A | B,C)  according to observed relative frequencies.  This is a reasonable technique when you have a large number of samples compared to the size space  A x B x C , but it (nat</p><p>4 0.095532604 <a title="150-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-18-It%26%238217%3Bs_MDL_Jim%2C_but_not_as_we_know_it%26%238230%3B%28on_Bayes%2C_MDL_and_consistency%29.html">263 hunch net-2007-09-18-It&#8217;s MDL Jim, but not as we know it&#8230;(on Bayes, MDL and consistency)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have recently completed  a 500+ page-book on MDL , the first comprehensive overview of the field (yes, this is a sneak advertisement    ). 
 Chapter 17  compares MDL to a menagerie of other methods and paradigms for learning and statistics. By far the most time (20 pages) is spent on the relation between MDL and Bayes. My two main points here are:
  
  In sharp contrast to Bayes, MDL is by definition based on designing universal codes for the data relative to some given (parametric or nonparametric) probabilistic model M. By some theorems due to  Andrew Barron , MDL inference  must  therefore be statistically consistent, and it is immune to Bayesian inconsistency results such as those by Diaconis, Freedman and Barron (I explain what I mean by “inconsistency” further below).  Hence, MDL must be different from Bayes!

<p>Introduction: One nice use for this blog is to consider and discuss papers that that have appeared at recent conferences. I really enjoyed Andrew Ng and Sham Kakade’s paper  Online Bounds for Bayesian Algorithms . From the paper:
  

The philosophy taken in the Bayesian methodology is often at odds with 
that in the online learning community…. the online learning setting 
makes rather minimal assumptions on the conditions under which the 
data are being presented to the learner â€”usually, Nature could provide 
examples in an adversarial manner. We study the performance of 
Bayesian algorithms in a more adversarial setting… We provide 
competitive bounds when the cost function is the log loss, and we 
compare our performance to the best model in our model class (as in 
the experts setting).  
  
It’s a very nice analysis of some of my favorite algorithms that all hinges around a beautiful theorem:

<p>Introduction: Compressed Sensing  (CS) is a new framework developed by  Emmanuel Candes ,  Terry Tao  and  David Donoho . To summarize, if you acquire a signal in some basis that is incoherent with the basis in which you know the signal to be sparse in, it is very likely you will be able to reconstruct the signal from these incoherent projections. 
 
Terry Tao, the recent  Fields medalist , does a very nice job at explaining the framework  here . He goes further in the theory description in this  post  where he mentions the central issue of the Uniform Uncertainty Principle. It so happens that random projections are on average incoherent, within the UUP meaning, with most known basis (sines, polynomials, splines, wavelets, curvelets …) and are therefore an ideal basis for Compressed Sensing.

<p>Introduction: This is about a design flaw in several learning algorithms such as the Naive Bayes classifier and Hidden Markov Models.  A number of people are aware of it, but it seems that not everyone is.
 
Several learning systems have the property that they estimate some conditional probabilities  P(event | other events)  either explicitly or implicitly.  Then, at prediction time, these learned probabilities are multiplied together according to some formula to produce a final prediction.  The Naive Bayes classifier for binary data is the simplest of these, so it seems like a good example.  
 
When Naive Bayes is used, a set of probabilities of the form  Pr’(feature i | label)  are estimated via counting statistics and some prior.  Predictions are made according to the label maximizing: 
  Pr’(label) * Product features i  Pr’(feature i | label)  
 
(The  Pr’  notation indicates these are estimated values.)

<p>Introduction: Say we have two random variables  X,Y  with mutual information  I(X,Y) . Let’s say we want to represent them with a bayes net of the form  X< -M->Y , such that the entropy of  M  equals the mutual information, i.e.  H(M)=I(X,Y) . Intuitively, we would like our hidden state to be as simple as possible (entropy wise). The data processing inequality means that  H(M)>=I(X,Y) , so the mutual information is a lower bound on how simple the  M  could be. Furthermore, if such a construction existed it would have a nice coding interpretation — one could jointly code  X  and  Y  by first coding the mutual information, then coding  X  with this mutual info (without  Y ) and coding  Y  with this mutual info (without  X ).
 
It turns out that such a construction does not exist in general (Thx  Alina Beygelzimer  for a counterexample! see below for the sketch).
 
What are the implications of this? Well, it’s hard for me to say, but it does suggest to me that the ‘generative’ model philosophy might be</p><p>2 0.86360782 <a title="150-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-01-Peekaboom.html">99 hunch net-2005-08-01-Peekaboom</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Luis  has released  Peekaboom  a successor to  ESPgame  ( game site ).  The purpose of the game is similar—using the actions of people playing a game to gather data helpful in solving AI.  
 
Peekaboom gathers more detailed, and perhaps more useful, data about vision.  For ESPgame, the byproduct of the game was mutually agreed upon labels for common images.  For Peekaboom, the location of the subimage generating the label is revealed by the game as well.  Given knowledge about what portion of the image is related to a label it may be more feasible learn to recognize the appropriate parts. 
 
There isn’t a dataset yet available for this game as there is for ESPgame, but hopefully a significant number of people will play and we’ll have one to work wtih soon.</p><p>3 0.73756742 <a title="150-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-11-Why_Manifold-Based_Dimension_Reduction_Techniques%3F.html">102 hunch net-2005-08-11-Why Manifold-Based Dimension Reduction Techniques?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Manifold based dimension-reduction algorithms share the following general outline.  
 
Given: a metric  d()  and a set of points  S 
  
 Construct a graph with a point in every node and every edge connecting to the node of one of the  k -nearest neighbors.  Associate with the edge a weight which is the distance between the points in the connected nodes. 
 Digest the graph.  This might include computing the shortest path between all points or figuring out how to linearly interpolate the point from it’s neighbors. 
 Find a set of points in a low dimensional space which preserve the digested properties. 
  
Examples include LLE, Isomap (which I worked on), Hessian-LLE, SDE, and many others.  The hope with these algorithms is that they can recover the low dimensional structure of point sets in high dimensional spaces.  Many of them can be shown to work in interesting ways producing various compelling pictures.

<p>Introduction: Machine Learning is rising in importance because data is being collected for all sorts of tasks where it either wasn’t previously collected, or for tasks that did not previously exist.  While this is great for Machine Learning, it has a downside—the massive data collection which is so useful can also lead to substantial privacy problems.  
 
It’s important to understand that this is a much harder problem than many people appreciate.  The  AOL   data   release  is a good example.  To those doing machine learning, the following strategies might be obvious:
  
 Just delete any names or other obviously personally identifiable information.  The logic here seems to be “if I can’t easily find the person then no one can”.  That doesn’t work as demonstrated by the people who were found circumstantially from the AOL data. 
 … then just hash all the search terms!  The logic here is “if I can’t read it, then no one can”.  It’s also trivially broken by a dictionary attack—just hash all the strings</p><p>5 0.47338447 <a title="150-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-19-Choice_of_Metrics.html">259 hunch net-2007-08-19-Choice of Metrics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How do we judge success in Machine Learning?  As  Aaron   notes , the best way is to use the loss imposed on you by the world.  This turns out to be infeasible sometimes for various reasons.  The ones I’ve seen are:
  
 The learned prediction is used in some complicated process that does not give the feedback necessary to understand the prediction’s impact on the loss.  
 The prediction is used by some other system which expects some semantics to the predicted value.  This is similar to the previous example, except that the issue is design modularity rather than engineering modularity. 
 The correct loss function is simply unknown (and perhaps unknowable, except by experimentation). 
  
In these situations, it’s unclear what metric for evaluation should be chosen.  This post has some design advice for this murkier case.  I’m using the word “metric” here to distinguish the fact that we are considering methods for  evaluating  predictive systems rather than a loss imposed by the real wor</p><p>6 0.46805403 <a title="150-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-07-The_State_of_the_Reduction.html">14 hunch net-2005-02-07-The State of the Reduction</a></p>

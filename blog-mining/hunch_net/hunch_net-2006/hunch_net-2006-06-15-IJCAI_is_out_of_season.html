Reviewer targeting is new this year.  The idea is that many poor decisions happen because the papers go to reviewers who are unqualified, and the hope is that allowing authors to point out who is qualified results in better decisions.  In my experience, this is a reasonable idea to test.
 
Both UAI and COLT are experimenting this year as well with double blind and author feedback, respectively.  Of the two, I believe author feedback is more important, as I’ve seen it make a difference.  However, I still consider double blind reviewing a net wi</p><p>4 0.15693134 <a title="184-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-30-Many_ways_to_Learn_this_summer.html">357 hunch net-2009-05-30-Many ways to Learn this summer</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are at least  3  summer schools related to machine learning this summer.
  
  The first  is at  University of Chicago  June 1-11 organized by  Misha Belkin ,  Partha Niyogi , and   Steve Smale .  Registration is closed for this one, meaning they met their capacity limit.  The format is essentially an extended Tutorial/Workshop.  I was particularly interested to see  Valiant  amongst the speakers.  I’m also presenting Saturday June 6, on logarithmic time prediction. 
  Praveen Srinivasan  points out the second at  Peking University  in Beijing, China, July 20-27.   This one  differs substantially, as it is about vision, machine learning, and their intersection.  The deadline for applications is June 10 or 15.  This is also another example of the growth of research in China, with active support from  NSF . 
 The third one is at  Cambridge , England, August 29-September 10.  It’s in the  MLSS series .

ICML continues to experiment with the reviewing process, although perhaps less so than last year.  
 
The S “sort-of” for COLT is because author feedback occurs only after decisions are made.  
 
KDD is notable for being the most comprehensive in terms of {Tutorials, Workshops, Challenges, Panels, Papers (two tracks), Demos}.  The S for KDD is because there is sometimes author feedback at the decision of the SPC.

<p>Introduction: IJCAI  is running January 6-12 in Hyderabad India rather than a more traditional summer date. (Presumably, this is to avoid melting people in the Indian summer.)
 
The paper deadline(June 23 abstract / June 30 submission) are particularly inconvenient if you attend  COLT  or  ICML .  But on the other hand, itâ&euro;&trade;s a good excuse to visit India.</p><p>3 0.91179532 <a title="184-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-19-CI_Fellows.html">355 hunch net-2009-05-19-CI Fellows</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Lev Reyzin  points out the  CI Fellows Project .  Essentially,  NSF  is funding 60 postdocs in computer science for graduates from a wide array of US places to a wide array of US places.  This is particularly welcome given a tough year for new hires.  I expect some fraction of these postdocs will be in ML.  The time frame is quite short, so those interested should look it over immediately.</p><p>4 0.60835409 <a title="184-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-14-More_NIPS_Papers_II.html">140 hunch net-2005-12-14-More NIPS Papers II</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I thought this was a very good NIPS with many excellent papers. The following are a few NIPS papers which I liked and I hope to study more carefully when I get the chance. The list is not exhaustive and in no particular order…
  
 Preconditioner Approximations for Probabilistic Graphical Models. 
Pradeeep Ravikumar and John Lafferty. 
I thought the use of preconditioner methods from solving linear systems in the context of approximate inference was novel and interesting. The results look good and I’d like to understand the limitations.
 
 Rodeo: Sparse nonparametric regression in high dimensions. 
John Lafferty and Larry Wasserman. 
A very interesting approach to feature selection in nonparametric regression from a frequentist framework. The use of lengthscale variables in each dimension reminds me a lot of  ‘Automatic Relevance Determination’ in Gaussian process regression — it would be interesting to compare Rodeo to ARD in GPs.

<p>Introduction: Lev Reyzin  points out  the  CI Fellows program is renewed .  CI Fellows are essentially  NSF  funded computer science postdocs for universities and industry research labs.  I’ve been lucky and happy to have Lev visit me for a year under  last year’s program , so I strongly recommend participating if it suits you.
 
As with last year, the application timeline is very short, with everything due by May 23.</p><p>6 0.51655895 <a title="184-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-08-27-NYAS_ML_2012_and_ICML_2013.html">472 hunch net-2012-08-27-NYAS ML 2012 and ICML 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Attendance at theNIPS workshopsis highly recommended for both research and
learning. Unfortunately, there does not yet appear to be a public list of
workshops. However, I found the following workshop webpages of
interest:Machine Learning in FinanceLearning to RankFoundations of Active
LearningMachine Learning Based Robotics in Unstructured EnvironmentsThere
aremanymore workshops. In fact, there are so many that it is not plausible
anyone can attend every workshop they are interested in. Maybe in future years
the organizers can spread them out over more days to reduce overlap.Many of
these workshops are accepting presentation proposals (due mid-October).</p><p>3 0.20830828 <a title="216-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-14-NIPS.html">71 hunch net-2005-05-14-NIPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: NIPSis the big winter conference of learning.Paper due date: June 3rd.
(Tweaked thanks toFei Sha.)Location: Vancouver (main program) Dec. 5-8 and
Whistler (workshops) Dec 9-10, BC, CanadaNIPS is larger than all of the other
learning conferences, partly because it's the only one at that time of year. I
recommend the workshops which are often quite interesting and energetic.</p><p>4 0.17247728 <a title="216-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-10-26-NIPS_workshops.html">375 hunch net-2009-10-26-NIPS workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many of theNIPS workshopshave a deadline about now, and the NIPSearly
registration deadline is Nov. 6. Several interest me:Adaptive Sensing, Active
Learning, and Experimental Designdue 10/27.Discrete Optimization in Machine
Learning: Submodularity, Sparsity & Polyhedra, due Nov. 6.Large-Scale Machine
Learning: Parallelism and Massive Datasets, due 10/23 (i.e. past)Analysis and
Design of Algorithms for Interactive Machine Learning, due 10/30.And I'm sure
many of the others interest others. Workshops are great as a mechanism for
research, so take a look if there is any chance you might be interested.</p><p>5 0.16100745 <a title="216-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-23-ICML_2009_Workshops_%28and_Tutorials%29.html">379 hunch net-2009-11-23-ICML 2009 Workshops (and Tutorials)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm theworkshops chairforICMLthis year. As such, I would like to personally
encourage people to consider running a workshop.My general view of workshops
is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research
directions--some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and
several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various
problems. My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making
them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops
often come off much better than expected in the end. Submissions are due
January 18, two weeks before papers.Similarly,Ben Taskaris looking for
goodtutorials, which is complementary. Workshops are about exploring a
subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught
essence, a vital part of the research process. Tutorials are due February 13,
two weeks after papers.</p><p>6 0.15317656 <a title="216-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-06-A_link.html">108 hunch net-2005-09-06-A link</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Learning reductionstransform a solver of one type of learning problem into a
solver of another type of learning problem. When we analyze these for
robustness we can make statement of the form "ReductionRhas the property that
regretr(or loss) on subproblems of typeAimplies regret at mostf ( r )on the
original problem of typeB".A lower bound for a learning reduction would have
the form "for all reductionsR, there exists a learning problem of typeBand
learning algorithm for problems of typeAwhere regretron induced problems
impliesat leastregretf ( r )forB".The pursuit of lower bounds is often
questionable because, unlike upper bounds, they do not yield practical
algorithms. Nevertheless, they may be helpful as a tool for thinking about
what is learnable and how learnable it is. This has already come
uphereandhere.At the moment, there is no coherent theory of lower bounds for
learning reductions, and we have little understanding of how feasible they are
or which techniques may be useful in</p><p>4 0.43491665 <a title="216-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-27-Watchword%3A_Supervised_Learning.html">299 hunch net-2008-04-27-Watchword: Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently discovered that supervised learning is a controversial term. The
two definitions are:Known LossSupervised learning corresponds to the situation
where you have unlabeled examples plus knowledge of the loss of each possible
predicted choice. This is the definition I'm familiar and comfortable with.
One reason to prefer this definition is that the analysis of sample complexity
for this class of learning problems are all pretty similar.Any kind of
signalSupervised learning corresponds to the situation where you have
unlabeled examples plus any source of side information about what the right
choice is. This notion of supervised learning seems to subsume reinforcement
learning, which makes me uncomfortable, because it means there are two words
for the same class. This also means there isn't a convenient word to describe
the first definition.Reviews suggest there are people who are dedicated to the
second definition out there, so it can be important to discriminate which you
mean.</p><p>5 0.43460265 <a title="216-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-23-On_Coding_via_Mutual_Information_%26%23038%3B_Bayes_Nets.html">150 hunch net-2006-01-23-On Coding via Mutual Information &#038; Bayes Nets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Say we have two random variablesX,Ywith mutual informationI(X,Y). Let's say we
want to represent them with a bayes net of the formX< -M->Y, such that the
entropy ofMequals the mutual information, i.e.H(M)=I(X,Y). Intuitively, we
would like our hidden state to be as simple as possible (entropy wise). The
data processing inequality means thatH(M)>=I(X,Y), so the mutual information
is a lower bound on how simple theMcould be. Furthermore, if such a
construction existed it would have a nice coding interpretation -- one could
jointly codeXandYby first coding the mutual information, then codingXwith this
mutual info (withoutY) and codingYwith this mutual info (withoutX).It turns
out that such a construction does not exist in general (ThxAlina
Beygelzimerfor a counterexample! see below for the sketch).What are the
implications of this? Well, it's hard for me to say, but it does suggest to me
that the 'generative' model philosophy might be burdened with a harder
modeling task. If all we care a</p><p>6 0.43457481 <a title="216-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-26-ML_Symposium_and_Strata-Hadoop_World.html">475 hunch net-2012-10-26-ML Symposium and Strata-Hadoop World</a></p>

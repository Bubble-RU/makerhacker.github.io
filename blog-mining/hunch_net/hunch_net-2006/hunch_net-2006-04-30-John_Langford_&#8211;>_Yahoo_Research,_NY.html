this is serious forYahoo! Research.We had advanced warning
fromPrabhakarthrough thesimple act of leaving. Yahoo! Research was a world
class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is
deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave. My first
thought when I saw the news was "Uhoh,Robsaid that he knew it was serious when
the head of ATnT Research left." In this case it was even more significant,
because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in
how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high
engagement with the company. Prabhakar's departure is a clear end to that
experiment.The result is ambiguous from a business perspective. Y!R clearly
was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses. I'm not privy to the

<p>Introduction: I just visitedYahoo Researchwhich has several fundamental learning problems
near to (or beyond) the set of problems we know how to solve well. Here are 3
of them.RankingThis is the canonical problem of all search engines. It is made
extra difficult for several reasons.There is relatively little "good"
supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as
click through rates).The learning must occur in a partially adversarial
environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top
ofrankings.It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as
'ranking' or as 'regression' which is then used to produce
aranking.Collaborative filteringYahoo has a large number of recommendation
systems for music, movies, etcâ&euro;Ś In these sorts of systems, users specify how
they liked a set of things, and then the system can (hopefully) find some more
examples of things they might likeby reasoning across multiple such
sets.Exploration with Generalization</p><p>4 0.17666215 <a title="175-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-02-25-Yahoo%21_Machine_Learning_grant_due_March_11.html">425 hunch net-2011-02-25-Yahoo! Machine Learning grant due March 11</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>6 0.13822103 <a title="175-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I attended theIBM research 60th anniversary. IBM research is, by any
reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the
most value to it's parent company over the long term. This can be seen by
simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab
which has not gone through a period of massive firing. (Note that there are
alsonew research labs.)Despite this impressive record, IBM research has
failed, by far, to achieve it's potential. Examples which came up in this
meeting include:It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented
in the lab. (In fact, Intel produced it first.)Relational databases and SQL
were invented and then languished. It was only under external competition that
IBM released it's own relational database. Why didn't IBM grow anOracle
division?An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing
aCisco division. Why not?And remember â&euro;Ś IBM research is a stark success story

<p>Introduction: I will joinYahoo Research(in New York) after my contract ends atTTI-
Chicago.The deciding reasons are:Yahoo is running into many hard learning
problems. This is precisely the situation where basic research might hope to
have the greatest impact.Yahoo Research understands research including
publishing, conferences, etc…Yahoo Research is growing, so there is a chance I
can help it grow well.Yahoo understands the internet, including (but not at
all limited to) experimenting with research blogs.In the end, Yahoo Research
seems like the place where I might have a chance to make the greatest
difference.Yahoo (as a company) has made a strong bet on Yahoo Research. We-
the-researchers all hope that bet will pay off, and this seems plausible. I'll
certainly have fun trying.</p><p>2 0.7967093 <a title="175-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-05-Server_Shift%2C_Site_Tweaks%2C_Suggestions%3F.html">182 hunch net-2006-06-05-Server Shift, Site Tweaks, Suggestions?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hunch.net has shifted to a new server, and wordpress has been updated to the
latest version. If anyone notices difficulties associated with this, please
comment. (Note that DNS updates can take awhile so the shift may not yet be
complete.)More generally, this is a good time to ask for suggestions. What
would make this blog more useful?</p><p>3 0.71284914 <a title="175-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-06-Structured_Regret_Minimization.html">53 hunch net-2005-04-06-Structured Regret Minimization</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Geoff Gordon made an interesting presentation at thesnowbird learning
workshopdiscussing the use of no-regret algorithms for the use of several
robot-related learning problems. There seems to be a drafthere. This seems
interesting in two ways:Drawback RemovalOne of the significant problems with
these online algorithms is that they can't cope with structure very easily.
This drawback is addressed for certain structures.ExperimentsOne criticism of
such algorithms is that they are too "worst case". Several experiments suggest
that protecting yourself against this worst case does not necessarily incur a
great loss.</p><p>4 0.70618123 <a title="175-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-17-New_Machine_Learning_mailing_list.html">278 hunch net-2007-12-17-New Machine Learning mailing list</a></p>
<p>Introduction: IMLS(which is the nonprofit running ICML) has setup a new mailing list
forMachine Learning News. The list address is ML-news@googlegroups.com, and
signup requires a google account (which you can create). Only members can send

<p>Introduction: The health ofCOLT(Conference on Learning Theory or Computational Learning
Theory depending on who you ask) has been questioned over the last few years.
Low points for the conference occurred whenEuroCOLTmerged with COLT in 2001,
and the attendance at the 2002 Sydney COLT fell to a new low. This occurred in
the general context of machine learning conferences rising in both number and
size over the last decade.Any discussion ofwhyCOLT has had difficulties is
inherently controversial as is any story about well-intentioned people making
the wrong decisions. Nevertheless, this may be worth discussing in the hope of
avoiding problems in the future and general understanding. In any such
discussion there is a strong tendency to identify with a conference/community
in a patriotic manner that is detrimental to thinking. Keep in mind that
conferences exist to further research.My understanding (I wasn't around) is
that COLT started as a subcommunity of the computer science theory community.

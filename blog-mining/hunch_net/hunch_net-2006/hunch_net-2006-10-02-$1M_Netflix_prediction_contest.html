<p>Introduction: I attended the  Netflix prize  ceremony this morning.  The press conference part is  covered fine elsewhere , with the basic outcome being that  BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos  won over  The Ensemble  by 15-20  minutes , because they were tied in performance on the ultimate holdout set.  I’m sure the individual participants will have many chances to speak about the solution.  One of these is Bell at the  NYAS ML symposium on Nov. 6 .
 
Several additional details may interest ML people.
  
 The degree of overfitting exhibited by the difference in performance on the  leaderboard test set  and the ultimate hold out set was small, but determining at .02 to .03%. 
 A tie was possible, because the rules cut off measurements below the fourth digit based on significance concerns.  In actuality, of course, the scores do differ before rounding, but everyone I spoke to claimed not to know how.

<p>Introduction: The  Heritage Health Prize  is potentially the largest prediction prize yet at $3M, which is sure to get many people interested.  Several elements of the competition may be worth discussing.
  
 The most straightforward way for HPN to deploy this predictor is in determining who to cover with insurance.  This might easily cover the costs of running the contest itself, but the value to the health system of a whole is minimal, as people not covered still exist.  While HPN itself is a provider network, they have active relationships with a number of insurance companies, and the right to resell any entrant.  It’s worth keeping in mind that the research and development may nevertheless end up being useful in the longer term, especially as entrants also keep the right to their code.

<p>Introduction: There are two prediction competitions currently in the air.  
  
 The  Performance Prediction Challenge   by  Isabelle Guyon .  Good entries minimize a weighted 0/1 loss + the difference between a prediction of this loss and the observed truth on 5 datasets.  Isabelle tells me all of the problems are “real world” and the test datasets are large enough (17K minimum) that the winner should be well determined by ability rather than luck.  This is due March 1. 
 The  Predictive Uncertainty Challenge  by  Gavin Cawley .  Good entries minimize log loss on real valued output variables for one synthetic and 3 “real” datasets related to atmospheric prediction. The use of log loss (which can be infinite and hence is never convergent) and smaller test sets of size 1K to 7K examples makes the winner of this contest more luck dependent.  Nevertheless, the contest may be of some interest particularly to the branch of learning (typically Bayes learning) which prefers to optimize log loss.

<p>Introduction: A $1M qualifying result was achieved on the  public Netflix test set  by a  3-way ensemble team .  This is just in time for  Yehuda ‘s presentation at  KDD , which I’m sure will be one of the best attended ever.  
 
This isn’t quite over—there are a few days for another super-conglomerate team to come together and there is some small chance that the performance is nonrepresentative of the final test set, but I expect not.  
 
Regardless of the final outcome, the biggest lesson for ML from the Netflix contest has been the formidable performance edge of ensemble methods.</p><p>4 0.68579233 <a title="211-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-09-21-Netflix_finishes_%28and_starts%29.html">371 hunch net-2009-09-21-Netflix finishes (and starts)</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the basic observations from the  atomic learning workshop  is that gradient-based optimization is pervasive.   For example, at least 7 (of 12) speakers used the word ‘gradient’ in their talk and several others may be approximating a gradient.  The essential useful quality of a gradient is that it decouples local updates from global optimization.  Restated: Given a gradient, we can determine how to change individual parameters of the system so as to improve overall performance.
 
It’s easy to feel depressed about this and think “nothing has happened”, but that appears untrue.  Many of the talks were about clever techniques for computing gradients where your calculus textbook breaks down.
  
 Sometimes there are clever approximations of the gradient. ( Simon Osindero ) 
 Sometimes we can compute constrained gradients via iterated gradient/project steps. ( Ben Taskar ) 
 Sometimes we can compute gradients anyways over mildly nondifferentiable functions. ( Drew Bagnell )

<p>Introduction: I’m not as naturally exuberant as  Muthu   2  or  David  about  CS/Econ  day, but I believe it and  ML day  were certainly successful.
 
At the CS/Econ day, I particularly enjoyed  Toumas Sandholm’s  talk which showed a commanding depth of understanding and application in automated auctions.
 
For the machine learning day, I enjoyed several talks and posters (I better, I helped pick them.).  What stood out to me was number of people attending: 158 registered, a level qualifying as “scramble to find seats”.  My rule of thumb for workshops/conferences is that the number of attendees is often something like the number of submissions.  That isn’t the case here, where there were just 4 invited speakers and 30-or-so posters.  Presumably, the difference is due to a critical mass of Machine Learning interested people in the area and the ease of their attendance.  
 
Are there other areas where a local Machine Learning day would fly?

<p>Introduction: Many people, especially students, haven’t had an opportunity to collaborate with other researchers.  Collaboration, especially with remote people can be tricky.  Here are some observations of what has worked for me on collaborations involving a few people.
  
  Travel and Discuss  Almost all collaborations start with in-person discussion.  This implies that travel is often necessary.  We can hope that in the future we’ll have better systems for starting collaborations remotely (such as blogs), but we aren’t quite there yet. 
  Enable your collaborator .  A collaboration can fall apart because one collaborator disables another.  This sounds stupid (and it is), but it’s far easier than you might think.
 
  Avoid Duplication .  Discovering that you and a collaborator have been editing the same thing and now need to waste time reconciling changes is annoying.  The best way to avoid this to be explicit about who has write permission to what.  Most of the time, a write lock is held for the e</p><p>5 0.67188245 <a title="211-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-12-Fast_Gradient_Descent.html">111 hunch net-2005-09-12-Fast Gradient Descent</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nic Schaudolph  has been developing a fast gradient descent algorithm called  Stochastic Meta-Descent  (SMD).
 
Gradient descent is currently untrendy in the machine learning community, but there remains a large number of people using gradient descent on neural networks or other architectures from when it was trendy in the early 1990s.  There are three problems with gradient descent.
  
 Gradient descent does not necessarily produce easily reproduced results.  Typical algorithms start with “set the initial parameters to small random values”. 
 The design of the representation that gradient descent is applied to is often nontrivial.  In particular, knowing exactly how to build a large neural network so that it will perform well requires knowledge which has not been made easily applicable. 
 Gradient descent can be slow.  Obviously, taking infinitesimal steps in the direction of the gradient would take forever, so some finite step size must be used.  What exactly this step size should be</p><p>6 0.49292332 <a title="211-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-23-ICML_2009_Workshops_%28and_Tutorials%29.html">379 hunch net-2009-11-23-ICML 2009 Workshops (and Tutorials)</a></p>

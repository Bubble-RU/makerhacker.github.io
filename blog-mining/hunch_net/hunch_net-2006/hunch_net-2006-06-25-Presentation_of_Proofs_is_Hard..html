is some attempt to state the standards and tests I applied to the papers. I
think it is a good idea to talk about this for two reasons:Making community

debate what is and is not the right standard. It might even give us a bit more
consistency across the years.It may save us all time. There are a number of
papers submitted which just aren't there yet. Avoiding submitting is the right
decision in this case.There are several criteria for judging a paper. All of
these were active this year. Some criteria are uncontroversial while others
may be so.The paper must have a theorem establishing something new for which
it is possible to derive high confidence in the correctness of the results. A
surprising number of papers fail this test. This criteria seems essential to

<p>Introduction: Foster Provostgave a talk at the ICMLmetalearning workshopon "metalearning"
and the "no free lunch theorem" which seems worth summarizing.As a review: the
no free lunch theorem is the most complicated way we know of to say that
abiasis required in order to learn. The simplest way to see this is in a
nonprobabilistic setting. If you are given examples of the form(x,y)and you
wish to predictyfromxthen any prediction mechanism errs half the time in
expectation over all sequences of examples. The proof of this is very simple:
on every example a predictor must make some prediction and by symmetry over
the set of sequences it will be wrong half the time and right half the time.
The basic idea of this proof has been applied to many other settings.The
simplistic interpretation of this theorem which many people jump to is
"machine learning is dead" since there can be no single learning algorithm
which can solve all learning problems. This is the wrong way to think about
it. In the real world, w</p><p>5 0.1138156 <a title="187-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-14-Who_is_Responsible_for_a_Bad_Review%3F.html">320 hunch net-2008-10-14-Who is Responsible for a Bad Review?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Although I'm greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be
admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in
reviews. The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if theByzantine
generalslimit has been exceeded. For example, I've seen recent reviews where
the given reasons for rejecting are:[NIPS] Theorem A is uninteresting because
Theorem B is uninteresting.[UAI] When you learn by memorization, the problem
addressed is trivial.[NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.[NIPS] This has been
done before. (â&euro;Ś but not giving any relevant citations)Just for the record I
want to point out what's wrong with these reviews. A future world in which
such reasons never come up again would be great, but I'm sure these errors
will be committed many times more in the future.This is nonsense. A theorem
should be evaluated based on it's merits, rather than the merits of another
theorem.Learning by memorization requires an exponentially larger sample
complexity than man</p><p>6 0.094109051 <a title="187-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-19-NIPS_2008_workshop_on_Kernel_Learning.html">321 hunch net-2008-10-19-NIPS 2008 workshop on Kernel Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For most people, a mathematical notation is like a language: you learn it and
stick with it. For people doing mathematical research, however, this is not
enough: they must design new notations for new problems. The design of good
notation is both hard and worthwhile since a bad initial notation can retard a
line of research greatly.Before we had mathematical notation, equations were
all written out in language. Since words have multiple meanings and variable
precedences, long equations written out in language can be extraordinarily
difficult and sometimes fundamentally ambiguous. A good representative example
of this is the legalese in the tax code. Since we want greater precision and
clarity, we adopt mathematical notation.One fundamental thing to understand
about mathematical notation, is that humans as logic verifiers, are barely
capable. This is the fundamental reason why one notation can be much better
than another. This observation is easier to miss than you might expect
because,</p><p>3 0.63286161 <a title="187-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-28-Learning_Theory_standards_for_NIPS_2006.html">204 hunch net-2006-08-28-Learning Theory standards for NIPS 2006</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In my experience, there are two different groups of people who believe the
same thing: the mathematics encountered in typical machine learning conference
papers is often of questionable value.The two groups who agree on this are
applied machine learning people who have given up on math, and mature
theoreticians who understand the limits of theory.Partly, this is just a
statement about where we are with respect to machine learning. In particular,
we have no mechanism capable of generating a prescription for how to solve all
learning problems. In the absence of such certainty, people try to come up
with formalisms that partially describe and motivate how and why they do
things. This is natural and healthy--we might hope that it will eventually
lead to just such a mechanism.But, part of this is simply an emphasis on
complexity over clarity. A very natural and simple theoretical statement is
often obscured by complexifications. Common sources of complexification
include:GeneralizationBy tr</p><p>5 0.60529363 <a title="187-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-10-Thinking_the_Unthought.html">91 hunch net-2005-07-10-Thinking the Unthought</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing common to much research is that the researcher must be the first
personeverto have some thought. How do you think of something that has never
been thought of? There seems to be no methodical manner of doing this, but
there are some tricks.The easiest method is to just have some connection come
to you. There is a trick here however: you should write it down and fill out
the idea immediately because it can just as easily go away.A harder method is
to set aside a block of time and simply think about an idea. Distraction
elimination is essential here because thinking about the unthought is hard
work which your mind will avoid.Another common method is in conversation.
Sometimes the process of verbalizing implies new ideas come up and sometimes
whoever you are talking to replies just the right way. This method is
dangerous though--you must speak to someone who helps you think rather than
someone who occupies your thoughts.Try to rephrase the problem so the answer
is simple. This is</p><p>6 0.56534582 <a title="187-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-04-More_Presentation_Preparation.html">307 hunch net-2008-07-04-More Presentation Preparation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A couple security researchersclaim to have cracked the netflix dataset. The
claims of success appear somewhat overstated to me, but the method of attack
is valid and could plausibly be substantially improved so as to reveal the
movie preferences of a small fraction of Netflix users.The basic idea is to
use a heuristic similarity function between ratings in a public database (from
IMDB) and an anonymized database (Netflix) to link ratings in the private
database to public identities (in IMDB). They claim to have linked two of a
few dozen IMDB users to anonymized netflix users.The claims seem a bit
inflated to me, because (a) knowing the IMDB identity isn't equivalent to
knowing the person and (b) the claims of statistical significance are with
respect to a model of the world they created (rather than one they

<p>Introduction: When presenting part of theReinforcement Learning theory tutorialatICML 2006,
I was forcibly reminded of this.There are several difficulties.When creating
the presentation, the correct level of detail is tricky. With too much detail,
the proof takes too much time and people may be lost to boredom. With too
little detail, the steps of the proof involve too-great a jump. This is very
difficult to judge.What may be an easy step in the careful thought of a quiet
room is not so easy when you are occupied by the process of presentation.What
may be easy after having gone over this (and other) proofs is not so easy to
follow in the first pass by a viewer.These problems seem only correctable by
process of repeated test-and-revise.When presenting the proof, simply speaking
with sufficient precision is substantially harder than in normal conversation
(where precision is not so critical). Practice can help here.When presenting
the proof, going at the right pace for understanding is difficult. When</p><p>3 0.89479083 <a title="187-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-04-Watchword%3A_model.html">135 hunch net-2005-12-04-Watchword: model</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In everyday use a model is a system which explains the behavior of some
system, hopefully at the level where some alteration of the model predicts
some alteration of the real-world system. In machine learning "model" has
several variant definitions.Everyday. The common definition is sometimes
used.Parameterized. Sometimes model is a short-hand for "parameterized model".
Here, it refers to a model with unspecified free parameters. In the Bayesian
learning approach, you typically have a prior over (everyday)
models.Predictive. Even further from everyday use is the predictive model.
Examples of this are "my model is a decision tree" or "my model is a support
vector machine". Here, there is no real sense in which an SVM explains the
underlying process. For example, an SVM tells us nothing in particular about
how alterations to the real-world system would create a change.Which
definition is being used at any particular time is important information. For
example, if it's a parameterized or p</p><p>4 0.88460255 <a title="187-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-31-Watchword%3A_Assumption.html">7 hunch net-2005-01-31-Watchword: Assumption</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Assumption" is another word to be careful with in machine learning because it
is used in several ways.Assumption = BiasThere are several ways to see that
some form of 'bias' (= preferring of one solution over another) is necessary.
This is obvious in an adversarial setting. A good bit of work has been
expended explaining this in other settings with "no free lunch" theorems. This
is a usage specialized to learning which is particularly common when talking
about priors for Bayesian Learning.Assumption = "if" of a theoremThe
assumptions are the 'if' part of the 'if-then' in a theorem. This is a fairly
common usage.Assumption = AxiomThe assumptions are the things that we assume
are true, but which we cannot verify. Examples are "the IID assumption" or "my
problem is a DNF on a small number of bits". This is the usage which I
prefer.One difficulty with any use of the word "assumption" is that you often
encounter "ifassumptionthenconclusionso ifnot assumptionthennot conclusion".

<p>Introduction: Arecent discussionindicated that one goal of this blog might be to allow
people to post comments about recent papers that they liked. I think this
could potentially be very useful, especially for those with diverse interests
but only finite time to read through conference proceedings.ACL 2005recently
completed, and here are four papers from that conference that I thought were
either good or perhaps of interest to a machine learning audience.David
Chiang,A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation.
(Best paper award.) This paper takes the standard phrase-based MT model that
is popular in our field (basically, translate a sentence by individually
translating phrases and reordering them according to a complicated statistical
model) and extends it to take into account hierarchy in phrases, so that you
can learn things like "X 's Y" -> "Y de X" in chinese, where X and Y are
arbitrary phrases. This takes a step toward linguistic syntax for MT, which

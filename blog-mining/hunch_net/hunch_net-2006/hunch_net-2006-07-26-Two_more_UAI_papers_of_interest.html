To summarize, if you acquire a signal in some basis that is incoherent with the basis in which you know the signal to be sparse in, it is very likely you will be able to reconstruct the signal from these incoherent projections. 
 
Terry Tao, the recent  Fields medalist , does a very nice job at explaining the framework  here . He goes further in the theory description in this  post  where he mentions the central issue of the Uniform Uncertainty Principle. It so happens that random projections are on average incoherent, within the UUP meaning, with most known basis (sines, polynomials, splines, wavelets, curvelets …) and are therefore an ideal basis for Compressed Sensing.

<p>Introduction: Here’s a list of papers that I found interesting at  ICML / COLT / UAI  in 2009.

This paper shows how to adapt learning algorithms that compete with fixed predictors to compete with changing policies.  The definition of regret they deal with seems particularly useful in many situation.

<p>Introduction: I learned a number of things at  NIPS .
  
 The financial people were there in greater force than previously.   Two Sigma  sponsored NIPS while  DRW Trading  had a booth. 
 The  adversarial machine learning workshop  had a number of talks about interesting applications where an adversary really is out to try and mess up your learning algorithm.  This is very different from the situation we often think of where the world is oblivious to our learning.  This may present new and convincing applications for the learning-against-an-adversary work common at  COLT . 
 There were several interesing papers.
 
  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Daniel Hsu , and  Claire Monteleoni  had a paper on  General Agnostic Active Learning .  The basic idea is that active learning can be done via reduction to a form of supervised learning problem.  This is great, because we have many supervised learning algorithms from which the benefits of active learning may be derived.

<p>Introduction: Ed Snelson  won the  Predictive Uncertainty in Environmental Modelling Competition  in the temp(erature) category using  this algorithm .  Some characteristics of the algorithm are:
  
 Gradient descent 
 … on about 600 parameters 
 … with local minima 
 … to solve regression. 
  
This bears a strong resemblance to a neural network.  The two main differences seem to be:
  
 The system has a probabilistic interpretation (which may aid design). 
 There are (perhaps) fewer parameters than a typical neural network might have for the same problem (aiding speed).</p><p>6 0.097353317 <a title="199-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-15-Normal_Deviate_and_the_UCSC_Machine_Learning_Summer_School.html">467 hunch net-2012-06-15-Normal Deviate and the UCSC Machine Learning Summer School</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since  John  did not attend  COLT  this year, I have been volunteered to report back on the hot stuff at this year’s meeting. The conference seemed to have pretty high quality stuff this year, and I found plenty of interesting papers on all the three days. I’m gonna pick some of my favorites going through the program in a chronological order.
 
The first session on matrices seemed interesting for two reasons. First, the papers were quite nice. But more interestingly, this is a topic that has had a lot of presence in Statistics and Compressed sensing literature recently. So it was good to see high-dimensional matrices finally make their entry at COLT. The paper of  Ohad  and  Shai  on  Collaborative Filtering with the Trace Norm: Learning, Bounding, and Transducing  provides non-trivial guarantees on trace norm regularization in an agnostic setup, while Rina and  Nati  show how Rademacher averages can be used to get sharper results for matrix completion problems in their paper  Concentr</p><p>3 0.61100596 <a title="199-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-24-Interesting_papers_at_UAICMOLT_2009.html">361 hunch net-2009-06-24-Interesting papers at UAICMOLT 2009</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a  paper  by Yann LeCun and Fu Jie Huang published at  AISTAT 2005 . I found this paper very difficult to read, but it does have some point about a computational shortcut.
 
This paper takes for granted that the method of solving a problem is gradient descent on parameters.  Given this assumption, the question arises: Do you want to do gradient descent on a probabilistic model or something else? 
 
All (conditional) probabilistic models have the form  p(y|x) = f(x,y)/Z(x)  where  Z(x) = sum y  f(x,y)  (the paper calls  - log f(x,y)  an “energy”).  If  f  is parameterized by some  w , the gradient has a term for  Z(x) , and hence for every value of  y .  The paper claims, that such models can be optimized for classification purposes using only the correct  y  and the other  y’ not y  which maximizes  f(x,y) .  This can even be done on unnormalizable models.  The paper further claims that this can be done with an approximate maximum.  These claims are plausible based on experimen</p><p>6 0.51289332 <a title="199-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-22-KDD_2010.html">406 hunch net-2010-08-22-KDD 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A reminder that the  New York Academy of Sciences  will be hosting the  7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium  tomorrow from 9:30am.
 
The main program will feature invited talks from  Peter Bartlett ,  William Freeman , and  Vladimir Vapnik , along with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main program,  hackNY  and  Microsoft Research  are sponsoring a networking hour with talks from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups (specifically  bit.ly ,  Buzzfeed ,  Chartbeat , and  Sense Networks ,  Visual Revenue ).  This should be of great interest to everyone considering working in machine learning.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.9432317 <a title="199-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-26-Two_more_UAI_papers_of_interest.html">199 hunch net-2006-07-26-Two more UAI papers of interest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In addition to Ed Snelson’s paper, there were (at least) two other papers that caught my eye at UAI.
 
One was  this paper  by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Daniel Hsu and Nakul Verma at UCSD which shows in a surprisingly general and strong way that almost all linear projections of any jointly distributed vector random variable with finite first and second moments look sphereical and unimodal (in fact look like a scale mixture of Gaussians). Great result, as you’d expect from Sanjoy.
 
The other paper which I found intriguing but which I just haven’t groked yet is  this beast  by Manfred and Dima Kuzmin. 
You can check out the (beautiful)  slides  
if that helps. I feel like there is something deep here, but my brain is too small to understand it. The COLT and last NIPS papers/slides are also on Manfred’s page. Hopefully someone here can illuminate.</p><p>3 0.92676371 <a title="199-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-09-Bad_Reviewing.html">38 hunch net-2005-03-09-Bad Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a difficult subject to talk about for many reasons, but a discussion may be helpful.
 
Bad reviewing is a problem in academia.  The first step in understanding this is admitting to the problem, so here is a short list of examples of bad reviewing. 
  
 Reviewer disbelieves theorem proof (ICML),  or disbelieve theorem with a trivially false counterexample. (COLT)  
 Reviewer internally swaps quantifiers in a theorem, concludes it has been done before and is trivial. (NIPS) 
 Reviewer believes a technique will not work despite experimental validation. (COLT) 
 Reviewers fail to notice flaw in theorem statement (CRYPTO).   
 Reviewer erroneously claims that it has been done before (NIPS, SODA, JMLR)—(complete with references!) 
 Reviewer inverts the message of a paper and concludes it says nothing important. (NIPS*2) 
 Reviewer fails to distinguish between a DAG and a tree (SODA). 
 Reviewer is enthusiastic about paper but clearly does not understand (ICML). 
 Reviewer erroneously</p><p>4 0.86833429 <a title="199-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-10-Is_the_Goal_Understanding_or_Prediction%3F.html">55 hunch net-2005-04-10-Is the Goal Understanding or Prediction?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Steve Smale  and I have a debate about goals of learning theory.
 
Steve likes theorems with a dependence on unobservable quantities.  For example, if  D  is a distribution over a space  X x [0,1] , you can state a theorem about the error rate dependent on the variance,  E (x,y)~D  (y-E y’~D|x [y']) 2  .
 
I dislike this, because I want to use the theorems to produce code solving learning problems.  Since I don’t know (and can’t measure) the variance, a theorem depending on the variance does not help me—I would not know what variance to plug into the learning algorithm.
 
Recast more broadly, this is a debate between “declarative” and “operative” mathematics.  A strong example of “declarative” mathematics is  “a new kind of science” .  Roughly speaking, the goal of this kind of approach seems to be finding a way to explain the observations we make.  Examples include “some things are unpredictable”, “a phase transition exists”, etc…
 
“Operative” mathematics helps you make predictions a</p><p>5 0.8156333 <a title="199-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-05-09-CI_Fellows%2C_again.html">434 hunch net-2011-05-09-CI Fellows, again</a></p>

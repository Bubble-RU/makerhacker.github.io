<p>Introduction: I will joinYahoo Research(in New York) after my contract ends atTTI-
Chicago.The deciding reasons are:Yahoo is running into many hard learning
problems. This is precisely the situation where basic research might hope to
have the greatest impact.Yahoo Research understands research including
publishing, conferences, etc…Yahoo Research is growing, so there is a chance I
can help it grow well.Yahoo understands the internet, including (but not at
all limited to) experimenting with research blogs.In the end, Yahoo Research
seems like the place where I might have a chance to make the greatest
difference.Yahoo (as a company) has made a strong bet on Yahoo Research. We-
the-researchers all hope that bet will pay off, and this seems plausible. I'll
certainly have fun trying.</p><p>3 0.17136765 <a title="156-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-10-Predictive_Search_is_Coming.html">120 hunch net-2005-10-10-Predictive Search is Coming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Search" is the other branch of AI research which has been succesful. Concrete
examples includeDeep Bluewhich beat the world chess champion andChinookthe
champion checkers program. A set of core search techniques exist including A*,
alpha-beta pruning, and others that can be applied to any of many different
search problems.Given this, it may be surprising to learn that there has been
relatively little succesful work on combining prediction and search. Given
also that humans typically solve search problems using a number of predictive
heuristics to narrow in on a solution, we might be surprised again. However,
the big successful search-based systems have typically not used "smart" search
algorithms. Insteady they have optimized for very fast search. This is not for
lack of tryingâ&euro;Ś many people have tried to synthesize search and prediction to

<p>Introduction: According to theNew York Times,Yahoo is releasing Project Panama shortly.
Project Panama is about better predicting which advertisements are relevant to
a search, implying a higher click through rate, implying larger income
forYahoo. There are two things that seem interesting here:A significant
portion of that improved accuracy is almost certainly machine learning at
work.The quantitative effect is huge--the estimate in the article is
$600*106.Googlealready has such improvements andMicrosoft Searchis surely
working on them, which suggest this is (perhaps) a $109per year machine
learning problem.The exact methodology under use is unlikely to be publicly
discussed in the near future because of the competitive enivironment.
Hopefully we'll have some public "war stories" at some point in the future
when this information becomes less sensitive. For now, it's reassuring to
simply note that machine learning is having a big impact.</p><p>5 0.15951295 <a title="156-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-03-Microsoft_Research%2C_New_York_City.html">464 hunch net-2012-05-03-Microsoft Research, New York City</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people. Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs,
this is serious forYahoo! Research.We had advanced warning
fromPrabhakarthrough thesimple act of leaving. Yahoo! Research was a world
class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is
deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave. My first
thought when I saw the news was "Uhoh,Robsaid that he knew it was serious when
the head of ATnT Research left." In this case it was even more significant,
because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in
how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high
engagement with the company. Prabhakar's departure is a clear end to that
experiment.The result is ambiguous from a business perspective. Y!R clearly
was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses. I'm not privy to the
internal accounting of impact and this is the kind of subject where there can
easily be great disagreemen</p><p>6 0.15700977 <a title="156-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-03-AOL%26%238217%3Bs_data_drop.html">200 hunch net-2006-08-03-AOL&#8217;s data drop</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I want to comment on the "Bing copies Google" discussionhere,here, andhere,
because there are data-related issues which the general public may not
understand, and some of the framing seems substantially misleading to me.As a
not-distant-outsider, let me mention the sources of bias I may have. I work
atYahoo!, which has started usingBing. This might predispose me towards Bing,
but on the other hand I'm still at Yahoo!, and have been usingLinuxexclusively
as an OS for many years, including even a couple minor kernel patches. And,on
the gripping hand, I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about the
basicprinciples of incorporating user feedback in machine learning. Also note,
this post is not related to official Yahoo! policy, it's just my personal
view.The issueGoogle engineers inserted synthetic responses to synthetic
queries on google.com, then executed the synthetic searches on google.com

<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahn'sPeekaboom projecthas yieldeddata(830MB).Peekaboom is the second
attempt (afterEspgame) to produce a dataset which is useful for learning to
solve vision problems based on voluntary game play. As a second attempt, it is
meant to address all of the shortcomings of the first attempt. In
particular:The locations of specific objects are provided by the data.The data
collection is far more complete and extensive.The data consists of:The source
images. (1 file per image, just short of 60K images.)The in-game events. (1

<p>Introduction: In recent years, there’s been an explosion of free educational resources that
make high-level knowledge and skills accessible to an ever-wider group of
people. In your own field, you probably have a good idea of where to look for
the answer to any particular question. But outside your areas of expertise,
sifting through textbooks, Wikipedia articles, research papers, and online
lectures can be bewildering (unless you’re fortunate enough to have a
knowledgeable colleague to consult). What are the key concepts in the field,
how do they relate to each other, which ones should you learn, and where
should you learn them?Courses are a major vehicle for packaging educational
materials for a broad audience. The trouble is that they’re typically meant to
be consumed linearly, regardless of your specific background or goals. Also,
unless thousands of other people have had the same background and learning
goals, there may not even be a course that fits your needs. Recently, we

<p>Introduction: I just visitedYahoo Researchwhich has several fundamental learning problems
near to (or beyond) the set of problems we know how to solve well. Here are 3
of them.RankingThis is the canonical problem of all search engines. It is made
extra difficult for several reasons.There is relatively little "good"
supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as
click through rates).The learning must occur in a partially adversarial
environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top
ofrankings.It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as
'ranking' or as 'regression' which is then used to produce
aranking.Collaborative filteringYahoo has a large number of recommendation
systems for music, movies, etcâ&euro;Ś In these sorts of systems, users specify how
they liked a set of things, and then the system can (hopefully) find some more
examples of things they might likeby reasoning across multiple such
sets.Exploration with Generalization</p><p>4 0.85897487 <a title="156-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-10-10-ALT_2009.html">374 hunch net-2009-10-10-ALT 2009</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I attendedALT("Algorithmic Learning Theory") for the first time this year. My
impression is ALT = 0.5 COLT, by attendance and also by some more intangible
"what do I get from it?" measure. There are many differences which can't quite
be described this way though. The program for ALT seems to be substantially
more diverse than COLT, which is both a weakness and a strength.One paper that
might interest people generally is:Alexey ChernovandVladimir Vovk,Prediction
with Expert Evaluators' Advice. The basic observation here is that in the
online learning with experts setting you can simultaneously compete with
several compatible loss functions simultaneously. Restated, debating between
competing with log loss and squared loss is a waste of breath, because it's
almost free to compete with them both simultaneously. This might interest
anyone who has run into "which loss function?" debates that come up
periodically.</p><p>5 0.7362178 <a title="156-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-28-Programming_Languages_for_Machine_Learning_Implementations.html">210 hunch net-2006-09-28-Programming Languages for Machine Learning Implementations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning algorithms have a much better chance of being widely adopted
if they are implemented in some easy-to-use code. There are several important
concerns associated with machine learning which stress programming languages
on the ease-of-use vs. speed frontier.SpeedThe rate at which data sources are
growing seems to be outstripping the rate at which computational power is
growing, so it is important that we be able to eak out every bit of
computational power. Garbage collected languages (java,ocaml,perlandpython)
often have several issues here.Garbage collection often implies that floating
point numbers are "boxed": every float is represented by a pointer to a float.
Boxing can cause an order of magnitude slowdown because an extra nonlocalized
memory reference is made, and accesses to main memory can are many CPU cycles
long.Garbage collection often implies that considerably more memory is used
than is necessary. This has a variable effect. In some circumstances it
results in</p><p>6 0.7313605 <a title="156-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-23-%28Dis%29similarities_between_academia_and_open_source_programmers.html">105 hunch net-2005-08-23-(Dis)similarities between academia and open source programmers</a></p>

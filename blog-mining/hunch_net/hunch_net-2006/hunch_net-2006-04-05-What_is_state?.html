<p>Introduction: One prescription for solving a problem well is:State the problem, in the
simplest way possible. In particular, this statement should involve no
contamination with or anticipation of the solution.Think about solutions to
the stated problem.Stating a problem in a succinct and crisp manner tends to
invite a simple elegant solution. When a problem can not be stated succinctly,
we wonder if the problem is even understood. (And when a problem is not
understood, we wonder if a solution can be meaningful.)Reinforcement learning
does step (1) well. It provides a clean simple language to state general AI
problems. In reinforcement learning there is a set of actionsA, a set of
observationsO, and a rewardr. The reinforcement learning problem, in general,
is defined by a conditional measureD( o, r | (o,r,a)*)which produces an
observationoand a rewardrgiven a history(o,r,a)*. The goal in reinforcement
learning is to find a policypi:(o,r,a)*-> amapping histories to actions so as

<p>Introduction: Exploration is one of the big unsolved problems in machine learning. This
isn't for lack of trying--there are many models of exploration which have been
analyzed in many different ways by many different groups of people. At some
point, it is worthwhile to sit back and see what has been done across these
many models.Reinforcement Learning(1). Reinforcement learning has
traditionally focused on Markov Decision Processes where the next states'is
given by a conditional distributionP(s'|s,a)given the current statesand
actiona. The typical result here is that certain specific algorithms
controlling an agent can behave withineof optimal for horizonTexcept
forpoly(1/e,T,S,A)"wasted" experiences (with high probability). This started
withE3bySatinder SinghandMichael Kearns.Sham Kakade's thesishas significant
discussion. Extensions have typically been of the form "under extra
assumptions, we can prove more", for exampleFactored-E3andMetric-E3. (It turns

<p>Introduction: Pieter Abbeelpresented a paper withAndrew NgatICMLonExploration and
Apprenticeship Learning in Reinforcement Learning. The basic idea of this
algorithm is:Collect data from a human controlling a machine.Build a
transition model based upon the experience.Build a policy which optimizes the
transition model.Evaluate the policy. If it works well, halt, otherwise add
the experience into the pool and go to (2).The paper proves that this
technique will converge to some policy with expected performance near human
expected performance assuming the world fits certain assumptions (MDP or
linear dynamics).This general idea of apprenticeship learning (i.e.
incorporating data from an expert) seems very compelling because (a) humans
often learn this way and (b) much harder problems can be solved. For (a), the
notion of teaching is about transferring knowledge from an expert to novices,
often via demonstration. To see (b), note that we can create intricate
reinforcement learning problems where a parti</p><p>6 0.51411915 <a title="169-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-23-Problem%3A_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Classification.html">27 hunch net-2005-02-23-Problem: Reinforcement Learning with Classification</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the questions facing machine learning as a field is "Can we produce a
generalized learning system that can solve a wide array of standard learning
problems?" The answer is trivial: "yes, just have children".Of course, that
wasn't really the question. The refined question is "Are there simple-to-
implement generalized learning systems that can solve a wide array of standard
learning problems?" The answer to this is less clear. The ability of animals
(and people ) to learn might be due to megabytes encoded in the DNA. If this
algorithmic complexity isnecessaryto solve machine learning, the field faces a
daunting task in replicating it on a computer.This observation suggests a
possibility: if you can show that few bits of DNA are needed for learning in
animals, then this provides evidence that machine learning (as a field) has a
hope of big success with relatively little effort.It is well known that
specific portions of the brain have specific functionality across individuals.

<p>Introduction: In reinforcement learning (and sometimes other settings), there is a notion of
"state". Based upon the state various predictions are made such as "Which
action should be taken next?" or "How much cumulative reward do I expect if I
take some action from this state?" Given the importance of state, it is
important to examine the meaning. There are actually several distinct options
and it turns out the definition variation is very important in motivating
different pieces of work.Newtonian State. State is the physical pose of the
world. Under this definition, there areverymany states, often too many for
explicit representation. This is also the definition typically used in
games.Abstracted State. State is an abstracted physical state of the world.
"Is the door open or closed?" "Are you in room A or not?" The number of states
is much smaller here. A basic issue here is: "How do you compute the state
from observations?"Mathematical State. State is a sufficient statistic of
observations for ma</p><p>4 0.86506003 <a title="169-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-01-NIPS%3A_Online_Bayes.html">8 hunch net-2005-02-01-NIPS: Online Bayes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One nice use for this blog is to consider and discuss papers that that have
appeared at recent conferences. I really enjoyed Andrew Ng and Sham Kakade's
paperOnline Bounds for Bayesian Algorithms. From the paper:The philosophy
taken in the Bayesian methodology is often at odds withthat in the online
learning community…. the online learning settingmakes rather minimal
assumptions on the conditions under which thedata are being presented to the
learner â€”usually, Nature could provideexamples in an adversarial manner. We
study the performance ofBayesian algorithms in a more adversarial setting… We
providecompetitive bounds when the cost function is the log loss, and
wecompare our performance to the best model in our model class (as inthe
experts setting).It's a very nice analysis of some of my favorite algorithms
that all hinges around a beautiful theorem:Let Q be any distribution over
parameters theta. Then for all sequences S:L_{Bayes}(S) leq L_Q(S) +
KL(Q|P)where P is our prior and th</p><p>5 0.8330763 <a title="169-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-12-04-Structural_Problems_in_NIPS_Decision_Making.html">221 hunch net-2006-12-04-Structural Problems in NIPS Decision Making</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a very difficult post to write, because it is about a perenially
touchy subject. Nevertheless, it is an important one which needs to be thought
about carefully.There are a few things which should be understood:The system
is changing and responsive. We-the-authors are we-the-reviewers, we-the-PC,
and even we-the-NIPS-board. NIPS has implemented 'secondary program chairs',
'author response', and 'double blind reviewing' in the last few years to help
with the decision process, and more changes may happen in the future.Agreement
creates a perception of correctness. When any PC meets and makes a group
decision about a paper, there is a strong tendency for the reinforcement
inherent in a group decision to create the perception of correctness. For the
many people who have been on the NIPS PC it's reasonable to entertain a
healthy skepticism in the face of this reinforcing certainty.This post is
about structural problems. What problems arise because of the structure of the
process? The</p><p>6 0.77636045 <a title="169-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-24-Specializations_of_the_Master_Problem.html">388 hunch net-2010-01-24-Specializations of the Master Problem</a></p>

</p><p>7 There are two advantages of the "weak to strong learning" view:Automatic computational speedups. [sent-8, score-0.242]
</p><p>8 In the "weak to strong learning" view, you automatically think about using a learning algorithm as a subroutine. [sent-9, score-0.305]

</p><p>12 The point here isnotthat the old view subsumes the CWGD view, but rather that the CWGD view does not account for all the value in the old view. [sent-18, score-1.022]

the machine learning community, but there remains a large number of people

<p>Introduction: A loss function is some function which, for any example, takes a prediction
and the correct prediction, and determines how much loss is incurred. (People
sometimes attempt to optimize functions of more than one example such as "area
under the ROC curve" or "harmonic mean of precision and recall".) Typically we
try to find predictors that minimize loss.There seems to be a strong dichotomy
between two views of what "loss" means in learning.Loss is determined by the
problem.Loss is a part of the specification of the learning problem. Examples
of problems specified by the loss function include "binary classification",
"multiclass classification", "importance weighted classification",
"l2regression", etcâ&euro;Ś This is the decision theory view of what loss means, and
the view that I prefer.Loss is determined by the solution.To solve a problem,
you optimize some particular loss functionnotgiven by the problem. Examples of
these loss functions are "hinge loss" (for SVMs), "log loss" (common in

interesting applications where an adversary really is out to try and mess up

and convincing applications for the learning-against-an-adversary work common
atCOLT.There were several interesing papers.Sanjoy Dasgupta,Daniel Hsu,
andClaire Monteleonihad a paper onGeneral Agnostic Active Learning. The basic
idea is that active learning can be done via reduction to a form of supervised
learning problem. This is great, because we have many supervised learning

<p>Introduction: One of the basic observations from theatomic learning workshopis that
gradient-based optimization is pervasive. For example, at least 7 (of 12)
speakers used the word 'gradient' in their talk and several others may be
approximating a gradient. The essential useful quality of a gradient is that
it decouples local updates from global optimization. Restated: Given a
gradient, we can determine how to change individual parameters of the system
so as to improve overall performance.It's easy to feel depressed about this
and think "nothing has happened", but that appears untrue. Many of the talks
were about clever techniques for computing gradients where your calculus
textbook breaks down.Sometimes there are clever approximations of the
gradient. (Simon Osindero)Sometimes we can compute constrained gradients via
iterated gradient/project steps. (Ben Taskar)Sometimes we can compute
gradients anyways over mildly nondifferentiable functions. (Drew Bagnell)Even
given a gradient, the choice of upda</p><p>4 0.63718307 <a title="179-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-17-A_Winner.html">197 hunch net-2006-07-17-A Winner</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since learning is far from an exact science, it's good to pay attention to
basic intuitions of applied learning. Here are a few I've
collected.IntegrationIn Bayesian learning, the posterior is computed by an
integral, and the optimal thing to do is to predict according to this
integral. This phenomena seems to be far more general. Bagging, Boosting,
SVMs, and Neural Networks all take advantage of this idea to some extent. The
phenomena is more general: you can average over many differentclassification
predictorsto improve performance.
Sources:Zoubin,CaruanaDifferentiationDifferent pieces of an average should
differentiate to achieve good performance by different methods. This is know
as the 'symmetry breaking' problem for neural networks, and it's why weights
are initialized randomly. Boosting explicitly attempts to achieve good
differentiation by creating new, different, learning problems. Sources:Yann

<p>Introduction: There will be no New York ML Symposium this year. The core issue is thatNYASis
disorganized by people leaving, pushing back the date, with the current
candidate a spring symposium on March 28.Gunnarand I were outvoted here--we
were gung ho on organizing a fall symposium, but the rest of the committee
wants to wait.In some good news, most of theICML 2012 videoshave been restored
from a deep backup.</p><p>2 0.96197599 <a title="179-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-24-Online_convex_optimization_at_COLT.html">186 hunch net-2006-06-24-Online convex optimization at COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: AtICML 2003,Marty Zinkevichproposedthe online convex optimization setting and
showed that a particular gradient descent algorithm has regret O(T0.5) with
respect to the best predictor where T is the number of rounds. This seems to
be a nice model for online learning, and there has been some significant
follow-up work.AtCOLT 2006Elad Hazan,Adam Kalai,Satyen Kale, andAmit
Agarwalpresenteda modification which takes a Newton stepguaranteeing O(log T)
regret when the first and second derivatives are bounded.Then they applied
these algorithms to portfolio managementatICML 2006(withRobert Schapire)
yielding some very fun graphs.</p><p>3 0.94847959 <a title="179-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-04-Vowpal_Wabbit%2C_version_5.0%2C_and_the_second_heresy.html">419 hunch net-2010-12-04-Vowpal Wabbit, version 5.0, and the second heresy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've releasedversion 5.0of theVowpal Wabbitonline learning software. The major
number has changed since thelast releasebecause I regard all earlier versions
as obsolete--there are several new algorithms & features including substantial
changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.The biggest changes are
new algorithms:Nikosand I improved the default algorithm. The basic update
rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully
controlled so that it's impossible to overrun the label. In addition, the
normalization has changed. Computationally, these changes are virtually free
and yield better results, sometimes much better. Less careful updates can be
reenabled with -loss_function classic, although results are still not
identical to previous due to normalization changes.Nikos also implemented the
per-feature learning rates as per thesetwopapers. Often, this works better
than the default algorithm. It isn't the default because it isn't (yet) as
adaptable</p><p>4 0.94121724 <a title="179-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Maximum_Margin_Mismatch%3F.html">77 hunch net-2005-05-29-Maximum Margin Mismatch?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John makes a fascinating point about structured classification (and slightly
scooped my post!). Maximum Margin Markov Networks (M3N) are an interesting
example of the second class of structured classifiers (where the
classification of one label depends on the others), and one of my favorite
papers. I'm not alone: the paper won the best student paper award at NIPS in
2003.There are some things I find odd about the paper. For instance, it says
of probabilistic models"cannot handle high dimensional feature spaces and lack
strong theoretical guarrantees."I'm aware of no such limitations.
Also:"Unfortunately, even probabilistic graphical models that are trained
discriminatively do not achieve the same level of performance as SVMs,
especially when kernel features are used."This is quite interesting and
contradicts my own experience as well as that of a number of
peopleIgreatlyrespect. I wonder what the root cause is: perhaps there is
something different about the data Ben+Carlos were working</p><p>same-blog 5 0.93610907 <a title="179-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-16-The_value_of_the_orthodox_view_of_Boosting.html">179 hunch net-2006-05-16-The value of the orthodox view of Boosting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The term "boosting" comes from the idea of using a meta-algorithm which takes
"weak" learners (that may be able to only barely predict slightly better than
random) and turn them into strongly capable learners (which predict very
well).Adaboostin 1995 was the first widely used (and useful) boosting
algorithm, although there were theoretical boosting algorithms floating around
since 1990 (see the bottom ofthis page).Since then, many different
interpretations of why boosting works have arisen. There is significant
discussion about these different views in theannals of statistics, including
aresponsebyYoav FreundandRobert Schapire.I believe there is a great deal of
value to be found in the original view of boosting (meta-algorithm for
creating a strong learner from a weak learner). This is not a claim that one
particular viewpoint obviates the value of all others, but rather that no
other viewpoint seems to really capture important properties.Comparing with
all other views of boosting is t</p><p>6 0.88465637 <a title="179-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-13-Wikis_for_Summer_Schools_and_Workshops.html">81 hunch net-2005-06-13-Wikis for Summer Schools and Workshops</a></p>

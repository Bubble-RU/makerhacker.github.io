<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>3 0.14934933 <a title="174-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-03-Conference_attendance_is_mandatory.html">66 hunch net-2005-05-03-Conference attendance is mandatory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For anyone planning to do research, conference attendance is virtually
mandatory for success. Aside from exposing yourself to a large collection of
different ideas, many interesting conversations leading to new research happen
at conferences. If you are a student, you should plan to go to at least one
summer conference. Your advisor should cover the costs.ConferenceLocationEarly

<p>Introduction: As part of aPASCALproject, the Slovenians have been filming various machine
learning events and placing them on the webhere. This includes, for example,
theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer Schoolas well as a number of other
summer schools, workshops, and conferences.There are some significant caveats
here--for example, I can't access it from Linux. Based upon the webserver
logs, I expect that is a problem for most people--Computer scientists are
particularly nonstandard in their choice of computing platform.Nevertheless,
the core idea here is excellent and details of compatibility can be fixed
later. With modern technology toys, there is no fundamental reason why the
process of announcing new work at a conference should happen only once and
only for the people who could make it to that room in that conference. The
problems solved include:The multitrack vs. single-track debate. ("Sometimes
the single track doesn't interest me" vs. "When it's multitrack I miss good

<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeckpoints outCOLTregistrationwith a May 13 early registration
deadline. The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs
with a $300 registration fee.ICMLregistrationis also available, at about an x3
higher cost. My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a
larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as
long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference
organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>6 0.12084866 <a title="174-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-28-Running_A_Machine_Learning_Summer_School.html">75 hunch net-2005-05-28-Running A Machine Learning Summer School</a></p>

<p>Introduction: (update:cross-postedonCACM)For the first time in several years,ICML 2010did
not havevideolecturesattending. Luckily, thetutorial on exploration and
learningwhichAlinaand I put together canbe viewed, since we also presented
atKDD 2010, which included videolecture support.ICML didn't cover the cost of
a videolecture, becausePASCALdidn't provide a grant for it this year. On the
other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs. The cost of
videolectures isn't cheap. Fora workshopthe baseline quote we have is 270 euro
per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman's travel and accomodation.
This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle
the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a
quoted 216 euro per hour.Youtubeis the most predominant free video site with a
cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.15 minute upload
limitsdo not match typical talk lengths. Videolectures also have side-by-side
synchronized slides &</p><p>6 0.61041284 <a title="174-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-30-COLT_2007.html">242 hunch net-2007-04-30-COLT 2007</a></p>

rather some people at "Enformatika". Investigation shows that they registered
with an anonymous yahoo email account fromdotregistrar.comthe "Home of the

internet company.It appears the website has since been altered to "ICNL" (the
above link uses the google cache).They say that imitation is the sincerest

ModelsDavid Blei, John LaffertyA nice model for how topics in LDA type models
can evolve over time,using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters
and a veryclever structured variational approximation (in which the mean
fieldparameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all

<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are
coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.It's entirely reasonable for
anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don't have a paper. For
students, visiting a conference is almost a 'must'--there is no where else
that a broad cross-section of research is on display.Workshops are also a very
good idea.ICML has 11,KDD has 9, andAAAI has 19. Workshops provide an
opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research. They
are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research
because they are so interactive.Tutorials are a good way to gain some
understanding of a long-standing direction of research. They are generally
more coherent than workshops.ICML has 7andAAAI has 15.</p><p>4 0.77707738 <a title="174-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-29-ICML_survey_and_comments.html">468 hunch net-2012-06-29-ICML survey and comments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attendingICML, except forDorawho arrived
on Monday. Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is
going well.For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like
everyone),Mark Reidhas setup theICML discussionsite where you can comment on
any paper or subscribe to papers. Authors are automatically subscribed to
their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly
after the fact, as people desire.We also conducted a survey before the
conference and have thesurvey resultsnow. This can be compared with theICML
2010 survey results. Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes
order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4
being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and
2010.Glancing through them, I see:Most people found the papers they reviewed a
good fit for their expertise (-.037 w.r.t 2010). Achieving this was one of our

<p>Introduction: I recently had fun discussions with bothVikash MansinghkaandThomas Breuelabout
approaching AI with machine learning. The general interest in taking a crack
at AI with machine learning seems to be rising on many fronts
includingDARPA.As a matter of history, there was a great deal of interest in
AI which died down before I began research. There remain many projects and
conferences spawned in this earlier AI wave, as well as a good bit of
experience about what did not work, or at least did not work yet. Here are a
few examples of failure modes that people seem to run into:Supply/Product
confusion. Sometimes we think "Intelligences use X, so I'll create X and have
an Intelligence." An example of this is theCyc Projectwhich inspires some
people as "intelligences use ontologies, so I'll create an ontology and a
system using it to have an Intelligence." The flaw here is that
Intelligencescreateontologies, which they use, and without the ability to
create ontologies you don't have an Intellige</p><p>6 0.73121482 <a title="174-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-28-Programming_Languages_for_Machine_Learning_Implementations.html">210 hunch net-2006-09-28-Programming Languages for Machine Learning Implementations</a></p>

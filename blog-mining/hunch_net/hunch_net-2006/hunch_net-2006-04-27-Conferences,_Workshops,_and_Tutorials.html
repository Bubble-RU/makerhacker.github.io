<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.  
  
 It’s entirely reasonable for anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don’t have a paper.  For students, visiting a conference is almost a ‘must’—there is no where else that a broad cross-section of research is on display. 
 Workshops are also a very good idea.   ICML has 11 ,  KDD has 9 , and  AAAI has 19 .  Workshops provide an opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research.  They are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research because they are so interactive.

<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.  This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.  Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention.  Roughly speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your interest.  The main conference program consists of elements related to someoneâ&euro;&trade;s interest (which is rarely your own).  Workshops are more about doing research while conferences are more about presenting research.  
 
Several conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due shortly.
  
 
  ICML workshops  
 Due April 1 
 
 
  IJCAI workshops  
 Deadlines Vary 
 
 
 KDD workshops 
 Not yet finalized 
 
  
Anyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops and see if any are of interest.  (If none are, then maybe you should organize one next year.)</p><p>3 0.20921798 <a title="174-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-23-ICML_2009_Workshops_%28and_Tutorials%29.html">379 hunch net-2009-11-23-ICML 2009 Workshops (and Tutorials)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m the  workshops chair  for  ICML  this year.  As such, I would like to personally encourage people to consider running a workshop.
 
My general view of workshops is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research directions—some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various problems.  My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops often come off much better than expected in the end.  Submissions are due January 18, two weeks before papers.
 
Similarly,  Ben Taskar  is looking for good  tutorials , which is complementary.  Workshops are about exploring a subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught essence, a vital part of the research process.  Tutorials are due February 13, two weeks after papers.</p><p>4 0.20497788 <a title="174-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-17-Workshops_as_Franchise_Conferences.html">141 hunch net-2005-12-17-Workshops as Franchise Conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult.  As a conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good papers—enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to (generally) to grow the conference.  For someone choosing to participate in a new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work out?  Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you are sure will work?
 
The conference founding problem is a joint agreement problem with a very significant barrier.  Workshops are a way around this problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective means for this.  A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available.  Presenting work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a confe</p><p>5 0.19686686 <a title="174-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-05-04-COLT_and_ICML_registration.html">482 hunch net-2013-05-04-COLT and ICML registration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeck  points out  COLT   registration  with a May 13 early registration deadline.   The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs with a $300 registration fee.
 
 ICML   registration  is also available, at about an x3 higher cost.  My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>6 0.1939131 <a title="174-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-19-Deadline_Season%2C_2010.html">387 hunch net-2010-01-19-Deadline Season, 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As part of a  PASCAL  project, the Slovenians have been filming various machine learning events and placing them on the web  here .  This includes, for example, the  Chicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer School  as well as a number of other summer schools, workshops, and conferences.
 
There are some significant caveats here—for example, I can’t access it from Linux.  Based upon the webserver logs, I expect that is a problem for most people—Computer scientists are particularly nonstandard in their choice of computing platform.
 
Nevertheless, the core idea here is excellent and details of compatibility can be fixed later.  With modern technology toys, there is no fundamental reason why the process of announcing new work at a conference should happen only once and only for the people who could make it to that room in that conference.  The problems solved include:

<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.  
  
 It’s entirely reasonable for anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don’t have a paper.  For students, visiting a conference is almost a ‘must’—there is no where else that a broad cross-section of research is on display. 
 Workshops are also a very good idea.   ICML has 11 ,  KDD has 9 , and  AAAI has 19 .  Workshops provide an opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research.  They are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research because they are so interactive. 
 Tutorials are a good way to gain some understanding of a long-standing direction of research.  They are generally more coherent than workshops.   ICML has 7  and  AAAI has 15 .</p><p>2 0.87234491 <a title="174-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-11-09-Graduates_and_Postdocs.html">490 hunch net-2013-11-09-Graduates and Postdocs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several strong graduates are on the job market this year.
  
  Alekh Agarwal  made the  most scalable public learning algorithm  as an intern two years ago.  He has a deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning as well as the ability and will to make things happen programming-wise.  I’ve been privileged to have Alekh visiting me in NY where he will be sorely missed. 
  John Duchi  created  Adagrad  which is a commonly helpful improvement over online gradient descent that is seeing wide adoption, including in  Vowpal Wabbit .  He has a similarly deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning with significant industry experience at  Google .  Alekh and John have often coauthored together. 
  Stephane Ross  visited me a year ago over the summer, implementing many new algorithms and working out the first  scale free online update rule  which is now the default in Vowpal Wabbit.  Stephane is  not  on the market—Google robbed the cradle successfully    I’m sure that</p><p>3 0.8446328 <a title="174-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-05-20-Google_Predict.html">399 hunch net-2010-05-20-Google Predict</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Slashdot  points out  Google Predict .  I’m not privy to the details, but this has the potential to be extremely useful, as in many applications simply having an easy mechanism to apply existing learning algorithms can be extremely helpful.  This differs goalwise from  MLcomp —instead of public comparisons for research purposes, it’s about private utilization of good existing algorithms.  It also differs infrastructurally, since a system designed to do this is much less awkward than using Amazon’s cloud computing.  The latter implies that datasets several order of magnitude larger can be handled up to limits imposed by network and storage.</p><p>4 0.79422241 <a title="174-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-24-Interesting_papers_at_UAICMOLT_2009.html">361 hunch net-2009-06-24-Interesting papers at UAICMOLT 2009</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a list of papers that I found interesting at  ICML / COLT / UAI  in 2009.
  
  Elad Hazan  and  Comandur Seshadhri   Efficient learning algorithms for changing environments  at ICML.  This paper shows how to adapt learning algorithms that compete with fixed predictors to compete with changing policies.  The definition of regret they deal with seems particularly useful in many situation. 
  Hal Daume ,  Unsupervised Search-based Structured Prediction  at ICML.  This paper shows a technique for reducing unsupervised learning to supervised learning which (a) make a fast unsupervised learning algorithm and (b)  makes semisupervised learning both easy and highly effective.  
 There were two papers with similar results on active learning in the KWIK framework for linear regression, both reducing the sample complexity to .  One was  Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi ,  Claudio Gentile , and  Francesco Orabona   Robust Bounds for Classification via Selective Sampling  at ICML and the other was  Thoma</p><p>5 0.71773571 <a title="174-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-18-Multiplication_of_Learned_Probabilities_is_Dangerous.html">157 hunch net-2006-02-18-Multiplication of Learned Probabilities is Dangerous</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about a design flaw in several learning algorithms such as the Naive Bayes classifier and Hidden Markov Models.  A number of people are aware of it, but it seems that not everyone is.
 
Several learning systems have the property that they estimate some conditional probabilities  P(event | other events)  either explicitly or implicitly.  Then, at prediction time, these learned probabilities are multiplied together according to some formula to produce a final prediction.  The Naive Bayes classifier for binary data is the simplest of these, so it seems like a good example.  
 
When Naive Bayes is used, a set of probabilities of the form  Pr’(feature i | label)  are estimated via counting statistics and some prior.  Predictions are made according to the label maximizing: 
  Pr’(label) * Product features i  Pr’(feature i | label)  
 
(The  Pr’  notation indicates these are estimated values.) 
 
There is nothing wrong with this method as long as (a) the prior for the sample counts is</p><p>6 0.70856261 <a title="174-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-07-A_NIPS_paper.html">330 hunch net-2008-12-07-A NIPS paper</a></p>

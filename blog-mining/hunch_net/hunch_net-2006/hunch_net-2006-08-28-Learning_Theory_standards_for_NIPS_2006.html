<p>Introduction: Normally, I don’t indulge in posters for  ICML , but this year is naturally an exception for me.   If you want one, there are a small number  left here , if you sign up before February.
 
It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting papers.  At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers.  Program chairs setup the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the reviewing process.  Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the community determine the conference.  Nevertheless, as a program chair this year it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to encourage (and occasionally discourage).

There are several difficulties.
  
  When creating the presentation, the correct level of detail is tricky.  With too much detail, the proof takes too much time and people may be lost to boredom.  With too little detail, the steps of the proof involve too-great a jump. This is very difficult to judge.

<p>Introduction: Claire  asked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite a bit of work.
 
I had a relatively light load—merely 49 theory papers.  Many of these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help review the papers.  I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally.  There were a couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.
 
There are some differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and theory communities.  In machine learning it is expected that a review be detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case.  Every paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very detailed.  
 
I’m sure not every author was happy with the outcome.  While we did our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make.

<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on this  post  and some of the previous  problems/research directions  about where learning theory might make large strides.  
  
  Why theory?   The essential reason for theory is “intuition extension”.  A very good applied learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the best computer algorithms for solving that problem.  A very good theory can take the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion.  To do this, we take these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:
 
 Explains the basic intuitions. 
 Makes new testable predictions about how to learn. 
 Succeeds in so learning. 
 

This is “intuition extension”: taking what we have learned somewhere else and applying it in new domains.  It is fundamentally useful to everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving problems.

<p>Introduction: It’s reviewing season right now, so I thought I would list (at a high level) the sorts of problems which I see in papers.  Hopefully, this will help us all write better papers.
 
The following flaws are fatal to any paper:
  
  Incorrect theorem or lemma statements  A typo might be “ok”, if it can be understood.  Any theorem or lemma which indicates an incorrect understanding of reality must be rejected.  Not doing so would severely harm the integrity of the conference.  A paper rejected for this reason must be fixed. 
  Lack of Understanding  If a paper is understood by none of the (typically 3) reviewers then it must be rejected for the same reason.  This is more controversial than it sounds because there are some people who maximize paper complexity in the hope of impressing the reviewer.  The tactic sometimes succeeds with some reviewers (but not with me).

As a reviewer, I sometimes get lost for stupid reasons.  This is why an anonymized  communication channel  with the author can</p><p>3 0.71779412 <a title="204-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-10-Precision_is_not_accuracy.html">202 hunch net-2006-08-10-Precision is not accuracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my experience, there are two different groups of people who believe the same thing: the mathematics encountered in typical machine learning conference papers is often of questionable value. 
The two groups who agree on this are applied machine learning people who have given up on math, and mature theoreticians who understand the limits of theory. 
 
Partly, this is just a statement about where we are with respect to machine learning.  In particular, we have no mechanism capable of generating a prescription for how to solve all learning problems.  In the absence of such certainty, people try to come up with formalisms that partially describe and motivate how and why they do things.  This is natural and healthy—we might hope that it will eventually lead to just such a mechanism.
 
But, part of this is simply an emphasis on complexity over clarity.  A very natural and simple theoretical statement is often obscured by complexifications.  Common sources of complexification include:</p><p>4 0.67634273 <a title="204-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-10-ICML_Reviewing_Criteria.html">325 hunch net-2008-11-10-ICML Reviewing Criteria</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael Littman  and  Leon Bottou  have decided to use a franchise program chair approach to  reviewing at ICML  this year.  I’ll be one of the area chairs, so I wanted to mention a few things if you are thinking about naming me.
  
 I take reviewing seriously.  That means papers to be reviewed are read, the implications are considered, and decisions are only made after that.  I do my best to be fair, and there are zero subjects that I consider categorical rejects.  I don’t consider several  arguments for rejection-not-on-the-merits reasonable . 
 I am generally interested in papers that (a) analyze new models of machine learning, (b) provide new algorithms, and (c) show that they work empirically on plausibly real problems.  If a paper has the trifecta, I’m particularly interested. With 2 out of 3, I might be interested.  I often find papers with only one element harder to accept, including papers with just (a).  
 I’m a bit tough.  I rarely jump-up-and-down about a paper, because I b</p><p>5 0.67536044 <a title="204-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-25-Presentation_of_Proofs_is_Hard..html">187 hunch net-2006-06-25-Presentation of Proofs is Hard.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For most people, a mathematical notation is like a language: you learn it and stick with it.  For people doing mathematical research, however, this is not enough: they must design new notations for new problems.  The design of good notation is both hard and worthwhile since a bad initial notation can retard a line of research greatly.  
 
Before we had mathematical notation, equations were all written out in language.  Since words have multiple meanings and variable precedences, long equations written out in language can be extraordinarily difficult and sometimes fundamentally ambiguous.  A good representative example of this is the legalese in the tax code.  Since we want greater precision and clarity, we adopt mathematical notation.
 
One fundamental thing to understand about mathematical notation, is that humans as logic verifiers, are barely capable.  This is the fundamental reason why one notation can be much better than another.  This observation is easier to miss than you might</p><p>2 0.90380454 <a title="204-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-19-How_is_Compressed_Sensing_going_to_change_Machine_Learning_%3F.html">248 hunch net-2007-06-19-How is Compressed Sensing going to change Machine Learning ?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Compressed Sensing  (CS) is a new framework developed by  Emmanuel Candes ,  Terry Tao  and  David Donoho . To summarize, if you acquire a signal in some basis that is incoherent with the basis in which you know the signal to be sparse in, it is very likely you will be able to reconstruct the signal from these incoherent projections. 
 
Terry Tao, the recent  Fields medalist , does a very nice job at explaining the framework  here . He goes further in the theory description in this  post  where he mentions the central issue of the Uniform Uncertainty Principle. It so happens that random projections are on average incoherent, within the UUP meaning, with most known basis (sines, polynomials, splines, wavelets, curvelets …) and are therefore an ideal basis for Compressed Sensing. [ For more in-depth information on the subject, the Rice group has done a very good job at providing a central library of papers relevant to the growing subject:  http://www.dsp.ece.rice.edu/cs/  ]

<p>Introduction: Bob Williamson  and I are the learning theory PC members at  NIPS  this year.  This is some attempt to state the standards and tests I applied to the papers.  I think it is a good idea to talk about this for two reasons:
  
 Making community standards a matter of public record seems healthy.  It give us a chance to debate what is and is not the right standard.  It might even give us a bit more consistency across the years. 
 It may save us all time.  There are a number of papers submitted which just aren’t there yet.  Avoiding submitting is the right decision in this case. 
  
There are several criteria for judging a paper.  All of these were active this year.  Some criteria are uncontroversial while others may be so.
  
 The paper must have a theorem establishing something new for which it is possible to derive high confidence in the correctness of the results.  A surprising number of papers fail this test.  This criteria seems essential to the definition of “theory”.

<p>Introduction: I want to comment on the “Bing copies Google” discussion  here ,  here , and  here , because there are data-related issues which the general public may not understand, and some of the framing seems substantially misleading to me.
 
As a not-distant-outsider, let me mention the sources of bias I may have.  I work at  Yahoo! , which has started using  Bing .  This might predispose me towards Bing, but on the other hand I’m still at Yahoo!, and have been using  Linux  exclusively as an OS for many years, including even a couple minor kernel patches.  And,  on the gripping hand , I’ve spent quite a bit of time thinking about the basic  principles of incorporating user feedback in machine learning .  Also note, this post is not  related to official Yahoo! policy, it’s just my personal view.
 
 The issue  Google engineers inserted synthetic responses to synthetic queries on google.com, then executed the synthetic searches on google.com using Internet Explorer with the Bing toolbar and later</p><p>5 0.84637856 <a title="204-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-17-Server_Update.html">354 hunch net-2009-05-17-Server Update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The hunch.net server has been updated.  I’ve taken the opportunity to upgrade the version of wordpress which caused cascading changes.
  
 Old threaded comments are now flattened.  The system we used to use ( Brian’s threaded comments ) appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress.  I haven’t yet figured out a workaround. 
 I setup a  feedburner account . 
 I added an RSS aggregator for both Machine Learning and other research blogs that I like to follow.  This is something that I’ve wanted to do for awhile. 
 Many other minor changes in font and format, with some help from  Alina .

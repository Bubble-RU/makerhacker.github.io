<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult. As a
conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good
papers--enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to
(generally) to grow the conference. For someone choosing to participate in a
new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a
paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work
out? Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you
are sure will work?The conference founding problem is a joint agreement
problem with a very significant barrier. Workshops are a way around this
problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective
means for this. A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to
speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available. Presenting
work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a
conference. F</p><p>3 0.15785249 <a title="146-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>4 0.1490849 <a title="146-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-27-Conferences%2C_Workshops%2C_and_Tutorials.html">174 hunch net-2006-04-27-Conferences, Workshops, and Tutorials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are
coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.It's entirely reasonable for
anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don't have a paper. For
students, visiting a conference is almost a 'must'--there is no where else
that a broad cross-section of research is on display.Workshops are also a very
good idea.ICML has 11,KDD has 9, andAAAI has 19. Workshops provide an
opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research. They
are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research
because they are so interactive.Tutorials are a good way to gain some
understanding of a long-standing direction of research. They are generally
more coherent than workshops.ICML has 7andAAAI has 15.</p><p>5 0.14787892 <a title="146-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-13-%26%238220%3BSister_Conference%26%238221%3B_presentations.html">93 hunch net-2005-07-13-&#8220;Sister Conference&#8221; presentations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Some of the "sister conference" presentations atAAAIhave been great. Roughly
speaking, the conference organizers asked other conference organizers to come
give a summary of their conference. Many different AI-related conferences
accepted. The presenters typically discuss some of the background and goals of
the conference then mention the results from a few papers they liked. This is
great because it provides a mechanism to get a digested overview of the work
of several thousand researchers--something which is simply available nowhere
else.Based on these presentations, it looks like there is a significant
component of (and opportunity for) applied machine learning inAIIDE,IUI,
andACL.There was also some discussion of having a super-colocation event
similar toFCRC, but centered on AI & Learning. This seems like a fine idea.
The field is fractured across so many different conferences that the mixing of
a supercolocation seems likely helpful for research.</p><p>6 0.13085459 <a title="146-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: (update:cross-postedonCACM)For the first time in several years,ICML 2010did
not havevideolecturesattending. Luckily, thetutorial on exploration and
learningwhichAlinaand I put together canbe viewed, since we also presented
atKDD 2010, which included videolecture support.ICML didn't cover the cost of
a videolecture, becausePASCALdidn't provide a grant for it this year. On the
other hand, KDD covered it out of registration costs. The cost of
videolectures isn't cheap. Fora workshopthe baseline quote we have is 270 euro
per hour, plus a similar cost for the cameraman's travel and accomodation.
This can be reduced substantially by having a volunteer with a camera handle
the cameraman duties, uploading the video and slides to be processed for a
quoted 216 euro per hour.Youtubeis the most predominant free video site with a
cost of $0, but it turns out to be a poor alternative.15 minute upload

<p>Introduction: Adam Kalaipoints out theNew England Machine Learning DayMay 1 at MSR New
England. There is a poster session with abstracts due April 19. I understand
last year'sNEMLwent well and it's great to meet your neighbors at regional
workshops like this.</p><p>2 0.96219361 <a title="146-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-04-Research_Budget_Changes.html">154 hunch net-2006-02-04-Research Budget Changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is
encouraging. There is some discussion of this at theComputing Research
Policyblog.One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time,
presumably in dollar budgets. I don't believe that dollar budgets are the
right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers. A better way
to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a
measure of the relative emphasis on research.This graph was assembled by
dividing theNSF budgetby theUS GDP. For 2005 GDP, I used thecurrent
estimateand for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per
year. The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to
change.This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding
emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row. The reality has been significantly
more severe due toDARPA decreasing fundingand industrial research labs (ATnT

<p>Introduction: A $1M qualifying result was achieved on thepublic Netflix test setby a3-way
ensemble team. This is just in time forYehuda's presentation atKDD, which I'm
sure will be one of the best attended ever.This isn't quite over--there are a
few days for another super-conglomerate team to come together and there is
some small chance that the performance is nonrepresentative of the final test
set, but I expect not.Regardless of the final outcome, the biggest lesson for
ML from the Netflix contest has been the formidable performance edge of
ensemble methods.</p><p>4 0.91792554 <a title="146-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-01-03-Herman_Goldstine_2011.html">421 hunch net-2011-01-03-Herman Goldstine 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Vikaspoints out theHerman Goldstine FellowshipatIBM. I was a Herman Goldstine
Fellow, and benefited from the experience a great deal--that's where work on
learning reductions started. If you can do research independently, it's
recommended. Applications are due January 6.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.89581704 <a title="146-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-06-MLTV.html">146 hunch net-2006-01-06-MLTV</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As part of aPASCALproject, the Slovenians have been filming various machine
learning events and placing them on the webhere. This includes, for example,
theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer Schoolas well as a number of other
summer schools, workshops, and conferences.There are some significant caveats
here--for example, I can't access it from Linux. Based upon the webserver
logs, I expect that is a problem for most people--Computer scientists are
particularly nonstandard in their choice of computing platform.Nevertheless,
the core idea here is excellent and details of compatibility can be fixed
later. With modern technology toys, there is no fundamental reason why the
process of announcing new work at a conference should happen only once and
only for the people who could make it to that room in that conference. The
problems solved include:The multitrack vs. single-track debate. ("Sometimes
the single track doesn't interest me" vs. "When it's multitrack I miss good
talks""I couldn't</p><p>6 0.88440943 <a title="146-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-05-Funding_Research.html">36 hunch net-2005-03-05-Funding Research</a></p>

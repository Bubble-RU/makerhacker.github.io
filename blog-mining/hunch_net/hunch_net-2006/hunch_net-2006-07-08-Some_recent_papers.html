<p>Introduction: One nice use for this blog is to consider and discuss papers that that have
appeared at recent conferences. I really enjoyed Andrew Ng and Sham Kakade's
paperOnline Bounds for Bayesian Algorithms. From the paper:The philosophy
taken in the Bayesian methodology is often at odds withthat in the online
learning community…. the online learning settingmakes rather minimal
assumptions on the conditions under which thedata are being presented to the
learner â€”usually, Nature could provideexamples in an adversarial manner. We
study the performance ofBayesian algorithms in a more adversarial setting… We
providecompetitive bounds when the cost function is the log loss, and
wecompare our performance to the best model in our model class (as inthe
experts setting).It's a very nice analysis of some of my favorite algorithms
that all hinges around a beautiful theorem:Let Q be any distribution over
parameters theta. Then for all sequences S:L_{Bayes}(S) leq L_Q(S) +
KL(Q|P)where P is our prior and th</p><p>3 0.099127978 <a title="192-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-23-Problem%3A_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Classification.html">27 hunch net-2005-02-23-Problem: Reinforcement Learning with Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At an intuitive level, the question here is "Can reinforcement learning be
solved with classification?"ProblemConstruct a reinforcement learning
algorithm with near-optimal expected sum of rewards in thedirect experience
modelgiven access to a classifier learning algorithm which has a small error
rate or regret on all posed classification problems. The definition of "posed"
here is slightly murky. I consider a problem "posed" if there is an algorithm
for constructing labeled classification examples.Past WorkThere exists
areduction of reinforcement learning to classification given a generative
model.A generative model is an inherently stronger assumption than the direct
experience model.Otherwork on learning reductionsmay be important.Several
algorithms for solving reinforcement learning in the direct experience model
exist. Most, such asE3,Factored-E3, andmetric-E3andRmaxrequire that the
observation be the state. Recent workextends this approach to POMDPs.This
problem is related topred</p><p>4 0.097360633 <a title="192-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-27-Continuizing_Solutions.html">220 hunch net-2006-11-27-Continuizing Solutions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about a general technique for problem solving which I've never
seen taught (in full generality), but which I've found very useful.Many
problems in computer science turn out to be discretely difficult. The best
known version of such problems are NP-hard problems, but I mean 'discretely
difficult' in a much more general way, which I only know how to capture by
examples.ERMIn empirical risk minimization, you choose a minimum error rate
classifier from a set of classifiers. This is NP hard for common sets, but it
can be much harder, depending on the set.ExpertsIn the online learning with
experts setting, you try to predict well so as to compete with a set of
(adversarial) experts. Here the alternating quantifiers of you and an
adversary playing out a game can yield a dynamic programming problem that
grows exponentially.Policy IterationThe problem with policy iteration is that
you learn a new policy with respect to an old policy, which implies that
simply adopting the new polic</p><p>5 0.091898039 <a title="192-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-13-Sam_Roweis_died.html">386 hunch net-2010-01-13-Sam Roweis died</a></p>
<p>Introduction: and I can't help but remember him.I first metSamas an undergraduate
atCaltechwhere he was TA forHopfield's class, and again when I visitedGatsby,
when he invited me to visitToronto, and at too many conferences to recount.
His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great
ability to phrase a problem so it's solution must be understood. With respect
to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to makemy first tutorial,
leading to others, and to other things, all of which I'm grateful to him for.
In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.His
death isbeing called a suicidewhich is so incompatible with my understanding
of Sam that it strains my credibility. But we know that his many
responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane
researchers have legions of inner doubts. Having been depressed now and then
myself, it's helpful to understand at least intellectually that the true

<p>Introduction: Pieter Abbeelpresented a paper withAndrew NgatICMLonExploration and
Apprenticeship Learning in Reinforcement Learning. The basic idea of this
algorithm is:Collect data from a human controlling a machine.Build a
transition model based upon the experience.Build a policy which optimizes the
transition model.Evaluate the policy. If it works well, halt, otherwise add
the experience into the pool and go to (2).The paper proves that this
technique will converge to some policy with expected performance near human
expected performance assuming the world fits certain assumptions (MDP or
linear dynamics).This general idea of apprenticeship learning (i.e.
incorporating data from an expert) seems very compelling because (a) humans
often learn this way and (b) much harder problems can be solved. For (a), the
notion of teaching is about transferring knowledge from an expert to novices,
often via demonstration. To see (b), note that we can create intricate
reinforcement learning problems where a parti</p><p>3 0.53948677 <a title="192-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-18-ICML_%26%23038%3B_COLT_2010.html">403 hunch net-2010-07-18-ICML &#038; COLT 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The Gibbs-Jaynes theorem is a classical result that tells us that the highest
entropy distribution (most uncertain, least committed, etc.) subject to
expectation constraints on a set of features is an exponential family
distribution with the features as sufficient statistics. In math,argmax_p
H(p)s.t. E_p[f_i] = c_iis given by e^{\sum \lambda_i f_i}/Z. (Z here is the
necessary normalization constraint, and the lambdas are free parameters we set
to meet the expectation constraints).A great deal of statistical mechanics
flows from this result, and it has proven very fruitful in learning as well.
(Motivating work in models in text learning and Conditional Random Fields, for
instance. ) The result has been demonstrated a number of ways. One of the most
elegant is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“geometricÃ¢â‚¬Â versionhere.In the case when the
expectation constraints come from data, this tells us that the maximum entropy
distribution is exactly the maximum likelihood distribution in the exponential
family. ItÃ</p><p>5 0.51651084 <a title="192-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-28-Yet_more_nips_thoughts.html">144 hunch net-2005-12-28-Yet more nips thoughts</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I only managed to make it out to the NIPS workshops this year soI'll give my
comments on what I saw there.The Learing and Robotics workshops lives again. I
hope itcontinues and gets more high quality papers in the future. Themost
interesting talk for me was Larry Jackel's on the LAGRprogram (see John's
previous post on said program). I got someideas as to what progress has been
made. Larry really explainedthe types of benchmarks and the tradeoffs that had
to be made tomake the goals achievable but challenging.Hal Daume gave a very
interesting talk about structuredprediction using RL techniques, something
near and dear to my ownheart. He achieved rather impressive results using only
a verygreedy search.The non-parametric Bayes workshop was great. I enjoyed the
entiremorning session I spent there, and particularly (the usuallydesultory)
discussion periods. One interesting topic was theGibbs/Variational inference
divide. I won't try to summarizeespecially as no conclusion was reached. It</p><p>6 0.51643848 <a title="192-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-14-More_NIPS_Papers_II.html">140 hunch net-2005-12-14-More NIPS Papers II</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Since learning is far from an exact science, it's good to pay attention to
basic intuitions of applied learning. Here are a few I've
collected.IntegrationIn Bayesian learning, the posterior is computed by an
integral, and the optimal thing to do is to predict according to this
integral. This phenomena seems to be far more general. Bagging, Boosting,
SVMs, and Neural Networks all take advantage of this idea to some extent. The
phenomena is more general: you can average over many differentclassification
predictorsto improve performance.
Sources:Zoubin,CaruanaDifferentiationDifferent pieces of an average should
differentiate to achieve good performance by different methods. This is know
as the 'symmetry breaking' problem for neural networks, and it's why weights
are initialized randomly. Boosting explicitly attempts to achieve good
differentiation by creating new, different, learning problems. Sources:Yann

<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś and you should use that fact.A workshop differs from a conference in that it
is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic. It also
differs in that a workshop is typically a "one-time affair" rather than a
series. (TheSnowbird learning workshopcounts as a conference in this
respect.)A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop
is to treat it as a conference. This is "ok", but it is not really taking
advantage of the situation. Here are some things I've learned:For speakers: A
smaller audience means it can be more interactive. Interactive means a better
chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation
(because you can adapt to your audience). Greater focus amongst the
participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and
discuss tradeoffs more carefully. Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued
than newness.For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference style

<p>Introduction: Many people in machine learning take advantage of the notion of a proxy loss:
A loss function which is much easier to optimize computationally than the loss
function imposed by the world. A canonical example is when we want to learn a
weight vectorwand predict according to a dot productfw(x)= sumiwixiwhere
optimizing squared loss(y-fw(x))2over many samples is much more tractable than
optimizing 0-1 lossI(y = Threshold(fw(x) - 0.5)).While the computational
advantages of optimizing a proxy loss are substantial, we are curious: which
proxy loss is best? The answer of course depends on what the real loss imposed
by the world is. For 0-1 loss classification, there are adherents to many
choices:Log loss. If we confine the prediction to[0,1], we can treat it as a
predicted probability that the label is1, and measure loss according tolog
1/p'(y|x)wherep'(y|x)is the predicted probability of the observed label. A
standard method for confining the prediction to[0,1]islogistic regressionwhich

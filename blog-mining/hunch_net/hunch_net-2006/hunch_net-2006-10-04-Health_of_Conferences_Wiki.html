<p>Introduction: Chicago ’05  ended a couple of weeks ago. This was the sixth  Machine Learning Summer School , and the second one that used a  wiki . (The first was Berder ’04, thanks to Gunnar Raetsch.) Wikis are relatively easy to set up, greatly aid social interaction, and should be used a lot more at summer schools and workshops. They can even be used as the meeting’s webpage, as a permanent record of its participants’ collaborations — see for example the wiki/website for last year’s  NVO Summer School .
 
A basic wiki is a collection of editable webpages, maintained by software called a   wiki engine . The engine used at both Berder and Chicago was  TikiWiki  — it is well documented and gets you something running fast. It uses PHP and MySQL, but doesn’t require you to know either. Tikiwiki has far more features than most wikis, as it is  really a full  Content Management System . (My thanks to Sebastian Stark for pointing this out.) Here are the features we found most useful:

<p>Introduction: Data linkage is a problem which seems to come up in various applied machine learning problems.  I have heard it mentioned in various data mining contexts, but it seems relatively less studied for systemic reasons.
 
A very simple version of the data linkage problem is a cross hospital patient record merge.  Suppose a patient (John Doe) is admitted to a hospital (General Health), treated, and released.  Later, John Doe is admitted to a second hospital (Health General), treated, and released.  Given a large number of records of this sort, it becomes very tempting to try and predict the outcomes of treatments.  This is reasonably straightforward as a machine learning problem if there is a shared unique identifier for John Doe used by General Health and Health General along with time stamps.  We can merge the records and create examples of the form “Given symptoms and treatment, did the patient come back to a hospital within the next year?”  These examples could be fed into a learning algo</p><p>4 0.1007174 <a title="212-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-04-The_Health_of_COLT.html">89 hunch net-2005-07-04-The Health of COLT</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The health of  COLT  (Conference on Learning Theory or Computational Learning Theory depending on who you ask) has been questioned over the last few years.  Low points for the conference occurred when  EuroCOLT  merged with COLT in 2001, and the attendance at the 2002 Sydney COLT fell to a new low.  This occurred in the general context of machine learning conferences rising in both number and size over the last decade.
 
Any discussion of  why  COLT has had difficulties is inherently controversial as is any story about well-intentioned people making the wrong decisions.   Nevertheless, this may be worth discussing in the hope of avoiding problems in the future and general understanding.  In any such discussion there is a strong tendency to identify with a conference/community in a patriotic manner that is detrimental to thinking.  Keep in mind that conferences exist to further research.
 
My understanding (I wasn’t around) is that COLT started as a subcommunity of the computer science</p><p>5 0.093587048 <a title="212-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-17-Learning_Research_Programs.html">21 hunch net-2005-02-17-Learning Research Programs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an attempt to organize the broad research programs related to machine learning currently underway.  This isn’t easy—this map is partial, the categories often overlap, and there are many details left out.  Nevertheless, it is (perhaps) helpful to have some map of what is happening where.  The word ‘typical’ should not be construed narrowly here.
  
  Learning Theory  Focuses on analyzing mathematical models of learning, essentially no experiments.  Typical conference: COLT. 
  Bayesian Learning  Bayes law is always used. Focus on methods of speeding up or approximating integration, new probabilistic models, and practical applications.  Typical conferences: NIPS,UAI 
  Structured learning  Predicting complex structured outputs, some applications. Typiical conferences: NIPS, UAI, others 
  Reinforcement Learning  Focused on ‘agent-in-the-world’ learning problems where the goal is optimizing reward.  Typical conferences: ICML

<p>Introduction: Perhaps the biggest CS prize for research is the  Turing Award , which has a $0.25M cash prize associated with it.  It appears none of the prizes so far have been for anything like machine learning (the closest are perhaps database awards).
 
In CS theory, there is the  GÃƒÂ¶del Prize  which is smaller and newer, offering a $5K prize along and perhaps (more importantly) recognition.  One such award has been given for Machine Learning, to  Robert Schapire  and  Yoav Freund  for Adaboost.
 
In Machine Learning, there seems to be no equivalent of these sorts of prizes.  There are several plausible reasons for this:
  
 
 There is no coherent community. 
  People drift in and out of the central conferences all the time.  Most of the author names from 10 years ago do not occur in the conferences of today.  In addition, the entire subject area is fairly new. 
 There are at least a core group of people who have stayed around.

<p>Introduction: Some of the “sister conference” presentations at  AAAI  have been great.  Roughly speaking, the conference organizers asked other conference organizers to come give a summary of their conference.  Many different AI-related conferences accepted.  The presenters typically discuss some of the background and goals of the conference then mention the results from a few papers they liked.  This is great because it provides a mechanism to get a digested overview of the work of several thousand researchers—something which is simply available nowhere else.
 
Based on these presentations, it looks like there is a significant component of (and opportunity for) applied machine learning in  AIIDE ,  IUI , and  ACL .
 
There was also some discussion of having a super-colocation event similar to  FCRC , but centered on AI & Learning.  This seems like a fine idea.  The field is fractured across so many different conferences that the mixing of a supercolocation seems likely helpful for research.</p><p>6 0.43186849 <a title="212-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-17-Rexa_is_live.html">173 hunch net-2006-04-17-Rexa is live</a></p>

<p>Introduction: and I can’t help but remember him.
 
I first met  Sam  as an undergraduate at  Caltech  where he was TA for  Hopfield ‘s class, and again when I visited  Gatsby , when he invited me to visit  Toronto , and at too many conferences to recount.  His personality was a combination of enthusiastic and thoughtful, with a great ability to phrase a problem so it’s solution must be understood.  With respect to my own work, Sam was the one who advised me to make  my first tutorial , leading to others, and to other things, all of which I’m grateful to him for.  In fact, my every interaction with Sam was positive, and that was his way.
 
His death is  being called a suicide  which is so incompatible with my understanding of Sam that it strains my credibility.  But we know that his many responsibilities were great, and it is well understood that basically all sane researchers have legions of inner doubts.  Having been depressed now and then myself, it’s helpful to understand at least intellectually</p><p>6 0.52163458 <a title="212-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-12-01-NIPS_tutorials_and_Vowpal_Wabbit_7.4.html">492 hunch net-2013-12-01-NIPS tutorials and Vowpal Wabbit 7.4</a></p>

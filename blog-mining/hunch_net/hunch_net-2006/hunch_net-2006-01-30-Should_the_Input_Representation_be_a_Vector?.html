<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple. Viewed
representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear
separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or
perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural
networks or kernelized SVMs). Should we go beyond this, and start using "deep"
representations?What is deep learning?Intuitively, deep learning is about
learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the
input (observed) features.Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be
rather difficult. Consider the following cases:SVM with Gaussian Kernel. This
is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can't
succinctly represent certain decision surfaces. One ofYann LeCun's examples is
recognizing objects based on pixel values. An SVM will need a new support
vector for each significantly different background. Since the number of
distinct backgrounds i</p><p>3 0.12589908 <a title="152-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-11-Interesting_Neural_Network_Papers_at_ICML_2011.html">438 hunch net-2011-07-11-Interesting Neural Network Papers at ICML 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Maybe it's too early to call, but with four separate Neural Network sessions
at this year'sICML, it looks like Neural Networks are making a comeback. Here
are my highlights of these sessions. In general, my feeling is that these
papers both demystify deep learning and show its broader applicability.The
first observation I made is that the once disreputable "Neural" nomenclature
is being used againin lieu of"deep learning". Maybe it's because Adam Coates
et al. showed that single layer networks can work surprisingly well.An

Coates,Honglak Lee,Andrew Y. Ng(AISTATS 2011)The Importance of Encoding Versus
Training with Sparse Coding and Vector Quantization,Adam Coates,Andrew Y.

<p>Introduction: There are a number of learning algorithms which explicitly incorporate
randomness into their execution. This includes at amongst others:Neural
Networks. Neural networks use randomization to assign initial
weights.Boltzmann Machines/Deep Belief Networks. Boltzmann machines are
something like a stochastic version of multinode logistic regression. The use
of randomness is more essential in Boltzmann machines, because the predicted
value at test time also uses randomness.Bagging. Bagging is a process where a
learning algorithm is run several different times on several different
datasets, creating a final predictor which makes a majority vote.Policy
descent. Several algorithms in reinforcement learning such asConservative
Policy Iterationuse random bits to create stochastic policies.Experts

prediction process to achieve better theoretical guarantees.A basic question

<p>Introduction: "Deep learning" is used to describe learning architectures which have
significant depth (as a circuit).One claimis that shallow architectures (one
or two layers) can not concisely represent some functions while a circuit with
more depth can concisely represent these same functions. Proving lower bounds
on the size of a circuit is substantially harder than upper bounds (which are
constructive), but some results are known.Luca Trevisan'sclass notesdetail how
XOR is not concisely representable by "AC0â&euro;ł (= constant depth unbounded fan-in
AND, OR, NOT gates). This doesn't quite prove that depth is necessary for the
representations commonly used in learning (such as a thresholded weighted
sum), but it is strongly suggestive that this is so.Examples like this are a
bit disheartening because existing algorithms for deep learning (deep belief
nets, gradient descent on deep neural networks, and a perhaps decision trees
depending on who you ask) can't learn XOR very easily. Evidence so far

<p>Introduction: One way to distinguish different learning algorithms is by their ability or
inability to easily use an input variable as the predicted output. This is
desirable for at least two reasons:ModularityIf we want to build complex
learning systems via reuse of a subsystem, it's important to have compatible
I/O."Prior" knowledgeMachine learning is often applied in situations where we
do have some knowledge of what the right solution is, often in the form of an
existing system. In such situations, it's good to start with a learning
algorithm that can be at least as good as any existing system.When doing
classification, most learning algorithms can do this. For example, a decision
tree can split on a feature, and then classify. The real differences come up
when we attempt regression. Many of the algorithms we know and commonly use
are not idempotent predictors.Logistic regressors can not be idempotent,
because all input features are mapped through a nonlinearity.Linear regressors
can be idempote</p><p>5 0.68304551 <a title="152-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-09-Intuitions_from_applied_learning.html">16 hunch net-2005-02-09-Intuitions from applied learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since learning is far from an exact science, it's good to pay attention to
basic intuitions of applied learning. Here are a few I've
collected.IntegrationIn Bayesian learning, the posterior is computed by an
integral, and the optimal thing to do is to predict according to this
integral. This phenomena seems to be far more general. Bagging, Boosting,
SVMs, and Neural Networks all take advantage of this idea to some extent. The
phenomena is more general: you can average over many differentclassification
predictorsto improve performance.
Sources:Zoubin,CaruanaDifferentiationDifferent pieces of an average should
differentiate to achieve good performance by different methods. This is know
as the 'symmetry breaking' problem for neural networks, and it's why weights
are initialized randomly. Boosting explicitly attempts to achieve good
differentiation by creating new, different, learning problems. Sources:Yann

5 international students can not come due to visa issues. There seem to be two
aspects to visa issues:Inefficiency. The system rejected the student simply by
being incapable of evenstartingto evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of
time.Politics. Border controls became much tighter after the September 11
attack. Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will
do that.What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem
than (2). Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa
rejection. Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time
almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry
even people concerned with (2). The obvious fixes to overload are "spend more
money" and "make the system more efficient".With respect to (2), (which is a
more minor issue by the numbers) it is unclear that the political calc</p><p>2 0.89359391 <a title="152-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-29-Key_Scientific_Challenges_and_the_Franklin_Symposium.html">457 hunch net-2012-02-29-Key Scientific Challenges and the Franklin Symposium</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Machine learning makes theNew Scientist. From the article:COMPUTERS can learn
the meaning of words simply by plugging into Google. The finding could bring
forward the day that true artificial intelligence is developedâ&euro;Ś.But Paul
Vitanyi and Rudi Cilibrasi of the National Institute for Mathematics and
Computer Science in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, realised that a Google search
can be used to measure how closely two words relate to each other. For
instance, imagine a computer needs to understand what a hat is.You can read

<p>Introduction: Let's suppose that we are trying to create a general purpose machine learning
box. The box is fed many examples of the function it is supposed to learn and
(hopefully) succeeds.To date, most such attempts to produce a box of this form
take a vector as input. The elements of the vector might be bits, real
numbers, or 'categorical' data (a discrete set of values).On the other hand,
there are a number of succesful applications of machine learning which do not
seem to use a vector representation as input. For example, in
vision,convolutional neural networkshave been used to solve several vision
problems. The input to the convolutional neural network is essentially the raw
camera image as amatrix. In learning for natural languages, several people
have had success on problems like parts-of-speech tagging using predictors
restricted to a window surrounding the word to be predicted.A vector window
and a matrix both imply a notion of locality which is being actively and
effectively used by thes</p><p>5 0.84716046 <a title="152-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-12-ICML_accepted_papers_and_early_registration.html">465 hunch net-2012-05-12-ICML accepted papers and early registration</a></p>

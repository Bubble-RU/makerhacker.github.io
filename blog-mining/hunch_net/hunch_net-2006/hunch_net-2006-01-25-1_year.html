<br/><h2>meta infos for this blog</h2><p>Source: <a title="hunch_net-2006-151-html" href="http://hunch.net/?p=162">html</a></p><p>Introduction: At the one year (+5 days) anniversary, the natural question is: “Was it helpful for research?”
 
Answer: Yes, and so it shall continue.
 
Some evidence is provided by noticing that I am about a factor of 2 more overloaded with paper ideas than I’ve ever previously been.  It is always hard to estimate counterfactual worlds, but I expect that this is also a factor of 2 more than “What if I had not started the blog?”
 
As for “Why?”, there seem to be two primary effects.
  
 A blog is a mechanism for connecting with people who either think like you or are interested in the same problems.  This allows for concentration of thinking which is very helpful in solving problems. 
 The process of stating things you don’t understand publicly is very helpful in understanding them.  Sometimes you are simply forced to express them in a way which aids understanding.  Sometimes someone else says something which helps.  And sometimes you discover that someone else has already solved the problem.

<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time. 
  Feedback failure .  This blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from</p><p>3 0.24841744 <a title="151-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-issues for the moment.
 
The number of posts is a bit over 20. 
The number of people speaking up in discussions is about 10. 
The number of people viewing the site is somewhat more than 100.
 
I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many things.
  
 Many of the  potential uses  haven’t been realized.  This is partly a matter of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no open problems because it’s hard to give them up), and partly a matter of tradition.  In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get everything perfectly right before presentation.  This is somewhat contradictory to the nature of making many posts, and it’s definitely contradictory to the idea of doing “public research”.  If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to continue experimenting, I’m going to use the next week as “open problems we</p><p>4 0.22986601 <a title="151-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-21-Six_Months.html">96 hunch net-2005-07-21-Six Months</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is the  6 month point  in the “run a research blog” experiment, so it seems like a good point to take stock and assess.  
 
One fundamental question is: “Is it worth it?”  The idea of running a research blog will never become widely popular and useful unless it actually aids research.  On the negative side, composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount of time.  On the positive side, the process might yield better research because there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster thinking.
 
My answer at the moment is a provisional “yes”.  Running the blog has been incidentally helpful in several ways:
  
 It is sometimes educational.  example  
 More often, the process of composing thoughts well enough to post simply aids thinking.  This has resulted in a couple solutions to problems of  interest  (and perhaps more over time).

<p>Introduction: … and you should use that fact.
 
A workshop differs from a conference in that it is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic.  It also differs in that a workshop is typically a “one-time affair” rather than a series.  (The  Snowbird learning workshop  counts as a conference in this respect.)  
 
A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop is to treat it as a conference.  This is “ok”, but it is not really taking advantage of the situation.  Here are some things I’ve learned:
  
 For speakers: A smaller audience means it can be more interactive.  Interactive means a better chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation (because you can adapt to your audience).  Greater focus amongst the participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and discuss tradeoffs more carefully.  Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued than newness. 
 For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference st</p><p>same-blog 2 0.8927421 <a title="151-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-25-1_year.html">151 hunch net-2006-01-25-1 year</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the one year (+5 days) anniversary, the natural question is: “Was it helpful for research?”
 
Answer: Yes, and so it shall continue.
 
Some evidence is provided by noticing that I am about a factor of 2 more overloaded with paper ideas than I’ve ever previously been.  It is always hard to estimate counterfactual worlds, but I expect that this is also a factor of 2 more than “What if I had not started the blog?”
 
As for “Why?”, there seem to be two primary effects.
  
 A blog is a mechanism for connecting with people who either think like you or are interested in the same problems.  This allows for concentration of thinking which is very helpful in solving problems. 
 The process of stating things you don’t understand publicly is very helpful in understanding them.  Sometimes you are simply forced to express them in a way which aids understanding.  Sometimes someone else says something which helps.  And sometimes you discover that someone else has already solved the problem.

<p>Introduction: Founding a successful new conference is extraordinarily difficult.  As a conference founder, you must manage to attract a significant number of good papers—enough to entice the participants into participating next year and to (generally) to grow the conference.  For someone choosing to participate in a new conference, there is a very significant decision to make: do you send a paper to some new conference with no guarantee that the conference will work out?  Or do you send it to another (possibly less related) conference that you are sure will work?
 
The conference founding problem is a joint agreement problem with a very significant barrier.  Workshops are a way around this problem, and workshops attached to conferences are a particularly effective means for this.  A workshop at a conference is sure to have people available to speak and attend and is sure to have a large audience available.  Presenting work at a workshop is not generally exclusive: it can also be presented at a confe</p><p>4 0.70102155 <a title="151-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research.  They provide many roles including “announcing research”, “meeting people”, and  “point of reference”.  Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: “to what extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?”  This question is very difficult to answer in any satisfying way.  What we can do is compare details of the process across multiple conferences.
  
  Comments   The average quality of comments across conferences can vary dramatically.  At one extreme, the tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback.  At the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing detailed constructive feedback.  Detailed feedback can give authors significant guidance about how to improve research.  This is the most subjective entry. 
  Blind  Virtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors do not know reviewers.  Some also provide  double blind  review where rev</p><p>5 0.70093739 <a title="151-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML.  I did manage to catch one interesting paper:
 
 Richard Socher ,  Cliff Lin ,  Andrew Y. Ng , and  Christopher D. Manning   Parsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural Networks .
 
I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so hopefully we’ll hear from him soon.  In the meantime,  Paul  and  Hal  have posted some lists.
 
 the future 
 
 Joelle  and I are program chairs for ICML 2012 in  Edinburgh , which I previously enjoyed visiting in  2005 .  This is a huge responsibility, that we hope to accomplish well.  A part of this (perhaps the most fun part), is imagining how we can make ICML better.  A key and critical constraint is choosing things that can be accomplished.  So far we have:
  
  Colocation . The first thing we looked into was potential colocations.  We quickly discovered that many other conferences precomitted their location.

<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This

<p>Introduction: This is the6 month pointin the "run a research blog" experiment, so it seems
like a good point to take stock and assess.One fundamental question is: "Is it
worth it?" The idea of running a research blog will never become widely
popular and useful unless it actually aids research. On the negative side,
composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount
of time. On the positive side, the process might yield better research because
there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster
thinking.My answer at the moment is a provisional "yes". Running the blog has
been incidentally helpful in several ways:It is sometimes
educational.exampleMore often, the process of composing thoughts well enough
to post simply aids thinking. This has resulted in a couple solutions to
problems ofinterest(and perhaps more over time). If you really want to solve a

post scanner on the right. My understanding fromJakeis that the intention is
to have a multiauthor blog which is more specialized towards learning
theory/game theory than this one. Nevertheless, several of the posts seem to
be of wider interest.</p><p>5 0.20405242 <a title="151-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-
issues for the moment.The number of posts is a bit over 20.The number of
people speaking up in discussions is about 10.The number of people viewing the
site is somewhat more than 100.I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many
things.Many of thepotential useshaven't been realized. This is partly a matter
of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no
open problems because it's hard to give them up), and partly a matter of
tradition. In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get
everything perfectly right before presentation. This is somewhat contradictory
to the nature of making many posts, and it's definitely contradictory to the
idea of doing "public research". If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must
be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to
continue experimenting, I'm going to use the next week as "open problems
week".Spam is a problem.</p><p>6 0.13702181 <a title="151-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-10-Thinking_the_Unthought.html">91 hunch net-2005-07-10-Thinking the Unthought</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm visiting Beijing for thePao-Lu Hsu Statistics Conferenceon Machine
Learning.I had several discussions about the state of Chinese research. Given
the large population and economy, you might expect substantial research--more
than has been observed at international conferences. The fundamental problem
seems to be theCultural Revolutionwhich lobotimized higher education, and the
research associated with it. There has been a process of slow recovery since
then, which has begun to be felt in the research world via increased
participation in international conferences and (now) conferences in China.The
amount of effort going into construction in Beijing is very impressive--people
are literally building a skyscraper at night outside the window of the hotel
I'm staying at (and this is not unusual). If a small fraction of this effort
is later focused onto supporting research, the effect could be very
substantial. General growth in China's research portfolio should be expected.</p><p>2 0.96378022 <a title="151-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-17-Rexa_is_live.html">173 hunch net-2006-04-17-Rexa is live</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Let me add to John's post with a few of my own favouritesfrom this year's
conference. First, let me say thatSanjoy's talk,Coarse Sample Complexity
Bounds for ActiveLearningwas also one of my favourites, as was theForgettron
paper.I also really enjoyed the last third ofChristos'talkon the complexity of
finding Nash equilibria.And, speaking of tagging, I thinkthe U.Mass Citeseer
replacement systemRexafrom the demo track is very cool.Finally, let me add my
recommendations for specific papers:Z. Ghahramani, K. Heller:Bayesian Sets[no
preprint](A very elegant probabilistic information retrieval style modelof
which objects are "most like" a given subset of objects.)T. Griffiths, Z.
Ghahramani:Infinite Latent Feature Models andthe Indian Buffet
Process[preprint](A Dirichlet style prior over infinite binary matrices
withbeautiful exchangeability properties.)K. Weinberger, J. Blitzer, L.

<p>Introduction: NIPSis the big winter conference of learning.Paper due date: June 3rd.
(Tweaked thanks toFei Sha.)Location: Vancouver (main program) Dec. 5-8 and
Whistler (workshops) Dec 9-10, BC, CanadaNIPS is larger than all of the other
learning conferences, partly because it's the only one at that time of year. I
recommend the workshops which are often quite interesting and energetic.</p><p>5 0.91332483 <a title="151-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-18-A_paper_not_at_Snowbird.html">431 hunch net-2011-04-18-A paper not at Snowbird</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, a scheduling failure meant I missed all ofAIStatand most of
thelearning workshop, otherwise known as Snowbird, when it's atSnowbird.At
snowbird, the talk onSum-Productnetworks byHoifung Poonstood out to me (Pedro
Domingosis a coauthor.). The basic point was that by appropriately
constructing networks based on sums and products, the normalization problem in
probabilistic models is eliminated, yielding a highly tractable yet flexible
representation+learning algorithm. As an algorithm, this is noticeably cleaner
than deep belief networks with a claim to being an order of magnitude faster
and working better on an image completion task.Snowbird doesn't have real
papers--just the abstract above. I look forward to seeing the paper. (added:
Rodrigo points out the deep learning workshopdraft.)</p><p>same-blog 6 0.91042 <a title="151-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-25-1_year.html">151 hunch net-2006-01-25-1 year</a></p>

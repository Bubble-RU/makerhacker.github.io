<p>Introduction: This post is about a reductions-related problem that I find mysterious.  There are two kinds of reductions analysis currently under consideration.
  
 Error limiting reductions.  Here, the goal is to bound the error rate of the created classifier in terms of the error rate of the binary classifiers that you reduce to.  A very simple example of this is that  error correcting output codes  where it is possible to prove that for certain codes, the multiclass error rate is at most 4 * the binary classifier error rate. 
 Regret minimizing reductions.  Here, the goal is to bound the  regret  of the created classifier in terms of the  regret  of the binary classifiers reduced to.  The regret is the error rate minus the minimum error rate.  When the learning problem is noisy the minimum error rate may not be  0 .

<p>Introduction: This  problem  has been cracked (but not quite completely solved) by  Alina ,  Pradeep , and  I .  The problem is essentially finding a better way to reduce multiclass classification to binary classification.  The solution is to use a carefully crafted tournament,  the simplest version of which is a  single elimination tournament  where the “players” are the different classes.  An example of the structure is here: 
    
For the single elimination tournament, we can prove that: 
 For all multiclass problems  D , for all learned binary classifiers  c , the regret of an induced multiclass classifier is bounded by the regret of the binary classifier times  log 2  k .  Restated:  
  reg multiclass (D,Filter_tree_test(c)) <= reg binary  (Filter_tree_train(D),c)    
Here:
  
   Filter_tree_train(D)  is the induced binary classification problem 
   Filter_tree_test(c)  is the induced multiclass classifier.

<p>Introduction: A type of prediction problem is specified by the type of samples produced by a data source (Example:  X x {0,1} ,  X x [0,1] ,  X x {1,2,3,4,5} , etc…) and a loss function (0/1 loss, squared error loss, cost sensitive losses, etc…).  For simplicity, we’ll assume that all losses have a minimum of zero.
 
For this post, we can think of a learning reduction as
  
 A mapping  R  from samples of one type  T  (like multiclass classification) to another type  T’  (like binary classification). 
 A mapping  Q  from predictors for type  T’  to predictors for type  T . 
  
The simplest sort of learning reduction is a “loss reduction”.  The idea in a loss reduction is to prove a statement of the form: 
 Theorem  For all base predictors  b , for all distributions  D  over examples of type  T : 
  E (x,y) ~ D  L T (y,Q(b,x)) <= f(E (x’,y’)~R(D)  L T’ (y’,b(x’)))   
Here  L T   is the loss for the type  T  problem and  L T’   is the loss for the type  T’  problem.  Also,  R(D)  is the distribution ov</p><p>5 0.2722849 <a title="181-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-07-The_State_of_the_Reduction.html">14 hunch net-2005-02-07-The State of the Reduction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What?  Reductions are machines which turn solvers for one problem into solvers for another problem. 
 Why?  Reductions are useful for several reasons.
  
  Laziness .  Reducing a problem to classification make at least 10 learning algorithms available to solve a problem.  Inventing 10 learning algorithms is quite a bit of work.  Similarly, programming a reduction is often trivial, while programming a learning algorithm is a great deal of work. 
  Crystallization .  The problems we often want to solve in learning are worst-case-impossible, but average case feasible.  By reducing all problems onto one or a few primitives, we can fine tune these primitives to perform well on real-world problems with greater precision due to the greater number of problems to validate on. 
  Theoretical Organization .  By studying what reductions are easy vs. hard vs. impossible, we can learn which problems are roughly equivalent in difficulty and which are much harder.

<p>Introduction: For  learning reductions  we have been concentrating on reducing various complex learning problems to binary classification.  This choice needs to be actively questioned, because it was not carefully considered.
 
Binary clasification is learning a classifier  c:X -> {0,1}  so as to minimize the probability of being wrong,  Pr x,y~D (c(x)   y)  .
 
The primary alternative candidate seems to be squared error regression.  In squared error regression, you learn a regressor  s:X -> [0,1]  so as to minimize squared error,  E x,y~D  (s(x)-y) 2  .
 
It is difficult to judge one primitive against another.  The judgement must at least partially be made on nontheoretical grounds because (essentially) we are evaluating a choice between two axioms/assumptions.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo released the  Key Scientific Challenges  program.  There is a  Machine Learning  list I worked on and a  Statistics  list which  Deepak  worked on.
 
I’m hoping this is taken quite seriously by graduate students.  The primary value, is that it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research which would be valuable to make progress on.  A good strategy for a beginning graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make substantial advances for a PhD.  The directions are sufficiently general that I’m sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.
 
A secondary point, (which I’m sure is primary for many    ) is that there is money for graduate students here.  It’s unrestricted, so you can use it for any reasonable travel, supplies, etc…</p><p>2 0.97867233 <a title="181-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-20-Machine_Learning_in_the_News.html">125 hunch net-2005-10-20-Machine Learning in the News</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The New York Times had a  short interview  about machine learning in datamining being used pervasively by the IRS and large corporations to predict who to audit and who to target for various marketing campaigns.  This is a big application area of machine learning.  It can be harmful (learning + databases = another way to invade privacy) or beneficial (as google demonstrates, better targeting of marketing campaigns is far less annoying).  This is yet more evidence that we can not rely upon “I’m just another fish in the school” logic for our expectations about treatment by government and large corporations.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.97861588 <a title="181-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-23-What_is_the_best_regret_transform_reduction_from_multiclass_to_binary%3F.html">181 hunch net-2006-05-23-What is the best regret transform reduction from multiclass to binary?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is about an open problem in learning reductions.
 
 Background  A reduction might transform a a multiclass prediction problem where there are  k  possible labels into a binary learning problem where there are only 2 possible labels.   On this induced binary problem we might learn a binary classifier with some error rate  e .  After subtracting the minimum possible (Bayes) error rate  b , we get a regret  r = e – b .  The  PECOC (Probabilistic Error Correcting Output Code) reduction has the property that binary regret  r  implies multiclass regret at most  4r 0.5  .
 
 The problem  This is not the “rightest” answer.  Consider the  k=2  case, where we reduce binary to binary.  There exists a reduction (the identity) with the property that regret  r  implies regret  r .  This is substantially superior to the transform given by the PECOC reduction, which suggests that a better reduction may exist for general  k .  For example, we can not rule out the possibility that a reduction</p><p>4 0.97122598 <a title="181-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-18-Lower_Bounds_for_Learning_Reductions.html">83 hunch net-2005-06-18-Lower Bounds for Learning Reductions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Learning reductions  transform a solver of one type of learning problem into a solver of another type of learning problem.  When we analyze these for robustness we can make statement of the form “Reduction  R  has the property that regret  r  (or loss) on subproblems of type  A  implies regret at most   f ( r )  on the original problem of type  B “.
 
A lower bound for a learning reduction would have the form “for all reductions  R , there exists a learning problem of type  B  and learning algorithm for problems of type  A  where regret  r  on induced problems implies  at least  regret  f ( r )  for  B “.
 
The pursuit of lower bounds is often questionable because, unlike upper bounds, they do not yield practical algorithms.  Nevertheless, they may be helpful as a tool for thinking about what is learnable and how learnable it is.  This has already come up  here  and  here .
 
At the moment, there is no coherent theory of lower bounds for learning reductions, and we have little understa</p><p>5 0.94545054 <a title="181-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-06-Bounds_greater_than_1.html">170 hunch net-2006-04-06-Bounds greater than 1</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Nati Srebro  and  Shai Ben-David  have a  paper  at  COLT  which, in the appendix, proves something very striking: several previous error bounds are  always  greater than 1.
 
 Background  One branch of learning theory focuses on theorems which
  
 Assume samples are drawn IID from an unknown distribution  D . 
 Fix a set of classifiers 
 Find a high probability bound on the maximum true error rate (with respect to  D ) as a function of the empirical error rate on the training set.
 
  
Many of these bounds become extremely complex and hairy.

 
 Current  Everyone working on this subject wants “tighter bounds”, however there are different definitions of “tighter”.  Some groups focus on “functional tightness” (getting the right functional dependency between the size of the training set and a parameterization of the hypothesis space) while  others  focus on “practical tightness” (finding bounds which work well on practical problems).  (I am definitely in the second camp.)

<p>Introduction: Nic Schaudolph  has been developing a fast gradient descent algorithm called  Stochastic Meta-Descent  (SMD).
 
Gradient descent is currently untrendy in the machine learning community, but there remains a large number of people using gradient descent on neural networks or other architectures from when it was trendy in the early 1990s.  There are three problems with gradient descent.
  
 Gradient descent does not necessarily produce easily reproduced results.  Typical algorithms start with “set the initial parameters to small random values”. 
 The design of the representation that gradient descent is applied to is often nontrivial.  In particular, knowing exactly how to build a large neural network so that it will perform well requires knowledge which has not been made easily applicable. 
 Gradient descent can be slow.  Obviously, taking infinitesimal steps in the direction of the gradient would take forever, so some finite step size must be used.  What exactly this step size should be</p><p>3 0.1142295 <a title="197-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-26-Two_more_UAI_papers_of_interest.html">199 hunch net-2006-07-26-Two more UAI papers of interest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In addition to Ed Snelson’s paper, there were (at least) two other papers that caught my eye at UAI.
 
One was  this paper  by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Daniel Hsu and Nakul Verma at UCSD which shows in a surprisingly general and strong way that almost all linear projections of any jointly distributed vector random variable with finite first and second moments look sphereical and unimodal (in fact look like a scale mixture of Gaussians). Great result, as you’d expect from Sanjoy.
 
The other paper which I found intriguing but which I just haven’t groked yet is  this beast  by Manfred and Dima Kuzmin. 
You can check out the (beautiful)  slides  
if that helps. I feel like there is something deep here, but my brain is too small to understand it. The COLT and last NIPS papers/slides are also on Manfred’s page. Hopefully someone here can illuminate.</p><p>4 0.10908284 <a title="197-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-27-Gradients_everywhere.html">167 hunch net-2006-03-27-Gradients everywhere</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the basic observations from the  atomic learning workshop  is that gradient-based optimization is pervasive.   For example, at least 7 (of 12) speakers used the word ‘gradient’ in their talk and several others may be approximating a gradient.  The essential useful quality of a gradient is that it decouples local updates from global optimization.  Restated: Given a gradient, we can determine how to change individual parameters of the system so as to improve overall performance.
 
It’s easy to feel depressed about this and think “nothing has happened”, but that appears untrue.  Many of the talks were about clever techniques for computing gradients where your calculus textbook breaks down.
  
 Sometimes there are clever approximations of the gradient. ( Simon Osindero )

<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple.  Viewed representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural networks or kernelized SVMs).  Should we go beyond this, and start using “deep” representations?
 
 What is deep learning?  
Intuitively, deep learning is about learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the input (observed) features.
 
Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be rather difficult.  Consider the following cases:
  
 SVM with Gaussian Kernel.  This is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can’t succinctly represent certain decision surfaces.  One of  Yann LeCun ‘s examples is recognizing objects based on pixel values.  An SVM will need a new support vector for each significantly different background.  Since the number</p><p>6 0.10370748 <a title="197-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-11-Interesting_Neural_Network_Papers_at_ICML_2011.html">438 hunch net-2011-07-11-Interesting Neural Network Papers at ICML 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The term “boosting” comes from the idea of using a meta-algorithm which takes “weak” learners (that may be able to only barely predict slightly better than random) and turn them into strongly capable learners (which predict very well).    Adaboost  in 1995 was the first widely used (and useful) boosting algorithm, although there were theoretical boosting algorithms floating around since 1990 (see the bottom of  this page ).
 
Since then, many different interpretations of why boosting works have arisen.  There is significant discussion about these different views in the  annals of statistics , including a  response  by  Yoav Freund  and  Robert Schapire .
 
I believe there is a great deal of value to be found in the original view of boosting (meta-algorithm for creating a strong learner from a weak learner).  This is not a claim that one particular viewpoint obviates the value of all others, but rather that no other viewpoint seems to really capture important properties.

<p>Introduction: The  Exponentiated Gradient  algorithm by  Manfred Warmuth  and  Jyrki Kivinen  came out just as I was starting graduate school, so I missed it both at a conference and in class.  It’s a fine algorithm which has a remarkable theoretical statement accompanying it.
 
The essential statement holds in the “online learning with an adversary” setting.  Initially, there are of set of  n  weights, which might have values  (1/n,…,1/n) , (or any other values from a probability distribution).  Everything happens in a round-by-round fashion.  On each round, the following happens:
  
 The world reveals a set of features  x in {0,1} n  .  In the online learning with an adversary literature, the features are called “experts” and thought of as subpredictors, but this interpretation isn’t necessary—you can just use feature values as experts (or maybe the feature value and the negation of the feature value as two experts). 
 EG makes a prediction according to  y’ = w . x  (dot product).

<p>Introduction: Ed Snelson  won the  Predictive Uncertainty in Environmental Modelling Competition  in the temp(erature) category using  this algorithm .  Some characteristics of the algorithm are:
  
 Gradient descent 
 … on about 600 parameters 
 … with local minima 
 … to solve regression. 
  
This bears a strong resemblance to a neural network.  The two main differences seem to be:
  
 The system has a probabilistic interpretation (which may aid design). 
 There are (perhaps) fewer parameters than a typical neural network might have for the same problem (aiding speed).</p><p>3 0.79993302 <a title="197-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-11-Visa_Casualties.html">69 hunch net-2005-05-11-Visa Casualties</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For the  Chicago 2005 machine learning summer school  we are organizing, at least 5 international students can not come due to visa issues.  There seem to be two aspects to visa issues:
  
  Inefficiency . The system rejected the student simply by being incapable of even  starting  to evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of time. 
  Politics . Border controls became much tighter after the September 11 attack.  Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will do that. 
  
What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem than (2).  Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa rejection.  Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry even people concerned with (2).  The obvious fixes to overload are “spend more money” and “make the system more efficient”.
 
With respect to (2), (which is a more minor issue by the numbers) it i</p><p>4 0.7329548 <a title="197-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-01-A_conversation_between_Theo_and_Pat.html">176 hunch net-2006-05-01-A conversation between Theo and Pat</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Pat (the practitioner)  I need to do multiclass classification and I only have a decision tree.
 
 Theo (the thoeretician)  Use an  error correcting output code .
 
 Pat  Oh, that’s cool.  But the created binary problems seem unintuitive.  I’m not sure the decision tree can solve them.
 
 Theo  Oh?  Is your problem a decision list?  
 
 Pat  No, I don’t think so.
 
 Theo  Hmm.  Are the classes well separated by axis aligned splits?
 
 Pat  Err, maybe.  I’m not sure.
 
 Theo  Well, if they are, under the IID assumption I can tell you how many samples you need.
 
 Pat  IID?  The data is definitely not IID.
 
 Theo  Oh dear.
 
 Pat  Can we get back to the choice of ECOC?  I suspect we need to build it dynamically in response to which subsets of the labels are empirically separable from each other.
 
 Theo  Ok.  What do you know about your problem?
 
 Pat  Not much.  My friend just gave me the dataset.
 
 Theo  Then, no one can help you.

<p>Introduction: from brain cancer.  I asked  Misha  who worked with him to write about it. 
  
Partha Niyogi, Louis Block Professor in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Chicago passed away on October 1, 2010, aged 43. 
 
I first met Partha Niyogi almost exactly ten years ago when I was a graduate student in math and he had just started as a faculty in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Chicago. Strangely, we first talked at length due to a somewhat convoluted mathematical argument in a paper on pattern recognition. I asked him some questions about the paper, and, even though the topic was new to him, he had put serious thought into it and we started regular meetings. We made significant progress and developed a line of research stemming initially just from trying to understand that one paper and to simplify one derivation. I think this was typical of Partha, showing both his intellectual curiosity and his intuition for the serendipitous; having a sense and focus fo</p><p>6 0.56702435 <a title="197-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-10-ML_Symposium_and_ICML_details.html">447 hunch net-2011-10-10-ML Symposium and ICML details</a></p>

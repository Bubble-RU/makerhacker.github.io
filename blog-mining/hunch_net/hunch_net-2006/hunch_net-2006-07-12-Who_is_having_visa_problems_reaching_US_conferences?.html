<p>Introduction: For the  Chicago 2005 machine learning summer school  we are organizing, at least 5 international students can not come due to visa issues.  There seem to be two aspects to visa issues:
  
  Inefficiency . The system rejected the student simply by being incapable of even  starting  to evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of time. 
  Politics . Border controls became much tighter after the September 11 attack.  Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will do that. 
  
What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem than (2).  Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa rejection.  Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry even people concerned with (2).  The obvious fixes to overload are “spend more money” and “make the system more efficient”.

<p>Introduction: Centmail  is a scheme which makes charity donations have a secondary value, as a stamp for email.  When discussed on  newscientist ,  slashdot , and others, some of the comments make the academic review process appear thoughtful   .  Some prominent fallacies are:
  
 Costing money fallacy.  Some commenters appear to believe the system charges money per email.  Instead, the basic idea is that users get an extra benefit from donations to a charity and participation is strictly voluntary.  The solution to this fallacy is simply reading  the details . 
 Single solution fallacy.  Some commenters seem to think this is proposed as a complete solution to spam, and since not everyone will opt to participate, it won’t work.  But a complete solution is not at all necessary or even possible given the  flag-day problem .  Deployed machine learning systems for fighting spam are great at taking advantage of a partial solution.  The solution to this fallacy is learning about machine learning.  In the</p><p>4 0.53781027 <a title="195-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-12-06-The_Spam_Problem.html">223 hunch net-2006-12-06-The Spam Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  New York Times  has an article on the  growth of spam .  Interesting facts include: 9/10 of all email is spam, spam source identification is nearly useless due to botnet spam senders, and image based spam (emails which consist of an image only) are on the growth.
 
Estimates of the cost of spam are almost certainly far to low, because they do not account for the cost in time lost by people.
 
The image based spam which is currently penetrating many filters should be catchable with a more sophisticated application of machine learning technology.  For the spam I see, the rendered images come in only a few formats, which would be easy to recognize via a support vector machine (with RBF kernel), neural network, or even nearest-neighbor architecture.  The mechanics of setting this up to run efficiently is the only real challenge.  This is the next step in the spam war.
 
The response to this system is to make the image based spam even more random.

<p>Introduction: Graduate study is a mysterious and uncertain process.  This easiest way to see this is by noting that a very old advisor/student mechanism is preferred. There is no known succesful mechanism for “mass producing” PhDs as is done (in some sense) for undergraduate and masters study.  Here are a few hints that might be useful to prospective or current students based on my own experience.
  
  Masters or PhD  (a) You want a PhD if you want to do research.  (b) You want a masters if you want to make money.  People wanting (b) will be manifestly unhappy with (a) because it typically means years of low pay.  People wanting (a) should try to avoid (b) because it prolongs an already long process. 
  Attitude .   Many  students struggle for awhile with the wrong attitude towards research.  Most students come into graduate school with 16-19 years of schooling where the principle means of success is proving that you know something via assignments, tests, etc…  Research does  not  work this way.

<p>Introduction: Rexa  is now publicly available.  Anyone can create an account and login.  
 
Rexa is similar to  Citeseer  and  Google Scholar  in functionality with more emphasis on the use of machine learning for intelligent information extraction.   For example, Rexa can automatically display a picture on an authorâ&euro;&trade;s homepage when the author is searched for.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.83837557 <a title="195-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-12-Who_is_having_visa_problems_reaching_US_conferences%3F.html">195 hunch net-2006-07-12-Who is having visa problems reaching US conferences?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many of the large machine learning conferences were in the US this summer.  A common problem which students from abroad encounter is visa issues. 
Just getting a visa to visit can be pretty rough: you stand around in lines, sometimes for days.  Even worse is the timing with respect to ticket buying.  Airplane tickets typically need to be bought well in advance on nonrefundable terms to secure a reasonable rate for air travel.  When a visa is denied, as happens reasonably often, a very expensive ticket is burnt.
 
A serious effort is under way to raise this as in issue in need of fixing.  Over the long term, effectively driving research conferences to locate outside of the US seems an unwise policy.   Robert Schapire  is planning to talk to a congressman.   Sally Goldman  suggested putting together a list of problem cases, and  Phil Long  setup an email address  immigration.and.confs@gmail.com  to collect them.

<p>Introduction: For about 5 years, I’ve been the treasurer of the Association for Computational Learning, otherwise known as COLT, taking over from  John Case  before me.  A transfer of duties to  Phil Long  is now about complete.  This probably matters to almost no one, but I wanted to describe things a bit for those interested.
 
The immediate impetus for this decision was unhappiness over reviewing decisions at  COLT 2009 , one as an author and several as a member of the program committee.  I seem to have disagreements fairly often about what is important work, partly because I’m focused on learning theory with practical implications, partly because I define learning theory more broadly than is typical amongst COLT members, and partly because COLT suffers a bit from insider-clique issues.  The degree to which these issues come up varies substantially each year so last year is not predictive of this one.  And, it’s important to understand that COLT remains healthy with these issues not nearly so bad</p><p>4 0.70477706 <a title="195-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-05-The_design_of_a_computing_cluster.html">128 hunch net-2005-11-05-The design of a computing cluster</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about the design of a computing cluster from the viewpoint of applied machine learning using current technology.  We just built a small one at TTI so this is some evidence of what is feasible and thoughts about the design choices.
  
  Architecture   There are several architectural choices.
 
 AMD Athlon64 based system.  This seems to have the cheapest bang/buck.  Maximum RAM is typically 2-3GB. 
 AMD Opteron based system. Opterons provide the additional capability to buy an SMP motherboard with two chips, and the motherboards often support 16GB of RAM.  The RAM is also the more expensive error correcting type. 
 Intel PIV or Xeon based system.  The PIV and Xeon based systems are the intel analog of the above 2.  Due to architectural design reasons, these chips tend to run a bit hotter and be a bit more expensive. 
 Dual core chips.  Both Intel and AMD have chips that actually have 2 processors embedded in them. 

In the end, we decided to go with option (2).

<p>Introduction: I have recently completed  a 500+ page-book on MDL , the first comprehensive overview of the field (yes, this is a sneak advertisement    ). 
 Chapter 17  compares MDL to a menagerie of other methods and paradigms for learning and statistics. By far the most time (20 pages) is spent on the relation between MDL and Bayes. My two main points here are:
  
  In sharp contrast to Bayes, MDL is by definition based on designing universal codes for the data relative to some given (parametric or nonparametric) probabilistic model M. By some theorems due to  Andrew Barron , MDL inference  must  therefore be statistically consistent, and it is immune to Bayesian inconsistency results such as those by Diaconis, Freedman and Barron (I explain what I mean by “inconsistency” further below).  Hence, MDL must be different from Bayes! 
 In contrast to what has sometimes been claimed, practical MDL algorithms do have a subjective component (which in many, but not all cases, may be implemented by somethin</p><p>6 0.36064354 <a title="195-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For theChicago 2005 machine learning summer schoolwe are organizing, at least
5 international students can not come due to visa issues. There seem to be two
aspects to visa issues:Inefficiency. The system rejected the student simply by
being incapable of evenstartingto evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of
time.Politics. Border controls became much tighter after the September 11
attack. Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will
do that.What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem
than (2). Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa
rejection. Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time
almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry
even people concerned with (2). The obvious fixes to overload are "spend more
money" and "make the system more efficient".With respect to (2), (which is a
more minor issue by the numbers) it is unclear that the political calc</p><p>3 0.11325374 <a title="195-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-27-Conferences%2C_Workshops%2C_and_Tutorials.html">174 hunch net-2006-04-27-Conferences, Workshops, and Tutorials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are
coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.It's entirely reasonable for
anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don't have a paper. For
students, visiting a conference is almost a 'must'--there is no where else
that a broad cross-section of research is on display.Workshops are also a very
good idea.ICML has 11,KDD has 9, andAAAI has 19. Workshops provide an
opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research. They
are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research
because they are so interactive.Tutorials are a good way to gain some
understanding of a long-standing direction of research. They are generally
more coherent than workshops.ICML has 7andAAAI has 15.</p><p>4 0.11140691 <a title="195-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-14-NIPS_workshp%3A_Learning_Problem_Design.html">265 hunch net-2007-10-14-NIPS workshp: Learning Problem Design</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many of the large machine learning conferences were in the US this summer. A
common problem which students from abroad encounter is visa issues.Just
getting a visa to visit can be pretty rough: you stand around in lines,
sometimes for days. Even worse is the timing with respect to ticket buying.
Airplane tickets typically need to be bought well in advance on nonrefundable
terms to secure a reasonable rate for air travel. When a visa is denied, as
happens reasonably often, a very expensive ticket is burnt.A serious effort is
under way to raise this as in issue in need of fixing. Over the long term,
effectively driving research conferences to locate outside of the US seems an
unwise policy.Robert Schapireis planning to talk to a congressman.Sally
Goldmansuggested putting together a list of problem cases, andPhil Longsetup

<p>Introduction: A type of prediction problem is specified by the type of samples produced by a
data source (Example:X x {0,1},X x [0,1],X x {1,2,3,4,5}, etc…) and a loss
function (0/1 loss, squared error loss, cost sensitive losses, etc…). For
simplicity, we'll assume that all losses have a minimum of zero.For this post,
we can think of a learning reduction asA mappingRfrom samples of one
typeT(like multiclass classification) to another typeT'(like binary
classification).A mappingQfrom predictors for typeT'to predictors for
typeT.The simplest sort of learning reduction is a "loss reduction". The idea
in a loss reduction is to prove a statement of the form:TheoremFor all base
predictorsb, for all distributionsDover examples of typeT:E(x,y) ~
DLT(y,Q(b,x)) <= f(E(x',y')~R(D)LT'(y',b(x')))HereLTis the loss for the
typeTproblem andLT'is the loss for the typeT'problem. Also,R(D)is the
distribution over samples induced by first drawing fromDand then mapping the
sample viaR. The functionf()is the loss transf</p><p>4 0.73532581 <a title="195-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-08-24-Patterns_for_research_in_machine_learning.html">471 hunch net-2012-08-24-Patterns for research in machine learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There area handful of basic code patternsthat I wish I was more aware of when
I started research in machine learning. Each on its own may seem pointless,
but collectively they go a long way towards making the typical research
workflow more efficient. Here they are:Separate code from data.Separate input
data, working data and output data.Save everything to disk frequently.Separate
options from parameters.Do not use global variables.Record the options used to
generate each run of the algorithm.Make it easy to sweep options.Make it easy
to execute only portions of the code.Use checkpointing.Write demos and
tests.Clickherefor discussion and examples for each item. Also seeCharles
Sutton'sandHackerNews'thoughts on the same topic.My guess is that these
patterns will not only be useful for machine learning, but also any other
computational work that involves either a) processing large amounts of data,
or b) algorithms that take a significant amount of time to execute. Share this
list with you</p><p>5 0.55573845 <a title="195-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-14-What_Learning_Theory_might_do.html">95 hunch net-2005-07-14-What Learning Theory might do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on thispostand some of the previousproblems/research
directionsabout where learning theory might make large strides.Why theory?The
essential reason for theory is "intuition extension". A very good applied
learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the
best computer algorithms for solving that problem. A very good theory can take
the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend
them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion. To do this, we take
these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:Explains the
basic intuitions.Makes new testable predictions about how to learn.Succeeds in
so learning.This is "intuition extension": taking what we have learned
somewhere else and applying it in new domains. It is fundamentally useful to
everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving
problems.Where next for learning theory?I like the analogy with physics. Back

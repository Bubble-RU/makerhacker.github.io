<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last decade.  The word “research” is applied broadly here to science, mathematics, and engineering.
 
There are two essential difficulties with funding research:
  
  Longshot  Paying a researcher is often a big gamble.  Most research projects don’t pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all worthwhile. 
  Information Only  Much of research is about finding the right way to think about or do something.  
  
The Longshot difficulty means that there is high variance in payoffs.  This can be compensated for by funding many different research projects, reducing variance.
 
The Information-Only difficulty means that it’s hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so companies have difficulty justifying basic research.  (Patents are a mechanism for doing this.  They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not applicable.)

<p>Introduction: The New York Times has an interesting  article  about how DARPA has dropped funding for computer science to universities by about a factor of 2 over the last 5 years and become less directed towards basic research.  Partially in response, the number of grant submissions to NSF has grown by a factor of 3 (with the NSF budget staying approximately constant in the interim).
 
This is the sort of policy decision which may make sense for the defense department, but which means a large hit for basic research on information technology development in the US.  For example “darpa funded the invention of the internet” is reasonably correct.  This policy decision is particularly painful in the context of NSF budget cuts and the end of extensive phone monopoly funded research at Bell labs. 
 
The good news from a learning perspective is that (based on anecdotal evidence) much of the remaining funding is aimed at learning and learning-related fields.

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired. 
  
In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,  ATnT Research  and  Lucent  had one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the remainder of  Bell Labs , triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine learning group there.  As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.
 
There are a couple positives to the recession as well.

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of “mechanism design”: setting up the structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane things (rather than obviously counterproductive things).  Application of this principle to academic research may be fruitful.
 
What is misdesigned about academic research?
  
 The  JMLG  guides give many hints. 
 The common nature of  bad reviewing  also suggests the system isn’t working optimally. 
 There are many ways to experimentally  “cheat” in machine learning . 
  Funding Prisoner’s Delimma.  Good researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing research.  Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written.  This is essentially a “prisoner’s delimma”: anyone not writing grant proposals loses, but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction.  If everyone wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution</p><p>6 0.55534905 <a title="154-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-12-The_unrealized_potential_of_the_research_lab.html">121 hunch net-2005-10-12-The unrealized potential of the research lab</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is encouraging.   There is some discussion of this at the  Computing Research Policy  blog.  
 
One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time, presumably in dollar budgets.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t believe that dollar budgets are the right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers.  A better way to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a measure of the relative emphasis on research.
 
  
 
This graph was assembled by dividing the  NSF budget  by the  US GDP .  For 2005 GDP, I used the  current estimate  and for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per year.  The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to change.
 
This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row.  The reality has been significantly more severe due to  DARPA decreasing funding  and industrial</p><p>2 0.88971502 <a title="154-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-05-more_icml_papers.html">189 hunch net-2006-07-05-more icml papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.
 
Topic Models:
  
   
Dynamic Topic Models  
David Blei, John Lafferty 
A nice model for how topics in LDA type models can evolve over time, 
using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters and a very 
clever structured variational approximation (in which the mean field 
parameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all Blei 
papers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive. 
   
Pachinko Allocation  
Wei Li, Andrew McCallum 
A very elegant (but computationally challenging) model which induces 
correlation amongst topics using a multi-level DAG whose interior nodes 
are “super-topics” and “sub-topics” and whose leaves are the 
vocabulary words. Makes the slumbering monster of structure learning stir. 
  
Sequence Analysis (I missed these talks since I was chairing another session)
  
   
Online Decoding of Markov Models with Latency Constraints

<p>Introduction: I attended  KDD  this year.  The conference has always had a strong grounding in what works based on the  KDDcup , but it has developed a halo of workshops on various subjects.  It seems that KDD has become a place where the economy meets machine learning in a stronger sense than many other conferences.
 
There were several papers that other people might like to take a look at.
  
  Yehuda Koren   Collaborative Filtering with Temporal Dynamics .  This paper describes how to incorporate temporal dynamics into a couple of collaborative filtering approaches.  This was also a best paper award. 
  D. Sculley , Robert Malkin,  Sugato Basu ,  Roberto J. Bayardo ,  Predicting Bounce Rates in Sponsored Search Advertisements .  The basic claim of this paper is that the probability people immediately leave (“bounce”) after clicking on an advertisement is predictable.

<p>Introduction: The  From Data to Knowledge  workshop May 7-11 at  Berkeley  should be of interest to the many people encountering streaming data in different disciplines.  Itâ&euro;&trade;s run by a group of astronomers who encounter streaming data all the time.  I met  Josh Bloom  recently and he is broadly interested in a workshop covering all aspects of Machine Learning on streaming data.  The hope here is that techniques developed in one area turn out useful in another which seems quite plausible.  Particularly if you are in the bay area, consider checking it out.</p><p>5 0.6958586 <a title="154-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-07-KDD_and_MUCMD_2011.html">444 hunch net-2011-09-07-KDD and MUCMD 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At  KDD  I enjoyed  Stephen Boyd ‘s invited talk about optimization quite a bit.  However, the most interesting talk for me was  David Haussler ‘s.  His talk started out with a formidable load of biological complexity.  About half-way through you start wondering, “can this be used to help with cancer?”  And at the end he connects it directly to use with a call to arms for the audience: cure cancer.  The core thesis here is that cancer is a complex set of diseases which can be distentangled via genetic assays, allowing attacking the specific signature of individual cancers.  However, the data quantity and complex dependencies within the data require systematic and relatively automatic prediction and analysis algorithms of the kind that we are best familiar with.

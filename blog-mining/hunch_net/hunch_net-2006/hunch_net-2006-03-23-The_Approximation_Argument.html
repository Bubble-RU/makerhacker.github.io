<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given
framework or mathematical model. It turns out that all of these models are
significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning. I've
created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of
machine learning.The point here is not simply "woe unto us". There are several
implications which seem important.The multitude of models is a point of
continuing confusion. It is common for people to learn about machine learning
within one framework which often becomes there "home framework" through which
they attempt to filter all machine learning. (Have you met people who can only
think in terms of kernels? Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)
Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help
resolve the confusion. This is particularly important when reviewing and
particularly important for students.Algorithms which conform to multiple
approaches can have substantial</p><p>4 0.14822938 <a title="165-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-26-Machine_Learning_is_too_easy.html">347 hunch net-2009-03-26-Machine Learning is too easy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is. The
viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models,
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etc… share
little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within
one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.There are
two fundamental reasons why this is possible.For many problems, many
approaches work in the sense that they do something useful. This is true
empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different
approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor. It's also
true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in
a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors
does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples.There
is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field. In many other areas
there are unifying p</p><p>5 0.14686161 <a title="165-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-08-Question%3A_%26%238220%3BWhen_is_the_right_time_to_insert_the_loss_function%3F%26%238221%3B.html">79 hunch net-2005-06-08-Question: &#8220;When is the right time to insert the loss function?&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Halasksa very good question: "When is the right time to insert the loss
function?" In particular, should it be used at testing time or at training
time?When the world imposes a loss on us, the standard Bayesian recipe is to
predict the (conditional) probability of each possibility and then choose the
possibility which minimizes the expected loss. In contrast, as
theconfusionover "loss = money lost" or "loss = the thing you optimize" might
indicate, many people ignore the Bayesian approach and simply optimize their
loss (or a close proxy for their loss) over the representation on the training
set.The best answer I can give is "it's unclear, but I prefer optimizing the
loss at training time". My experience is that optimizing the loss in the most
direct manner possible typically yields best performance. This question is
related to a basic principle which bothYann LeCun(applied) andVladimir
Vapnik(theoretical) advocate: "solve the simplest prediction problem that
solves the problem". (One</p><p>6 0.14273907 <a title="165-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-01-Watchword%3A_Loss.html">9 hunch net-2005-02-01-Watchword: Loss</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I have recently completeda 500+ page-book on MDL, the first comprehensive
overview of the field (yes, this is a sneak advertisement).Chapter 17compares
MDL to a menagerie of other methods and paradigms for learning and statistics.
By far the most time (20 pages) is spent on the relation between MDL and
Bayes. My two main points here are:In sharp contrast to Bayes, MDL is by
definition based on designing universal codes for the data relative to some
given (parametric or nonparametric) probabilistic model M. By some theorems
due toAndrew Barron, MDL inferencemusttherefore be statistically consistent,
and it is immune to Bayesian inconsistency results such as those by Diaconis,
Freedman and Barron (I explain what I mean by "inconsistency" further below).
Hence, MDL must be different from Bayes!In contrast to what has sometimes been
claimed, practical MDL algorithms do have a subjective component (which in
many, but not all cases, may be implemented by something similar to a Bayesian

<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I readthis. David Blei and I spent some time thinking hard
about this a few years back (thanks to Kary Myers for pointing us to it):In
short I was thinking that Ã¢â‚¬Å“bayesian belief updatingÃ¢â‚¬Â and
Ã¢â‚¬Å“maximum entropyÃ¢â‚¬Â were two othogonal principles. But it appear
that they are not, and that they can even be in conflict !Example (from Kass
1996); consider a Die (6 sides), consider prior knowledge E[X]=3.5.Maximum
entropy leads to P(X)= (1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6).Now consider a new piece
of evidence A=Ã¢â‚¬ÂX is an odd numberÃ¢â‚¬ÂBayesian posterior P(X|A)=
P(A|X) P(X) = (1/3, 0, 1/3, 0, 1/3, 0).But MaxEnt with the constraints
E[X]=3.5 and E[Indicator function of A]=1 leads to (.22, 0, .32, 0, .47, 0) !!
(note that E[Indicator function of A]=P(A))Indeed, for MaxEnt, because there
is no more Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ6Ã¢â‚¬Â², big numbers must be more probable to ensure an
average of 3.5. For bayesian updating, P(X|A) doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to have a
3.5 expectation. P(X) a</p><p>5 0.73097402 <a title="165-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-18-Multiplication_of_Learned_Probabilities_is_Dangerous.html">157 hunch net-2006-02-18-Multiplication of Learned Probabilities is Dangerous</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about a design flaw in several learning algorithms such as the Naive
Bayes classifier and Hidden Markov Models. A number of people are aware of it,
but it seems that not everyone is.Several learning systems have the property
that they estimate some conditional probabilitiesP(event | other events)either
explicitly or implicitly. Then, at prediction time, these learned
probabilities are multiplied together according to some formula to produce a
final prediction. The Naive Bayes classifier for binary data is the simplest
of these, so it seems like a good example.When Naive Bayes is used, a set of
probabilities of the formPr'(feature i | label)are estimated via counting
statistics and some prior. Predictions are made according to the label
maximizing:Pr'(label) * Productfeatures iPr'(feature i | label)(ThePr'notation
indicates these are estimated values.)There is nothing wrong with this method
as long as (a) the prior for the sample counts is very strong and (b) the
prior (on the c</p><p>6 0.68170941 <a title="165-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-03-All_Models_of_Learning_have_Flaws.html">235 hunch net-2007-03-03-All Models of Learning have Flaws</a></p>

<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the2010 NYAS ML Symposiumthis year. (It wasabout 170
last year.) I particularly enjoyed several talks.Yannhas a new live demo of
(limited) real-time object recognition learning.Sanjoygave a fairly convincing
and comprehensible explanation of why amodified form of single-linkage
clusteringis consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a
critical feature for clustering algorithms. I'm curious how well this
algorithm works in practice.Matt Hoffman's poster covering online LDA seemed
pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement.This year, we allocated
more time towards posters & poster spotlights.For next year, we are
considering some further changes. The format has traditionally been 4 invited
Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students. Demand
from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and
startups in the area. Another growing concern is the facility--the location is
exceptional, but fittin</p><p>2 0.94658744 <a title="165-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-18-Multiplication_of_Learned_Probabilities_is_Dangerous.html">157 hunch net-2006-02-18-Multiplication of Learned Probabilities is Dangerous</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is about a design flaw in several learning algorithms such as the Naive
Bayes classifier and Hidden Markov Models. A number of people are aware of it,
but it seems that not everyone is.Several learning systems have the property
that they estimate some conditional probabilitiesP(event | other events)either
explicitly or implicitly. Then, at prediction time, these learned
probabilities are multiplied together according to some formula to produce a
final prediction. The Naive Bayes classifier for binary data is the simplest
of these, so it seems like a good example.When Naive Bayes is used, a set of
probabilities of the formPr'(feature i | label)are estimated via counting
statistics and some prior. Predictions are made according to the label
maximizing:Pr'(label) * Productfeatures iPr'(feature i | label)(ThePr'notation
indicates these are estimated values.)There is nothing wrong with this method
as long as (a) the prior for the sample counts is very strong and (b) the
prior (on the c</p><p>same-blog 3 0.91662252 <a title="165-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-23-The_Approximation_Argument.html">165 hunch net-2006-03-23-The Approximation Argument</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the "right" way to do
machine learning. This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.
The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a
reply2.The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and
general. Essentially, you first specify a priorP(D)over possible
processesDproducing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data
according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)After
this, hard decisions are made (such as "turn left" or "turn right") by
choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior)
loss.This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices
ofP(D)and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice
properties:There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual
distribution generating the data is drawn fromP(D)there is no better method.
One way to think about this is that in</p><p>4 0.89302397 <a title="165-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-02-Proprietary_Data_in_Academic_Research%3F.html">306 hunch net-2008-07-02-Proprietary Data in Academic Research?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Should results of experiments on proprietary datasets be in the academic
research literature?The arguments I can imagine in the "against" column
are:Experiments are not repeatable. Repeatability in experiments is essential
to science because it allows others to compare new methods with old and
discover which is better.It's unfair. Academics who don't have insider access
to proprietary data are at a substantial disadvantage when competing with
others who do.I'm unsympathetic to argument (2). To me, it looks like their
are simply some resource constraints, and these should not prevent research
progress. For example, we wouldn't prevent publishing about particle
accelerator experiments by physicists atCERNbecause physicists atCMUcouldn't
run their own experiments.Argument (1) seems like a real issue.The argument
for is:Yes, they are another form of evidence that an algorithm is good. The
degree to which they are evidence is less than for publicly repeatable
experiments, but greater than n</p><p>5 0.86687279 <a title="165-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-06-Yisong_Yue_on_Self-improving_Systems.html">376 hunch net-2009-11-06-Yisong Yue on Self-improving Systems</a></p>

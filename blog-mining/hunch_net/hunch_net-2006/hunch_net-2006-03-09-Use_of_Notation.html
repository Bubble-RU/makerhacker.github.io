<p>Introduction: In my experience, there are two different groups of people who believe the
same thing: the mathematics encountered in typical machine learning conference
papers is often of questionable value.The two groups who agree on this are
applied machine learning people who have given up on math, and mature
theoreticians who understand the limits of theory.Partly, this is just a
statement about where we are with respect to machine learning. In particular,
we have no mechanism capable of generating a prescription for how to solve all
learning problems. In the absence of such certainty, people try to come up
with formalisms that partially describe and motivate how and why they do
things. This is natural and healthy--we might hope that it will eventually
lead to just such a mechanism.But, part of this is simply an emphasis on
complexity over clarity. A very natural and simple theoretical statement is
often obscured by complexifications. Common sources of complexification

<p>Introduction: The notationg(n) = O(f(n))means that in the limit asnapproaches infinity there
exists a constantCsuch that theg(n)is less thanCf(n).In learning theory, there
are many statements about learning algorithms of the form "under
assumptionsx,y, andz, the classifier learned has an error rate of at
mostO(f(m))".There is one very good reason to use O(): it helps you understand
the big picture and neglect the minor details which are not important in the
big picture. However, there are some important reasons not to do this as
well.UnspeedupIn algorithm analysis, the use of O() for time complexity is
pervasive and well-justified. Determining the exact value of C is inherently
computer architecture dependent. (The "C" for x86 processors might differ from
the "C" on PowerPC processors.) Since many learning theorists come from a CS
theory background, the O() notation is applied to generalization error. The
O() abstraction breaks here--you can not generally change learning algorithm

<p>Introduction: Many people in Machine Learning don't fully understand the impact of
computation, as demonstrated by a lack ofbig-Oanalysis of new learning
algorithms. This is important--some current active research programs are
fundamentally flawed w.r.t. computation, and other research programs are
directly motivated by it. When considering a learning algorithm, I think about
the following questions:How does the learning algorithm scale with the number
of examplesm? Any algorithm using all of the data is at leastO(m), but in many
cases this isO(m2)(naive nearest neighbor for self-prediction) or unknown
(k-means or many other optimization algorithms). The unknown case is very
common, and it can mean (for example) that the algorithm isn't convergent or
simply that the amount of computation isn't controlled.The above question can
also be asked for test cases. In some applications, test-time performance is
of great importance.How does the algorithm scale with the number of
featuresnper example? Many sec</p><p>5 0.11435349 <a title="162-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-11-New_Models.html">194 hunch net-2006-07-11-New Models</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How should we, as researchers in machine learning, organize ourselves?The most
immediate measurable objective of computer science research is publishing a
paper. The most difficult aspect of publishing a paper is having reviewers
accept and recommend it for publication. The simplest mechanism for doing this
is to show theoretical progress on some standard, well-known easily understood
problem.In doing this, we often fall into a local minima of the research
process. The basic problem in machine learning is that it is very unclear that
the mathematical model is the right one for the (or some) real problem. A good
mathematical model in machine learning should have one fundamental trait: it
should aid the design of effective learning algorithms. To date, our ability
to solve interesting learning problems (speech recognition, machine
translation, object recognition, etcâ&euro;Ś) remains limited (although improving),
so the "rightness" of our models is in doubt.If our mathematical models are
bad, t</p><p>6 0.087654501 <a title="162-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-28-Learning_Theory_standards_for_NIPS_2006.html">204 hunch net-2006-08-28-Learning Theory standards for NIPS 2006</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Andrej Bauer has setup aMathematics and ComputationBlog. As a first step he
has tried to address the persistent and annoying problem of math on the web.
As a basic tool for precisely stating and transfering understanding of
technical subjects, mathematics is very necessary. Despite this necessity,
every mechanism for expressing mathematics on the web seems unnaturally
clumsy. Here are some of the methods and their drawbacks:MathMLThis was
supposed to be the answer, but it has two severe drawbacks: "Internet
Explorer" doesn't read it and the language is an example of push-XML-to-the-
limit which no one would ever consider writing in. (In contrast, html is easy
to write in.) It's also very annoying that math fonts must be installed
independent of the browser, even for mozilla based browsers.Create inline
images. This has several big drawbacks: font size is fixed for all viewers,
you can't cut & paste inside the images, and you can't hyperlink from (say)
symbol to definition.Math Worldis</p><p>4 0.67992061 <a title="162-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-04-More_Presentation_Preparation.html">307 hunch net-2008-07-04-More Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've discussedpresentation preparation before, but I have one more thing to
add:transitioning. For a research presentation, it is substantially helpful
for the audience if transitions are clear. A common outline for a research
presentation in machine leanring is:The problem. Presentations which don't
describe the problem almost immediately lose people, because the context is
missing to understand the detail.Prior relevant work. In many cases, a paper
builds on some previous bit of work which must be understood in order to
understand what the paper does. A common failure mode seems to be spending too
much time on prior work. Discuss just the relevant aspects of prior work in
the language of your work. Sometimes this is missing when unneeded.What we
did. For theory papers in particular, it is often not possible to really cover
the details. Prioritizing what you present can be very important.How it
worked. Many papers in Machine Learning have some sort of experimental test of

<p>Introduction: When presenting part of theReinforcement Learning theory tutorialatICML 2006,
I was forcibly reminded of this.There are several difficulties.When creating
the presentation, the correct level of detail is tricky. With too much detail,
the proof takes too much time and people may be lost to boredom. With too
little detail, the steps of the proof involve too-great a jump. This is very
difficult to judge.What may be an easy step in the careful thought of a quiet
room is not so easy when you are occupied by the process of presentation.What
may be easy after having gone over this (and other) proofs is not so easy to
follow in the first pass by a viewer.These problems seem only correctable by
process of repeated test-and-revise.When presenting the proof, simply speaking
with sufficient precision is substantially harder than in normal conversation
(where precision is not so critical). Practice can help here.When presenting
the proof, going at the right pace for understanding is difficult. When</p><p>6 0.66557443 <a title="162-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-21-Presentation_Preparation.html">249 hunch net-2007-06-21-Presentation Preparation</a></p>

line of research greatly.Before we had mathematical notation, equations were
all written out in language. Since words have multiple meanings and variable
precedences, long equations written out in language can be extraordinarily
difficult and sometimes fundamentally ambiguous. A good representative example
of this is the legalese in the tax code. Since we want greater precision and
clarity, we adopt mathematical notation.One fundamental thing to understand
about mathematical notation, is that humans as logic verifiers, are barely
capable. This is the fundamental reason why one notation can be much better
than another. This observation is easier to miss than you might expect
because,</p><p>2 0.82319111 <a title="162-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-26-A_Variance_only_Deviation_Bound.html">392 hunch net-2010-03-26-A Variance only Deviation Bound</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At thePAC-Bayesworkshop earlier this week,Olivier Catonidescribed a result
that I hadn't believed was possible:a deviation bound dependingonlyon the
variance of a random variable.For people not familiar with deviation bounds,
this may be hard to appreciate. Deviation bounds, are one of the core
components for the foundations of machine learning theory, so developments
here have a potential to alter our understanding of how to learn and what is
learnable. My understanding is that the basic proof techniques started
withBernsteinand have evolved into several variants specialized for various
applications. All of the variants I knew had a dependence on the range, with
some also having a dependence on the variance of an IID or martingale random
variable. This one is the first I know of with a dependence on only the
variance.The basic idea is to use a biased estimator of the mean which is not
influenced much by outliers. Then, a deviation bound can be proved by using

<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.
This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.
Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance
can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention. Roughly
speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your
interest. The main conference program consists of elements related to
someone's interest (which is rarely your own). Workshops are more about doing
research while conferences are more about presenting research.Several
conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due
shortly.ICML workshopsDue April 1IJCAI workshopsDeadlines VaryKDD workshopsNot
yet finalizedAnyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops
and see if any are of interest. (If none are, then maybe you should organize
one next year.)</p><p>4 0.72744322 <a title="162-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-07-Is_the_Google_way_the_way_for_machine_learning%3F.html">136 hunch net-2005-12-07-Is the Google way the way for machine learning?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Urs HoelzlefromGooglegave an invited presentation atNIPS. In the presentation,
he strongly advocates interacting with data in a particular scalable manner
which is something like the following:Make a cluster of machines.Build a
unified filesystem. (Google uses GFS, but NFS or other approaches work
reasonably well for smaller clusters.)Interact with data viaMapReduce.Creating
a cluster of machines is, by this point, relatively straightforward.Unified
filesystems are a little bit tricky--GFS is capable by design of essentially
unlimited speed throughput to disk. NFS can bottleneck because all of the data
has to move through one machine. Nevertheless, this may not be a limiting
factor for smaller clusters.MapReduce is a programming paradigm. Essentially,
it is a combination of a data element transform (map) and an
agreggator/selector (reduce). These operations are highly parallelizable and
the claim is that they support the forms of data interaction which are
necessary.Apparently, theNutc</p><p>5 0.65165836 <a title="162-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-14-What_Learning_Theory_might_do.html">95 hunch net-2005-07-14-What Learning Theory might do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on thispostand some of the previousproblems/research
directionsabout where learning theory might make large strides.Why theory?The
essential reason for theory is "intuition extension". A very good applied
learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the
best computer algorithms for solving that problem. A very good theory can take
the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend
them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion. To do this, we take
these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:Explains the
basic intuitions.Makes new testable predictions about how to learn.Succeeds in
so learning.This is "intuition extension": taking what we have learned
somewhere else and applying it in new domains. It is fundamentally useful to
everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving
problems.Where next for learning theory?I like the analogy with physics. Back

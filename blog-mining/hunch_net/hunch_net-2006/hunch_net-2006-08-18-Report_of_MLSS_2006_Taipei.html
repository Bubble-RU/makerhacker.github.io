lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see
ourWIKIfor more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as
organizers to screw it up too bad. Also, since we have pretty good
infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and
Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it
was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this
two-week long party of machine learning.In the end of MLSS we distributed a

<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś and you should use that fact.A workshop differs from a conference in that it
is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic. It also
differs in that a workshop is typically a "one-time affair" rather than a
series. (TheSnowbird learning workshopcounts as a conference in this
respect.)A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop
is to treat it as a conference. This is "ok", but it is not really taking
advantage of the situation. Here are some things I've learned:For speakers: A
smaller audience means it can be more interactive. Interactive means a better
chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation
(because you can adapt to your audience). Greater focus amongst the
participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and
discuss tradeoffs more carefully. Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued
than newness.For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference style

enjoyedToumas Sandholm'stalk which showed a commanding depth of understanding
and application in automated auctions.For the machine learning day, I enjoyed
several talks and posters (I better, I helped pick them.). What stood out to
me was number of people attending: 158 registered, a level qualifying as
"scramble to find seats". My rule of thumb for workshops/conferences is that
the number of attendees is often something like the number of submissions.
That isn't the case here, where there were just 4 invited speakers and 30-or-
so posters. Presumably, the difference is due to a critical mass of Machine
Learning interested people in the area and the ease of their attendance.Are

<p>Introduction: Chicago '05ended a couple of weeks ago. This was the sixthMachine Learning
Summer School, and the second one that used awiki. (The first was Berder '04,
thanks to Gunnar Raetsch.) Wikis are relatively easy to set up, greatly aid
social interaction, and should be used a lot more at summer schools and
workshops. They can even be used as the meeting's webpage, as a permanent
record of its participants' collaborations -- see for example the wiki/website
for last year'sNVO Summer School.A basic wiki is a collection of editable
webpages, maintained by software called awiki engine. The engine used at both
Berder and Chicago wasTikiWiki-- it is well documented and gets you something
running fast. It uses PHP and MySQL, but doesn't require you to know either.
Tikiwiki has far more features than most wikis, as it is really a fullContent
Management System. (My thanks to Sebastian Stark for pointing this out.) Here

<p>Introduction: TheNew York Machine Learning Symposiumis October 19 with a 2 page abstract
deadline due September 13 via email with subject "Machine Learning Poster
Submission" sent to physicalscience@nyas.org. Everyone is welcome to submit.
Last year's attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.The primary
experiment forICML 2013is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling
review cycles. The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15. This
is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and
reduce peak load. The "not for proceedings" experiment from this year's ICML
is not continuing.Edit: Fixed second ICML deadline.</p><p>2 0.94389123 <a title="203-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-18-SVM_Adaptability.html">103 hunch net-2005-08-18-SVM Adaptability</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several recent papers have shown that SVM-like optimizations can be used to
handle several large family loss functions.This is a good thing because it is
implausible that thelossfunction imposed by the world can not be taken into
account in the process of solving a prediction problem. Even people used to
the hard-coreBayesianapproach to learning often note that some approximations
are almost inevitable in specifying apriorand/or integrating to achieve a
posterior. Taking into account how the system will be evaluated can allow both
computational effort and design effort to be focused so as to improve
performance.A current laundry list of capabilities includes:2002multiclass SVM

<p>Introduction: Lancereminded me aboutelectoralmarketstoday, which is cool enough that I want
to point it out explicitly here.Most people stilluse pollsto predict who wins,
while electoralmarkets uses people betting real money. They might use polling
information, but any other sources of information are implicitly also allowed.
A side-by-side comparison of how polls compare to prediction markets might be
fun in a few months.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.92805547 <a title="203-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-18-Report_of_MLSS_2006_Taipei.html">203 hunch net-2006-08-18-Report of MLSS 2006 Taipei</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4,
2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245
participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a
lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see
ourWIKIfor more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as
organizers to screw it up too bad. Also, since we have pretty good
infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and
Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it
was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this
two-week long party of machine learning.In the end of MLSS we distributed a
survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this
survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from
participants.The first question is designed to find out how our participants
learned about MLSS 2006 Taipei.</p><p>5 0.87195289 <a title="203-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-01-The_Producer-Consumer_Model_of_Research.html">51 hunch net-2005-04-01-The Producer-Consumer Model of Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the quest to understand what good reviewing is, perhaps it's worthwhile to
think about what good research is. One way to think about good research is in
terms of a producer/consumer model.In the producer/consumer model of research,
for any element of research there are producers (authors and coauthors of
papers, for example) and consumers (people who use the papers to make new
papers or code solving problems). An produced bit of research is judged as
"good" if it is used by many consumers. There are two basic questions which
immediately arise:Is this a good model of research?Are there alternatives?The
producer/consumer model has some difficulties which can be (partially)
addressed.Disconnect.A group of people doing research on some subject may
become disconnected from the rest of the world. Each person uses the research
of other people in the group so it appears good research is being done, but
the group has no impact on the rest of the world. One way to detect this is by

<p>Introduction: This post is about a confusion of mine with respect to many commonly used machine learning algorithms.   
 
A simple example where this comes up is Bayes net prediction.  A Bayes net where a directed acyclic graph over a set of nodes where each node is associated with a variable and the edges indicate dependence.  The joint probability distribution over the variables is given by a set of conditional probabilities.  For example, a very simple Bayes net might express: 
 P(A,B,C) = P(A | B,C)P(B)P(C) 
 
What I don’t understand is the mechanism commonly used to estimate  P(A | B, C) .  If we let  N(A,B,C)  be the number of instances of  A,B,C  then people sometimes form an estimate according to: 
  P’(A | B,C) = N(A,B,C) / N /[N(B)/N * N(C)/N] = N(A,B,C) N /[N(B)  N(C)]   
… in other words, people just estimate  P’(A | B,C)  according to observed relative frequencies.  This is a reasonable technique when you have a large number of samples compared to the size space  A x B x C , but it (nat</p><p>3 0.05799602 <a title="171-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-14-What_Learning_Theory_might_do.html">95 hunch net-2005-07-14-What Learning Theory might do</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on this  post  and some of the previous  problems/research directions  about where learning theory might make large strides.  
  
  Why theory?   The essential reason for theory is “intuition extension”.  A very good applied learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the best computer algorithms for solving that problem.  A very good theory can take the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion.  To do this, we take these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:
 
 Explains the basic intuitions. 
 Makes new testable predictions about how to learn. 
 Succeeds in so learning. 
 

This is “intuition extension”: taking what we have learned somewhere else and applying it in new domains.  It is fundamentally useful to everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving problems.

 
  Where next for learning theory?  I like the a</p><p>4 0.056664135 <a title="171-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-22-Taking_the_next_step.html">297 hunch net-2008-04-22-Taking the next step</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the  last ICML ,  Tom Dietterich  asked me to look into systems for commenting on papers.  I’ve been slow getting to this, but it’s relevant now.
 
The essential observation is that we now have many tools for online collaboration, but they are not yet much used in academic research.  If we can find the right way to use them, then perhaps great things might happen, with extra kudos to the first conference that manages to really create an online community.  Various conferences have been poking at this.  For example,  UAI has setup a wiki , COLT has  started using   Joomla , with some dynamic content, and AAAI has been setting up a “ student blog “.  Similarly,  Dinoj Surendran  setup a twiki for the  Chicago Machine Learning Summer School , which was quite useful for coordinating events and other things.
 
I believe the most important thing is a willingness to experiment.  A good place to start seems to be enhancing existing conference websites.  For example, the  ICML 2007 papers pag</p><p>5 0.056026131 <a title="171-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-18-%2450K_Spock_Challenge.html">239 hunch net-2007-04-18-$50K Spock Challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Apparently, the company  Spock  is setting up a  $50k entity resolution challenge .  $50k is much less than the Netflix challenge, but it’s effectively the same as Netflix until  someone reaches 10% .  It’s also nice that the Spock challenge has a short duration.  The (visible) test set is of size 25k and the training set has size 75k.</p><p>6 0.055477329 <a title="171-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-12-The_unrealized_potential_of_the_research_lab.html">121 hunch net-2005-10-12-The unrealized potential of the research lab</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Larry Jackal has set up the  LAGR  (“Learning Applied to Ground Robotics”) project (and competition) which seems to be quite well designed.  Features include:
  
 Many participants (8 going on 12?) 
 Standardized hardware.  In the  DARPA grand challenge  contestants entering with motorcycles are at a severe disadvantage to those entering with a Hummer.  Similarly, contestants using more powerful sensors can gain huge advantages. 
 Monthly contests, with full feedback (but since the hardware is standardized, only code is shipped).  One of the premises of the program is that robust systems are desired.  Monthly evaluations at different locations can help measure this and provide data.

<p>Introduction: Watson  convincingly beat the best champion  Jeopardy!  players.  The apparent significance of this varies hugely, depending on your background knowledge about the related machine learning, NLP, and search technology.  For a random person, this might seem evidence of serious machine intelligence, while for people working on the system itself, it probably seems like a reasonably good assemblage of existing technologies with several twists to make the entire system work.
 
Above all, I think we should congratulate the people who managed to put together and execute this project—many years of effort by a diverse set of highly skilled people were needed to make this happen.  In academia, it’s pretty difficult for one professor to assemble that quantity of talent, and in industry it’s rarely the case that such a capable group has both a worthwhile project and the support needed to pursue something like this for several years before success.

<p>Introduction: Machine learning algorithms have a much better chance of being widely adopted if they are implemented in some easy-to-use code.  There are several important concerns associated with machine learning which stress programming languages on the ease-of-use vs. speed frontier.
  
  Speed   The rate at which data sources are growing seems to be outstripping the rate at which computational power is growing, so it is important that we be able to eak out every bit of computational power.  Garbage collected languages ( java ,  ocaml ,  perl  and  python ) often have several issues here.
 
 Garbage collection often implies that floating point numbers are “boxed”: every float is represented by a pointer to a float.  Boxing can cause an order of magnitude slowdown because an extra nonlocalized memory reference is made, and accesses to main memory can are many CPU cycles long. 
 Garbage collection often implies that considerably more memory is used than is necessary.   This has a variable effect.  I</p><p>5 0.51937026 <a title="171-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-03-07-Spock_Challenge_Winners.html">291 hunch net-2008-03-07-Spock Challenge Winners</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just visited  ISI  where  Daniel Marcu  and others are working on machine translation.  Apparently, machine translation is rapidly improving.   A particularly dramatic year was 2002->2003 when systems switched from word-based translation to phrase-based translation.  From a (now famous) slide by Charles Wayne at  DARPA  (which funds much of the work on machine translation) here is some anecdotal evidence:

<p>Introduction: Textbooks invariably seem to carry the proof that uses Markov’s inequality, moment-generating functions, and Taylor approximations. Here’s an easier way.
 
For  , let   be the KL divergence between a coin of bias   and one of bias  :  
 
 Theorem:  Suppose you do   independent tosses of a coin of bias  . The probability of seeing   heads or more, for  , is at most  . So is the probability of seeing   heads or less, for  .
 
 Remark:  By Pinsker’s inequality,  .
 
 Proof  Let’s do the   case; the other is identical.
 
Let   be the distribution over   induced by a coin of bias  , and likewise   for a coin of bias  . Let   be the set of all sequences of   tosses which contain   heads or more. We’d like to show that   is unlikely under  .
 
Pick any  , with say   heads. Then:

The big winner this year is Europe.   This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.  With  cuts to basic science  in the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside the US become more attractive.   Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english in place.  China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>4 0.63121516 <a title="171-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-06-30-ICML_has_a_comment_system.html">305 hunch net-2008-06-30-ICML has a comment system</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Reid  has stepped up and created a  comment system for ICML papers  which  Greger Linden  has tightly integrated.  
 
My understanding is that Mark spent quite  a bit of time on the details, and there are some cool features like working latex math mode.  This is an excellent chance for the ICML community to experiment with making ICML year-round, so I hope it works out.  Please do consider experimenting with it.</p><p>5 0.57457316 <a title="171-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-23-Interesting_papers_at_ACL.html">97 hunch net-2005-07-23-Interesting papers at ACL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  recent discussion  indicated that one goal of this blog might be to allow people to post comments about recent papers that they liked.  I think this could potentially be very useful, especially for those with diverse interests but only finite time to read through conference proceedings.   ACL 2005  recently completed, and here are four papers from that conference that I thought were either good or perhaps of interest to a machine learning audience.
 
David Chiang,   A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation  . (Best paper award.) This paper takes the standard phrase-based MT model that is popular in our field (basically, translate a sentence by individually translating phrases and reordering them according to a complicated statistical model) and extends it to take into account hierarchy in phrases, so that you can learn things like “X ‘s Y” -> “Y de X” in chinese, where X and Y are arbitrary phrases. This takes a step toward linguistic syntax for MT, whic</p><p>6 0.50813264 <a title="171-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>

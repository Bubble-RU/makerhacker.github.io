<p>Introduction: The Gibbs-Jaynes theorem is a classical result that tells us that the highest
entropy distribution (most uncertain, least committed, etc.) subject to
expectation constraints on a set of features is an exponential family
distribution with the features as sufficient statistics. In math,argmax_p
H(p)s.t. E_p[f_i] = c_iis given by e^{\sum \lambda_i f_i}/Z. (Z here is the
necessary normalization constraint, and the lambdas are free parameters we set
to meet the expectation constraints).A great deal of statistical mechanics
flows from this result, and it has proven very fruitful in learning as well.
(Motivating work in models in text learning and Conditional Random Fields, for
instance. ) The result has been demonstrated a number of ways. One of the most
elegant is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“geometricÃ¢â‚¬Â versionhere.In the case when the
expectation constraints come from data, this tells us that the maximum entropy
distribution is exactly the maximum likelihood distribution in the exponential
family. ItÃ</p><p>4 0.10628823 <a title="191-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-23-The_Approximation_Argument.html">165 hunch net-2006-03-23-The Approximation Argument</a></p>
<p>Introduction: An argument is sometimes made that the Bayesian way is the "right" way to do
machine learning. This is a serious argument which deserves a serious reply.
The approximation argument is a serious reply for which I have not yet seen a
reply2.The idea for the Bayesian approach is quite simple, elegant, and
general. Essentially, you first specify a priorP(D)over possible
processesDproducing the data, observe the data, then condition on the data
according to Bayes law to construct a posterior:P(D|x) = P(x|D)P(D)/P(x)After
this, hard decisions are made (such as "turn left" or "turn right") by
choosing the one which minimizes the expected (with respect to the posterior)
loss.This basic idea is reused thousands of times with various choices
ofP(D)and loss functions which is unsurprising given the many nice
properties:There is an extremely strong associated guarantee: If the actual
distribution generating the data is drawn fromP(D)there is no better method.

<p>Introduction: This is about a design flaw in several learning algorithms such as the Naive
Bayes classifier and Hidden Markov Models. A number of people are aware of it,
but it seems that not everyone is.Several learning systems have the property
that they estimate some conditional probabilitiesP(event | other events)either
explicitly or implicitly. Then, at prediction time, these learned
probabilities are multiplied together according to some formula to produce a
final prediction. The Naive Bayes classifier for binary data is the simplest
of these, so it seems like a good example.When Naive Bayes is used, a set of
probabilities of the formPr'(feature i | label)are estimated via counting
statistics and some prior. Predictions are made according to the label
maximizing:Pr'(label) * Productfeatures iPr'(feature i | label)(ThePr'notation
indicates these are estimated values.)There is nothing wrong with this method
as long as (a) the prior for the sample counts is very strong and (b) the
prior (on the c</p><p>5 0.55767268 <a title="191-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-09-18-It%26%238217%3Bs_MDL_Jim%2C_but_not_as_we_know_it%26%238230%3B%28on_Bayes%2C_MDL_and_consistency%29.html">263 hunch net-2007-09-18-It&#8217;s MDL Jim, but not as we know it&#8230;(on Bayes, MDL and consistency)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I have recently completeda 500+ page-book on MDL, the first comprehensive
overview of the field (yes, this is a sneak advertisement).Chapter 17compares
MDL to a menagerie of other methods and paradigms for learning and statistics.
By far the most time (20 pages) is spent on the relation between MDL and
Bayes. My two main points here are:In sharp contrast to Bayes, MDL is by
definition based on designing universal codes for the data relative to some
given (parametric or nonparametric) probabilistic model M. By some theorems
due toAndrew Barron, MDL inferencemusttherefore be statistically consistent,
and it is immune to Bayesian inconsistency results such as those by Diaconis,
Freedman and Barron (I explain what I mean by "inconsistency" further below).
Hence, MDL must be different from Bayes!In contrast to what has sometimes been
claimed, practical MDL algorithms do have a subjective component (which in

<p>Introduction: A few weeks ago I readthis. David Blei and I spent some time thinking hard
about this a few years back (thanks to Kary Myers for pointing us to it):In
short I was thinking that Ã¢â‚¬Å“bayesian belief updatingÃ¢â‚¬Â and
Ã¢â‚¬Å“maximum entropyÃ¢â‚¬Â were two othogonal principles. But it appear
that they are not, and that they can even be in conflict !Example (from Kass
1996); consider a Die (6 sides), consider prior knowledge E[X]=3.5.Maximum
entropy leads to P(X)= (1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6).Now consider a new piece
of evidence A=Ã¢â‚¬ÂX is an odd numberÃ¢â‚¬ÂBayesian posterior P(X|A)=
P(A|X) P(X) = (1/3, 0, 1/3, 0, 1/3, 0).But MaxEnt with the constraints
E[X]=3.5 and E[Indicator function of A]=1 leads to (.22, 0, .32, 0, .47, 0) !!
(note that E[Indicator function of A]=P(A))Indeed, for MaxEnt, because there
is no more Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ6Ã¢â‚¬Â², big numbers must be more probable to ensure an
average of 3.5. For bayesian updating, P(X|A) doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to have a
3.5 expectation. P(X) a</p><p>2 0.89785033 <a title="191-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-01-Interesting_papers_at_COLT_2011.html">439 hunch net-2011-08-01-Interesting papers at COLT 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: SinceJohndid not attendCOLTthis year, I have been volunteered to report back
on the hot stuff at this year's meeting. The conference seemed to have pretty
high quality stuff this year, and I found plenty of interesting papers on all
the three days. I'm gonna pick some of my favorites going through the program
in a chronological order.The first session on matrices seemed interesting for
two reasons. First, the papers were quite nice. But more interestingly, this
is a topic that has had a lot of presence in Statistics and Compressed sensing
literature recently. So it was good to see high-dimensional matrices finally
make their entry at COLT. The paper ofOhadandShaionCollaborative Filtering
with the Trace Norm: Learning, Bounding, and Transducingprovides non-trivial
guarantees on trace norm regularization in an agnostic setup, while Rina
andNatishow how Rademacher averages can be used to get sharper results for
matrix completion problems in their paperConcentration-Based Guarantees for

<p>Introduction: Data linkage is a problem which seems to come up in various applied machine
learning problems. I have heard it mentioned in various data mining contexts,
but it seems relatively less studied for systemic reasons.A very simple
version of the data linkage problem is a cross hospital patient record merge.
Suppose a patient (John Doe) is admitted to a hospital (General Health),
treated, and released. Later, John Doe is admitted to a second hospital
(Health General), treated, and released. Given a large number of records of
this sort, it becomes very tempting to try and predict the outcomes of
treatments. This is reasonably straightforward as a machine learning problem
if there is a shared unique identifier for John Doe used by General Health and
Health General along with time stamps. We can merge the records and create
examples of the form "Given symptoms and treatment, did the patient come back
to a hospital within the next year?" These examples could be fed into a
learning algorithm, and</p><p>4 0.87434024 <a title="191-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-10-Learning_Track_of_International_Planning_Competition.html">276 hunch net-2007-12-10-Learning Track of International Planning Competition</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheInternational Planning Competition(IPC) is a biennial event organized in
the context of theInternational Conference on Automated Planning and
Scheduling(ICAPS). This year, for the first time, there will a learning track
of the competition. For more information you can go to the competitionweb-
site.The competitions are typically organized around a number of planning
domains that can vary from year to year, where a planning domain is simply a
class of problems that share a common action schema--e.g. Blocksworld is a
well-known planning domain that contains a problem instance each possible
initial tower configuration and goal configuration. Some other domains have
included Logistics, Airport, Freecell, PipesWorld, and manyothers. For each
domain the competition includes a number of problems (say 40-50) and the
planners are run on each problem with a time limit for each problem (around 30
minutes). The problems are hard enough that many problems are not solved
within the time limit.Giv</p><p>5 0.82341683 <a title="191-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-24-Top_graduates_this_season.html">384 hunch net-2009-12-24-Top graduates this season</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I would like to point out 3 graduates this season as having my confidence they
are capable of doing great things.Daniel Hsuhas diverse papers with diverse
coauthors on {active learning, mulitlabeling, temporal learning, â&euro;Ś} each
covering new algorithms and methods of analysis. He is also a capable
programmer, having helped me with some nitty-gritty details of cluster
parallelVowpal Wabbitthis summer. He has an excellent tendency to just get
things done.Nicolas Lambertdoesn't nominally work in machine learning, but
I've found his work inelicitationrelevant nevertheless. In essence, elicitable
properties are closely related to learnable properties, and the elicitation
complexity is related to a notion of learning complexity. See theSurrogate
regret bounds paperfor some related discussion. Few people successfully work
at such a general level that it crosses fields, but he's one of them.Yisong
Yueis deeply focused on interactive learning, which he has attacked at all
levels: theory, algorit</p><p>6 0.76249635 <a title="191-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-23-The_Approximation_Argument.html">165 hunch net-2006-03-23-The Approximation Argument</a></p>

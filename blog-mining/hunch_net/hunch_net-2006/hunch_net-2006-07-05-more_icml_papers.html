<p>Introduction: John makes a fascinating point about structured classification (and slightly
scooped my post!). Maximum Margin Markov Networks (M3N) are an interesting
example of the second class of structured classifiers (where the
classification of one label depends on the others), and one of my favorite
papers. I'm not alone: the paper won the best student paper award at NIPS in
2003.There are some things I find odd about the paper. For instance, it says
of probabilistic models"cannot handle high dimensional feature spaces and lack
strong theoretical guarrantees."I'm aware of no such limitations.
Also:"Unfortunately, even probabilistic graphical models that are trained
discriminatively do not achieve the same level of performance as SVMs,
especially when kernel features are used."This is quite interesting and
contradicts my own experience as well as that of a number of
peopleIgreatlyrespect. I wonder what the root cause is: perhaps there is
something different about the data Ben+Carlos were working</p><p>3 0.13461907 <a title="189-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-20-Cool_and_Interesting_things_at_NIPS%2C_take_three.html">280 hunch net-2007-12-20-Cool and Interesting things at NIPS, take three</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following up on Hal Daume's post and John's post on cool and interesting
things seen at NIPS I'll post my own little list of neat papers here as well.
Of course it's going to be biased towards what I think is interesting. Also, I
have to say that I hadn't been able to see many papers this year at nips due
to myself being too busy, so please feel free to contribute the papers that
you liked1. P. Mudigonda, V. Kolmogorov, P. Torr. An Analysis of Convex
Relaxations for MAP Estimation. A surprising paper which shows that many of
the more sophisticated convex relaxations that had been proposed recently
turns out to be subsumed by the simplest LP relaxation. Be careful next time
you try a cool new convex relaxation!2. D. Sontag, T. Jaakkola. New Outer

<p>Introduction: Maybe it's too early to call, but with four separate Neural Network sessions
at this year'sICML, it looks like Neural Networks are making a comeback. Here
are my highlights of these sessions. In general, my feeling is that these
papers both demystify deep learning and show its broader applicability.The
first observation I made is that the once disreputable "Neural" nomenclature
is being used againin lieu of"deep learning". Maybe it's because Adam Coates
et al. showed that single layer networks can work surprisingly well.An
Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning,Adam
Coates,Honglak Lee,Andrew Y. Ng(AISTATS 2011)The Importance of Encoding Versus
Training with Sparse Coding and Vector Quantization,Adam Coates,Andrew Y.
Ng(ICML 2011)Another surprising result out of Andrew Ng's group comes from
Andrew Saxe et al. who show that certain convolutional pooling architectures
can obtain close to state-of-the-art performance with random weights (that is,

<p>Introduction: TheICMLpaper deadline has passed.Joelleand I were surprised to see the number
of submissions jump from last year by about 50% to around 900 submissions. A
tiny portion of these are immediate rejects(*), so this is a much larger set
of papers than expected. The number of workshop submissions also doubled
compared to last year, so ICML may grow significantly this year, if we can
manage to handle the load well. The prospect of making 900 good decisions is
fundamentally daunting, and success will rely heavily on theprogram
committeeandarea chairsat this point.For those who want to rubberneck a bit
more, here's a breakdown of submissions by primary topic of submitted
papers:66 Reinforcement Learning 52 Supervised Learning 51 Clustering 46
Kernel Methods 40 Optimization Algorithms 39 Feature Selection and

<p>Introduction: Let me add to John's post with a few of my own favouritesfrom this year's
conference. First, let me say thatSanjoy's talk,Coarse Sample Complexity
Bounds for ActiveLearningwas also one of my favourites, as was theForgettron
paper.I also really enjoyed the last third ofChristos'talkon the complexity of
finding Nash equilibria.And, speaking of tagging, I thinkthe U.Mass Citeseer
replacement systemRexafrom the demo track is very cool.Finally, let me add my
recommendations for specific papers:Z. Ghahramani, K. Heller:Bayesian Sets[no

which objects are "most like" a given subset of objects.)T. Griffiths, Z.
Ghahramani:Infinite Latent Feature Models andthe Indian Buffet

<p>Introduction: I thought this was a very good NIPS with many excellent papers. The following
are a few NIPS papers which I liked and I hope to study more carefully when I
get the chance. The list is not exhaustive and in no particular
order…Preconditioner Approximations for Probabilistic Graphical
Models.Pradeeep Ravikumar and John Lafferty.I thought the use of
preconditioner methods from solving linear systems in the context of
approximate inference was novel and interesting. The results look good and I'd
like to understand the limitations.Rodeo: Sparse nonparametric regression in
high dimensions.John Lafferty and Larry Wasserman.A very interesting approach
to feature selection in nonparametric regression from a frequentist framework.
The use of lengthscale variables in each dimension reminds me a lot of
'Automatic Relevance Determination' in Gaussian process regression -- it would
be interesting to compare Rodeo to ARD in GPs.Interpolating between types and
tokens by estimating power law generators</p><p>5 0.65329146 <a title="189-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Maximum_Margin_Mismatch%3F.html">77 hunch net-2005-05-29-Maximum Margin Mismatch?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alex Smolashowed me thisICML 2006webpage. This isNOTthe ICML we know, but
rather some people at "Enformatika". Investigation shows that they registered
with an anonymous yahoo email account fromdotregistrar.comthe "Home of the
$6.79 wholesale domain!" and their nameservers are byTurkticaret, a Turkish
internet company.It appears the website has since been altered to "ICNL" (the
above link uses the google cache).They say that imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery, so the organizers of the realICML 2006must feel quite
flattered.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91049856 <a title="189-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-05-more_icml_papers.html">189 hunch net-2006-07-05-more icml papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.Topic Models:Dynamic Topic
ModelsDavid Blei, John LaffertyA nice model for how topics in LDA type models
can evolve over time,using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters
and a veryclever structured variational approximation (in which the mean
fieldparameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all
Bleipapers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive.Pachinko
AllocationWei Li, Andrew McCallumA very elegant (but computationally
challenging) model which inducescorrelation amongst topics using a multi-level
DAG whose interior nodesare "super-topics" and "sub-topics" and whose leaves
are thevocabulary words. Makes the slumbering monster of structure learning
stir.Sequence Analysis (I missed these talks since I was chairing another
session)Online Decoding of Markov Models with Latency ConstraintsMukund

<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are
coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.It's entirely reasonable for
anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don't have a paper. For
students, visiting a conference is almost a 'must'--there is no where else
that a broad cross-section of research is on display.Workshops are also a very
good idea.ICML has 11,KDD has 9, andAAAI has 19. Workshops provide an
opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research. They
are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research
because they are so interactive.Tutorials are a good way to gain some
understanding of a long-standing direction of research. They are generally
more coherent than workshops.ICML has 7andAAAI has 15.</p><p>4 0.66677582 <a title="189-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-29-ICML_survey_and_comments.html">468 hunch net-2012-06-29-ICML survey and comments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attendingICML, except forDorawho arrived
on Monday. Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is
going well.For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like
everyone),Mark Reidhas setup theICML discussionsite where you can comment on
any paper or subscribe to papers. Authors are automatically subscribed to
their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly
after the fact, as people desire.We also conducted a survey before the
conference and have thesurvey resultsnow. This can be compared with theICML
2010 survey results. Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes
order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4
being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and
2010.Glancing through them, I see:Most people found the papers they reviewed a
good fit for their expertise (-.037 w.r.t 2010). Achieving this was one of our

<p>Introduction: I recently had fun discussions with bothVikash MansinghkaandThomas Breuelabout
approaching AI with machine learning. The general interest in taking a crack
at AI with machine learning seems to be rising on many fronts
includingDARPA.As a matter of history, there was a great deal of interest in
AI which died down before I began research. There remain many projects and
conferences spawned in this earlier AI wave, as well as a good bit of
experience about what did not work, or at least did not work yet. Here are a
few examples of failure modes that people seem to run into:Supply/Product
confusion. Sometimes we think "Intelligences use X, so I'll create X and have
an Intelligence." An example of this is theCyc Projectwhich inspires some
people as "intelligences use ontologies, so I'll create an ontology and a
system using it to have an Intelligence." The flaw here is that
Intelligencescreateontologies, which they use, and without the ability to
create ontologies you don't have an Intellige</p><p>6 0.57675081 <a title="189-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-28-Programming_Languages_for_Machine_Learning_Implementations.html">210 hunch net-2006-09-28-Programming Languages for Machine Learning Implementations</a></p>

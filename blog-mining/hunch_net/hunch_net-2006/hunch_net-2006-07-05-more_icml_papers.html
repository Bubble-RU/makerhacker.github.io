Topic Models:
  
   
Dynamic Topic Models  
David Blei, John Lafferty 
A nice model for how topics in LDA type models can evolve over time, 
using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters and a very 
clever structured variational approximation (in which the mean field 
parameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all Blei 
papers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive. 
   
Pachinko Allocation  
Wei Li, Andrew McCallum 
A very elegant (but computationally challenging) model which induces 
correlation amongst topics using a multi-level DAG whose interior nodes 
are “super-topics” and “sub-topics” and whose leaves are the 
vocabulary words. Makes the slumbering monster of structure learning stir. 
  
Sequence Analysis (I missed these talks since I was chairing another session)
  
   
Online Decoding of Markov Models with Latency Constraints

<p>Introduction: John makes a fascinating point about structured classification (and slightly scooped my post!). Maximum Margin Markov Networks (M3N) are an interesting example of the second class of structured classifiers (where the classification of one label depends on the others), and one of my favorite papers. I’m not alone: the paper won the best student paper award at NIPS in 2003. 
 
There are some things I find odd about the paper. For instance, it says of probabilistic models 
  
“cannot handle high dimensional feature spaces and lack strong theoretical guarrantees.” 
  
I’m aware of no such limitations. Also: 
  

“Unfortunately, even probabilistic graphical models that are trained discriminatively do not achieve the same level of performance as SVMs, especially when kernel features are used.”

  
This is quite interesting and contradicts my own experience as well as that of a number of people  I   greatly  
 respect .

<p>Introduction: Following up on Hal Daume’s post and John’s post on cool and interesting things seen at NIPS I’ll post my own little list of neat papers here as well.  Of course it’s going to be biased towards what I think is interesting.  Also, I have to say that I hadn’t been able to see many papers this year at nips due to myself being too busy, so please feel free to contribute the papers that you liked   
 
1. P. Mudigonda, V. Kolmogorov, P. Torr.  An Analysis of Convex Relaxations for MAP Estimation.  A surprising paper which shows that many of the more sophisticated convex relaxations that had been proposed recently turns out to be subsumed by the simplest LP relaxation.  Be careful next time you try a cool new convex relaxation!

<p>Introduction: Let me add to John’s post with a few of my own favourites 
from this year’s conference. First, let me say that 
Sanjoy’s talk,  Coarse Sample Complexity Bounds for Active 
Learning  was also one of my favourites, as was the 
  
Forgettron paper .
 

I also really enjoyed the last third of 
 Christos’  talk 
on the complexity of finding Nash equilibria.

 

And, speaking of tagging, I think 
the U.Mass Citeseer replacement system 
 Rexa  from the demo track is very cool.

 

Finally, let me add my recommendations for specific papers:
  
  Z. Ghahramani, K. Heller:  Bayesian Sets  
[no preprint] 
(A very elegant probabilistic information retrieval style model 
of which objects are “most like” a given subset of objects.)
 
 T. Griffiths, Z. Ghahramani:  Infinite Latent Feature Models and 
the Indian Buffet Process  
[  
preprint ] 
(A Dirichlet style prior over infinite binary matrices with 
beautiful exchangeability properties.)

<p>Introduction: A  recent discussion  indicated that one goal of this blog might be to allow people to post comments about recent papers that they liked.  I think this could potentially be very useful, especially for those with diverse interests but only finite time to read through conference proceedings.   ACL 2005  recently completed, and here are four papers from that conference that I thought were either good or perhaps of interest to a machine learning audience.
 
David Chiang,   A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation  . (Best paper award.) This paper takes the standard phrase-based MT model that is popular in our field (basically, translate a sentence by individually translating phrases and reordering them according to a complicated statistical model) and extends it to take into account hierarchy in phrases, so that you can learn things like “X ‘s Y” -> “Y de X” in chinese, where X and Y are arbitrary phrases. This takes a step toward linguistic syntax for MT, whic</p><p>6 0.10495069 <a title="189-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-11-Interesting_Neural_Network_Papers_at_ICML_2011.html">438 hunch net-2011-07-11-Interesting Neural Network Papers at ICML 2011</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.
 
Topic Models:
  
   
Dynamic Topic Models  
David Blei, John Lafferty 
A nice model for how topics in LDA type models can evolve over time, 
using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters and a very 
clever structured variational approximation (in which the mean field 
parameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all Blei 
papers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive. 
   
Pachinko Allocation  
Wei Li, Andrew McCallum 
A very elegant (but computationally challenging) model which induces 
correlation amongst topics using a multi-level DAG whose interior nodes 
are “super-topics” and “sub-topics” and whose leaves are the 
vocabulary words. Makes the slumbering monster of structure learning stir. 
  
Sequence Analysis (I missed these talks since I was chairing another session)
  
   
Online Decoding of Markov Models with Latency Constraints

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is encouraging.   There is some discussion of this at the  Computing Research Policy  blog.  
 
One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time, presumably in dollar budgets.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t believe that dollar budgets are the right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers.  A better way to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a measure of the relative emphasis on research.
 
  
 
This graph was assembled by dividing the  NSF budget  by the  US GDP .  For 2005 GDP, I used the  current estimate  and for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per year.  The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to change.
 
This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row.  The reality has been significantly more severe due to  DARPA decreasing funding  and industrial</p><p>3 0.83640528 <a title="189-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-07-11-Interesting_papers_at_KDD.html">364 hunch net-2009-07-11-Interesting papers at KDD</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I attended  KDD  this year.  The conference has always had a strong grounding in what works based on the  KDDcup , but it has developed a halo of workshops on various subjects.  It seems that KDD has become a place where the economy meets machine learning in a stronger sense than many other conferences.
 
There were several papers that other people might like to take a look at.
  
  Yehuda Koren   Collaborative Filtering with Temporal Dynamics .  This paper describes how to incorporate temporal dynamics into a couple of collaborative filtering approaches.  This was also a best paper award. 
  D. Sculley , Robert Malkin,  Sugato Basu ,  Roberto J. Bayardo ,  Predicting Bounce Rates in Sponsored Search Advertisements .  The basic claim of this paper is that the probability people immediately leave (“bounce”) after clicking on an advertisement is predictable.

<p>Introduction: The  From Data to Knowledge  workshop May 7-11 at  Berkeley  should be of interest to the many people encountering streaming data in different disciplines.  Itâ&euro;&trade;s run by a group of astronomers who encounter streaming data all the time.  I met  Josh Bloom  recently and he is broadly interested in a workshop covering all aspects of Machine Learning on streaming data.  The hope here is that techniques developed in one area turn out useful in another which seems quite plausible.  Particularly if you are in the bay area, consider checking it out.</p><p>5 0.70283169 <a title="189-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-07-KDD_and_MUCMD_2011.html">444 hunch net-2011-09-07-KDD and MUCMD 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At  KDD  I enjoyed  Stephen Boyd ‘s invited talk about optimization quite a bit.  However, the most interesting talk for me was  David Haussler ‘s.  His talk started out with a formidable load of biological complexity.  About half-way through you start wondering, “can this be used to help with cancer?”  And at the end he connects it directly to use with a call to arms for the audience: cure cancer.  The core thesis here is that cancer is a complex set of diseases which can be distentangled via genetic assays, allowing attacking the specific signature of individual cancers.  However, the data quantity and complex dependencies within the data require systematic and relatively automatic prediction and analysis algorithms of the kind that we are best familiar with.

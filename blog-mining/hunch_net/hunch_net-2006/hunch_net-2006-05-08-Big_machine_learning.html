  Ranking   This is the canonical problem of all search engines.  It is made extra difficult for several reasons.
 
 There is relatively little “good” supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as click through rates). 
 The learning must occur in a partially adversarial environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top of 
rankings. 
 It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as ‘ranking’ or as ‘regression’ which is then used to produce a 
ranking.

<p>Introduction: I want to comment on the “Bing copies Google” discussion  here ,  here , and  here , because there are data-related issues which the general public may not understand, and some of the framing seems substantially misleading to me.
 
As a not-distant-outsider, let me mention the sources of bias I may have.  I work at  Yahoo! , which has started using  Bing .  This might predispose me towards Bing, but on the other hand I’m still at Yahoo!, and have been using  Linux  exclusively as an OS for many years, including even a couple minor kernel patches.  And,  on the gripping hand , I’ve spent quite a bit of time thinking about the basic  principles of incorporating user feedback in machine learning .  Also note, this post is not  related to official Yahoo! policy, it’s just my personal view.

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people .  Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs, this is serious for  Yahoo! Research .  
 
We had advanced warning from  Prabhakar  through the  simple act of leaving .  Yahoo! Research was a world class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave.  My first thought when I saw the news was “Uhoh,  Rob  said that he knew it was serious when the head of ATnT Research left.”  In this case it was even more significant, because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high engagement with the company.  Prabhakar’s departure is a clear end to that experiment.
 
The result is ambiguous from a business perspective.  Y!R clearly was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses.

<p>Introduction: According to the  New York Times ,  Yahoo is releasing Project Panama shortly .  Project Panama is about better predicting which advertisements are relevant to a search, implying a higher click through rate, implying larger income for  Yahoo .  There are two things that seem interesting here:
  
 A significant portion of that improved accuracy is almost certainly machine learning at work. 
 The quantitative effect is huge—the estimate in the article is $600*10 6 . 
  
 Google  already has such improvements and  Microsoft Search  is surely working on them, which suggest this is (perhaps) a $10 9  per year machine learning problem. 
 
The exact methodology under use is unlikely to be publicly discussed in the near future because of the competitive enivironment.  Hopefully we’ll have some public “war stories” at some point in the future when this information becomes less sensitive.  For now, it’s reassuring to simply note that machine learning is having a big impact.</p><p>2 0.81446034 <a title="178-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-12-Online_learning_or_online_preservation_of_learning%3F.html">163 hunch net-2006-03-12-Online learning or online preservation of learning?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the online learning with experts setting, you observe a set of predictions, make a decision, and then observe the truth.  This process repeats indefinitely.  In this setting, it is possible to prove theorems of the sort: 
 master algorithm error count < = k* best predictor error count + c*log(number of predictors) 
 
Is this a statement about learning or about preservation of learning?  We did some experiments to analyze the new  Binning algorithm  which works in this setting.  For several UCI datasets, we reprocessed them so that features could be used as predictors and then applied several master algorithms.  The first graph confirms that Binning is indeed a better algorithm according to the tightness of the upper bound.
 
    
Here, “Best” is the performance of the best expert. “V. Bound” is the bound for  Vovk ‘s algorithm (the previous best).  “Bound” is the bound for the Binning algorithm.  “Binning” is the performance of the Binning algorithm.  The Binning algorithm clearly h</p><p>3 0.79681963 <a title="178-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks_for_RL.html">148 hunch net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks for RL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, Drew Bagnell and I started the  RLBench project  to setup a suite of reinforcement learning benchmark problems.  We haven’t been able to touch it (due to lack of time) for a year so the project is on hold.  Luckily, there are several other projects such as  CLSquare  and  RL-Glue  with a similar goal, and we strongly endorse their continued development.
 
I would like to explain why, especially in the context of criticism of other learning benchmarks.   For example, sometimes the  UCI Machine Learning Repository  is criticized.  There are two criticisms I know of:
  
 Learning algorithms have overfit to the problems in the repository.  It is easy to imagine a mechanism for this happening unintentionally.  Strong evidence of this would be provided by learning algorithms which perform great on the UCI machine learning repository but very badly (relative to other learning algorithms) on non-UCI learning problems.  I have seen little evidence of this but it remains a po</p><p>4 0.72814023 <a title="178-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-01-The_Webscience_Future.html">134 hunch net-2005-12-01-The Webscience Future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The internet has significantly effected the way we do research but it’s capabilities have not yet been fully realized.
 
First, let’s acknowledge some known effects.
  
  Self-publishing  By default, all researchers in machine learning (and more generally computer science and physics) place their papers online for anyone to download.  The exact mechanism differs—physicists tend to use a central repository ( Arxiv ) while computer scientists tend to place the papers on their webpage.  Arxiv has been slowly growing in subject breadth so it now sometimes used by computer scientists. 
  Collaboration  Email has enabled working remotely with coauthors.  This has allowed collaborationis which would not otherwise have been possible and generally speeds research. 
  
Now, let’s look at attempts to go further.
  
  Blogs  (like this one) allow public discussion about topics which are not easily categorized as “a new idea in machine learning” (like this topic).

<p>Introduction: This is a very difficult post to write, because it is about a perenially touchy subject.  Nevertheless, it is an important one which needs to be thought about carefully.
 
There are a few things which should be understood:
  
 The system is changing and responsive.  We-the-authors are we-the-reviewers, we-the-PC, and even we-the-NIPS-board.  NIPS has implemented ‘secondary program chairs’, ‘author response’, and ‘double blind reviewing’ in the last few years to help with the decision process, and more changes may happen in the future. 
 Agreement creates a perception of correctness.  When any PC meets and makes a group decision about a paper, there is a strong tendency for the reinforcement inherent in a group decision to create the perception of correctness.  For the many people who have been on the NIPS PC it’s reasonable to entertain a healthy skepticism in the face of this reinforcing certainty.

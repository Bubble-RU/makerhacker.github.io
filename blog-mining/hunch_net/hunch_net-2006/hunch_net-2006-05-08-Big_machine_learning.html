<p>Introduction: I just visitedYahoo Researchwhich has several fundamental learning problems
near to (or beyond) the set of problems we know how to solve well. Here are 3
of them.RankingThis is the canonical problem of all search engines. It is made
extra difficult for several reasons.There is relatively little "good"
supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as
click through rates).The learning must occur in a partially adversarial
environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top
ofrankings.It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as
'ranking' or as 'regression' which is then used to produce
aranking.Collaborative filteringYahoo has a large number of recommendation
systems for music, movies, etcâ&euro;Ś In these sorts of systems, users specify how
they liked a set of things, and then the system can (hopefully) find some more
examples of things they might likeby reasoning across multiple such
sets.Exploration with Generalization</p><p>3 0.085463941 <a title="178-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-24-David_Waltz.html">460 hunch net-2012-03-24-David Waltz</a></p>

<p>Introduction: In the quest to understand what good reviewing is, perhaps it's worthwhile to
think about what good research is. One way to think about good research is in
terms of a producer/consumer model.In the producer/consumer model of research,
for any element of research there are producers (authors and coauthors of
papers, for example) and consumers (people who use the papers to make new
papers or code solving problems). An produced bit of research is judged as
"good" if it is used by many consumers. There are two basic questions which
immediately arise:Is this a good model of research?Are there alternatives?The
producer/consumer model has some difficulties which can be (partially)
addressed.Disconnect.A group of people doing research on some subject may
become disconnected from the rest of the world. Each person uses the research
of other people in the group so it appears good research is being done, but
the group has no impact on the rest of the world. One way to detect this is by
looking at</p><p>5 0.076273687 <a title="178-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-11-09-Graduates_and_Postdocs.html">490 hunch net-2013-11-09-Graduates and Postdocs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several strong graduates are on the job market this year.Alekh Agarwalmade
themost scalable public learning algorithmas an intern two years ago. He has a
deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning as well as the
ability and will to make things happen programming-wise. I've been privileged
to have Alekh visiting me in NY where he will be sorely missed.John
DuchicreatedAdagradwhich is a commonly helpful improvement over online
gradient descent that is seeing wide adoption, including inVowpal Wabbit. He
has a similarly deep and broad understanding of optimization and learning with
significant industry experience atGoogle. Alekh and John have often coauthored
together.Stephane Rossvisited me a year ago over the summer, implementing many
new algorithms and working out the firstscale free online update rulewhich is
now the default in Vowpal Wabbit. Stephane isnoton the market--Google robbed
the cradle successfullyI'm sure that he will do great things.Anna

<p>Introduction: I want to comment on the "Bing copies Google" discussionhere,here, andhere,
because there are data-related issues which the general public may not
understand, and some of the framing seems substantially misleading to me.As a
not-distant-outsider, let me mention the sources of bias I may have. I work
atYahoo!, which has started usingBing. This might predispose me towards Bing,
but on the other hand I'm still at Yahoo!, and have been usingLinuxexclusively
as an OS for many years, including even a couple minor kernel patches. And,on
the gripping hand, I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about the
basicprinciples of incorporating user feedback in machine learning. Also note,
this post is not related to official Yahoo! policy, it's just my personal
view.The issueGoogle engineers inserted synthetic responses to synthetic
queries on google.com, then executed the synthetic searches on google.com

<p>Introduction: I just visitedISIwhereDaniel Marcuand others are working on machine
translation. Apparently, machine translation is rapidly improving. A
particularly dramatic year was 2002->2003 when systems switched from word-
based translation to phrase-based translation. From a (now famous) slide by
Charles Wayne atDARPA(which funds much of the work on machine translation)

<p>Introduction: The New York Times had ashort interviewabout machine learning in datamining
being used pervasively by the IRS and large corporations to predict who to
audit and who to target for various marketing campaigns. This is a big
application area of machine learning. It can be harmful (learning + databases
= another way to invade privacy) or beneficial (as google demonstrates, better
targeting of marketing campaigns is far less annoying). This is yet more
evidence that we can not rely upon "I'm just another fish in the school" logic
for our expectations about treatment by government and large corporations.</p><p>5 0.59186357 <a title="178-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-10-Predictive_Search_is_Coming.html">120 hunch net-2005-10-10-Predictive Search is Coming</a></p>
<p>Introduction: "Search" is the other branch of AI research which has been succesful. Concrete
examples includeDeep Bluewhich beat the world chess champion andChinookthe
champion checkers program. A set of core search techniques exist including A*,
alpha-beta pruning, and others that can be applied to any of many different
search problems.Given this, it may be surprising to learn that there has been
relatively little succesful work on combining prediction and search. Given
also that humans typically solve search problems using a number of predictive
heuristics to narrow in on a solution, we might be surprised again. However,
the big successful search-based systems have typically not used "smart" search
algorithms. Insteady they have optimized for very fast search. This is not for
lack of tryingâ&euro;Ś many people have tried to synthesize search and prediction to
various degrees of success. For example,Knightcapachieves good-but-not-stellar

see an unlabeled examplex, make a predictiony'(possibly based on the
classifiersc), and then see the correct labely.When one of these classifiers
is perfect, there is a great algorithm available: predict according to the
majority vote over every classifier consistent with every previous example.
This is called the Halving algorithm. It makes at mostlog2|c|mistakes since on
any mistake, at least half of the classifiers are eliminated.Obviously, we
can't generally hope that the there exists a classifier which never errs.
TheBinomial Weighting algorithmis an elegant technique allowing a variant
Halving algorithm to cope with errors by creating a set of virtual classifiers
for every classifier which occasionally disagree with the original classifier.
The Halving algorithm on this set of virtual classifiers satisfies a theorem
of the form:errors</p><p>3 0.81386513 <a title="178-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-02-17-The_Meaning_of_Confidence.html">289 hunch net-2008-02-17-The Meaning of Confidence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In many machine learning papers experiments are done and little confidence
bars are reported for the results. This often seems quite clear, until you
actually try to figure out what it means. There are several different kinds of
'confidence' being used, and it's easy to become confused.Confidence =
Probability. For those who haven't worried about confidence for a long time,
confidence is simply the probability of some event. You are confident about
events which have a large probability. This meaning of confidence is
inadequate in many applications because we want to reason about how much more
information we have, how much more is needed, and where to get it. As an
example, a learning algorithm might predict that the probability of an event
is0.5, but it's unclear if the probability is0.5because no examples have been
provided or0.5because many examples have been provided and the event is simply
fundamentally uncertain.Classical Confidence Intervals. These are common in
learning theory.</p><p>4 0.80051887 <a title="178-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-08-Incompatibilities_between_classical_confidence_intervals_and_learning..html">213 hunch net-2006-10-08-Incompatibilities between classical confidence intervals and learning.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Classical confidence intervals satisfy a theorem of the form: For some data
sourcesD,PrS ~ D(f(D) > g(S)) > 1-dwherefis some function of the distribution
(such as the mean) andgis some function of the observed sampleS. The
constraints onDcan vary between "Independent and identically distributed (IID)
samples from a gaussian with an unknown mean" to "IID samples from an
arbitrary distributionD". There are even some confidence intervals which do
not require IID samples.Classical confidence intervals often confuse people.
They donotsay "with high probability, for my observed sample, the bounds
holds". Instead, they tell you that if you reason according to the confidence
interval in the future (and the constraints onDare satisfied), then you are
not often wrong. Restated, they tell you something about what a safe procedure
is in a stochastic world wheredis the safety parameter.There are a number of
results in theoretical machine learning which use confidence intervals. For
example,TheE3alg</p><p>5 0.78923583 <a title="178-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-26-Problem%3A_Reductions_and_Relative_Ranking_Metrics.html">31 hunch net-2005-02-26-Problem: Reductions and Relative Ranking Metrics</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This, again, is something of a research direction rather than a single
problem.There are several metrics people care about which depend upon the
relative ranking of examples and there are sometimes good reasons to care
about such metrics. Examples includeAROC, "F1â&euro;ł, the proportion of the time
that the top ranked element is in some class, the proportion of the top 10
examples in some class (google's problem), the lowest ranked example of some
class, and the "sort distance" from a predicted ranking to a correct ranking.
Seeherefor an example of some of these.ProblemWhat does the ability to
classify well imply about performance under these metrics?Past
WorkProbabilistic classification under squared errorcan be solved with a
classifier. A counterexample shows this does not imply a good AROC.Sample

<p>Introduction: Hunch.net has shifted to a new server, and wordpress has been updated to the latest version. If anyone notices difficulties associated with this, please comment. (Note that DNS updates can take awhile so the shift may not yet be complete.)

<p>Introduction: The hunch.net server has been updated.  I’ve taken the opportunity to upgrade the version of wordpress which caused cascading changes.
  
 Old threaded comments are now flattened.  The system we used to use ( Brian’s threaded comments ) appears incompatible with the new threading system built into wordpress.  I haven’t yet figured out a workaround. 
 I setup a  feedburner account . 
 I added an RSS aggregator for both Machine Learning and other research blogs that I like to follow.  This is something that I’ve wanted to do for awhile. 
 Many other minor changes in font and format, with some help from  Alina . 
  
If you have any suggestions for site tweaks, please speak up.</p><p>3 0.12298258 <a title="182-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-02-Retrospective.html">225 hunch net-2007-01-02-Retrospective</a></p>
<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time. 
  Feedback failure .  This blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from</p><p>4 0.10455205 <a title="182-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-12-Blog_compromised.html">294 hunch net-2008-04-12-Blog compromised</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Iain  noticed that hunch.net had zero width divs hiding spammy URLs.  Some investigation reveals that the wordpress version being used (2.0.3) had security flaws.  I’ve upgraded to the latest, rotated passwords, and removed the spammy URLs.  I don’t believe any content was lost.  You can check your own and other sites for a similar problem by greping for “width:0″ or “width: 0″ in the delivered html source.</p><p>5 0.094774708 <a title="182-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-05-Site_Update.html">107 hunch net-2005-09-05-Site Update</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I tweaked the site in a number of ways today, including:
  
 Updating to  WordPress  1.5. 
 Installing and heavily tweaking the  Geekniche  theme.  Update: I switched back to a tweaked version of the old theme. 
 Adding the  Customizable Post Listings  plugin. 
 Installing the  StatTraq  plugin. 
 Updating some of the links.  I particularly recommend looking at the  computer research policy  blog. 
 Adding  threaded comments .  This doesn’t thread old comments obviously, but the extra structure may be helpful for new ones. 
  
Overall, I think this is an improvement, and it addresses a few of my  earlier problems .  If you have any difficulties or anything seems “not quite right”, please speak up.  A few other tweaks to the site may happen in the near future.</p><p>6 0.093714729 <a title="182-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-13-David_Pennock_starts_Oddhead.html">214 hunch net-2006-10-13-David Pennock starts Oddhead</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is the  6 month point  in the “run a research blog” experiment, so it seems like a good point to take stock and assess.  
 
One fundamental question is: “Is it worth it?”  The idea of running a research blog will never become widely popular and useful unless it actually aids research.  On the negative side, composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount of time.  On the positive side, the process might yield better research because there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster thinking.
 
My answer at the moment is a provisional “yes”.  Running the blog has been incidentally helpful in several ways:
  
 It is sometimes educational.  example  
 More often, the process of composing thoughts well enough to post simply aids thinking.  This has resulted in a couple solutions to problems of  interest  (and perhaps more over time).  If you really want to solve a problem, letting the world know is helpful.  This isn’t necessarily</p><p>4 0.55190271 <a title="182-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-05-Site_Update.html">107 hunch net-2005-09-05-Site Update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a difficult subject to talk about for many reasons, but a discussion may be helpful.
 
Bad reviewing is a problem in academia.  The first step in understanding this is admitting to the problem, so here is a short list of examples of bad reviewing. 
  
 Reviewer disbelieves theorem proof (ICML),  or disbelieve theorem with a trivially false counterexample. (COLT)  
 Reviewer internally swaps quantifiers in a theorem, concludes it has been done before and is trivial. (NIPS) 
 Reviewer believes a technique will not work despite experimental validation. (COLT) 
 Reviewers fail to notice flaw in theorem statement (CRYPTO).   
 Reviewer erroneously claims that it has been done before (NIPS, SODA, JMLR)—(complete with references!) 
 Reviewer inverts the message of a paper and concludes it says nothing important. (NIPS*2) 
 Reviewer fails to distinguish between a DAG and a tree (SODA). 
 Reviewer is enthusiastic about paper but clearly does not understand (ICML).

<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This

<p>Introduction: I tweaked the site in a number of ways today, including:Updating
toWordPress1.5.Installing and heavily tweaking theGeeknichetheme. Update: I
switched back to a tweaked version of the old theme.Adding theCustomizable
Post Listingsplugin.Installing theStatTraqplugin.Updating some of the links. I
particularly recommend looking at thecomputer research
policyblog.Addingthreaded comments. This doesn't thread old comments
obviously, but the extra structure may be helpful for new ones.Overall, I
think this is an improvement, and it addresses a few of myearlier problems. If
you have any difficulties or anything seems "not quite right", please speak
up. A few other tweaks to the site may happen in the near future.</p><p>5 0.52534419 <a title="182-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-21-Six_Months.html">96 hunch net-2005-07-21-Six Months</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is the6 month pointin the "run a research blog" experiment, so it seems
like a good point to take stock and assess.One fundamental question is: "Is it
worth it?" The idea of running a research blog will never become widely
popular and useful unless it actually aids research. On the negative side,
composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount
of time. On the positive side, the process might yield better research because
there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster
thinking.My answer at the moment is a provisional "yes". Running the blog has
been incidentally helpful in several ways:It is sometimes
educational.exampleMore often, the process of composing thoughts well enough
to post simply aids thinking. This has resulted in a couple solutions to
problems ofinterest(and perhaps more over time). If you really want to solve a
problem, letting the world know is helpful. This isn't necessarily because the
world will help you s</p><p>6 0.51949388 <a title="182-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>

workshopdiscussing the use of no-regret algorithms for the use of several
robot-related learning problems. There seems to be a drafthere. This seems
interesting in two ways:Drawback RemovalOne of the significant problems with
these online algorithms is that they can't cope with structure very easily.
This drawback is addressed for certain structures.ExperimentsOne criticism of
such algorithms is that they are too "worst case". Several experiments suggest
that protecting yourself against this worst case does not necessarily incur a
great loss.</p><p>3 0.72632504 <a title="182-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML_Open_Questions_and_ICML_Instructions.html">458 hunch net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML Open Questions and ICML Instructions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Sashais theopen problemschair for bothCOLTandICML. Open problems will be
presented in a joint session in the evening of the COLT/ICML overlap day. COLT
has a history of open sessions, but this is new for ICML. If you have a
difficult theoretically definable problem in machine learning, consider
submitting it for review,due March 16. You'll benefit three ways:The effort of
writing down a precise formulation of what you want often helps you understand
the nature of the problem.Your problem will be officially published and
citable.You might have it solved by some very intelligent bored people.The
general idea could easily be applied to any problem which can be crisply
stated with an easily verifiable solution, and we may consider expanding this
in later years, but for this year all problems need to be of a theoretical
variety.Joelleand I (andMahdi, andLaurent) finished an initial assignment

<p>Introduction: One standard approach for clustering data with a set of gaussians is using EM.
Roughly speaking, you pick a set ofkrandom guassians and then use alternating
expectation maximization to (hopefully) find a set of guassians that "explain"
the data well. This process is difficult to work with because EM can become
"stuck" in local optima. There are various hacks like "rerun withtdifferent
random starting points".One cool observation is that this can often be solved
via other algorithm which donotsuffer from local optima. This is an
earlypaperwhich shows this. Ravi Kannan presented anew papershowing this is
possible in a much more adaptive setting.A very rough summary of these papers
is that by projecting into a lower dimensional space, it is computationally
tractable to pick out the gross structure of the data. It is unclear how well
these algorithms work in practice, but they might be effective, especially if
used as a subroutine of the form:Project to low dimensional space.Pick out

<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made sinceSanjoypointed out the
significantlack of theoretical understanding of active learning. This is an
update on the progress I know of. As a refresher, active learning as meant
here is:There is a source of unlabeled data.There is an oracle from which
labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source.The goal is
to perform well with minimal use of the oracle.Here is what I've
learned:Sanjoy has developed sufficient and semi-necessary conditions for
active learning given the assumptions of IID data and "realizability" (that
one of the classifiers is a correct classifier).Nina,Alina, and I developed an
algorithm for active learning relying on only the assumption of IID data. A
draft ishere.Nicolo,Claudio, andLucashowed that it is possible to do active
learning in an entirely adversarial setting for linear threshold
classifiershere. This was published a year or two ago and I recently learned
about it.All of these results are relative</p><p>6 0.49069703 <a title="182-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-30-John_Langford_%26%238211%3B%3E_Yahoo_Research%2C_NY.html">175 hunch net-2006-04-30-John Langford &#8211;> Yahoo Research, NY</a></p>

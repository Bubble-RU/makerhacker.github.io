<p>Introduction: Luis  has released  Peekaboom  a successor to  ESPgame  ( game site ).  The purpose of the game is similar—using the actions of people playing a game to gather data helpful in solving AI.  
 
Peekaboom gathers more detailed, and perhaps more useful, data about vision.  For ESPgame, the byproduct of the game was mutually agreed upon labels for common images.  For Peekaboom, the location of the subimage generating the label is revealed by the game as well.  Given knowledge about what portion of the image is related to a label it may be more feasible learn to recognize the appropriate parts. 
 
There isn’t a dataset yet available for this game as there is for ESPgame, but hopefully a significant number of people will play and we’ll have one to work wtih soon.</p><p>3 0.25318003 <a title="209-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-27-The_Peekaboom_Dataset.html">159 hunch net-2006-02-27-The Peekaboom Dataset</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahn â&euro;&tilde;s  Peekaboom project  has yielded  data  (830MB).
 
Peekaboom is the second attempt (after  Espgame ) to produce a dataset which is useful for learning to solve vision problems based on voluntary game play.  As a second attempt, it is meant to address all of the shortcomings of the first attempt.  In particular:
  
 The locations of specific objects are provided by the data. 
 The data collection is far more complete and extensive. 
  
The data consists of:
  
 The source images. (1 file per image, just short of 60K images.) 
 The in-game events. (1 file per image, in a lispy syntax.) 
 A description of the event language. 
  
There is a great deal of very specific and relevant data here so the hope that this will help solve vision problems seems quite reasonable.</p><p>4 0.18192123 <a title="209-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-28-CI_Fellows_program_renewed.html">396 hunch net-2010-04-28-CI Fellows program renewed</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Luis von Ahn  has been running the  espgame  for awhile now.  The espgame provides a picture to two randomly paired people across the web, and asks them to agree on a label.  It hasn’t managed to label the web yet, but it has produced a  large dataset  of (image, label) pairs.  I organized the dataset so you could  explore the implied bipartite graph  (requires much bandwidth).
 
Relative to other image datasets, this one is quite large—67000 images, 358,000 labels (average of 5/image with variation from 1 to 19), and 22,000 unique labels (one every 3 images).  The dataset is also very ‘natural’, consisting of images spidered from the internet.  The multiple label characteristic is intriguing because ‘learning to learn’ and metalearning techniques may be applicable.  The ‘natural’ quality means that this dataset varies greatly in difficulty from easy (predicting “red”) to hard (predicting “funny”) and potentially more rewarding to tackle.

<p>Introduction: Lev Reyzin  points out the  CI Fellows Project .  Essentially,  NSF  is funding 60 postdocs in computer science for graduates from a wide array of US places to a wide array of US places.  This is particularly welcome given a tough year for new hires.  I expect some fraction of these postdocs will be in ML.  The time frame is quite short, so those interested should look it over immediately.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.81885368 <a title="209-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-19-Luis_von_Ahn_is_awarded_a_MacArthur_fellowship..html">209 hunch net-2006-09-19-Luis von Ahn is awarded a MacArthur fellowship.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: IJCAI  is running January 6-12 in Hyderabad India rather than a more traditional summer date. (Presumably, this is to avoid melting people in the Indian summer.)
 
The paper deadline(June 23 abstract / June 30 submission) are particularly inconvenient if you attend  COLT  or  ICML .  But on the other hand, itâ&euro;&trade;s a good excuse to visit India.</p><p>4 0.42892843 <a title="209-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-14-More_NIPS_Papers_II.html">140 hunch net-2005-12-14-More NIPS Papers II</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I thought this was a very good NIPS with many excellent papers. The following are a few NIPS papers which I liked and I hope to study more carefully when I get the chance. The list is not exhaustive and in no particular order…
  
 Preconditioner Approximations for Probabilistic Graphical Models. 
Pradeeep Ravikumar and John Lafferty. 
I thought the use of preconditioner methods from solving linear systems in the context of approximate inference was novel and interesting. The results look good and I’d like to understand the limitations.
 
 Rodeo: Sparse nonparametric regression in high dimensions. 
John Lafferty and Larry Wasserman. 
A very interesting approach to feature selection in nonparametric regression from a frequentist framework. The use of lengthscale variables in each dimension reminds me a lot of  ‘Automatic Relevance Determination’ in Gaussian process regression — it would be interesting to compare Rodeo to ARD in GPs.

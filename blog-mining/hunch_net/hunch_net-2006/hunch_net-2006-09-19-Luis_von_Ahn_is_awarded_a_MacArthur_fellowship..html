<p>Introduction: Lev Reyzinpoints out theCI Fellows Project. Essentially,NSFis funding 60
postdocs in computer science for graduates from a wide array of US places to a
wide array of US places. This is particularly welcome given a tough year for
new hires. I expect some fraction of these postdocs will be in ML. The time
frame is quite short, so those interested should look it over immediately.</p><p>4 0.10842852 <a title="209-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-20-Both_new%3A_STOC_workshops_and_NEML.html">462 hunch net-2012-04-20-Both new: STOC workshops and NEML</a></p>

workshop/symposium on machine learning. To present a poster, submit an
abstract byMay 5.May 19 in New York,STOCis coming to town and rather

<p>Introduction: Do we have computer hardware sufficient for AI? This question is difficult to
answer, but here's a try:One way to achieve AI is by simulating a human brain.
A human brain has about 1015synapses which operate at about 102per second
implying about 1017bit ops per second.A modern computer runs at
109cycles/second and operates on 102bits per cycle implying 1011bits processed
per second.The gap here is only 6 orders of magnitude, which can be plausibly
surpassed via cluster machines. For example, theBlueGene/Loperates 105nodes
(one order of magnitude short). It's peak recorded performance is about
0.5*1015FLOPS which translates to about 1016bit ops per second, which is
nearly 1017.There are many criticisms (both positive and negative) for this
argument.Simulation of a human brain might require substantially more detail.
Perhaps an additional 102is required per neuron.We may not need to simulate a
human brain to achieve AI. There are certainly many examples where we have
been able to design</p><p>6 0.42409655 <a title="209-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-20-Both_new%3A_STOC_workshops_and_NEML.html">462 hunch net-2012-04-20-Both new: STOC workshops and NEML</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is a (near) transcript of a talk that I gave at theICML 2013
Workshop on Peer Review and Publishing Models. Although there's aPDF available
on my website, I've chosen to post a slightly modified version here as well in
order to better facilitate discussion.Disclaimers and ContextI want to start
with a couple of disclaimers and some context.First, I want to point out that
although I've read a lot about double-blind review, this isn't my research
area and the research discussed in this post is not my own. As a result, I
probably can't answer super detailed questions about these studies.I also want
to note that I'm not opposed to open peer review -- I was a free and open
source software developer for over ten years and I care a great deal about
openness and transparency. Rather, my motivation in writing this post is
simply to create awareness of and to initiate discussion about the benefits of
double-blind review.Lastly, and most importantly, I think it's essential to
acknowledg</p><p>5 0.12545578 <a title="209-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-06-27-Reviewing_Horror_Stories.html">304 hunch net-2008-06-27-Reviewing Horror Stories</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections. They
always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections
come to seem reasonable. Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the
topic just isn't as important as was originally thought. A few rejections do
not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror
stories, a great material for conversations. I've decided to share three of
mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.Prediction Theory for
Classification Tutorial. This is a tutorial about tight sample complexity
bounds for classification that I submitted toJMLR. The first decision I heard
was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me--for example one of the
reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics
books. Upon further inquiry, several citations were given, none of which
actually covered the content. Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was
accepted. Apparently, the pape</p><p>6 0.034751274 <a title="209-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-02-Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Googling.html">10 hunch net-2005-02-02-Kolmogorov Complexity and Googling</a></p>

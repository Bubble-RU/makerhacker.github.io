<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This

<p>Introduction: Lancereminded me aboutelectoralmarketstoday, which is cool enough that I want
to point it out explicitly here.Most people stilluse pollsto predict who wins,
while electoralmarkets uses people betting real money. They might use polling
information, but any other sources of information are implicitly also allowed.
A side-by-side comparison of how polls compare to prediction markets might be
fun in a few months.</p><p>5 0.22683169 <a title="214-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-08-Prediction_Science.html">345 hunch net-2009-03-08-Prediction Science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One view of machine learning is that it's about how to program computers to
predict well. This suggests a broader research program centered around the
more pervasive goal of simply predicting well.There are many distinct strands
of this broader research program which are only partially unified. Here are
the ones that I know of:Learning Theory. Learning theory focuses on several
topics related to the dynamics and process of prediction. Convergence bounds
like theVC boundgive an intellectual foundation to many learning algorithms.
Online learning algorithms likeWeighted Majorityprovide an alternate purely
game theoretic foundation for learning.Boosting algorithmsyield algorithms for
purifying prediction abiliity.Reduction algorithmsprovide means for changing
esoteric problems into well known ones.Machine Learning. A great deal of
experience has accumulated in practical algorithm design from a mixture of
paradigms, including bayesian, biological, optimization, and
theoretical.Mechanism De</p><p>6 0.22318342 <a title="214-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is the6 month pointin the "run a research blog" experiment, so it seems
like a good point to take stock and assess.One fundamental question is: "Is it
worth it?" The idea of running a research blog will never become widely
popular and useful unless it actually aids research. On the negative side,
composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount
of time. On the positive side, the process might yield better research because
there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster
thinking.My answer at the moment is a provisional "yes". Running the blog has
been incidentally helpful in several ways:It is sometimes
educational.exampleMore often, the process of composing thoughts well enough
to post simply aids thinking. This has resulted in a couple solutions to
problems ofinterest(and perhaps more over time). If you really want to solve a
problem, letting the world know is helpful. This isn't necessarily because the
world will help you s</p><p>4 0.63274419 <a title="214-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-09-Inherent_Uncertainty.html">383 hunch net-2009-12-09-Inherent Uncertainty</a></p>

to have a multiauthor blog which is more specialized towards learning

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is
encouraging. There is some discussion of this at theComputing Research
Policyblog.One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time,
presumably in dollar budgets. I don't believe that dollar budgets are the
right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers. A better way
to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a
measure of the relative emphasis on research.This graph was assembled by
dividing theNSF budgetby theUS GDP. For 2005 GDP, I used thecurrent
estimateand for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per
year. The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to
change.This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding
emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row. The reality has been significantly
more severe due toDARPA decreasing fundingand industrial research labs (ATnT

few days for another super-conglomerate team to come together and there is
some small chance that the performance is nonrepresentative of the final test
set, but I expect not.Regardless of the final outcome, the biggest lesson for
ML from the Netflix contest has been the formidable performance edge of

<p>Introduction: In the online learning with experts setting, you observe a set of predictions,
make a decision, and then observe the truth. This process repeats
indefinitely. In this setting, it is possible to prove theorems of the
sort:master algorithm error count < = k* best predictor error count +
c*log(number of predictors)Is this a statement about learning or about
preservation of learning? We did some experiments to analyze the newBinning
algorithmwhich works in this setting. For several UCI datasets, we reprocessed
them so that features could be used as predictors and then applied several
master algorithms. The first graph confirms that Binning is indeed a better
algorithm according to the tightness of the upper bound.Here, "Best" is the
performance of the best expert. "V. Bound" is the bound forVovk's algorithm
(the previous best). "Bound" is the bound for the Binning algorithm. "Binning"
is the performance of the Binning algorithm. The Binning algorithm clearly has
a tighter bound, and the pe</p><p>5 0.12189734 <a title="170-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-10-Precision_is_not_accuracy.html">202 hunch net-2006-08-10-Precision is not accuracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my experience, there are two different groups of people who believe the
same thing: the mathematics encountered in typical machine learning conference
papers is often of questionable value.The two groups who agree on this are
applied machine learning people who have given up on math, and mature
theoreticians who understand the limits of theory.Partly, this is just a
statement about where we are with respect to machine learning. In particular,
we have no mechanism capable of generating a prescription for how to solve all
learning problems. In the absence of such certainty, people try to come up
with formalisms that partially describe and motivate how and why they do
things. This is natural and healthy--we might hope that it will eventually
lead to just such a mechanism.But, part of this is simply an emphasis on
complexity over clarity. A very natural and simple theoretical statement is
often obscured by complexifications. Common sources of complexification

<p>Introduction: Sham Kakadepoints out that we are missing a bound.Suppose we
havemsamplesxdrawn IID from some distributionD. Through the magic of
exponential moment method we know that:If the range ofxis bounded by an
interval of sizeI, aChernoff/Hoeffding style boundgives us a bound on the
deviations likeO(I/m0.5)(at least in crude form). A proof is on page 9here.If
the range ofxis bounded, and the variance (or a bound on the variance) is
known, thenBennett's boundcan give tighter results (*). This can be a huge
improvment when the true variance small.What's missing here is a bound that
depends on the observed variance rather than a bound on the variance. This
means that many people attempt to use Bennett's bound (incorrectly) by
plugging the observed variance in as the true variance, invalidating the bound
application. Most of the time, they get away with it, but this is a dangerous
move when doing machine learning. In machine learning, we are typically trying
to find a predictor with 0 expected los</p><p>4 0.68428481 <a title="170-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-15-The_State_of_Tight_Bounds.html">41 hunch net-2005-03-15-The State of Tight Bounds</a></p>

<p>Introduction: "Science" has many meanings, but one common meaning is "thescientific method"
which is a principled method for investigating the world using the following
steps:Form a hypothesis about the world.Use the hypothesis to make
predictions.Run experiments to confirm or disprove the predictions.The
ordering of these steps is very important to the scientific method. In
particular, predictionsmustbe made before experiments are run.Given that we
all believe in the scientific method of investigation, it may be surprising to
learn that cheating is very common. This happens for many reasons, some
innocent and some not.Drug studies. Pharmaceutical companies make predictions
about the effects of their drugs and then conduct blind clinical studies to
determine their effect. Unfortunately, they have also been caught using some
of the more advanced techniques for cheatinghere: including "reprobleming",
"data set selection", and probably "overfitting by review". It isn't too
surprising to observe this: w</p><p>6 0.63398278 <a title="170-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-12-Online_learning_or_online_preservation_of_learning%3F.html">163 hunch net-2006-03-12-Online learning or online preservation of learning?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just visitedISIwhereDaniel Marcuand others are working on machine
translation. Apparently, machine translation is rapidly improving. A
particularly dramatic year was 2002->2003 when systems switched from word-
based translation to phrase-based translation. From a (now famous) slide by
Charles Wayne atDARPA(which funds much of the work on machine translation)
here is some anecdotal evidence:20022003insistent Wednesday may recurred her

<p>Introduction: Nati SrebroandShai Ben-Davidhave apaperatCOLTwhich, in the appendix, proves
something very striking: several previous error bounds arealwaysgreater than
1.BackgroundOne branch of learning theory focuses on theorems whichAssume
samples are drawn IID from an unknown distributionD.Fix a set of
classifiersFind a high probability bound on the maximum true error rate (with
respect toD) as a function of the empirical error rate on the training
set.Many of these bounds become extremely complex and hairy.CurrentEveryone
working on this subject wants "tighter bounds", however there are different
definitions of "tighter". Some groups focus on "functional tightness" (getting
the right functional dependency between the size of the training set and a
parameterization of the hypothesis space) whileothersfocus on "practical
tightness" (finding bounds which work well on practical problems). (I am
definitely in the second camp.)One of the dangers of striving for "functional
tightness" is that the bound</p><p>3 0.84458345 <a title="170-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-28-Science_Fiction_and_Research.html">64 hunch net-2005-04-28-Science Fiction and Research</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and
then trying to figure out how to get there.A big part of science fiction is
imagining how things could be different, and then working through the
implications.Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can
sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research. (And, hey, it's
fun.) Here's some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem
particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning
systems:Vernor Vinge, "True Names", "A Fire Upon the Deep"Marc Stiegler,
"David's Sling", "Earthweb"Charles Stross, "Singularity Sky"Greg Egan,
"Diaspora"Joe Haldeman, "Forever Peace"(There are surely many
others.)Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.
Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans
control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series). That didn't really happen in the
last 50 years. Instead, we gradually refined the degree to whi</p><p>4 0.79187274 <a title="170-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-13-Regression_vs._Classification_as_a_Primitive.html">196 hunch net-2006-07-13-Regression vs. Classification as a Primitive</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Forlearning reductionswe have been concentrating on reducing various complex
learning problems to binary classification. This choice needs to be actively
questioned, because it was not carefully considered.Binary clasification is
learning a classifierc:X -> {0,1}so as to minimize the probability of being
wrong,Prx,y~D(c(x)y).The primary alternative candidate seems to be squared
error regression. In squared error regression, you learn a regressors:X ->
[0,1]so as to minimize squared error,Ex,y~D(s(x)-y)2.It is difficult to judge
one primitive against another. The judgement must at least partially be made
on nontheoretical grounds because (essentially) we are evaluating a choice
between two axioms/assumptions.These two primitives are significantly related.
Classification can be reduced to regression in the obvious way: you use the
regressor to predictD(y=1|x), then threshold at0.5. For this simple reduction
a squared error regret ofrimplies a classification regret of at mostr0.5.

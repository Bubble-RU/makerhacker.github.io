<p>Introduction: "Deep learning" is used to describe learning architectures which have
significant depth (as a circuit).One claimis that shallow architectures (one
or two layers) can not concisely represent some functions while a circuit with
more depth can concisely represent these same functions. Proving lower bounds
on the size of a circuit is substantially harder than upper bounds (which are
constructive), but some results are known.Luca Trevisan'sclass notesdetail how
XOR is not concisely representable by "AC0â&euro;ł (= constant depth unbounded fan-in
AND, OR, NOT gates). This doesn't quite prove that depth is necessary for the
representations commonly used in learning (such as a thresholded weighted
sum), but it is strongly suggestive that this is so.Examples like this are a
bit disheartening because existing algorithms for deep learning (deep belief
nets, gradient descent on deep neural networks, and a perhaps decision trees
depending on who you ask) can't learn XOR very easily. Evidence so far

Deep Networks. Empirically investigates some of the design choices behind deep
belief networks.Long Zhu, Yuanhao Chen,Alan YuilleUnsupervised Learning of a

Adaptation. This is the first analysis I've seen of learning with respect to
samples drawn differently from the evaluation distribution which depends on
reasonable measurable quantities.All of these papers turn out to have a common
theme--the power of unlabeled data to do generically useful things.</p><p>6 0.16563594 <a title="201-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-01-01-Deep_Learning_2012.html">477 hunch net-2013-01-01-Deep Learning 2012</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, a scheduling failure meant I missed all ofAIStatand most of
thelearning workshop, otherwise known as Snowbird, when it's atSnowbird.At
snowbird, the talk onSum-Productnetworks byHoifung Poonstood out to me (Pedro
Domingosis a coauthor.). The basic point was that by appropriately
constructing networks based on sums and products, the normalization problem in
probabilistic models is eliminated, yielding a highly tractable yet flexible
representation+learning algorithm. As an algorithm, this is noticeably cleaner
than deep belief networks with a claim to being an order of magnitude faster
and working better on an image completion task.Snowbird doesn't have real
papers--just the abstract above. I look forward to seeing the paper. (added:
Rodrigo points out the deep learning workshopdraft.)</p><p>5 0.79336423 <a title="201-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-10-A_Deep_Belief_Net_Learning_Problem.html">227 hunch net-2007-01-10-A Deep Belief Net Learning Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Graduating students in Statistics appear to be at a substantial handicap
compared to graduating students in Machine Learning, despite being in
substantially overlapping subjects.The problem seems to be cultural.
Statistics comes from a mathematics background which emphasizes large
publications slowly published under review at journals. Machine Learning comes
from a Computer Science background which emphasizes quick publishing at
reviewed conferences. This has a number of implications:Graduating statistics
PhDs often have 0-2 publications while graduating machine learning PhDs might
have 5-15.Graduating ML students have had a chance for others to build on
their work. Stats students have had no such chance.Graduating ML students have
attended a number of conferences and presented their work, giving them a

<p>Introduction: One of the fundamental underpinnings of the internet is advertising based
content. This has become much more effective due to targeted advertising where
ads are specifically matched to interests. Everyone is familiar with this,
because everyone uses search engines and all search engines try to make money
this way.The problem of matching ads to interests is a natural machine
learning problem in some ways since there is much information in who clicks on
what. A fundamental problem with this information is that it is not supervised
--in particular a click-or-not on one ad doesn't generally tell you if a
different ad would have been clicked on. This implies we have a fundamental
exploration problem.A standard mathematical setting for this situation is
"k-Armed Bandits", often with various relevant embellishments. Thek-Armed
Bandit setting works on a round-by-round basis. On each round:A policy chooses
armafrom1ofkarms (i.e. 1 of k ads).The world reveals the rewardraof the chosen

<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple. Viewed
representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear
separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or
perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural
networks or kernelized SVMs). Should we go beyond this, and start using "deep"
representations?What is deep learning?Intuitively, deep learning is about
learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the
input (observed) features.Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be
rather difficult. Consider the following cases:SVM with Gaussian Kernel. This
is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can't
succinctly represent certain decision surfaces. One ofYann LeCun's examples is
recognizing objects based on pixel values. An SVM will need a new support
vector for each significantly different background. Since the number of
distinct backgrounds i</p><p>4 0.93650138 <a title="201-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-14-Interesting_Papers_at_COLT_2007.html">247 hunch net-2007-06-14-Interesting Papers at COLT 2007</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are two papers that seem particularly interesting at this year's
COLT.Gilles BlanchardandFranÃƒÂ§ois Fleuret,Occam's Hammer. When we are
interested in very tight bounds on the true error rate of a classifier, it is
tempting to use a PAC-Bayes bound which can (empirically) bequite tight. A
disadvantage of the PAC-Bayes bound is that it applies to a classifier which
is randomized over a set of base classifiers rather than a single classifier.
This paper shows that a similar bound can be proved which holds for a single
classifier drawn from the set. The ability to safely use a single classifier
is very nice. This technique applies generically to any base bound, so it has
other applications covered in the paper.Adam Tauman Kalai.Learning Nested
Halfspaces and Uphill Decision Trees. Classification PAC-learning, where you
prove that any problem amongst some set is polytime learnable with respect to
any distribution over the inputXis extraordinarily challenging as judged by

<p>Introduction: In my experience, there are two different groups of people who believe the
same thing: the mathematics encountered in typical machine learning conference
papers is often of questionable value.The two groups who agree on this are
applied machine learning people who have given up on math, and mature
theoreticians who understand the limits of theory.Partly, this is just a
statement about where we are with respect to machine learning. In particular,
we have no mechanism capable of generating a prescription for how to solve all
learning problems. In the absence of such certainty, people try to come up
with formalisms that partially describe and motivate how and why they do
things. This is natural and healthy--we might hope that it will eventually
lead to just such a mechanism.But, part of this is simply an emphasis on
complexity over clarity. A very natural and simple theoretical statement is
often obscured by complexifications. Common sources of complexification

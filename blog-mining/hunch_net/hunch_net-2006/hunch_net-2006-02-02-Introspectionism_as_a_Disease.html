<p>Introduction: Manifold based dimension-reduction algorithms share the following general outline.  
 
Given: a metric  d()  and a set of points  S 
  
 Construct a graph with a point in every node and every edge connecting to the node of one of the  k -nearest neighbors.  Associate with the edge a weight which is the distance between the points in the connected nodes. 
 Digest the graph.  This might include computing the shortest path between all points or figuring out how to linearly interpolate the point from it’s neighbors. 
 Find a set of points in a low dimensional space which preserve the digested properties. 
  
Examples include LLE, Isomap (which I worked on), Hessian-LLE, SDE, and many others.  The hope with these algorithms is that they can recover the low dimensional structure of point sets in high dimensional spaces.  Many of them can be shown to work in interesting ways producing various compelling pictures.

<p>Introduction: One of the common trends in machine learning has been an emphasis on the use of unlabeled data.  The argument goes something like “there aren’t many labeled web pages out there, but there are a  huge  number of web pages, so we must find a way to take advantage of them.”  There are several standard approaches for doing this:
  
  Unsupervised Learning .  You use only unlabeled data.  In a typical application, you cluster the data and hope that the clusters somehow correspond to what you care about. 
 Semisupervised Learning.  You use both unlabeled and labeled data to build a predictor.  The unlabeled data influences the learned predictor in some way. 
  Active Learning . You have unlabeled data and access to a labeling oracle.  You interactively choose which examples to label so as to optimize prediction accuracy. 
  
It seems there is a fourth approach worth serious investigation—automated labeling.  The approach goes as follows:

<p>Introduction: I recently had fun discussions with both  Vikash Mansinghka  and  Thomas Breuel  about approaching AI with machine learning.  The general interest in taking a crack at AI with machine learning seems to be rising on many fronts including  DARPA .
 
As a matter of history, there was a great deal of interest in AI which died down before I began research.  There remain many projects and conferences spawned in this earlier AI wave, as well as a good bit of experience about what did not work, or at least did not work yet.  Here are a few examples of failure modes that people seem to run into:
  
  Supply/Product confusion .  Sometimes we think “Intelligences use X, so I’ll create X and have an Intelligence.”  An example of this is the  Cyc Project  which inspires some people as “intelligences use ontologies, so I’ll create an ontology and a system using it to have an Intelligence.”  The flaw here is that Intelligences  create  ontologies, which they use, and without the ability to create ont</p><p>5 0.080419503 <a title="153-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-03-All_Models_of_Learning_have_Flaws.html">235 hunch net-2007-03-03-All Models of Learning have Flaws</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given framework or mathematical model.  It turns out that all of these models are significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning.  I’ve created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of machine learning.
 
The point here is not simply “woe unto us”.  There are several implications which seem important.
  
 The multitude of models is a point of continuing confusion.  It is common for people to learn about machine learning within one framework which often becomes there “home framework” through which they attempt to filter all machine learning.  (Have you met people who can only think in terms of kernels?  Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)  Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help resolve the confusion.  This is particularly important when reviewing and particularly important for students.

<p>Introduction: Do we have computer hardware sufficient for AI?  This question is difficult to answer, but here’s a try:
 
One way to achieve AI is by simulating a human brain.  A human brain has about 10 15  synapses which operate at about 10 2  per second implying about 10 17  bit ops per second.
 
A modern computer runs at 10 9  cycles/second and operates on 10 2  bits per cycle implying 10 11  bits processed per second.  
 
The gap here is only 6 orders of magnitude, which can be plausibly surpassed via cluster machines.  For example, the  BlueGene/L  operates 10 5  nodes (one order of magnitude short).  It’s peak recorded performance is about 0.5*10 15  FLOPS which translates to about 10 16  bit ops per second, which is nearly 10 17 .
 
There are many criticisms (both positive and negative) for this argument.
  
 Simulation of a human brain might require substantially more detail.  Perhaps an additional 10 2  is required per neuron. 
 We may not need to simulate a human brain to achieve AI.  Ther</p><p>4 0.68704528 <a title="153-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-12-It_Doesn%26%238217%3Bt_Stop.html">295 hunch net-2008-04-12-It Doesn&#8217;t Stop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve enjoyed the  Terminator  movies and show.  Neglecting the whacky aspects (time travel and associated paradoxes), there is an enduring topic of discussion: how do people deal with intelligent machines (and vice versa)?
 
In Terminator-land, the primary method for dealing with intelligent machines is to prevent them from being made.  This approach works pretty badly, because a new angle on building an intelligent machine keeps coming up.  This is partly a ploy for writer’s to avoid writing themselves out of a job, but there is a fundamental truth to it as well: preventing progress in research is hard.
 
The United States, has been experimenting with trying to stop research on  stem cells .  It hasn’t worked very well—the net effect has been retarding research programs a bit, and exporting some research to other countries.  Another less recent example was encryption technology, for which the United States generally did not encourage early public research and even  discouraged as a mu</p><p>5 0.6822812 <a title="153-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-29-AI_Safety.html">380 hunch net-2009-11-29-AI Safety</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Dan Reeves  introduced me to  Michael Vassar  who ran the  Singularity Summit  and educated me a bit on the subject of AI safety which the  Singularity Institute  has  small grants for .  
 
I still believe that  interstellar space travel is necessary for long term civilization survival, and the AI is necessary for interstellar space travel .  On these grounds alone, we could judge that developing AI is much more safe than not.  Nevertheless, there is a basic reasonable fear, as expressed by some commenters, that AI could go bad.
 
A basic scenario starts with someone inventing an AI and telling it to make as much money as possible.  The AI promptly starts trading in various markets to make money.  To improve, it crafts a virus that takes over most of the world’s computers using it as a surveillance network so that it can always make the right decision.  The AI also branches out into any form of distance work, taking over the entire outsourcing process for all jobs that are entirely di</p><p>6 0.67229414 <a title="153-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-08-Computability_in_Artificial_Intelligence.html">353 hunch net-2009-05-08-Computability in Artificial Intelligence</a></p>

<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the  2010 NYAS ML Symposium  this year.  (It was  about 170 last year .)  I particularly enjoyed several talks.
  
  Yann  has a new live demo of (limited) real-time object recognition learning.  
  Sanjoy  gave a fairly convincing and comprehensible explanation of why a  modified form of single-linkage clustering  is consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a critical feature for clustering algorithms.  I’m curious how well this algorithm works in practice. 
  Matt Hoffman ‘s poster covering online LDA seemed pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement. 
  
This year, we allocated more time towards posters & poster spotlights.  
 
For next year, we are considering some further changes.  The format has traditionally been 4 invited Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students.  Demand from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and startups in the area.  Another growing concern is the fa</p><p>same-blog 2 0.86523527 <a title="153-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-02-Introspectionism_as_a_Disease.html">153 hunch net-2006-02-02-Introspectionism as a Disease</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In the AI-related parts of machine learning, it is often tempting to examine how  you  do things in order to imagine how a machine should do things.  This is introspection, and it can easily go awry.  I will call introspection gone awry introspectionism.
 
Introspectionism is almost unique to AI (and the AI-related parts of machine learning) and it can lead to huge wasted effort in research.  It’s easiest to show how introspectionism arises by an example.
 
Suppose we want to solve the problem of navigating a robot from point A to point B given a camera.  Then, the following research action plan might seem natural when you examine your own capabilities:
  
 Build an edge detector for still images. 
 Build an object recognition system given the edge detector. 
 Build a system to predict distance and orientation to objects given the object recognition system. 
 Build a system to plan a path through the scene you construct from {object identification, distance, orientation} predictions.</p><p>3 0.84409177 <a title="153-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-30-ICML_papers.html">188 hunch net-2006-06-30-ICML papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are some ICML papers which interested me.
  
  Arindam Banerjee  had a  paper  which notes that PAC-Bayes bounds, a core theorem in online learning, and the optimality of Bayesian learning statements share a core inequality in their proof. 
  Pieter Abbeel ,  Morgan Quigley  and  Andrew Y. Ng  have a  paper  discussing RL techniques for learning given a bad (but not too bad) model of the world. 
  Nina Balcan  and  Avrim Blum  have a  paper  which discusses how to learn given a similarity function rather than a kernel.  A similarity function requires less structure than a kernel, implying that a learning algorithm using a similarity function might be applied in situations where no effective kernel is evident. 
  Nathan Ratliff ,  Drew Bagnell , and  Marty Zinkevich  have a  paper  describing an algorithm which attempts to fuse A *  path planning with learning of transition costs based on human demonstration.

<p>Introduction: In research, it’s often the case that solving a problem helps you realize that it wasn’t the right problem to solve.  This is the case for the “ reduce RL to classification ” problem with the solution hinted at  here  and turned into a paper  here .  
 
The essential difficulty is that the method of stating and analyzing reductions ends up being nonalgorithmic (unlike previous reductions) unless you work with learning from teleoperated robots as  Greg Grudic  does.  The difficulty here is due to the reduction being dependent on the optimal policy (which a human teleoperator might simulate, but which is otherwise unavailable).
 
So, this  problem  is “open” again with the caveat that this time we want a more algorithmic solution.  
 
Whether or not this is feasible at all is still unclear and evidence in either direction would greatly interest me.  A positive answer might have many practical implications in the long run.</p><p>6 0.7402972 <a title="153-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-29-Key_Scientific_Challenges_and_the_Franklin_Symposium.html">457 hunch net-2012-02-29-Key Scientific Challenges and the Franklin Symposium</a></p>

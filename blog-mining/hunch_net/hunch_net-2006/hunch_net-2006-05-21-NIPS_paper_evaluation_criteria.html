<p>Introduction: Bob Williamsonand I are the learning theory PC members atNIPSthis year. This
is some attempt to state the standards and tests I applied to the papers. I
think it is a good idea to talk about this for two reasons:Making community
standards a matter of public record seems healthy. It give us a chance to
debate what is and is not the right standard. It might even give us a bit more
consistency across the years.It may save us all time. There are a number of
papers submitted which just aren't there yet. Avoiding submitting is the right
decision in this case.There are several criteria for judging a paper. All of
these were active this year. Some criteria are uncontroversial while others
may be so.The paper must have a theorem establishing something new for which
it is possible to derive high confidence in the correctness of the results. A
surprising number of papers fail this test. This criteria seems essential to
the definition of "theory".Missing theorem statementMissing proofThis isn't an</p><p>3 0.10118423 <a title="180-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-30-ICML_Posters_and_Scope.html">454 hunch net-2012-01-30-ICML Posters and Scope</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally, I don't indulge in posters forICML, but this year is naturally an
exception for me. If you want one, there are a small numberleft here, if you
sign up before February.It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the
scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting
papers. At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which
informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers. Program chairs setup
the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the
reviewing process. Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because
a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the
community determine the conference. Nevertheless, as a program chair this year
it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to
encourage (and occasionally discourage).At the highest level, I believe ICML
exists to further research into machine learning, which I generally think of

is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and
reduce peak load. The "not for proceedings" experiment from this year's ICML

<p>Introduction: ByShieandNatiFollowing John's advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought
it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is
often the best place for theory papers. We would like to emphasize that we
both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs,
and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers. For
many papers, ICML is the best venue. But for many theory papers, COLT is a
better and more appropriate place.Why should you submit to COLT?By-and-large,
theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory
papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking
theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT
is more focused then ICML with a single track session. Unlike ICML, the norm
in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks
presented. There is also often a lively discussion following paper

<p>Introduction: The prevailing wisdom in machine learning seems to be that motivating a paper
is the responsibility of the author. I think this is a harmful view--instead,
it's healthier for the community to regard this as the responsibility of the
reviewer.There are lots of reasons to prefer a reviewer-responsibility
approach.Authors are the most biased possible source of information about the
motivation of the paper. Systems which rely upon very biased sources of
information are inherently unreliable.Authors are highly variable in their
ability and desire to express motivation for their work. This adds greatly to
variance on acceptance of an idea, and it can systematically discriminate or
accentuate careers. It's great if you have a career accentuated by awesome
wording choice, but wise decision making by reviewers is important for the
field.The motivation section in a paper doesn'tdoanything in some sense--it's
there to get the paper in. Reading the motivation of a paper is of little use
in helping</p><p>4 0.53199589 <a title="180-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-08-27-NYAS_ML_2012_and_ICML_2013.html">472 hunch net-2012-08-27-NYAS ML 2012 and ICML 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a very difficult post to write, because it is about a perenially
touchy subject. Nevertheless, it is an important one which needs to be thought
about carefully.There are a few things which should be understood:The system
is changing and responsive. We-the-authors are we-the-reviewers, we-the-PC,
and even we-the-NIPS-board. NIPS has implemented 'secondary program chairs',
'author response', and 'double blind reviewing' in the last few years to help
with the decision process, and more changes may happen in the future.Agreement
creates a perception of correctness. When any PC meets and makes a group
decision about a paper, there is a strong tendency for the reinforcement
inherent in a group decision to create the perception of correctness. For the
many people who have been on the NIPS PC it's reasonable to entertain a
healthy skepticism in the face of this reinforcing certainty.This post is
about structural problems. What problems arise because of the structure of the
process? The</p><p>6 0.49340478 <a title="180-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-04-Grounds_for_Rejection.html">52 hunch net-2005-04-04-Grounds for Rejection</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Claude Sammutis attempting to put together anEncyclopedia of Machine Learning.
I volunteered to write one article onEfficient RL in MDPs, which I would like
to invite comment on. Is something critical missing?</p><p>4 0.63676709 <a title="180-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-29-The_Benefits_of_Double-Blind_Review.html">485 hunch net-2013-06-29-The Benefits of Double-Blind Review</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is a (near) transcript of a talk that I gave at theICML 2013
Workshop on Peer Review and Publishing Models. Although there's aPDF available
on my website, I've chosen to post a slightly modified version here as well in
order to better facilitate discussion.Disclaimers and ContextI want to start
with a couple of disclaimers and some context.First, I want to point out that
although I've read a lot about double-blind review, this isn't my research
area and the research discussed in this post is not my own. As a result, I
probably can't answer super detailed questions about these studies.I also want
to note that I'm not opposed to open peer review -- I was a free and open
source software developer for over ten years and I care a great deal about
openness and transparency. Rather, my motivation in writing this post is
simply to create awareness of and to initiate discussion about the benefits of
double-blind review.Lastly, and most importantly, I think it's essential to

<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections. They
always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections
come to seem reasonable. Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the
topic just isn't as important as was originally thought. A few rejections do
not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror
stories, a great material for conversations. I've decided to share three of
mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.Prediction Theory for
Classification Tutorial. This is a tutorial about tight sample complexity
bounds for classification that I submitted toJMLR. The first decision I heard
was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me--for example one of the
reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics
books. Upon further inquiry, several citations were given, none of which
actually covered the content. Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was
accepted. Apparently, the pape</p><p>6 0.41326934 <a title="180-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-14-Who_is_Responsible_for_a_Bad_Review%3F.html">320 hunch net-2008-10-14-Who is Responsible for a Bad Review?</a></p>

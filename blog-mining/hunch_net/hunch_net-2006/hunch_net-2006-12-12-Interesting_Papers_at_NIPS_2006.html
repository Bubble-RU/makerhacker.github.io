<p>Introduction: Many learning algorithms used in practice are fairly simple. Viewed
representationally, many prediction algorithms either compute a linear
separator of basic features (perceptron, winnow, weighted majority, SVM) or
perhaps a linear separator of slightly more complex features (2-layer neural
networks or kernelized SVMs). Should we go beyond this, and start using "deep"
representations?What is deep learning?Intuitively, deep learning is about
learning to predict in ways which can involve complex dependencies between the
input (observed) features.Specifying this more rigorously turns out to be
rather difficult. Consider the following cases:SVM with Gaussian Kernel. This
is not considered deep learning, because an SVM with a gaussian kernel can't
succinctly represent certain decision surfaces. One ofYann LeCun's examples is
recognizing objects based on pixel values. An SVM will need a new support
vector for each significantly different background. Since the number of
distinct backgrounds i</p><p>3 0.12957552 <a title="224-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-23-Boosted_Decision_Trees_for_Deep_Learning.html">407 hunch net-2010-08-23-Boosted Decision Trees for Deep Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 4 years ago, I speculated thatdecision trees qualify as a deep learning
algorithmbecause they can make decisions which are substantially nonlinear in
the input representation.Ping Lihasproved this correct, empiricallyatUAIby
showing that boosted decision trees can beat deep belief networks on versions
ofMnistwhich are artificially hardened so as to make them solvable only by
deep learning algorithms.This is an important point, because the ability to
solve these sorts of problems is probably the best objective definition of a
deep learning algorithm we have. I'm not that surprised. In my experience, if
you can accept the computational drawbacks of a boosted decision tree, they
can achieve pretty good performance.Geoff Hintononce told me that the great
thing about deep belief networks is that they work. I understand that Ping had
very substantial difficulty in getting this published, so I hope some
reviewers step up to the standard of valuing what works.</p><p>4 0.12016903 <a title="224-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-27-Automated_Labeling.html">143 hunch net-2005-12-27-Automated Labeling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the common trends in machine learning has been an emphasis on the use
of unlabeled data. The argument goes something like "there aren't many labeled
web pages out there, but there are ahugenumber of web pages, so we must find a
way to take advantage of them." There are several standard approaches for
doing this:Unsupervised Learning. You use only unlabeled data. In a typical
application, you cluster the data and hope that the clusters somehow
correspond to what you care about.Semisupervised Learning. You use both
unlabeled and labeled data to build a predictor. The unlabeled data influences
the learned predictor in some way.Active Learning. You have unlabeled data and
access to a labeling oracle. You interactively choose which examples to label
so as to optimize prediction accuracy.It seems there is a fourth approach
worth serious investigation--automated labeling. The approach goes as
follows:Identify some subset of observed values to predict from the
others.Build a predictor.U</p><p>5 0.11550599 <a title="224-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-11-Interesting_Neural_Network_Papers_at_ICML_2011.html">438 hunch net-2011-07-11-Interesting Neural Network Papers at ICML 2011</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Maybe it's too early to call, but with four separate Neural Network sessions
at this year'sICML, it looks like Neural Networks are making a comeback. Here
are my highlights of these sessions. In general, my feeling is that these
papers both demystify deep learning and show its broader applicability.The
first observation I made is that the once disreputable "Neural" nomenclature
is being used againin lieu of"deep learning". Maybe it's because Adam Coates
et al. showed that single layer networks can work surprisingly well.An

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, a scheduling failure meant I missed all ofAIStatand most of
thelearning workshop, otherwise known as Snowbird, when it's atSnowbird.At
snowbird, the talk onSum-Productnetworks byHoifung Poonstood out to me (Pedro
Domingosis a coauthor.). The basic point was that by appropriately
constructing networks based on sums and products, the normalization problem in
probabilistic models is eliminated, yielding a highly tractable yet flexible
representation+learning algorithm. As an algorithm, this is noticeably cleaner
than deep belief networks with a claim to being an order of magnitude faster
and working better on an image completion task.Snowbird doesn't have real
papers--just the abstract above. I look forward to seeing the paper. (added:
Rodrigo points out the deep learning workshopdraft.)</p><p>6 0.57839644 <a title="224-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-01-10-A_Deep_Belief_Net_Learning_Problem.html">227 hunch net-2007-01-10-A Deep Belief Net Learning Problem</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm offering a reward of $1000 for a solution to this problem. This joins
thecross validation problemwhich I'm offering a$500 rewardfor. I believe both
of these problems are hard but plausibly solvable, and plausibly with a
solution of substantial practical value. While it's unlikely these rewards are
worth your time on an hourly wage basis, the recognition for solving them
definitely should beThe ProblemThe problem is finding a general, robust, and
efficient mechanism for estimating a conditional probabilityP(y|x)where
robustness and efficiency are measured using techniques from learning
reductions.In particular, suppose we have access to a binary regression
oracleBwhich has two interfaces--one for specifying training information and
one for testing. Training information is specified asB(x',y')wherex'is a
feature vector andy'is a scalar in[0,1]with no value returned. Testing is done
according toB(x')with a value in[0,1]returned.A learning reduction consists of

<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, Drew Bagnell and I started theRLBench projectto setup a
suite of reinforcement learning benchmark problems. We haven't been able to
touch it (due to lack of time) for a year so the project is on hold. Luckily,
there are several other projects such asCLSquareandRL-Gluewith a similar goal,
and we strongly endorse their continued development.I would like to explain
why, especially in the context of criticism of other learning benchmarks. For
example, sometimes theUCI Machine Learning Repositoryis criticized. There are
two criticisms I know of:Learning algorithms have overfit to the problems in
the repository. It is easy to imagine a mechanism for this happening
unintentionally. Strong evidence of this would be provided by learning
algorithms which perform great on the UCI machine learning repository but very
badly (relative to other learning algorithms) on non-UCI learning problems. I
have seen little evidence of this but it remains a point of concern. There is

<p>Introduction: This is apaperby Yann LeCun and Fu Jie Huang published atAISTAT 2005. I found
this paper very difficult to read, but it does have some point about a
computational shortcut.This paper takes for granted that the method of solving
a problem is gradient descent on parameters. Given this assumption, the
question arises: Do you want to do gradient descent on a probabilistic model
or something else?All (conditional) probabilistic models have the formp(y|x) =
f(x,y)/Z(x)whereZ(x) = sumyf(x,y)(the paper calls- log f(x,y)an "energy").
Iffis parameterized by somew, the gradient has a term forZ(x), and hence for
every value ofy. The paper claims, that such models can be optimized for
classification purposes using only the correctyand the othery' not ywhich
maximizesf(x,y). This can even be done on unnormalizable models. The paper
further claims that this can be done with an approximate maximum. These claims
are plausible based on experimental results and intuition.It wouldn't surprise

<p>Introduction: This is an attempt to organize the broad research programs related to machine
learning currently underway. This isn't easy--this map is partial, the
categories often overlap, and there are many details left out. Nevertheless,
it is (perhaps) helpful to have some map of what is happening where. The word
'typical' should not be construed narrowly here.Learning TheoryFocuses on
analyzing mathematical models of learning, essentially no experiments. Typical
conference: COLT.Bayesian LearningBayes law is always used. Focus on methods
of speeding up or approximating integration, new probabilistic models, and
practical applications. Typical conferences: NIPS,UAIStructured
learningPredicting complex structured outputs, some applications. Typiical
conferences: NIPS, UAI, othersReinforcement LearningFocused on 'agent-in-the-
world' learning problems where the goal is optimizing reward. Typical

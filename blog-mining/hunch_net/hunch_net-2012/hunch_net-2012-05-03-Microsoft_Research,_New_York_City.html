</p><p>4 It turns out that talking to the rest of the organization doing consulting, architecting, and prototyping on a minority basis helps research by sharpening the questions you ask more than it hinders by taking up time. [sent-22, score-0.429]
</p><p>5 Consequently, the abrupt departure of Prabhakar and an apparent lack of appreciation by the new CEO created a crisis of confidence. [sent-29, score-0.26]
</p><p>6 Many people who were sitting on strong offers quickly left, and everyone else started looking around. [sent-30, score-0.326]
</p><p>7 In this situation, my first concern was for colleagues, both in Machine Learning across the company and the Yahoo! [sent-31, score-0.212]

</p><p>9 More generally, the demand for high quality seasoned machine learning researchers across startups, mature companies, government labs, and academia has been astonishing, and I expect the outcome to reflect that. [sent-35, score-0.443]
</p><p>10 This is remarkably different from the cuts that hit ATnT research in late 2001 and early 2002 where the famous machine learning group there took many months to disperse to new positions. [sent-36, score-0.443]
</p><p>11 In the New York office, we investigated many possibilities hard enough that it became a  news story . [sent-37, score-0.254]
</p><p>12 While that article is wrong in specifics (we ended up not fired for example, although it is difficult to discern cause and effect), we certainly shook the job tree very hard to see what would fall out. [sent-38, score-0.248]
</p><p>13 My belief is that the new  Microsoft Research New York City  lab will become an even greater techhouse than Y! [sent-41, score-0.265]
</p><p>14 In light of this, I would encourage people in academia to consider Yahoo! [sent-45, score-0.294]
</p><p>15 There are and will be some serious hard feelings about the outcome as various top researchers elsewhere in the organization feel compelled to look for jobs and leave. [sent-47, score-0.345]

<p>Introduction: I will join  Yahoo Research  (in New York) after my contract ends at  TTI-Chicago .
 
The deciding reasons are:
  
 Yahoo is running into many hard learning problems.  This is precisely the situation where basic research might hope to have the greatest impact. 
 Yahoo Research understands research including publishing, conferences, etc… 
 Yahoo Research is growing, so there is a chance I can help it grow well. 
 Yahoo understands the internet, including (but not at all limited to) experimenting with research blogs. 
  
In the end, Yahoo Research seems like the place where I might have a chance to make the greatest difference.  
 
Yahoo (as a company) has made a strong bet on Yahoo Research.  We-the-researchers all hope that bet will pay off, and this seems plausible.

<p>Introduction: I attended the  IBM research 60th anniversary .  IBM research is, by any reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the most value to it’s parent company over the long term.  This can be seen by simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab which has not gone through a period of massive firing.  (Note that there are also  new research labs .)
 
Despite this impressive record, IBM research has failed, by far, to achieve it’s potential.  Examples which came up in this meeting include:
  
 It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented in the lab.  (In fact, Intel produced it first.) 
 Relational databases and SQL were invented and then languished.  It was only under external competition that IBM released it’s own relational database.  Why didn’t IBM grow an  Oracle division ? 
 An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing a  Cisco division .  Why not?

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research?  Here are some essential ingredients that I see.  
  
  Stability .  University-based research is relatively good at this.  On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will work on.  A very common tradeoff is between:
 
 easy small 
 difficult big 
 

For researchers without stability, the ‘easy small’ option wins.  This is often “ok”—a series of incremental improvements on the state of the art can add up to something very beneficial.  However, it misses one of the big potentials of research: finding entirely new and better ways of doing things.


Stability comes in many forms.  The prototypical example is tenure at a university—a tenured professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the freedom to consider far horizon activities.  An iron-clad guarantee of a paycheck is not necessary—industrial research labs have succeeded well with research positions of indefinite duration.

<p>Introduction: I just visited  Yahoo Research  which has several fundamental learning problems near to (or beyond) the set of problems we know how to solve well.  Here are 3 of them.
  
  Ranking   This is the canonical problem of all search engines.  It is made extra difficult for several reasons.
 
 There is relatively little “good” supervised learning data and a great deal of data with some signal (such as click through rates). 
 The learning must occur in a partially adversarial environment. Many people very actively attempt to place themselves at the top of 
rankings. 
 It is not even quite clear whether the problem should be posed as ‘ranking’ or as ‘regression’ which is then used to produce a 
ranking. 
 
 
  Collaborative filtering  Yahoo has a large number of recommendation systems for music, movies, etc…  In these sorts of systems, users specify how they liked a set of things, and then the system can (hopefully) find some more examples of things they might like

<p>Introduction: According to the  New York Times ,  Yahoo is releasing Project Panama shortly .  Project Panama is about better predicting which advertisements are relevant to a search, implying a higher click through rate, implying larger income for  Yahoo .  There are two things that seem interesting here:
  
 A significant portion of that improved accuracy is almost certainly machine learning at work. 
 The quantitative effect is huge—the estimate in the article is $600*10 6 . 
  
 Google  already has such improvements and  Microsoft Search  is surely working on them, which suggest this is (perhaps) a $10 9  per year machine learning problem. 
 
The exact methodology under use is unlikely to be publicly discussed in the near future because of the competitive enivironment.  Hopefully we’ll have some public “war stories” at some point in the future when this information becomes less sensitive.  For now, it’s reassuring to simply note that machine learning is having a big impact.</p><p>6 0.68511635 <a title="464-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The internet has recently made the research process much smoother: papers are easy to obtain, citations are easy to follow, and unpublished “tutorials” are often available. Yet, new research fields can look very complicated to outsiders or newcomers. Every paper is like a small piece of an unfinished jigsaw puzzle: to understand just one publication, a researcher without experience in the field will typically have to follow several layers of citations, and many of the papers he encounters have a great deal of repeated information. Furthermore, from one publication to the next, notation and terminology may not be consistent which can further confuse the reader.
 
But the internet is now proving to be an extremely useful medium for collaboration and knowledge aggregation. Online forums allow users to ask and answer questions and to share ideas. The recent phenomenon of Wikipedia provides a proof-of-concept for the “anyone can edit” system. Can such models be used to facilitate research a</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91859102 <a title="464-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-03-Microsoft_Research%2C_New_York_City.html">464 hunch net-2012-05-03-Microsoft Research, New York City</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo! laid off people .  Unlike every previous time there have been layoffs, this is serious for  Yahoo! Research .  
 
We had advanced warning from  Prabhakar  through the  simple act of leaving .  Yahoo! Research was a world class organization that Prabhakar recruited much of personally, so it is deeply implausible that he would spontaneously decide to leave.  My first thought when I saw the news was “Uhoh,  Rob  said that he knew it was serious when the head of ATnT Research left.”  In this case it was even more significant, because Prabhakar recruited me on the premise that Y!R was an experiment in how research should be done: via a combination of high quality people and high engagement with the company.  Prabhakar’s departure is a clear end to that experiment.
 
The result is ambiguous from a business perspective.  Y!R clearly was not capable of saving the company from its illnesses.  I’m not privy to the internal accounting of impact and this is the kind of subject where there c</p><p>3 0.88427997 <a title="464-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-31-Watchword%3A_Assumption.html">7 hunch net-2005-01-31-Watchword: Assumption</a></p>
<p>Introduction: “Assumption” is another word to be careful with in machine learning because it is used in several ways.
  
  Assumption = Bias  There are several ways to see that some form of ‘bias’ (= preferring of one solution over another) is necessary.   This is obvious in an adversarial setting.  A good bit of work has been expended explaining this in other settings with “ no free lunch ” theorems.  This is a usage specialized to learning which is particularly common when talking about priors for Bayesian Learning. 
  Assumption = “if” of a theorem  The assumptions are the ‘if’ part of the ‘if-then’ in a theorem.  This is a fairly common usage. 
  Assumption = Axiom  The assumptions are the things that we assume are true, but which we cannot verify.  Examples are “the IID assumption” or “my problem is a DNF on a small number of bits”.  This is the usage which I prefer. 
  
One difficulty with any use of the word “assumption” is that you often encounter “if  assumption  then  conclusion  so if  no</p><p>4 0.81896871 <a title="464-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research.  They provide many roles including “announcing research”, “meeting people”, and  “point of reference”.  Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: “to what extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?”  This question is very difficult to answer in any satisfying way.  What we can do is compare details of the process across multiple conferences.
  
  Comments   The average quality of comments across conferences can vary dramatically.  At one extreme, the tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback.  At the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing detailed constructive feedback.  Detailed feedback can give authors significant guidance about how to improve research.  This is the most subjective entry. 
  Blind  Virtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors do not know reviewers.  Some also provide  double blind  review where rev</p><p>5 0.81814742 <a title="464-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-23-%28Dis%29similarities_between_academia_and_open_source_programmers.html">105 hunch net-2005-08-23-(Dis)similarities between academia and open source programmers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Martin Pool  and I recently discussed the similarities and differences between academia and open source programming.   
 
Similarities:
  
  Cost profile   Research and programming share approximately the same cost profile: A large upfront effort is required to produce something useful, and then “anyone” can use it.  (The “anyone” is not quite right for either group because only sufficiently technical people could use it.) 
  Wealth profile  A “wealthy” academic or open source programmer is someone who has contributed a lot to other people in research or programs.  Much of academia is a “gift culture”: whoever gives the most is most respected. 
  Problems   Both academia and open source programming suffer from similar problems.
 
 Whether or not (and which) open source program is used are perhaps too-often personality driven rather than driven by capability or usefulness.  Similar phenomena can happen in academia with respect to directions of research.

<p>Introduction: How do you create an optimal environment for research? Here are some essential

at this. On any particular day, researchers face choices in what they will
work on. A very common tradeoff is between:easy smalldifficult bigFor
researchers without stability, the 'easy small' option wins. This is often

in many forms. The prototypical example is tenure at a university--a tenured
professor is almost imposssible to fire which means that the professor has the

<p>Introduction: I attended theIBM research 60th anniversary. IBM research is, by any
reasonable account, the industrial research lab which has managed to bring the
most value to it's parent company over the long term. This can be seen by
simply counting the survivors: IBM research is the only older research lab
which has not gone through a period of massive firing. (Note that there are
alsonew research labs.)Despite this impressive record, IBM research has
failed, by far, to achieve it's potential. Examples which came up in this
meeting include:It took about a decade to produce DRAM after it was invented
in the lab. (In fact, Intel produced it first.)Relational databases and SQL
were invented and then languished. It was only under external competition that
IBM released it's own relational database. Why didn't IBM grow anOracle
division?An early lead in IP networking hardware did not result in IBM growing
aCisco division. Why not?And remember Ã¢&euro;Åš IBM research is a stark success story

<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT
ResearchandLucenthad one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the
remainder ofBell Labs, triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine
learning group there. As the recession progresses, we may easily see more
firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer
support research.There are a couple positives to the recession as well.Both
the implosion of Wall Street (which siphoned off smart people) and the general
difficulty of getting a job coming out of an undergraduate education suggest
that the quality of admitted phd</p><p>6 0.15951295 <a title="464-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-11-Yahoo%26%238217%3Bs_Learning_Problems..html">156 hunch net-2006-02-11-Yahoo&#8217;s Learning Problems.</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The funding of research (and machine learning research) is an issue which
seems to have become more significant in the United States over the last
decade. The word "research" is applied broadly here to science, mathematics,
and engineering.There are two essential difficulties with funding
research:LongshotPaying a researcher is often a big gamble. Most research
projects don't pan out, but a few big payoffs can make it all
worthwhile.Information OnlyMuch of research is about finding the right way to
think about or do something.The Longshot difficulty means that there is high
variance in payoffs. This can be compensated for by funding many different
research projects, reducing variance.The Information-Only difficulty means
that it's hard to extract a profit directly from many types of research, so
companies have difficulty justifying basic research. (Patents are a mechanism
for doing this. They are often extraordinarily clumsy or simply not
applicable.)These two difficulties together imp</p><p>6 0.67428094 <a title="464-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I've releasedversion 5.0of theVowpal Wabbitonline learning software. The major
number has changed since thelast releasebecause I regard all earlier versions
as obsolete--there are several new algorithms & features including substantial
changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.The biggest changes are
new algorithms:Nikosand I improved the default algorithm. The basic update
rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully
controlled so that it's impossible to overrun the label. In addition, the
normalization has changed. Computationally, these changes are virtually free
and yield better results, sometimes much better. Less careful updates can be
reenabled with -loss_function classic, although results are still not
identical to previous due to normalization changes.Nikos also implemented the
per-feature learning rates as per thesetwopapers. Often, this works better
than the default algorithm. It isn't the default because it isn't (yet) as
adaptable</p><p>2 0.96572208 <a title="464-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Maximum_Margin_Mismatch%3F.html">77 hunch net-2005-05-29-Maximum Margin Mismatch?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John makes a fascinating point about structured classification (and slightly
scooped my post!). Maximum Margin Markov Networks (M3N) are an interesting
example of the second class of structured classifiers (where the
classification of one label depends on the others), and one of my favorite
papers. I'm not alone: the paper won the best student paper award at NIPS in
2003.There are some things I find odd about the paper. For instance, it says
of probabilistic models"cannot handle high dimensional feature spaces and lack
strong theoretical guarrantees."I'm aware of no such limitations.
Also:"Unfortunately, even probabilistic graphical models that are trained
discriminatively do not achieve the same level of performance as SVMs,
especially when kernel features are used."This is quite interesting and
contradicts my own experience as well as that of a number of
peopleIgreatlyrespect. I wonder what the root cause is: perhaps there is
something different about the data Ben+Carlos were working</p><p>3 0.96494895 <a title="464-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-16-The_value_of_the_orthodox_view_of_Boosting.html">179 hunch net-2006-05-16-The value of the orthodox view of Boosting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The term "boosting" comes from the idea of using a meta-algorithm which takes
"weak" learners (that may be able to only barely predict slightly better than
random) and turn them into strongly capable learners (which predict very
well).Adaboostin 1995 was the first widely used (and useful) boosting
algorithm, although there were theoretical boosting algorithms floating around
since 1990 (see the bottom ofthis page).Since then, many different
interpretations of why boosting works have arisen. There is significant
discussion about these different views in theannals of statistics, including
aresponsebyYoav FreundandRobert Schapire.I believe there is a great deal of
value to be found in the original view of boosting (meta-algorithm for
creating a strong learner from a weak learner). This is not a claim that one
particular viewpoint obviates the value of all others, but rather that no
other viewpoint seems to really capture important properties.Comparing with
all other views of boosting is t</p><p>4 0.9564029 <a title="464-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-13-Wikis_for_Summer_Schools_and_Workshops.html">81 hunch net-2005-06-13-Wikis for Summer Schools and Workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Chicago '05ended a couple of weeks ago. This was the sixthMachine Learning
Summer School, and the second one that used awiki. (The first was Berder '04,
thanks to Gunnar Raetsch.) Wikis are relatively easy to set up, greatly aid
social interaction, and should be used a lot more at summer schools and
workshops. They can even be used as the meeting's webpage, as a permanent
record of its participants' collaborations -- see for example the wiki/website
for last year'sNVO Summer School.A basic wiki is a collection of editable
webpages, maintained by software called awiki engine. The engine used at both
Berder and Chicago wasTikiWiki-- it is well documented and gets you something
running fast. It uses PHP and MySQL, but doesn't require you to know either.
Tikiwiki has far more features than most wikis, as it is really a fullContent
Management System. (My thanks to Sebastian Stark for pointing this out.) Here
are the features we found most useful:Bulletin boards, or forums. The most-

<p>Introduction: AtICML 2003,Marty Zinkevichproposedthe online convex optimization setting and
showed that a particular gradient descent algorithm has regret O(T0.5) with
respect to the best predictor where T is the number of rounds. This seems to
be a nice model for online learning, and there has been some significant
follow-up work.AtCOLT 2006Elad Hazan,Adam Kalai,Satyen Kale, andAmit
Agarwalpresenteda modification which takes a Newton stepguaranteeing O(log T)
regret when the first and second derivatives are bounded.Then they applied
these algorithms to portfolio managementatICML 2006(withRobert Schapire)
yielding some very fun graphs.</p><p>6 0.94683069 <a title="464-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-21-What_is_the_right_form_of_modularity_in_structured_prediction%3F.html">74 hunch net-2005-05-21-What is the right form of modularity in structured prediction?</a></p>

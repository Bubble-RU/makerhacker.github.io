Machine Learning conferences are triannual now, between  NIPS ,  AIStat , and  ICML .  This has not always been the case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April conference.  
 
However, the first claim is not quite correct.  NIPS and AIStat have few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other conf</p><p>3 0.25275147 <a title="454-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-16-Representative_Reviewing.html">484 hunch net-2013-06-16-Representative Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some conception of what good reviewing is.  As far as I can tell, this is almost always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a “good paper” looks like for that area) rather than general principles.  Neither individual papers or areas are sufficiently general for a large conference—every paper differs in the details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?
 
An unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too large.  In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper which someone thinks might be of interest.  This reason for reviewing exists independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual conferences.  Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively meaningless over the long term — growing conferences simply use more rooms and/or change fo</p><p>4 0.24667071 <a title="454-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: By  Shie  and  Nati 
 
Following John’s advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is often the best place for theory papers.  We would like to emphasize that we both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs, and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers.  For many papers, ICML is the best venue.  But for many theory papers, COLT is a better and more appropriate place.
 
Why should you submit to COLT?
 
By-and-large, theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT is more focused then ICML with a single track session.  Unlike ICML, the norm in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks presented.  There is also often a lively discussion followi</p><p>6 0.2366171 <a title="454-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-23-Use_of_Learning_Theory.html">332 hunch net-2008-12-23-Use of Learning Theory</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Michael Littman  and  Leon Bottou  have decided to use a franchise program chair approach to  reviewing at ICML  this year.  I’ll be one of the area chairs, so I wanted to mention a few things if you are thinking about naming me.
  
 I take reviewing seriously.  That means papers to be reviewed are read, the implications are considered, and decisions are only made after that.  I do my best to be fair, and there are zero subjects that I consider categorical rejects.  I don’t consider several  arguments for rejection-not-on-the-merits reasonable . 
 I am generally interested in papers that (a) analyze new models of machine learning, (b) provide new algorithms, and (c) show that they work empirically on plausibly real problems.  If a paper has the trifecta, I’m particularly interested. With 2 out of 3, I might be interested.  I often find papers with only one element harder to accept, including papers with just (a).  
 I’m a bit tough.  I rarely jump-up-and-down about a paper, because I b</p><p>4 0.76671219 <a title="454-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-18-Decision_by_Vetocracy.html">343 hunch net-2009-02-18-Decision by Vetocracy</a></p>

 Strictly greater: Cost sensitive multiclass problems where only the loss of one choice can be probed.

<p>Introduction: Claire  asked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite a bit of work.
 
I had a relatively light load—merely 49 theory papers.  Many of these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help review the papers.  I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally.  There were a couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.
 
There are some differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and theory communities.  In machine learning it is expected that a review be detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case.  Every paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very detailed.  
 
I’m sure not every author was happy with the outcome.  While we did our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make.

<p>Introduction: This is a difficult subject to talk about for many reasons, but a discussion may be helpful.
 
Bad reviewing is a problem in academia.  The first step in understanding this is admitting to the problem, so here is a short list of examples of bad reviewing. 
  
 Reviewer disbelieves theorem proof (ICML),  or disbelieve theorem with a trivially false counterexample. (COLT)  
 Reviewer internally swaps quantifiers in a theorem, concludes it has been done before and is trivial. (NIPS) 
 Reviewer believes a technique will not work despite experimental validation. (COLT) 
 Reviewers fail to notice flaw in theorem statement (CRYPTO).   
 Reviewer erroneously claims that it has been done before (NIPS, SODA, JMLR)—(complete with references!) 
 Reviewer inverts the message of a paper and concludes it says nothing important. (NIPS*2) 
 Reviewer fails to distinguish between a DAG and a tree (SODA). 
 Reviewer is enthusiastic about paper but clearly does not understand (ICML).

<p>Introduction: Steve Smale  and I have a debate about goals of learning theory.
 
Steve likes theorems with a dependence on unobservable quantities.  For example, if  D  is a distribution over a space  X x [0,1] , you can state a theorem about the error rate dependent on the variance,  E (x,y)~D  (y-E y’~D|x [y']) 2  .
 
I dislike this, because I want to use the theorems to produce code solving learning problems.  Since I don’t know (and can’t measure) the variance, a theorem depending on the variance does not help me—I would not know what variance to plug into the learning algorithm.
 
Recast more broadly, this is a debate between “declarative” and “operative” mathematics.  A strong example of “declarative” mathematics is  “a new kind of science” .  Roughly speaking, the goal of this kind of approach seems to be finding a way to explain the observations we make.  Examples include “some things are unpredictable”, “a phase transition exists”, etc…
 
“Operative” mathematics helps you make predictions a</p><p>3 0.93465209 <a title="454-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-21-Videolectures.net.html">240 hunch net-2007-04-21-Videolectures.net</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Davor  has been working to setup  videolectures.net  which is the new site for the many lectures  mentioned here .  (Tragically, they seem to only be available in windows media format.) I went through  my own projects  and added a few links to the videos.  The day when every result is a set of {paper, slides, video} isn’t quite here yet, but it’s within sight.  (For many papers, of course, code is a 4th component.)</p><p>same-blog 4 0.92830414 <a title="454-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-30-ICML_Posters_and_Scope.html">454 hunch net-2012-01-30-ICML Posters and Scope</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally, I don’t indulge in posters for  ICML , but this year is naturally an exception for me.   If you want one, there are a small number  left here , if you sign up before February.
 
It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting papers.  At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers.  Program chairs setup the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the reviewing process.  Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the community determine the conference.  Nevertheless, as a program chair this year it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to encourage (and occasionally discourage).
 
At the highest level, I believe ICML exists to further research into machine learning, which I gene</p><p>5 0.89175433 <a title="454-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-26-Two_more_UAI_papers_of_interest.html">199 hunch net-2006-07-26-Two more UAI papers of interest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In addition to Ed Snelson’s paper, there were (at least) two other papers that caught my eye at UAI.
 
One was  this paper  by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Daniel Hsu and Nakul Verma at UCSD which shows in a surprisingly general and strong way that almost all linear projections of any jointly distributed vector random variable with finite first and second moments look sphereical and unimodal (in fact look like a scale mixture of Gaussians). Great result, as you’d expect from Sanjoy.
 
The other paper which I found intriguing but which I just haven’t groked yet is  this beast  by Manfred and Dima Kuzmin. 
You can check out the (beautiful)  slides  
if that helps. I feel like there is something deep here, but my brain is too small to understand it. The COLT and last NIPS papers/slides are also on Manfred’s page. Hopefully someone here can illuminate.</p><p>6 0.88990319 <a title="454-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-05-Server_Shift%2C_Site_Tweaks%2C_Suggestions%3F.html">182 hunch net-2006-06-05-Server Shift, Site Tweaks, Suggestions?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: If you are in the New York area and interested in machine learning, consider submitting a 2 page abstract to the  ML symposium  by tomorrow (Sept 5th) midnight.  Itâ&euro;&trade;s a fun one day affair on October 10 in an awesome location overlooking the world trade center site.

<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is another  machine learning meetup  where I’ll be speaking.  Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as “the future of machine learning”.  In particular, it’s all about how to learn in an interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation, etc…
 
On Sept 24, abstracts for the  New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it’s a great way to have a conversation with other people.
 
On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually happens.  This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more time for posters.  In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:  David Blei ,  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Tommi Jaakkola , and  Yann LeCun .  After the meeting, a late  hackNY  related event is planned where students and startups can meet.
 
I’d also like to point out the related  CS/Econ symposium  as I have interests there as well.</p><p>5 0.13627987 <a title="460-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2014/hunch_net-2014-03-11-The_New_York_ML_Symposium%2C_take_2.html">494 hunch net-2014-03-11-The New York ML Symposium, take 2</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A reminder that the  New York Academy of Sciences  will be hosting the  7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium  tomorrow from 9:30am.
 
The main program will feature invited talks from  Peter Bartlett ,  William Freeman , and  Vladimir Vapnik , along with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main program,  hackNY  and  Microsoft Research  are sponsoring a networking hour with talks from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups (specifically  bit.ly ,  Buzzfeed ,  Chartbeat , and  Sense Networks ,  Visual Revenue ).  This should be of great interest to everyone considering working in machine learning.</p><p>4 0.76844019 <a title="460-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2014/hunch_net-2014-03-11-The_New_York_ML_Symposium%2C_take_2.html">494 hunch net-2014-03-11-The New York ML Symposium, take 2</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When presenting part of the  Reinforcement Learning theory tutorial  at  ICML 2006 , I was forcibly reminded of this.
 
There are several difficulties.
  
  When creating the presentation, the correct level of detail is tricky.  With too much detail, the proof takes too much time and people may be lost to boredom.  With too little detail, the steps of the proof involve too-great a jump. This is very difficult to judge.
 
 What may be an easy step in the careful thought of a quiet room is not so easy when you are occupied by the process of presentation. 
 What may be easy after having gone over this (and other) proofs is not so easy to follow in the first pass by a viewer. 
 

  These problems seem only correctable by process of repeated test-and-revise.
 
 When presenting the proof, simply speaking with sufficient precision is substantially harder than in normal conversation (where precision is not so critical).  Practice can help here. 
 When presenting the proof, going at the right p</p><p>2 0.81289536 <a title="460-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-23-Machine_Learning_Jobs_are_Growing_on_Trees.html">250 hunch net-2007-06-23-Machine Learning Jobs are Growing on Trees</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The consensus of several discussions at ICML is that the number of jobs for people knowing machine learning well substantially exceeds supply.  This is my experience as well.  Demand comes from many places, but I’ve seen particularly strong demand from trading companies and internet startups.
 
Like all interest bursts, this one will probably pass because of economic recession or other distractions.  Nevertheless, the general outlook for machine learning in business seems to be good.  Machine learning is all about optimization when there is uncertainty and lots of data.  The quantity of data available is growing quickly as computer-run processes and sensors become more common, and the quality of the data is dropping since there is little editorial control in it’s collection.  Machine Learning is a difficult subject to master (*), so those who do should remain in demand over the long term.

<p>Introduction: has  died .   He lived a full life.  I know him personally as a founder of the  Center for Computational Learning Systems  and the  New York Machine Learning Symposium , both of which have sheltered and promoted the advancement of machine learning.  I expect much of the New York area machine learning community will miss him, as well as many others around the world.</p><p>4 0.76255369 <a title="460-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-04-More_Presentation_Preparation.html">307 hunch net-2008-07-04-More Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We’ve discussed  presentation preparation before , but I have one more thing to add:  transitioning .  For a research presentation, it is substantially helpful for the audience if transitions are clear.  A common outline for a research presentation in machine leanring is:
  
  The problem .  Presentations which don’t describe the problem almost immediately lose people, because the context is missing to understand the detail. 
  Prior relevant work .  In many cases, a paper builds on some previous bit of work which must be understood in order to understand what the paper does.  A common failure mode seems to be spending too much time on prior work.  Discuss just the relevant aspects of prior work in the language of your work.  Sometimes this is missing when unneeded. 
  What we did . For theory papers in particular, it is often not possible to really cover the details.  Prioritizing what you present can be very important. 
  How it worked .  Many papers in Machine Learning have some sor</p><p>5 0.69680834 <a title="460-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-24-2009_ICML_discussion_site.html">356 hunch net-2009-05-24-2009 ICML discussion site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Reid  has setup a  discussion site for ICML papers  again this year and  Monica Dinculescu  has linked it in from the ICML site.  Last year’s attempt appears to have been an acceptable but not wild success as a little bit of fruitful discussion occurred.  I’m hoping this year will be a bit more of a success—please don’t be shy   
 
I’d like to also point out that  ICML ‘s early  registration  deadline has a few hours left, while  UAI ‘s and  COLT ‘s are in a week.</p><p>6 0.64474225 <a title="460-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-10-Precision_is_not_accuracy.html">202 hunch net-2006-08-10-Precision is not accuracy</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Perhaps the biggest CS prize for research is theTuring Award, which has a
$0.25M cash prize associated with it. It appears none of the prizes so far
have been for anything like machine learning (the closest are perhaps database
awards).In CS theory, there is theGÃƒÂ¶del Prizewhich is smaller and newer,
offering a $5K prize along and perhaps (more importantly) recognition. One
such award has been given for Machine Learning, toRobert SchapireandYoav
Freundfor Adaboost.In Machine Learning, there seems to be no equivalent of
these sorts of prizes. There are several plausible reasons for this:There is
no coherent community.People drift in and out of the central conferences all
the time. Most of the author names from 10 years ago do not occur in the
conferences of today. In addition, the entire subject area is fairly new.There
are at least a core group of people who have stayed around.Machine Learning

<p>Introduction: It's reviewing season right now, so I thought I would list (at a high level)
the sorts of problems which I see in papers. Hopefully, this will help us all
write better papers.The following flaws are fatal to any paper:Incorrect
theorem or lemma statementsA typo might be "ok", if it can be understood. Any
theorem or lemma which indicates an incorrect understanding of reality must be
rejected. Not doing so would severely harm the integrity of the conference. A
paper rejected for this reason must be fixed.Lack of UnderstandingIf a paper
is understood by none of the (typically 3) reviewers then it must be rejected
for the same reason. This is more controversial than it sounds because there
are some people who maximize paper complexity in the hope of impressing the
reviewer. The tactic sometimes succeeds with some reviewers (but not with
me).As a reviewer, I sometimes get lost for stupid reasons. This is why an
anonymizedcommunication channelwith the author can be very helpful.Bad

<p>Introduction: ByShieandNatiFollowing John's advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought
it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is
often the best place for theory papers. We would like to emphasize that we
both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs,
and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers. For
many papers, ICML is the best venue. But for many theory papers, COLT is a
better and more appropriate place.Why should you submit to COLT?By-and-large,
theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory
papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking
theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT
is more focused then ICML with a single track session. Unlike ICML, the norm
in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks
presented. There is also often a lively discussion following paper

<p>Introduction: Normally, I don't indulge in posters forICML, but this year is naturally an
exception for me. If you want one, there are a small numberleft here, if you
sign up before February.It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the
scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting
papers. At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which
informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers. Program chairs setup
the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the
reviewing process. Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because
a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the
community determine the conference. Nevertheless, as a program chair this year
it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to
encourage (and occasionally discourage).At the highest level, I believe ICML
exists to further research into machine learning, which I generally think of
as</p><p>4 0.27106988 <a title="452-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-02-Reviewing_techniques_for_conferences.html">65 hunch net-2005-05-02-Reviewing techniques for conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The many reviews following the many paper deadlines are just about over. AAAI
and ICML in particular were experimenting with several reviewing
techniques.Double Blind: AAAI and ICML were both double blind this year. It
seemed (overall) beneficial, but two problems arose.For theoretical papers,
with a lot to say, authors often leave out the proofs. This is very hard to
cope with under a double blind review because (1) you can not trust the
authors got the proof right but (2) a blanket "reject" hits many probably-good
papers. Perhaps authors should more strongly favor proof-complete papers sent
to double blind conferences.On the author side, double blind reviewing is
actually somewhat disruptive to research. In particular, it discourages the
author from talking about the subject, which is one of the mechanisms of
research. This is not a great drawback, but it is one not previously
appreciated.Author feedback: AAAI and ICML did author feedback this year. It
seemed helpful for several pape</p><p>5 0.25974274 <a title="452-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some

which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>6 0.24086472 <a title="452-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-04-26-Compassionate_Reviewing.html">395 hunch net-2010-04-26-Compassionate Reviewing</a></p>

poor decisions happen because the papers go to reviewers who are unqualified,
and the hope is that allowing authors to point out who is qualified results in
better decisions. In my experience, this is a reasonable idea to test.Both UAI
and COLT are experimenting this year as well with double blind and author
feedback, respectively. Of the two, I believe author feedback is more
important, as I've seen it make a difference. However, I still consider double

fairness.</p><p>6 0.69374847 <a title="452-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-29-ICML_survey_and_comments.html">468 hunch net-2012-06-29-ICML survey and comments</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Perhaps the biggest CS prize for research is theTuring Award, which has a
$0.25M cash prize associated with it. It appears none of the prizes so far
have been for anything like machine learning (the closest are perhaps database
awards).In CS theory, there is theGÃƒÂ¶del Prizewhich is smaller and newer,
offering a $5K prize along and perhaps (more importantly) recognition. One
such award has been given for Machine Learning, toRobert SchapireandYoav
Freundfor Adaboost.In Machine Learning, there seems to be no equivalent of
these sorts of prizes. There are several plausible reasons for this:There is
no coherent community.People drift in and out of the central conferences all
the time. Most of the author names from 10 years ago do not occur in the
conferences of today. In addition, the entire subject area is fairly new.There
are at least a core group of people who have stayed around.Machine Learning

dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.Machine Learning conferences
are triannual now, betweenNIPS,AIStat, andICML. This has not always been the
case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started
with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April
conference.However, the first claim is not quite correct. NIPS and AIStat have
few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other
conferences accepting machine learning related papers. SinceJoelleand I are

<p>Introduction: It's reviewing season right now, so I thought I would list (at a high level)
the sorts of problems which I see in papers. Hopefully, this will help us all
write better papers.The following flaws are fatal to any paper:Incorrect
theorem or lemma statementsA typo might be "ok", if it can be understood. Any
theorem or lemma which indicates an incorrect understanding of reality must be
rejected. Not doing so would severely harm the integrity of the conference. A
paper rejected for this reason must be fixed.Lack of UnderstandingIf a paper
is understood by none of the (typically 3) reviewers then it must be rejected
for the same reason. This is more controversial than it sounds because there
are some people who maximize paper complexity in the hope of impressing the
reviewer. The tactic sometimes succeeds with some reviewers (but not with
me).As a reviewer, I sometimes get lost for stupid reasons. This is why an
anonymizedcommunication channelwith the author can be very helpful.Bad

<p>Introduction: Normally I do not blog, but John kindly invited me to do so. Since
computability issues play a major role in Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on that and raise
some questions.The general attitude is that AI is about finding efficient
smart algorithms. For large parts of machine learning, the same attitude is
not too dangerous. If you want to concentrate on conceptual problems, simply
become a statistician. There is no analogous escape for modern research on AI
(as opposed toGOFAIrooted in logic).Let me show by analogy whylimiting
research to computational questions is bad for any field.Except in computer
science, computational aspects play little role in the development
offundamentaltheories: Consider e.g. set theory with axiom of choice,
foundations of logic, exact/full minimax for zero-sum games, quantum (field)
theory, string theory, â&euro;Ś Indeed, at least in physics, every new fundamental
theory seems to be less computable th</p><p>5 0.8506633 <a title="452-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-01-31-Remote_large_scale_learning_class_participation.html">479 hunch net-2013-01-31-Remote large scale learning class participation</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>3 0.23205796 <a title="468-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-18-ICML_%26%23038%3B_COLT_2010.html">403 hunch net-2010-07-18-ICML &#038; COLT 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research. They provide many
roles including "announcing research", "meeting people", and "point of
reference". Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: "to what
extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?" This question is
very difficult to answer in any satisfying way. What we can do is compare
details of the process across multiple conferences.CommentsThe average quality
of comments across conferences can vary dramatically. At one extreme, the
tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback. At
the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing
detailed constructive feedback. Detailed feedback can give authors significant
guidance about how to improve research. This is the most subjective
entry.BlindVirtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors
do not know reviewers. Some also providedouble blindreview where reviewers do
not know authors. T</p><p>5 0.20489851 <a title="468-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-09-ICML_author_feedback_is_open.html">461 hunch net-2012-04-09-ICML author feedback is open</a></p>
<p>Introduction: as of last night, late.When the reviewing deadline passed Wednesday night 15%
of reviews were still missing, much higher than I expected. Between late
reviews coming in, ACs working overtime through the weekend, and people
willing to help in the pinch another ~390 reviews came in, reducing the
missing mass to 0.2%. Nailing that last bit and a similar quantity of papers
with uniformly low confidence reviews is what remains to be done in terms of
basic reviews. We are trying to make all of those happen this week so authors
have some chance to respond.I was surprised by the quantity of late reviews,
and I think that's an area where ICML needs to improve in future years. Good
reviews are not done in a rush--they are done by setting aside time (like an
afternoon), and carefully reading the paper while thinking about implications.
Many reviewers do this well but a significant minority aren't good at
scheduling their personal time. In this situation there are several ways to
fail:Give early w</p><p>6 0.20383589 <a title="468-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>3 0.76052839 <a title="468-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-26-The_SODA_Program_Committee.html">318 hunch net-2008-09-26-The SODA Program Committee</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Claireasked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite
a bit of work.I had a relatively light load--merely 49 theory papers. Many of
these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common
for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help
review the papers. I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally. There were a
couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed
off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.There are some
differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and
theory communities. In machine learning it is expected that a review be
detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case. Every
paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very
detailed.I'm sure not every author was happy with the outcome. While we did
our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make. For
example, if there is a</p><p>4 0.75167251 <a title="468-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-09-ICML_author_feedback_is_open.html">461 hunch net-2012-04-09-ICML author feedback is open</a></p>

with an anonymous yahoo email account fromdotregistrar.comthe "Home of the
$6.79 wholesale domain!" and their nameservers are byTurkticaret, a Turkish
internet company.It appears the website has since been altered to "ICNL" (the
above link uses the google cache).They say that imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery, so the organizers of the realICML 2006must feel quite
flattered.</p><p>same-blog 2 0.88224971 <a title="468-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-29-ICML_survey_and_comments.html">468 hunch net-2012-06-29-ICML survey and comments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attendingICML, except forDorawho arrived
on Monday. Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is
going well.For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like
everyone),Mark Reidhas setup theICML discussionsite where you can comment on
any paper or subscribe to papers. Authors are automatically subscribed to
their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly
after the fact, as people desire.We also conducted a survey before the
conference and have thesurvey resultsnow. This can be compared with theICML
2010 survey results. Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes
order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4
being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and
2010.Glancing through them, I see:Most people found the papers they reviewed a
good fit for their expertise (-.037 w.r.t 2010). Achieving this was one of our

<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.Topic Models:Dynamic Topic
ModelsDavid Blei, John LaffertyA nice model for how topics in LDA type models
can evolve over time,using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters
and a veryclever structured variational approximation (in which the mean
fieldparameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all
Bleipapers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive.Pachinko
AllocationWei Li, Andrew McCallumA very elegant (but computationally
challenging) model which inducescorrelation amongst topics using a multi-level
DAG whose interior nodesare "super-topics" and "sub-topics" and whose leaves
are thevocabulary words. Makes the slumbering monster of structure learning
stir.Sequence Analysis (I missed these talks since I was chairing another
session)Online Decoding of Markov Models with Latency ConstraintsMukund

<p>Introduction: This is a reminder that many deadlines for summer conference registration are
coming up, and attendance is a very good idea.It's entirely reasonable for
anyone to visit a conference once, even when they don't have a paper. For
students, visiting a conference is almost a 'must'--there is no where else
that a broad cross-section of research is on display.Workshops are also a very
good idea.ICML has 11,KDD has 9, andAAAI has 19. Workshops provide an
opportunity to get a good understanding of some current area of research. They
are probably the forum most conducive to starting new lines of research
because they are so interactive.Tutorials are a good way to gain some
understanding of a long-standing direction of research. They are generally
more coherent than workshops.ICML has 7andAAAI has 15.</p><p>5 0.73042852 <a title="468-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-28-Programming_Languages_for_Machine_Learning_Implementations.html">210 hunch net-2006-09-28-Programming Languages for Machine Learning Implementations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning algorithms have a much better chance of being widely adopted
if they are implemented in some easy-to-use code. There are several important
concerns associated with machine learning which stress programming languages
on the ease-of-use vs. speed frontier.SpeedThe rate at which data sources are
growing seems to be outstripping the rate at which computational power is
growing, so it is important that we be able to eak out every bit of
computational power. Garbage collected languages (java,ocaml,perlandpython)
often have several issues here.Garbage collection often implies that floating
point numbers are "boxed": every float is represented by a pointer to a float.
Boxing can cause an order of magnitude slowdown because an extra nonlocalized
memory reference is made, and accesses to main memory can are many CPU cycles
long.Garbage collection often implies that considerably more memory is used
than is necessary. This has a variable effect. In some circumstances it
results in</p><p>6 0.70876837 <a title="468-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>

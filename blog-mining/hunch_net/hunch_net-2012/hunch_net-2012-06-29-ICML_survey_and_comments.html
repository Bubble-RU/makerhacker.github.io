<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some conception of what good reviewing is.  As far as I can tell, this is almost always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a “good paper” looks like for that area) rather than general principles.  Neither individual papers or areas are sufficiently general for a large conference—every paper differs in the details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?
 
An unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too large.  In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper which someone thinks might be of interest.  This reason for reviewing exists independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual conferences.  Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively meaningless over the long term — growing conferences simply use more rooms and/or change fo</p><p>3 0.22974727 <a title="468-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-18-ICML_%26%23038%3B_COLT_2010.html">403 hunch net-2010-07-18-ICML &#038; COLT 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The papers which interested me most at  ICML  and  COLT  2010 were:
  
  Thomas Walsh ,  Kaushik Subramanian ,  Michael Littman  and  Carlos Diuk   Generalizing Apprenticeship Learning across Hypothesis Classes .  This paper formalizes and provides algorithms with guarantees for mixed-mode apprenticeship and traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, allowing RL algorithms that perform better than for either setting alone. 
  István Szita  and  Csaba Szepesvári   Model-based reinforcement learning with nearly tight exploration complexity bounds .  This paper and  another represent the frontier of best-known algorithm for Reinforcement Learning in a Markov Decision Process. 
  James Martens   Deep learning via Hessian-free optimization .  About a new not-quite-online second order gradient algorithm for learning deep functional structures.  Potentially this is very powerful because while people have often talked about end-to-end learning, it has rarely worked in practice.

<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research.  They provide many roles including “announcing research”, “meeting people”, and  “point of reference”.  Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: “to what extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?”  This question is very difficult to answer in any satisfying way.  What we can do is compare details of the process across multiple conferences.
  
  Comments   The average quality of comments across conferences can vary dramatically.  At one extreme, the tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback.  At the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing detailed constructive feedback.  Detailed feedback can give authors significant guidance about how to improve research.  This is the most subjective entry. 
  Blind  Virtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors do not know reviewers.  Some also provide  double blind  review where rev</p><p>5 0.21288082 <a title="468-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The many reviews following the many paper deadlines are just about over.  AAAI and ICML in particular were experimenting with several reviewing techniques.  
  
 Double Blind: AAAI and ICML were both double blind this year.  It seemed (overall) beneficial, but two problems arose.
 
 For theoretical papers, with a lot to say, authors often leave out the proofs.  This is very hard to cope with under a double blind review because (1) you can not trust the authors got the proof right but (2) a blanket “reject” hits many probably-good papers.  Perhaps authors should more strongly favor proof-complete papers sent to double blind conferences. 
 On the author side, double blind reviewing is actually somewhat disruptive to research.  In particular, it discourages the author from talking about the subject, which is one of the mechanisms of research.  This is not a great drawback, but it is one not previously appreciated.

Machine Learning conferences are triannual now, between  NIPS ,  AIStat , and  ICML .  This has not always been the case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April conference.  
 
However, the first claim is not quite correct.

<p>Introduction: A substantial difficulty with the 2009 and 2008  ICML discussion system  was a communication vacuum, where authors were not informed of comments, and commenters were not informed of responses to their comments without explicit monitoring.   Mark Reid  has setup a  new discussion system for 2010  with the goal of addressing this.
 
Mark didn’t want to make it to intrusive, so you must opt-in.  As an author,  find your paper  and “Subscribe by email” to the comments.

<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attending  ICML , except for  Dora  who arrived on Monday.  Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is going well.
 
For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like everyone),  Mark Reid  has setup the  ICML discussion  site where you can comment on any paper or subscribe to papers.  Authors are automatically subscribed to their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly after the fact, as people desire.
 
We also conducted a survey before the conference and have the  survey results  now.  This can be compared with the  ICML 2010 survey results .  Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4 being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and 2010.

<p>Introduction: To commemorate the  Twenty Fourth Annual International Conference on Machine  Learning  (ICML-07), the FOX Network has decided to  launch a new spin-off series in prime time.

<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.  This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.  Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention.  Roughly speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your interest.  The main conference program consists of elements related to someoneâ&euro;&trade;s interest (which is rarely your own).  Workshops are more about doing research while conferences are more about presenting research.  
 
Several conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due shortly.
  
 
  ICML workshops  
 Due April 1 
 
 
  IJCAI workshops  
 Deadlines Vary 
 
 
 KDD workshops

Anyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops and see if any are of interest.  (If none are, then maybe you should organize one next year.)</p><p>4 0.84951073 <a title="468-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-28-Somebody%26%238217%3Bs_Eating_Your_Lunch.html">445 hunch net-2011-09-28-Somebody&#8217;s Eating Your Lunch</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Since we last discussed  the other online learning ,  Stanford  has very visibly started pushing mass teaching in  AI ,  Machine Learning , and  Databases .  In retrospect, it’s not too surprising that the next step up in serious online teaching experiments are occurring at the computer science department of a university embedded in the land of startups.  Numbers on the order of  100000  are quite significant—similar in scale to the number of  computer science undergraduate students/year  in the US.  Although these populations surely differ, the fact that they  could  overlap is worth considering for the future.  
 
It’s too soon to say how successful these classes will be and there are many easy criticisms to make:
  
  Registration != Learning   … but if only 1/10th complete these classes, the scale of teaching still surpasses the scale of any traditional process. 
  1st year excitement != nth year routine  … but if only 1/10th take future classes, the scale of teaching still surpass</p><p>5 0.8483572 <a title="468-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-26-The_SODA_Program_Committee.html">318 hunch net-2008-09-26-The SODA Program Committee</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Claire  asked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite a bit of work.
 
I had a relatively light load—merely 49 theory papers.  Many of these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help review the papers.  I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally.  There were a couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.
 
There are some differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and theory communities.  In machine learning it is expected that a review be detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case.  Every paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very detailed.  
 
I’m sure not every author was happy with the outcome.  While we did our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make.

<p>Introduction: … but only the little prize.  The  BellKor team  focused on integrating predictions from many different methods.  The base methods consist of:
  
 Nearest Neighbor Methods 
 Matrix Factorization Methods (asymmetric and symmetric) 
 Linear Regression on various feature spaces

The final predictor was an ensemble (as was reasonable to expect), although it’s a little bit more complicated than just a weighted average—it’s essentially a customized learning algorithm.  Base approaches (1)-(3) seem like relatively well-known approaches (although I haven’t seen the asymmetric factorization variant before).  RBMs are the new approach.
 
The  writeup  is pretty clear for more details.

<p>Introduction: Weâ&euro;&trade;d like to invite hunch.net readers to participate in the NIPS 2008 workshop on kernel learning.  While the main focus is on automatically learning kernels from data, we are also also looking at the broader questions of feature selection, multi-task learning and multi-view learning. There are no restrictions on the learning problem being addressed (regression, classification, etc), and both theoretical and applied work will be considered. The deadline for submissions is  October 24 .
 
More detail can be found  here .

<p>Introduction: The  second Netflix prize is canceled  due to  privacy problems .  I continue to believe my original assessment of this paper, that the privacy break was somewhat overstated.  I still haven’t seen any serious privacy failures on the scale of the  AOL search log release .
 
I expect privacy concerns to continue to be a big issue when dealing with data releases by companies or governments.  The theory of maintaining privacy while using data is improving, but it is not yet in a state where the limits of what’s possible are clear let alone how to achieve these limits in a manner friendly to a prediction competition.</p><p>2 0.96606839 <a title="456-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-01-31-Remote_large_scale_learning_class_participation.html">479 hunch net-2013-01-31-Remote large scale learning class participation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yann and I have arranged so that people who are interested in our  large scale machine learning class  and not able to attend in person can follow along via two methods.
  
  Videos  will be posted with about a 1 day delay on  techtalks .  This is a side-by-side capture of video+slides from  Weyond . 
 We are experimenting with  Piazza  as a discussion forum.  Anyone is welcome to subscribe to Piazza and ask questions there, where I will be monitoring things.   update2 : Sign up  here . 
  
The first lecture is up now, including the  revised version of the slides  which fixes a few typos and rounds out references.</p><p>3 0.96361572 <a title="456-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-25-Why_Papers%3F.html">30 hunch net-2005-02-25-Why Papers?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Makc asked a good  question  in comments—”Why bother to make a paper, at all?”  There are several reasons for writing papers which may not be immediately obvious to people not in academia.
 
The basic idea is that papers have considerably more utility than the obvious “present an idea”.
  
 Papers are a formalized units of work. Academics (especially young ones) are often judged on the number of papers they produce. 
 Papers have a formalized method of citing and crediting other—the bibliography.  Academics (especially older ones) are often judged on the number of citations they receive. 
 Papers enable a “more fair” anonymous review.  Conferences receive  many  papers, from which a subset are selected.  Discussion forums are inherently not anonymous for anyone who wants to build a reputation for good work. 
 Papers are an excuse to meet your friends.  Papers are the content of conferences, but much of what you do is talk to friends about interesting problems while there.  Sometimes yo</p><p>4 0.95905948 <a title="456-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-01-NIPS_2008_workshop_on_%26%238216%3BLearning_over_Empirical_Hypothesis_Spaces%26%238217%3B.html">319 hunch net-2008-10-01-NIPS 2008 workshop on &#8216;Learning over Empirical Hypothesis Spaces&#8217;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This workshop asks for insights how far we may/can push the theoretical boundary of using data in the design of learning machines. Can we express our classification rule in terms of the sample, or do we have to stick to a core assumption of classical statistical learning theory, namely that the hypothesis space is to be defined independent from the sample? This workshop is particularly interested in – but not restricted to – the ‘luckiness framework’ and the recently introduced  notion of ‘compatibility functions’ in a semi-supervised learning context (more information can be found at  http://www.kuleuven.be/wehys ).</p><p>5 0.94544375 <a title="456-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-02-26-Yahoo%21_ML_events.html">389 hunch net-2010-02-26-Yahoo!

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! is sponsoring two machine learning events that might interest people.  
  
 The  Key Scientific Challenges  program (due March 5) for  Machine Learning  and  Statistics  offers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working on a core problem of interest to Y!  If you are already working on one of these problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you arenâ&euro;&trade;t you might want to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary of the possible in Machine Learning.   There are 7 days left. 
 The  Learning to Rank challenge  (due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at an ICML workshop.  Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreak  the ensemble  encountered.  If you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all learn something.  There are 3 months left.</p><p>same-blog 6 0.9406476 <a title="456-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-02-24-ICML%2B50%25.html">456 hunch net-2012-02-24-ICML+50%</a></p>

<p>Introduction: There are at least3summer schools related to machine learning this summer.The
firstis atUniversity of ChicagoJune 1-11 organized byMisha Belkin,Partha
Niyogi, andSteve Smale. Registration is closed for this one, meaning they met
their capacity limit. The format is essentially an extended Tutorial/Workshop.
I was particularly interested to seeValiantamongst the speakers. I'm also
presenting Saturday June 6, on logarithmic time prediction.Praveen
Srinivasanpoints out the second atPeking Universityin Beijing, China, July
20-27.This onediffers substantially, as it is about vision, machine learning,
and their intersection. The deadline for applications is June 10 or 15. This
is also another example of the growth of research in China, with active
support fromNSF.The third one is atCambridge, England, August 29-September 10.
It's in theMLSS series. Compared to the Chicago one, this one is more about
the Bayesian side of ML, although effort has been made to create a good cross
section of topic</p><p>4 0.13184729 <a title="470-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-19-Workshop%3A_Atomic_Learning.html">124 hunch net-2005-10-19-Workshop: Atomic Learning</a></p>

this year is Europe. This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the
general internationalization of science over the last few years. Withcuts to
basic sciencein the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside
the US become more attractive. Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the
immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english
in place. China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>6 0.12746276 <a title="470-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-03-Fall_Machine_Learning_Events.html">443 hunch net-2011-09-03-Fall Machine Learning Events</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.September
9,abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposiumare due. Send a 2 page
pdf, if interested, and note that we:widened submissions to be from anybody
rather than students.set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed
submissions.September 15, there is amachine learning meetup, where I'll be
discussing terascale learning at AOL.September 16, there is aCS&Econ; dayat New
York Academy of Sciences. This is not ML focused, but it's easy to imagine
interest.September 23 and laterNIPS workshopsubmissions start coming due. As
usual, there are too many good ones, so I won't be able to attend all those
that interest me. I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming
summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you. Here are a few that
interest me:Big Learningis about dealing with lots of data. Abstracts are

<p>Introduction: One of the subsidiary roles of conferences is recruitment.NIPSis optimally
placed in time for this because it falls right before the major recruitment
season.I personally found job hunting embarrassing, and was relatively inept
at it. I expect this is true of many people, because it is not something done
often.The basic rule is: make the plausible hirers aware of your interest.
Anycorporate sponsoris a "plausible", regardless of whether or not there is a
booth.CRAand theacm job centerare other reasonable sources.There are
substantial differences between the different possibilities. Putting some
effort into understanding the distinctions is a good idea, although you should
always remember where the other person is coming from.</p><p>4 0.46903935 <a title="470-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-10-ICML_Reviewing_Criteria.html">325 hunch net-2008-11-10-ICML Reviewing Criteria</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Michael LittmanandLeon Bottouhave decided to use a franchise program chair
approach toreviewing at ICMLthis year. I'll be one of the area chairs, so I
wanted to mention a few things if you are thinking about naming me.I take
reviewing seriously. That means papers to be reviewed are read, the
implications are considered, and decisions are only made after that. I do my
best to be fair, and there are zero subjects that I consider categorical
rejects. I don't consider severalarguments for rejection-not-on-the-merits
reasonable.I am generally interested in papers that (a) analyze new models of
machine learning, (b) provide new algorithms, and (c) show that they work
empirically on plausibly real problems. If a paper has the trifecta, I'm
particularly interested. With 2 out of 3, I might be interested. I often find
papers with only one element harder to accept, including papers with just
(a).I'm a bit tough. I rarely jump-up-and-down about a paper, because I

<p>Introduction: People are naturally interested in slicing the ICML acceptance statistics in
various ways. Here's a rundown for the top categories.18/66 = 0.27in

The big winner this year is Europe.   This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.  With  cuts to basic science  in the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside the US become more attractive.   Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english in place.  China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>3 0.15787421 <a title="470-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-01-16-2011_Summer_Conference_Deadline_Season.html">422 hunch net-2011-01-16-2011 Summer Conference Deadline Season</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.
  
  September 9 ,  abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  Send a 2 page pdf, if interested, and note that we:
 
 widened submissions to be from anybody rather than students. 
 set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed submissions.  
 
 
  September 15 , there is a  machine learning meetup , where I’ll be discussing terascale learning at AOL. 
  September 16 , there is a  CS&Econ; day  at New York Academy of Sciences.  This is not ML focused, but it’s easy to imagine interest. 
  September 23 and later   NIPS workshop  submissions start coming due.  As usual, there are too many good ones, so I won’t be able to attend all those that interest me.  I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you.  Here are a few that interest me:
 
  Big Learning  is about dealing with lots of data.  Abstracts are due  September 30 .

<p>Introduction: The workshop on the  Meaningful Use of Complex Medical Data  is happening again, August 9-12 in LA, near  UAI  on Catalina Island August 15-17.  I enjoyed my visit last year, and expect this year to be interesting also.
 
The first  Bay Area Machine Learning Symposium  is August 30 at  Google .  Abstracts are due July 30.</p><p>2 0.60779595 <a title="470-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-04-21-Interesting_Presentations_at_Snowbird.html">349 hunch net-2009-04-21-Interesting Presentations at Snowbird</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are a few of presentations interesting me at the  snowbird learning  workshop (which, amusingly, was in Florida with  AIStat ).  
  
  Thomas Breuel  described machine learning problems within OCR and an open source  OCR software/research  platform with modular learning components as well has a 60Million size dataset derived from  Google ‘s scanned books. 
  Kristen Grauman  and  Fei-Fei Li  discussed using active learning with different cost labels and large datasets for  image ontology .  Both of them used  Mechanical Turk  as a  labeling system , which looks to become routine, at least for vision problems. 
  Russ Tedrake  discussed using machine learning for control, with a basic claim that it was the way to go for problems involving a medium  Reynold’s number  such as in bird flight, where simulation is extremely intense. 
  Yann LeCun  presented a poster on an  FPGA for convolutional neural networks  yielding a factor of 100 speedup in processing.   In addition to the graphi</p><p>3 0.45000753 <a title="470-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-16-KDNuggets.html">342 hunch net-2009-02-16-KDNuggets</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Eric Zaetsch points out  KDNuggets  which is a well-developed mailing list/news site with a  KDD  flavor.  This might particularly interest people looking for industrial jobs in machine learning, as the mailing list has many such.</p><p>4 0.35376769 <a title="470-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-18-Is_Multitask_Learning_Black-Boxable%3F.html">149 hunch net-2006-01-18-Is Multitask Learning Black-Boxable?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Multitask learning is the learning to predict multiple outputs given the same input.  Mathematically, we might think of this as trying to learn a function  f:X -> {0,1} n  .  Structured learning is similar at this level of abstraction.  Many people have worked on solving multitask learning (for example  Rich Caruana ) using methods which share an internal representation.  On other words, the the computation and learning  of the  i th prediction is shared with the computation and learning of the  j th prediction.  Another way to ask this question is: can we avoid sharing the internal representation?  
 
For example, it  might  be feasible to solve multitask learning by some process feeding the  i th prediction  f(x) i   into the  j th predictor  f(x,f(x) i ) j  , 
 
If the answer is “no”, then it implies we can not take binary classification as a basic primitive in the process of solving prediction problems.  If the answer is “yes”, then we can reuse binary classification algorithms to</p><p>5 0.2222853 <a title="470-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-08-31-Extreme_Classification_workshop_at_NIPS.html">488 hunch net-2013-08-31-Extreme Classification workshop at NIPS</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Manik  and I are organizing the  extreme classification  workshop at NIPS this year.  We have a number of good speakers lined up, but I would further encourage anyone working in the area to submit an abstract by October 9.  I believe this is an idea whose time has now come.
 
The NIPS website doesnâ&euro;&trade;t have other workshops listed yet, but I expect several others to be of significant interest.</p><p>6 0.20589617 <a title="470-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-19-Deadline_Season%2C_2010.html">387 hunch net-2010-01-19-Deadline Season, 2010</a></p>

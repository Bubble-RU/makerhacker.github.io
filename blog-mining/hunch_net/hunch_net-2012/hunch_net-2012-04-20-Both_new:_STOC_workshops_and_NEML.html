pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement.This year, we allocated
more time towards posters & poster spotlights.For next year, we are
considering some further changes. The format has traditionally been 4 invited

<p>Introduction: For anyone planning to do research, conference attendance is virtually
mandatory for success. Aside from exposing yourself to a large collection of
different ideas, many interesting conversations leading to new research happen
at conferences. If you are a student, you should plan to go to at least one
summer conference. Your advisor should cover the costs.ConferenceLocationEarly

<p>Introduction: I found the article on "Political Science" at theNew York Timesinteresting.
Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been
systematically distorting scientific views. With apetitionby some7000+
scientistsalleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.One
thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are
fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the
world. In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued. This value is
achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms. One example of a formal
mechanism is peer review.In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value
is agreement. It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be
passed or other actions can be taken. Since Science (with a capitol 'S') has
accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.
This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mechanism for
pushing agreement</p><p>4 0.4821198 <a title="462-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-27-Watchword%3A_Supervised_Learning.html">299 hunch net-2008-04-27-Watchword: Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I recently discovered that supervised learning is a controversial term. The
two definitions are:Known LossSupervised learning corresponds to the situation
where you have unlabeled examples plus knowledge of the loss of each possible
predicted choice. This is the definition I'm familiar and comfortable with.
One reason to prefer this definition is that the analysis of sample complexity
for this class of learning problems are all pretty similar.Any kind of
signalSupervised learning corresponds to the situation where you have
unlabeled examples plus any source of side information about what the right
choice is. This notion of supervised learning seems to subsume reinforcement
learning, which makes me uncomfortable, because it means there are two words
for the same class. This also means there isn't a convenient word to describe
the first definition.Reviews suggest there are people who are dedicated to the
second definition out there, so it can be important to discriminate which you

<p>Introduction: Say we have two random variablesX,Ywith mutual informationI(X,Y). Let's say we
want to represent them with a bayes net of the formX< -M->Y, such that the
entropy ofMequals the mutual information, i.e.H(M)=I(X,Y). Intuitively, we
would like our hidden state to be as simple as possible (entropy wise). The
data processing inequality means thatH(M)>=I(X,Y), so the mutual information
is a lower bound on how simple theMcould be. Furthermore, if such a
construction existed it would have a nice coding interpretation -- one could
jointly codeXandYby first coding the mutual information, then codingXwith this
mutual info (withoutY) and codingYwith this mutual info (withoutX).It turns
out that such a construction does not exist in general (ThxAlina
Beygelzimerfor a counterexample! see below for the sketch).What are the
implications of this? Well, it's hard for me to say, but it does suggest to me
that the 'generative' model philosophy might be burdened with a harder
modeling task. If all we care a</p><p>6 0.48174083 <a title="462-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-26-ML_Symposium_and_Strata-Hadoop_World.html">475 hunch net-2012-10-26-ML Symposium and Strata-Hadoop World</a></p>

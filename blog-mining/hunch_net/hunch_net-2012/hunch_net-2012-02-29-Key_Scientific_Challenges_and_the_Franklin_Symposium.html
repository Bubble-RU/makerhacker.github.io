<p>Introduction: Perhaps the biggest CS prize for research is theTuring Award, which has a
$0.25M cash prize associated with it. It appears none of the prizes so far
have been for anything like machine learning (the closest are perhaps database
awards).In CS theory, there is theGÃƒÂ¶del Prizewhich is smaller and newer,
offering a $5K prize along and perhaps (more importantly) recognition. One
such award has been given for Machine Learning, toRobert SchapireandYoav
Freundfor Adaboost.In Machine Learning, there seems to be no equivalent of
these sorts of prizes. There are several plausible reasons for this:There is
no coherent community.People drift in and out of the central conferences all
the time. Most of the author names from 10 years ago do not occur in the
conferences of today. In addition, the entire subject area is fairly new.There
are at least a core group of people who have stayed around.Machine Learning

information onthe program.The Simons Institute has created a number of
"Research Fellowships" for youngresearchers (within at most six years of the
award of their PhD) who wish toparticipate in Institute programs, including
the Big Data program. Individualswho already hold postdoctoral positions or
who are junior faculty are welcometo apply, as are finishing PhDs.Please note

<p>Introduction: Yahoo released theKey Scientific Challengesprogram. There is aMachine
Learninglist I worked on and aStatisticslist whichDeepakworked on.I'm hoping
this is taken quite seriously by graduate students. The primary value, is that
it gave us a chance to sit down and publicly specify directions of research
which would be valuable to make progress on. A good strategy for a beginning
graduate student is to pick one of these directions, pursue it, and make
substantial advances for a PhD. The directions are sufficiently general that
I'm sure any serious advance has applications well beyond Yahoo.A secondary
point, (which I'm sure is primary for many) is that there is money for
graduate students here. It's unrestricted, so you can use it for any
reasonable travel, supplies, etcâ&euro;Ś</p><p>6 0.47867018 <a title="457-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-16-MLSS_2008.html">273 hunch net-2007-11-16-MLSS 2008</a></p>

<p>Introduction: For theChicago 2005 machine learning summer schoolwe are organizing, at least
5 international students can not come due to visa issues. There seem to be two
aspects to visa issues:Inefficiency. The system rejected the student simply by
being incapable of evenstartingto evaluate their visa in less than 1 month of
time.Politics. Border controls became much tighter after the September 11
attack. Losing a big chunk of downtown of the largest city in a country will
do that.What I (and the students) learned is that (1) is a much larger problem
than (2). Only 1 prospective student seems to have achieved an explicit visa
rejection. Fixing problem (1) should be a no-brainer, because the lag time
almost surely indicates overload, and overload on border controls should worry
even people concerned with (2). The obvious fixes to overload are "spend more
money" and "make the system more efficient".With respect to (2), (which is a
more minor issue by the numbers) it is unclear that the political calc</p><p>4 0.77072036 <a title="457-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-02-Kolmogorov_Complexity_and_Googling.html">10 hunch net-2005-02-02-Kolmogorov Complexity and Googling</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning makes theNew Scientist. From the article:COMPUTERS can learn
the meaning of words simply by plugging into Google. The finding could bring
forward the day that true artificial intelligence is developedâ&euro;Ś.But Paul
Vitanyi and Rudi Cilibrasi of the National Institute for Mathematics and
Computer Science in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, realised that a Google search
can be used to measure how closely two words relate to each other. For
instance, imagine a computer needs to understand what a hat is.You can read
the paper atKC Google.Hat tip:Kolmogorov Mailing ListAny thoughts on the

<p>Introduction: I have decided to run a weblog on machine learning and learning theory
research. Here are some reasons:1) Weblogs enable new functionality:Public
comment on papers. No mechanism for this exists at conferences and most
journals. I have encountered it once for asciencepaper. Some communities have
mailing lists supporting this, but not machine learning or learning theory. I
have often read papers and found myself wishing there was some method to
consider other's questions and read the replies.Conference shortlists. One of
the most common conversations at a conference is "what did you find
interesting?" There is no explicit mechanism for sharing this information at
conferences, and it's easy to imagine that it would be handy to do
so.Evaluation and comment on research directions. Papers are almost

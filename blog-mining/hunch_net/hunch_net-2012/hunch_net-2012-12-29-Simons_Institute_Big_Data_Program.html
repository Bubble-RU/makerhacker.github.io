The new  Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing  
will begin organizing semester-long programs starting in 2013.
 
One of our first programs, set for Fall 2013, will be on the “Theoretical Foundations 
of Big Data Analysis”.  The organizers of this program are Michael Jordan (chair), 
Stephen Boyd, Peter Buehlmann, Ravi Kannan, Michael Mahoney, and Muthu Muthukrishnan.
 
See  http://simons.berkeley.edu/program_bigdata2013.html  for more information on 
the program.
 
The Simons Institute has created a number of “Research Fellowships” for young 
researchers (within at most six years of the award of their PhD) who wish to 
participate in Institute programs, including the Big Data program.  Individuals 
who already hold postdoctoral positions or who are junior faculty are welcome 
to apply, as are finishing PhDs.

<p>Introduction: As usual  ICML 2007  will be hosting a  workshop program  to be held this year on June 24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I’d like to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for details. 
 
Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your choosing. I’ve always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-conference on a particular ML sub-area.  Hope to see some interesting proposals rolling in.</p><p>6 0.43769026 <a title="476-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-19-How_is_Compressed_Sensing_going_to_change_Machine_Learning_%3F.html">248 hunch net-2007-06-19-How is Compressed Sensing going to change Machine Learning ?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Michael Jordan  sends the below:
 
The new  Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing  
will begin organizing semester-long programs starting in 2013.
 
One of our first programs, set for Fall 2013, will be on the “Theoretical Foundations 
of Big Data Analysis”.  The organizers of this program are Michael Jordan (chair), 
Stephen Boyd, Peter Buehlmann, Ravi Kannan, Michael Mahoney, and Muthu Muthukrishnan.
 
See  http://simons.berkeley.edu/program_bigdata2013.html  for more information on 
the program.
 
The Simons Institute has created a number of “Research Fellowships” for young 
researchers (within at most six years of the award of their PhD) who wish to 
participate in Institute programs, including the Big Data program.  Individuals 
who already hold postdoctoral positions or who are junior faculty are welcome 
to apply, as are finishing PhDs.
 
Please note that the application deadline is January 15, 2013.  Further details 
are available at  http://simons.berkeley.edu/fellows.h</p><p>2 0.67225569 <a title="476-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-07-28-Asking_questions.html">257 hunch net-2007-07-28-Asking questions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There are very substantial differences in how question asking is viewed culturally.  For example, all of the following are common:
  
 If no one asks a question, then no one is paying attention. 
 To ask a question is disrespectful of the speaker. 
 Asking a question is admitting your own ignorance. 
  
The first view seems to be the right one for research, for several reasons.
  
 Research is quite hard—it’s difficult to guess how people won’t understand something in advance while preparing a presentation.  Consequently, it’s very common to lose people.  No worthwhile presenter wants that. 
 Real understanding is precious.   By asking a question, you are really declaring “I want to understand”, and everyone should respect that. 
 Asking a question wakes you up.  I don’t mean from “asleep” to “awake” but from “awake” to “really awake”.  It’s easy to drift through something sort-of-understanding.  When you ask a question, especially because you are on the spot, you will do much better.</p><p>3 0.34860212 <a title="476-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here’s a quick reference for summer ML-related conferences sorted by due date:
  
 
 Conference 
 Due date 
 Location 
 Reviewing 
 
 
  KDD  
 Feb 10 
 August 12-16, Beijing, China 
 Single Blind 
 
 
  COLT

 June 25-June 27, Edinburgh, Scotland 
 Single Blind? (historically) 
 
 
  ICML  
 Feb 24 
 June 26-July 1, Edinburgh, Scotland 
 Double Blind, author response, zero  SPOF  
 
 
  UAI  
 March 30 
 August 15-17, Catalina Islands, California 
 Double Blind, author response 
 
  
Geographically, this is greatly dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.
 
Machine Learning conferences are triannual now, between  NIPS ,  AIStat , and  ICML .  This has not always been the case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April conference.  
 
However, the first claim is not quite correct.  NIPS and AIStat have few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other conf</p><p>4 0.34838998 <a title="476-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-20-Both_new%3A_STOC_workshops_and_NEML.html">462 hunch net-2012-04-20-Both new: STOC workshops and NEML</a></p>
<p>Introduction: May 16 in Cambridge , is the  New England Machine Learning Day , a first regional workshop/symposium on machine learning.  To present a poster, submit an abstract by  May 5 .
 
 May 19 in New York ,  STOC  is coming to town and  rather surprisingly having  workshops  which should be quite a bit of fun.  Iâ&euro;&trade;ll be speaking at  Algorithms for Distributed and Streaming Data .</p><p>5 0.34780318 <a title="476-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-02-26-Yahoo%21_ML_events.html">389 hunch net-2010-02-26-Yahoo! ML events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Yahoo! is sponsoring two machine learning events that might interest people.  
  
 The  Key Scientific Challenges  program (due March 5) for  Machine Learning  and  Statistics  offers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working on a core problem of interest to Y!  If you are already working on one of these problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you arenâ&euro;&trade;t you might want to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary of the possible in Machine Learning.   There are 7 days left. 
 The  Learning to Rank challenge  (due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at an ICML workshop.  Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreak  the ensemble  encountered.  If you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all learn something.  There are 3 months left.</p><p>6 0.34486371 <a title="476-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-25-Why_Papers%3F.html">30 hunch net-2005-02-25-Why Papers?</a></p>

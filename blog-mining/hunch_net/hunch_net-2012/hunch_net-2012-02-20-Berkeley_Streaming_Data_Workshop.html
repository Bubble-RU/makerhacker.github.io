<p>Introduction: The  New York ML symposium  was last Friday.  There were 303 registrations, up a bit from  last year .  I particularly enjoyed talks by  Bill Freeman  on vision and ML,  Jon Lenchner  on strategy in Jeopardy, and  Tara N. Sainath  and Brian Kingsbury on  deep learning for speech recognition .  If anyone has suggestions or thoughts for next year, please speak up.
 
I also attended  Strata + Hadoop World  for the first time.  This is primarily a trade conference rather than an academic conference, but I found it pretty interesting as a first time attendee.  This is ground zero for the  Big data  buzzword, and I see now why.  It’s about data, and the word “big” is so ambiguous that everyone can lay claim to it.  There were essentially zero academic talks.  Instead, the focus was on war stories, product announcements, and education.  The general level of education is much lower—explaining Machine Learning to the SQL educated is the primary operating point.  Nevertheless that’s happening, a</p><p>4 0.11134796 <a title="455-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-22-Create_Your_Own_ICML_Workshop.html">234 hunch net-2007-02-22-Create Your Own ICML Workshop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: As usual  ICML 2007  will be hosting a  workshop program  to be held this year on June 24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I’d like to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for details. 
 
Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your choosing. I’ve always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-conference on a particular ML sub-area.  Hope to see some interesting proposals rolling in.</p><p>5 0.099703372 <a title="455-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-07-17-MUCMD_and_BayLearn.html">470 hunch net-2012-07-17-MUCMD and BayLearn</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The workshop on the  Meaningful Use of Complex Medical Data  is happening again, August 9-12 in LA, near  UAI  on Catalina Island August 15-17.  I enjoyed my visit last year, and expect this year to be interesting also.

<p>Introduction: This workshop asks for insights how far we may/can push the theoretical boundary of using data in the design of learning machines. Can we express our classification rule in terms of the sample, or do we have to stick to a core assumption of classical statistical learning theory, namely that the hypothesis space is to be defined independent from the sample? This workshop is particularly interested in – but not restricted to – the ‘luckiness framework’ and the recently introduced  notion of ‘compatibility functions’ in a semi-supervised learning context (more information can be found at  http://www.kuleuven.be/wehys ).</p><p>3 0.58880776 <a title="455-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-20-The_Workshop_on_Cores%2C_Clusters%2C_and_Clouds.html">404 hunch net-2010-08-20-The Workshop on Cores, Clusters, and Clouds</a></p>

The general interest level in parallel learning seems to be growing rapidly, so I expect quite a bit of attendance.  Please join us if you are parallel-interested.
 
And, if you are working in the area of parallel learning, please consider  submitting an abstract  due Oct. 17 for presentation at the workshop.</p><p>4 0.58317721 <a title="455-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-24-Alex_Smola_starts_a_blog.html">408 hunch net-2010-08-24-Alex Smola starts a blog</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is encouraging.   There is some discussion of this at the  Computing Research Policy  blog.  
 
One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time, presumably in dollar budgets.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t believe that dollar budgets are the right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers.  A better way to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a measure of the relative emphasis on research.
 
  
 
This graph was assembled by dividing the  NSF budget  by the  US GDP .  For 2005 GDP, I used the  current estimate  and for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per year.  The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to change.
 
This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row.  The reality has been significantly more severe due to  DARPA decreasing funding  and industrial</p><p>2 0.89154857 <a title="455-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-05-more_icml_papers.html">189 hunch net-2006-07-05-more icml papers</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are a few other papers I enjoyed from ICML06.
 
Topic Models:
  
   
Dynamic Topic Models  
David Blei, John Lafferty 
A nice model for how topics in LDA type models can evolve over time, 
using a linear dynamical system on the natural parameters and a very 
clever structured variational approximation (in which the mean field 
parameters are pseudo-observations of a virtual LDS). Like all Blei 
papers, he makes it look easy, but it is extremely impressive. 
   
Pachinko Allocation  
Wei Li, Andrew McCallum 
A very elegant (but computationally challenging) model which induces 
correlation amongst topics using a multi-level DAG whose interior nodes 
are “super-topics” and “sub-topics” and whose leaves are the 
vocabulary words. Makes the slumbering monster of structure learning stir. 
  
Sequence Analysis (I missed these talks since I was chairing another session)

<p>Introduction: I attended  KDD  this year.  The conference has always had a strong grounding in what works based on the  KDDcup , but it has developed a halo of workshops on various subjects.  It seems that KDD has become a place where the economy meets machine learning in a stronger sense than many other conferences.
 
There were several papers that other people might like to take a look at.
  
  Yehuda Koren   Collaborative Filtering with Temporal Dynamics .  This paper describes how to incorporate temporal dynamics into a couple of collaborative filtering approaches.  This was also a best paper award. 
  D. Sculley , Robert Malkin,  Sugato Basu ,  Roberto J. Bayardo ,  Predicting Bounce Rates in Sponsored Search Advertisements .  The basic claim of this paper is that the probability people immediately leave (“bounce”) after clicking on an advertisement is predictable.

<p>Introduction: The  From Data to Knowledge  workshop May 7-11 at  Berkeley  should be of interest to the many people encountering streaming data in different disciplines.  Itâ&euro;&trade;s run by a group of astronomers who encounter streaming data all the time.  I met  Josh Bloom  recently and he is broadly interested in a workshop covering all aspects of Machine Learning on streaming data.  The hope here is that techniques developed in one area turn out useful in another which seems quite plausible.  Particularly if you are in the bay area, consider checking it out.</p><p>5 0.71328253 <a title="455-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-28-A_COLT_paper.html">85 hunch net-2005-06-28-A COLT paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found Tong Zhangâ&euro;&trade;s paper on  Data Dependent Concentration Bounds for Sequential Prediction Algorithms  interesting.  Roughly speaking, it states a tight bound on the future error rate for online learning algorithms assuming that samples are drawn independently.   This bound is easily computed and will make the progressive validation approaches used  here  significantly more practical.</p><p>6 0.68999732 <a title="455-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-07-KDD_and_MUCMD_2011.html">444 hunch net-2011-09-07-KDD and MUCMD 2011</a></p>

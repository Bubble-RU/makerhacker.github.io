<p>Introduction: Sebastien Bubeck  points out  COLT   registration  with a May 13 early registration deadline.   The local organizers have done an admirable job of containing costs with a $300 registration fee.
 
 ICML   registration  is also available, at about an x3 higher cost.  My understanding is that this is partly due to the costs of a larger conference being harder to contain, partly due to ICML lasting twice as long with tutorials and workshops, and partly because the conference organizers were a bit over-conservative in various ways.</p><p>3 0.17417008 <a title="465-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-30-COLT_2007.html">242 hunch net-2007-04-30-COLT 2007</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Registration for COLT 2007 is now open.
 
The conference will take place on 13-15 June, 2007, in San Diego, California, as part of the 2007 Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC), which includes STOC, Complexity, and EC.
 
The website for COLT: http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2007/index.html
 
The early registration deadline is May 11, and the cutoff date for discounted hotel rates is May 9.
 
Before registering, take note that the fees are substantially lower for members of ACM and/or SIGACT than for nonmembers. If youâ&euro;&trade;ve been contemplating joining either of these two societies (annual dues: $99 for ACM, $18 for SIGACT), now would be a good time!</p><p>4 0.17150095 <a title="465-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-10-26-NIPS_workshops.html">375 hunch net-2009-10-26-NIPS workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many of the  NIPS workshops  have a deadline about now, and the NIPS  early registration deadline is Nov. 6 .  Several interest me:
  
  Adaptive Sensing, Active Learning, and Experimental Design  due 10/27. 
  Discrete Optimization in Machine Learning: Submodularity, Sparsity & Polyhedra , due Nov. 6. 
  Large-Scale Machine Learning: Parallelism and Massive Datasets , due 10/23 (i.e. past) 
  Analysis and Design of Algorithms for Interactive Machine Learning , due 10/30. 
  
And Iâ&euro;&trade;m sure many of the others interest others.   Workshops are great as a mechanism for research, so take a look if there is any chance you might be interested.</p><p>5 0.1512603 <a title="465-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-24-2009_ICML_discussion_site.html">356 hunch net-2009-05-24-2009 ICML discussion site</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Mark Reid  has setup a  discussion site for ICML papers  again this year and  Monica Dinculescu  has linked it in from the ICML site.  Last year’s attempt appears to have been an acceptable but not wild success as a little bit of fruitful discussion occurred.  I’m hoping this year will be a bit more of a success—please don’t be shy

<p>Introduction: The  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is October 19 with a 2 page abstract deadline due September 13 via email with subject “Machine Learning Poster Submission” sent to physicalscience@nyas.org.  Everyone is welcome to submit.  Last year’s attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.
 
The primary experiment for  ICML 2013  is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling review cycles.  The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15.  This is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and reduce peak load.   The “not for proceedings” experiment from this year’s ICML is not continuing.
 
Edit: Fixed second ICML deadline.</p><p>4 0.95953137 <a title="465-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-05-CMU_wins_DARPA_Urban_Challenge.html">271 hunch net-2007-11-05-CMU wins DARPA Urban Challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  results have been posted , with  CMU first ,  Stanford second , and  Virginia Tech Third .
 
Considering that this was an open event (at least for people in the US), this was a very strong showing for research at universities (instead of defense contractors, for example).  Some details should become public at the  NIPS workshops .

<p>Introduction: Various people want to use hunch.net to announce things.  I’ve generally resisted this because I feared hunch becoming a pure announcement zone while I am much more interested contentful posts and discussion personally.  Nevertheless there is clearly some value and announcements are easy, so I’m planning to summarize announcements on Mondays.
  
  D. Sculley  points out an interesting  Semisupervised feature learning  competition, with a deadline of October 17.  
  Lihong Li  points out the  webscope user interaction dataset  which is the first high quality exploration dataset I’m aware of that is publicly available. 
 Seth Rogers points out  CrossValidated  which looks similar in conception to  metaoptimize , but directly using the  stackoverflow  interface and with a bit more of a statistics twist.</p><p>6 0.94486016 <a title="465-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-05-25-Inappropriate_Mathematics_for_Machine_Learning.html">302 hunch net-2008-05-25-Inappropriate Mathematics for Machine Learning</a></p>

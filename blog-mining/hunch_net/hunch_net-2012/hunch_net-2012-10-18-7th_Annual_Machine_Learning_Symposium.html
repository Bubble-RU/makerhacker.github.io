<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is another  machine learning meetup  where I’ll be speaking.  Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as “the future of machine learning”.  In particular, it’s all about how to learn in an interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation, etc…
 
On Sept 24, abstracts for the  New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it’s a great way to have a conversation with other people.
 
On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually happens.  This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more time for posters.  In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:  David Blei ,  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Tommi Jaakkola , and  Yann LeCun .  After the meeting, a late  hackNY  related event is planned where students and startups can meet.
 
I’d also like to point out the related  CS/Econ symposium  as I have interests there as well.</p><p>3 0.10219691 <a title="474-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-26-ML_Symposium_and_Strata-Hadoop_World.html">475 hunch net-2012-10-26-ML Symposium and Strata-Hadoop World</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  New York ML symposium  was last Friday.  There were 303 registrations, up a bit from  last year .  I particularly enjoyed talks by  Bill Freeman  on vision and ML,  Jon Lenchner  on strategy in Jeopardy, and  Tara N. Sainath  and Brian Kingsbury on  deep learning for speech recognition .  If anyone has suggestions or thoughts for next year, please speak up.
 
I also attended  Strata + Hadoop World  for the first time.  This is primarily a trade conference rather than an academic conference, but I found it pretty interesting as a first time attendee.  This is ground zero for the  Big data  buzzword, and I see now why.  It’s about data, and the word “big” is so ambiguous that everyone can lay claim to it.  There were essentially zero academic talks.  Instead, the focus was on war stories, product announcements, and education.  The general level of education is much lower—explaining Machine Learning to the SQL educated is the primary operating point.  Nevertheless that’s happening, a</p><p>4 0.098992907 <a title="474-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-28-NY_ML_Symposium_2010.html">415 hunch net-2010-10-28-NY ML Symposium 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the  2010 NYAS ML Symposium  this year.  (It was  about 170 last year .)  I particularly enjoyed several talks.
  
  Yann  has a new live demo of (limited) real-time object recognition learning.  
  Sanjoy  gave a fairly convincing and comprehensible explanation of why a  modified form of single-linkage clustering  is consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a critical feature for clustering algorithms.  I’m curious how well this algorithm works in practice. 
  Matt Hoffman ‘s poster covering online LDA seemed pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement. 
  
This year, we allocated more time towards posters & poster spotlights.  
 
For next year, we are considering some further changes.  The format has traditionally been 4 invited Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students.  Demand from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and startups in the area.  Another growing concern is the fa</p><p>5 0.094720721 <a title="474-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-27-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">369 hunch net-2009-08-27-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several events are happening in the NY area.
  
  Barriers in Computational Learning Theory Workshop, Aug 28.   That’s tomorrow near Princeton.  I’m looking forward to speaking at this one on “Getting around Barriers in Learning Theory”, but several other talks are of interest, particularly to the CS theory inclined. 
  Claudia Perlich  is running the  INFORMS Data Mining Contest  with a deadline of Sept. 25. This is a contest using real health record data (they partnered with  HealthCare Intelligence ) to predict transfers and mortality. In the current US health care reform debate, the case studies of high costs we hear strongly suggest machine learning & statistics can save many billions. 
  The Singularity Summit October 3&4 .  This is for the AIists out there.  Several of the talks look interesting, although unfortunately I’ll miss it for  ALT . 
  Predictive Analytics World, Oct 20-21 .  This is stretching the definition of “New York Area” a bit, but the train to DC is reasonable.</p><p>6 0.088034846 <a title="474-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2014/hunch_net-2014-03-11-The_New_York_ML_Symposium%2C_take_2.html">494 hunch net-2014-03-11-The New York ML Symposium, take 2</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A reminder that the  New York Academy of Sciences  will be hosting the  7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium  tomorrow from 9:30am.
 
The main program will feature invited talks from  Peter Bartlett ,  William Freeman , and  Vladimir Vapnik , along with numerous spotlight talks and a poster session. Following the main program,  hackNY  and  Microsoft Research  are sponsoring a networking hour with talks from machine learning practitioners at NYC startups (specifically  bit.ly ,  Buzzfeed ,  Chartbeat , and  Sense Networks ,  Visual Revenue ).  This should be of great interest to everyone considering working in machine learning.</p><p>2 0.82975459 <a title="474-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-05-09-CI_Fellows%2C_again.html">434 hunch net-2011-05-09-CI Fellows, again</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a difficult subject to talk about for many reasons, but a discussion may be helpful.
 
Bad reviewing is a problem in academia.  The first step in understanding this is admitting to the problem, so here is a short list of examples of bad reviewing. 
  
 Reviewer disbelieves theorem proof (ICML),  or disbelieve theorem with a trivially false counterexample. (COLT)  
 Reviewer internally swaps quantifiers in a theorem, concludes it has been done before and is trivial. (NIPS) 
 Reviewer believes a technique will not work despite experimental validation. (COLT) 
 Reviewers fail to notice flaw in theorem statement (CRYPTO).   
 Reviewer erroneously claims that it has been done before (NIPS, SODA, JMLR)—(complete with references!) 
 Reviewer inverts the message of a paper and concludes it says nothing important. (NIPS*2) 
 Reviewer fails to distinguish between a DAG and a tree (SODA). 
 Reviewer is enthusiastic about paper but clearly does not understand (ICML). 
 Reviewer erroneously</p><p>4 0.74137723 <a title="474-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-26-Two_more_UAI_papers_of_interest.html">199 hunch net-2006-07-26-Two more UAI papers of interest</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In addition to Ed Snelson’s paper, there were (at least) two other papers that caught my eye at UAI.
 
One was  this paper  by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Daniel Hsu and Nakul Verma at UCSD which shows in a surprisingly general and strong way that almost all linear projections of any jointly distributed vector random variable with finite first and second moments look sphereical and unimodal (in fact look like a scale mixture of Gaussians). Great result, as you’d expect from Sanjoy.
 
The other paper which I found intriguing but which I just haven’t groked yet is  this beast  by Manfred and Dima Kuzmin. 
You can check out the (beautiful)  slides  
if that helps. I feel like there is something deep here, but my brain is too small to understand it. The COLT and last NIPS papers/slides are also on Manfred’s page. Hopefully someone here can illuminate.</p><p>5 0.71645707 <a title="474-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-05-Server_Shift%2C_Site_Tweaks%2C_Suggestions%3F.html">182 hunch net-2006-06-05-Server Shift, Site Tweaks, Suggestions?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Hunch.net has shifted to a new server, and wordpress has been updated to the latest version. If anyone notices difficulties associated with this, please comment. (Note that DNS updates can take awhile so the shift may not yet be complete.) 
More generally, this is a good time to ask for suggestions.

<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.
  
  September 9 ,  abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  Send a 2 page pdf, if interested, and note that we:
 
 widened submissions to be from anybody rather than students. 
 set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed submissions.  
 
 
  September 15 , there is a  machine learning meetup , where I’ll be discussing terascale learning at AOL. 
  September 16 , there is a  CS&Econ; day  at New York Academy of Sciences.  This is not ML focused, but it’s easy to imagine interest. 
  September 23 and later   NIPS workshop  submissions start coming due.  As usual, there are too many good ones, so I won’t be able to attend all those that interest me.  I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you.  Here are a few that interest me:

ICML continues to experiment with the reviewing process, although perhaps less so than last year.  
 
The S “sort-of” for COLT is because author feedback occurs only after decisions are made.  
 
KDD is notable for being the most comprehensive in terms of {Tutorials, Workshops, Challenges, Panels, Papers (two tracks), Demos}.  The S for KDD is because there is sometimes author feedback at the decision of the SPC.

Geographically, this is greatly dispersed and the UAI/KDD conflict is unfortunate.
 
Machine Learning conferences are triannual now, between  NIPS ,  AIStat , and  ICML .  This has not always been the case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April conference.  
 
However, the first claim is not quite correct.  NIPS and AIStat have few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other conf</p><p>5 0.16080488 <a title="472-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-04-Fall_ML_Conferences.html">316 hunch net-2008-09-04-Fall ML Conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Everyone should have received notice for  NY ML Symposium  abstracts.  Check carefully, as one was lost by our system.  
 
The event itself is October 21, next week.   Leon Bottou ,  Stephen Boyd , and  Yoav Freund  are giving the invited talks this year, and there are many spotlights on local work spread throughout the day.   Chris Wiggins  has setup 6(!) ML-interested startups to follow the symposium, which should be of substantial interest to the employment interested.
 
I also wanted to give an update on  ICML 2012 .  Unlike last year, our deadline is coordinated with  AIStat  (which is due this Friday).  The paper deadline for ICML has been pushed back to February 24 which should allow significant time for finishing up papers after the winter break.  Other details may interest people as well: 
  
 We settled on using  CMT  after checking out the possibilities.  I wasn’t looking for this, because I’ve  often found CMT clunky in terms of easy access to the right information.

<p>Introduction: Mark Reid  has setup a  discussion site for ICML papers  again this year and  Monica Dinculescu  has linked it in from the ICML site.  Last year’s attempt appears to have been an acceptable but not wild success as a little bit of fruitful discussion occurred.  I’m hoping this year will be a bit more of a success—please don’t be shy   
 
I’d like to also point out that  ICML ‘s early  registration  deadline has a few hours left, while  UAI ‘s and  COLT ‘s are in a week.</p><p>6 0.51438957 <a title="472-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-24-David_Waltz.html">460 hunch net-2012-03-24-David Waltz</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is October 19 with a 2 page abstract deadline due September 13 via email with subject “Machine Learning Poster Submission” sent to physicalscience@nyas.org.  Everyone is welcome to submit.  Last year’s attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.
 
The primary experiment for  ICML 2013  is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling review cycles.  The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15.  This is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and reduce peak load.   The “not for proceedings” experiment from this year’s ICML is not continuing.
 
Edit: Fixed second ICML deadline.</p><p>2 0.99202967 <a title="472-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-11-COLT_CFP.html">326 hunch net-2008-11-11-COLT CFP</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The  results have been posted , with  CMU first ,  Stanford second , and  Virginia Tech Third .
 
Considering that this was an open event (at least for people in the US), this was a very strong showing for research at universities (instead of defense contractors, for example).  Some details should become public at the  NIPS workshops .

<p>Introduction: Various people want to use hunch.net to announce things.  I’ve generally resisted this because I feared hunch becoming a pure announcement zone while I am much more interested contentful posts and discussion personally.  Nevertheless there is clearly some value and announcements are easy, so I’m planning to summarize announcements on Mondays.
  
  D. Sculley  points out an interesting  Semisupervised feature learning  competition, with a deadline of October 17.  
  Lihong Li  points out the  webscope user interaction dataset  which is the first high quality exploration dataset I’m aware of that is publicly available. 
 Seth Rogers points out  CrossValidated  which looks similar in conception to  metaoptimize , but directly using the  stackoverflow  interface and with a bit more of a statistics twist.</p><p>6 0.97210616 <a title="472-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-05-25-Inappropriate_Mathematics_for_Machine_Learning.html">302 hunch net-2008-05-25-Inappropriate Mathematics for Machine Learning</a></p>

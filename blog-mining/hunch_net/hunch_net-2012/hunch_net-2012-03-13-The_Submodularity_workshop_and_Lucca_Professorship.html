<p>Introduction: Many of the  NIPS workshops  have a deadline about now, and the NIPS  early registration deadline is Nov. 6 .  Several interest me:
  
  Adaptive Sensing, Active Learning, and Experimental Design  due 10/27. 
  Discrete Optimization in Machine Learning: Submodularity, Sparsity & Polyhedra , due Nov. 6. 
  Large-Scale Machine Learning: Parallelism and Massive Datasets , due 10/23 (i.e. past) 
  Analysis and Design of Algorithms for Interactive Machine Learning , due 10/30. 
  
And Iâ&euro;&trade;m sure many of the others interest others.   Workshops are great as a mechanism for research, so take a look if there is any chance you might be interested.</p><p>3 0.085281588 <a title="459-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-02-Paper_Deadlines.html">11 hunch net-2005-02-02-Paper Deadlines</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Thanksgiving is perhaps my favorite holiday, because pausing your life and giving thanks provides a needed moment of perspective.
 
As a researcher, I am most thankful for my education, without which I could not function.  I want to share this, because it provides some sense of how a researcher starts.
  
 My long term memory seems to function particularly well, which makes any education I get is particularly useful. 
 I am naturally obsessive, which makes me chase down details until I fully understand things.  Natural obsessiveness can go wrong, of course, but it’s a great ally when you absolutely must get things right. 
 My childhood was all in one hometown, which was a conscious sacrifice on the part of my father, implying disruptions from moving around were eliminated.  I’m not sure how important this was since travel has it’s own benefits, but it bears thought. 
 I had several great teachers in grade school, and naturally gravitated towards teachers over classmates, as they seemed</p><p>3 0.35969228 <a title="459-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-11-COLT_CFP.html">326 hunch net-2008-11-11-COLT CFP</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is October 19 with a 2 page abstract deadline due September 13 via email with subject “Machine Learning Poster Submission” sent to physicalscience@nyas.org.  Everyone is welcome to submit.  Last year’s attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.
 
The primary experiment for  ICML 2013  is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling review cycles.  The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15.  This is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and reduce peak load.   The “not for proceedings” experiment from this year’s ICML is not continuing.

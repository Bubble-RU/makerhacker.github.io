rather some people at "Enformatika". Investigation shows that they registered
with an anonymous yahoo email account fromdotregistrar.comthe "Home of the

internet company.It appears the website has since been altered to "ICNL" (the
above link uses the google cache).They say that imitation is the sincerest

flattered.</p><p>6 0.073493786 <a title="459-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-17-Going_all_the_Way%2C_Sometimes.html">42 hunch net-2005-03-17-Going all the Way, Sometimes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Various people want to use hunch.net to announce things. I've generally
resisted this because I feared hunch becoming a pure announcement zone while I
am much more interested contentful posts and discussion personally.
Nevertheless there is clearly some value and announcements are easy, so I'm
planning to summarize announcements on Mondays.D. Sculleypoints out an
interestingSemisupervised feature learningcompetition, with a deadline of
October 17.Lihong Lipoints out thewebscope user interaction datasetwhich is
the first high quality exploration dataset I'm aware of that is publicly
available.Seth Rogers points outCrossValidatedwhich looks similar in
conception tometaoptimize, but directly using thestackoverflowinterface and

<p>Introduction: Since learning is far from an exact science, it's good to pay attention to
basic intuitions of applied learning. Here are a few I've
collected.IntegrationIn Bayesian learning, the posterior is computed by an
integral, and the optimal thing to do is to predict according to this
integral. This phenomena seems to be far more general. Bagging, Boosting,
SVMs, and Neural Networks all take advantage of this idea to some extent. The
phenomena is more general: you can average over many differentclassification
predictorsto improve performance.
Sources:Zoubin,CaruanaDifferentiationDifferent pieces of an average should
differentiate to achieve good performance by different methods. This is know
as the 'symmetry breaking' problem for neural networks, and it's why weights
are initialized randomly. Boosting explicitly attempts to achieve good
differentiation by creating new, different, learning problems. Sources:Yann

<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś and you should use that fact.A workshop differs from a conference in that it
is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic. It also
differs in that a workshop is typically a "one-time affair" rather than a
series. (TheSnowbird learning workshopcounts as a conference in this
respect.)A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop
is to treat it as a conference. This is "ok", but it is not really taking
advantage of the situation. Here are some things I've learned:For speakers: A
smaller audience means it can be more interactive. Interactive means a better
chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation
(because you can adapt to your audience). Greater focus amongst the
participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and
discuss tradeoffs more carefully. Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued
than newness.For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference style
presentation format (i.</p><p>4 0.8617478 <a title="459-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-04-Optimal_Proxy_Loss_for_Classification.html">341 hunch net-2009-02-04-Optimal Proxy Loss for Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Many people in machine learning take advantage of the notion of a proxy loss:
A loss function which is much easier to optimize computationally than the loss
function imposed by the world. A canonical example is when we want to learn a
weight vectorwand predict according to a dot productfw(x)= sumiwixiwhere
optimizing squared loss(y-fw(x))2over many samples is much more tractable than
optimizing 0-1 lossI(y = Threshold(fw(x) - 0.5)).While the computational
advantages of optimizing a proxy loss are substantial, we are curious: which
proxy loss is best? The answer of course depends on what the real loss imposed
by the world is. For 0-1 loss classification, there are adherents to many
choices:Log loss. If we confine the prediction to[0,1], we can treat it as a
predicted probability that the label is1, and measure loss according tolog
1/p'(y|x)wherep'(y|x)is the predicted probability of the observed label. A
standard method for confining the prediction to[0,1]islogistic regressionwhich

RÃƒÂ©mi MunosAgain, on the list to read. I saw Csaba and Remi talk about this
and related work at an ICML Workshop on Kernel Reinforcement Learning. The big
question in my head is how this compares/contrasts with existing work
inreductions to reinforcement learning.Are there
advantages/disadvantages?Higher Order Learning On Graphs>by Sameer Agarwal,
Kristin Branson, and Serge Belongie, looks to be interesteding. They seem to
poo-poo "tensorization" of existing graph algorithm</p><p>6 0.8245728 <a title="459-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-01-21-Nearly_all_natural_problems_require_nonlinearity.html">337 hunch net-2009-01-21-Nearly all natural problems require nonlinearity</a></p>

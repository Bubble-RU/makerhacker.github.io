dealing with causality in a contextual bandit framework. Relative toprevious

while mine will be about total mastery of the simplest nontrivial case,

<p>Introduction: I've releasedversion 5.0of theVowpal Wabbitonline learning software. The major
number has changed since thelast releasebecause I regard all earlier versions
as obsolete--there are several new algorithms & features including substantial
changes and upgrades to the default learning algorithm.The biggest changes are
new algorithms:Nikosand I improved the default algorithm. The basic update
rule still uses gradient descent, but the size of the update is carefully
controlled so that it's impossible to overrun the label. In addition, the
normalization has changed. Computationally, these changes are virtually free
and yield better results, sometimes much better. Less careful updates can be
reenabled with -loss_function classic, although results are still not
identical to previous due to normalization changes.Nikos also implemented the
per-feature learning rates as per thesetwopapers. Often, this works better
than the default algorithm. It isn't the default because it isn't (yet) as
adaptable</p><p>4 0.12006091 <a title="473-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-12-07-Vowpal_Wabbit_version_4.0%2C_and_a_NIPS_heresy.html">381 hunch net-2009-12-07-Vowpal Wabbit version 4.0, and a NIPS heresy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm releasingversion 4.0(tarball) ofVowpal Wabbit. The biggest change (by far)
in this release is experimental support for cluster parallelism, with notable
help fromDaniel Hsu.I also took advantage of the major version number to
introduce some incompatible changes, including switching tomurmurhash 2, and
other alterations to cachefiles. You'll need to delete and regenerate them. In
addition, the precise specification for a "tag" (i.e. string that can be used
to identify an example) changed--you can't have a space between the tag and
the '|' at the beginning of the feature namespace.And, of course, we made it
faster.For the future, I put up mytodo listoutlining the major future
improvements I want to see in the code. I'm planning to discuss the current
mechanism and results of the cluster parallel implementation at thelarge scale
machine learning workshopatNIPSlater this week. Several people have asked me
to do a tutorial/walkthrough of VW, which is arranged for friday 2pm in the

<p>Introduction: Several recent papers have shown that SVM-like optimizations can be used to
handle several large family loss functions.This is a good thing because it is
implausible that thelossfunction imposed by the world can not be taken into
account in the process of solving a prediction problem. Even people used to
the hard-coreBayesianapproach to learning often note that some approximations
are almost inevitable in specifying apriorand/or integrating to achieve a
posterior. Taking into account how the system will be evaluated can allow both
computational effort and design effort to be focused so as to improve
performance.A current laundry list of capabilities includes:2002multiclass SVM
including arbitrary cost matricesICML 2003Hidden Markov ModelsNIPS 2003Markov
Networks(see somediscussion)EMNLP 2004Context free grammarsICML 2004Any loss

<p>Introduction: I just madeversion 6.1ofVowpal Wabbit. Relative to6.0, there are few new
features, but many refinements.The cluster parallel learning code better
supports multiple simultaneous runs, and other forms of parallelism have been
mostly removed. This incidentally significantly simplifies the learning
core.The online learning algorithms are more general, with support for l1(via
a truncated gradient variant) and l2regularization, and a generalized form of
variable metric learning.There is a solid persistent server mode which can
train online, as well as serve answers to many simultaneous queries, either in
text or binary.This should be a very good release if you are just getting
started, as we've made it compile more automatically out of the box, have
several newexamplesand updated documentation.Aspertradition, we're planning to
do a tutorial at NIPS during the break at theparallel learning workshopat 2pm
Spanish time Friday. I'll cover the basics, leaving the fun stuff for
others.Mirowill cov</p><p>5 0.54598838 <a title="473-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-04-Vowpal_Wabbit%2C_version_5.0%2C_and_the_second_heresy.html">419 hunch net-2010-12-04-Vowpal Wabbit, version 5.0, and the second heresy</a></p>

wanted to getlearning reductionsworking and we've finally done it. Not
everything is implemented yet, but VW now supports direct:Multiclass

searnor-daggerIn addition, it is now easy to build your own custom learning
reductions for various plausible uses: feature diddling, custom structured
prediction problems, or alternate learning reductions. This effort is far from
done, but it is now in a generally useful state. Note that all learning
reductions inherit the ability to do cluster parallel learning.Library
interface: VW now has a basic library interface. The library provides most of
the functionality of VW, with the limitation that it is monolithic and
nonreentrant. These will be improved over time.Windows port: The priority of a

<p>Introduction: I've been looking at some recent embeddings work, and am struck by how
beautiful the theory and algorithms are. It also makes me wonder, what are
embeddings good for?A few things immediately come to mind:(1) For
visualization of high-dimensional data sets.In this case, one would like good
algorithms for embedding specifically into 2- and 3-dimensional Euclidean
spaces.(2) For nonparametric modeling.The usual nonparametric models
(histograms, nearest neighbor) often require resources which are exponential
in the dimension. So if the data actually lie close to some low-
dimensionalsurface, it might be a good idea to first identify this surface and
embed the data before applying the model.Incidentally, for applications like
these, it's important to have a functional mapping from high to low dimension,
which some techniques do not yield up.(3) As a prelude to classifier
learning.The hope here is presumably that learning will be easier in the low-
dimensional space, because of (i) better ge</p><p>3 0.77225214 <a title="473-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.

Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some

which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>4 0.76554269 <a title="473-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-01-The_Webscience_Future.html">134 hunch net-2005-12-01-The Webscience Future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The internet has significantly effected the way we do research but it's
capabilities have not yet been fully realized.First, let's acknowledge some
known effects.Self-publishingBy default, all researchers in machine learning
(and more generally computer science and physics) place their papers online
for anyone to download. The exact mechanism differs--physicists tend to use a
central repository (Arxiv) while computer scientists tend to place the papers
on their webpage. Arxiv has been slowly growing in subject breadth so it now
sometimes used by computer scientists.CollaborationEmail has enabled working
remotely with coauthors. This has allowed collaborationis which would not
otherwise have been possible and generally speeds research.Now, let's look at
attempts to go further.Blogs(like this one) allow public discussion about
topics which are not easily categorized as "a new idea in machine learning"
(like this topic).Organizationof some subfield of research. This

<p>Introduction: One viewpoint on academia is that it is inherently adversarial: there are
finite research dollars, positions, and students to work with, implying a
zero-sum game between different participants. This is not a viewpoint that I
want to promote, as I consider it flawed. However, I know several people
believe strongly in this viewpoint, and I have found it to have substantial
explanatory power.For example:It explains why your paper was rejected based on
poor logic. The reviewer wasn't concerned with research quality, but rather
with rejecting a competitor.It explains why professors rarely work together.
The goal of a non-tenured professor (at least) is to get tenure, and a case
for tenure comes from a portfolio of work that is undisputably yours.It
explains why new research programs are not quickly adopted. Adopting a
competitor's program is impossible, if your career is based on the competitor
being wrong.Different academic groups subscribe to the adversarial viewpoint
in different degrees</p><p>6 0.75834578 <a title="473-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-17-Learning_Research_Programs.html">21 hunch net-2005-02-17-Learning Research Programs</a></p>

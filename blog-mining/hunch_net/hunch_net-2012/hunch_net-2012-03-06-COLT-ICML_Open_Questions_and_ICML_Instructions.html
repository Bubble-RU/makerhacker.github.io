<p>Introduction: One prescription for solving a problem well is:State the problem, in the
simplest way possible. In particular, this statement should involve no
contamination with or anticipation of the solution.Think about solutions to
the stated problem.Stating a problem in a succinct and crisp manner tends to
invite a simple elegant solution. When a problem can not be stated succinctly,
we wonder if the problem is even understood. (And when a problem is not
understood, we wonder if a solution can be meaningful.)Reinforcement learning
does step (1) well. It provides a clean simple language to state general AI
problems. In reinforcement learning there is a set of actionsA, a set of
observationsO, and a rewardr. The reinforcement learning problem, in general,
is defined by a conditional measureD( o, r | (o,r,a)*)which produces an
observationoand a rewardrgiven a history(o,r,a)*. The goal in reinforcement
learning is to find a policypi:(o,r,a)*-> amapping histories to actions so as
to maximize (or appro</p><p>5 0.11083927 <a title="458-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-28-Why_COLT%3F.html">453 hunch net-2012-01-28-Why COLT?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: ByShieandNatiFollowing John's advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought
it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is
often the best place for theory papers. We would like to emphasize that we
both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs,
and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers. For
many papers, ICML is the best venue. But for many theory papers, COLT is a
better and more appropriate place.Why should you submit to COLT?By-and-large,
theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory
papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking
theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT
is more focused then ICML with a single track session. Unlike ICML, the norm
in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks
presented. There is also often a lively discussion following paper

<p>Introduction: In research, it's often the case that solving a problem helps you realize that
it wasn't the right problem to solve. This is the case for the "reduce RL to
classification" problem with the solution hinted athereand turned into a
paperhere.The essential difficulty is that the method of stating and analyzing
reductions ends up being nonalgorithmic (unlike previous reductions) unless
you work with learning from teleoperated robots asGreg Grudicdoes. The
difficulty here is due to the reduction being dependent on the optimal policy
(which a human teleoperator might simulate, but which is otherwise
unavailable).So, thisproblemis "open" again with the caveat that this time we
want a more algorithmic solution.Whether or not this is feasible at all is
still unclear and evidence in either direction would greatly interest me. A
positive answer might have many practical implications in the long run.</p><p>5 0.53200352 <a title="458-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-06-COLT_open_questions.html">429 hunch net-2011-04-06-COLT open questions</a></p>
<p>Introduction: AlinaandJakepoint out the COLTCall for Open Questionsdue May 11. In general,
this is cool, and worth doing if you can come up with a crisp question. In my
case, I particularly enjoyedcrafting an open questionwith precisely a form
such that acritic targeting my paperswould be forced to confront their fallacy
or make a case for the reward. But less esoterically, this is a way to get the
attention of some very smart people focused on a problem that really matters,
which is the real value.</p><p>6 0.52374256 <a title="458-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-04-The_Health_of_COLT.html">89 hunch net-2005-07-04-The Health of COLT</a></p>

workshopdiscussing the use of no-regret algorithms for the use of several
robot-related learning problems. There seems to be a drafthere. This seems
interesting in two ways:Drawback RemovalOne of the significant problems with
these online algorithms is that they can't cope with structure very easily.
This drawback is addressed for certain structures.ExperimentsOne criticism of
such algorithms is that they are too "worst case". Several experiments suggest
that protecting yourself against this worst case does not necessarily incur a
great loss.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.90473598 <a title="458-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML_Open_Questions_and_ICML_Instructions.html">458 hunch net-2012-03-06-COLT-ICML Open Questions and ICML Instructions</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One standard approach for clustering data with a set of gaussians is using EM.
Roughly speaking, you pick a set ofkrandom guassians and then use alternating
expectation maximization to (hopefully) find a set of guassians that "explain"
the data well. This process is difficult to work with because EM can become
"stuck" in local optima. There are various hacks like "rerun withtdifferent
random starting points".One cool observation is that this can often be solved
via other algorithm which donotsuffer from local optima. This is an
earlypaperwhich shows this. Ravi Kannan presented anew papershowing this is
possible in a much more adaptive setting.A very rough summary of these papers
is that by projecting into a lower dimensional space, it is computationally
tractable to pick out the gross structure of the data. It is unclear how well
these algorithms work in practice, but they might be effective, especially if
used as a subroutine of the form:Project to low dimensional space.Pick out

<p>Introduction: Several bits of progress have been made sinceSanjoypointed out the
significantlack of theoretical understanding of active learning. This is an
update on the progress I know of. As a refresher, active learning as meant
here is:There is a source of unlabeled data.There is an oracle from which
labels can be requested for unlabeled data produced by the source.The goal is
to perform well with minimal use of the oracle.Here is what I've
learned:Sanjoy has developed sufficient and semi-necessary conditions for
active learning given the assumptions of IID data and "realizability" (that
one of the classifiers is a correct classifier).Nina,Alina, and I developed an
algorithm for active learning relying on only the assumption of IID data. A
draft ishere.Nicolo,Claudio, andLucashowed that it is possible to do active
learning in an entirely adversarial setting for linear threshold
classifiershere. This was published a year or two ago and I recently learned
about it.All of these results are relative</p><p>6 0.65985328 <a title="458-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks_for_RL.html">148 hunch net-2006-01-13-Benchmarks for RL</a></p>

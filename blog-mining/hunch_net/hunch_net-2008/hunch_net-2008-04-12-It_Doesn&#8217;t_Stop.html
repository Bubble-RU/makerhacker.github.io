<p>Introduction: I recently had fun discussions with both  Vikash Mansinghka  and  Thomas Breuel  about approaching AI with machine learning.  The general interest in taking a crack at AI with machine learning seems to be rising on many fronts including  DARPA .
 
As a matter of history, there was a great deal of interest in AI which died down before I began research.  There remain many projects and conferences spawned in this earlier AI wave, as well as a good bit of experience about what did not work, or at least did not work yet.  Here are a few examples of failure modes that people seem to run into:
  
  Supply/Product confusion .  Sometimes we think “Intelligences use X, so I’ll create X and have an Intelligence.”  An example of this is the  Cyc Project  which inspires some people as “intelligences use ontologies, so I’ll create an ontology and a system using it to have an Intelligence.”  The flaw here is that Intelligences  create  ontologies, which they use, and without the ability to create ont</p><p>4 0.14935979 <a title="295-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-08-Computability_in_Artificial_Intelligence.html">353 hunch net-2009-05-08-Computability in Artificial Intelligence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally I do not blog, but John kindly invited me to do so.  Since computability issues play a major role in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on that and raise some questions.
 
The general attitude is that AI is about finding efficient smart algorithms. For large parts of machine learning, the same attitude is not too dangerous. If you want to concentrate on conceptual problems, simply become a statistician. There is no analogous escape for modern research on AI (as opposed to  GOFAI  rooted in logic).

 
Let me show by analogy why  limiting research to computational questions is bad for any field. 
 
Except in computer science, computational aspects play little role in the development of  fundamental  theories: Consider e.g. set theory with axiom of choice, foundations of logic, exact/full minimax for zero-sum games, quantum (field) theory, string theory, … Indeed, at least in physics, every new fundamental theory seems to</p><p>5 0.1304425 <a title="295-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired. 
  
In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,  ATnT Research  and  Lucent  had one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the remainder of  Bell Labs , triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine learning group there.  As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.
 
There are a couple positives to the recession as well.

<p>Introduction: Do we have computer hardware sufficient for AI?  This question is difficult to answer, but here’s a try:
 
One way to achieve AI is by simulating a human brain.  A human brain has about 10 15  synapses which operate at about 10 2  per second implying about 10 17  bit ops per second.
 
A modern computer runs at 10 9  cycles/second and operates on 10 2  bits per cycle implying 10 11  bits processed per second.  
 
The gap here is only 6 orders of magnitude, which can be plausibly surpassed via cluster machines.  For example, the  BlueGene/L  operates 10 5  nodes (one order of magnitude short).  It’s peak recorded performance is about 0.5*10 15  FLOPS which translates to about 10 16  bit ops per second, which is nearly 10 17 .
 
There are many criticisms (both positive and negative) for this argument.
  
 Simulation of a human brain might require substantially more detail.  Perhaps an additional 10 2  is required per neuron. 
 We may not need to simulate a human brain to achieve AI.  Ther</p><p>6 0.65473235 <a title="295-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-02-02-Introspectionism_as_a_Disease.html">153 hunch net-2006-02-02-Introspectionism as a Disease</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Yaser  points out some nicely  videotaped machine learning lectures  at  Caltech .  Yaser taught me machine learning, and I always found the lectures clear and interesting, so I expect many people can benefit from watching.  Relative to  Andrew Ng â&euro;&tilde;s  ML class  there are somewhat different areas of emphasis but the topic is the same, so picking and choosing the union may be helpful.</p><p>2 0.88943213 <a title="295-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-04-02-Mad_%28Neuro%29science.html">168 hunch net-2006-04-02-Mad (Neuro)science</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the questions facing machine learning as a field is “Can we produce a generalized learning system that can solve a wide array of standard learning problems?”  The answer is trivial: “yes, just have children”.
 
Of course, that wasn’t really the question.  The refined question is “Are there simple-to-implement generalized learning systems that can solve a wide array of standard learning problems?”  The answer to this is less clear.  The ability of animals (and people ) to learn might be due to megabytes encoded in the DNA.  If this algorithmic complexity is  necessary  to solve machine learning, the field faces a daunting task in replicating it on a computer.
 
This observation suggests a possibility: if you can show that few bits of DNA are needed for learning in animals, then this provides evidence that machine learning (as a field) has a hope of big success with relatively little effort.

<p>Introduction: Some of the “sister conference” presentations at  AAAI  have been great.  Roughly speaking, the conference organizers asked other conference organizers to come give a summary of their conference.  Many different AI-related conferences accepted.  The presenters typically discuss some of the background and goals of the conference then mention the results from a few papers they liked.  This is great because it provides a mechanism to get a digested overview of the work of several thousand researchers—something which is simply available nowhere else.
 
Based on these presentations, it looks like there is a significant component of (and opportunity for) applied machine learning in  AIIDE ,  IUI , and  ACL .
 
There was also some discussion of having a super-colocation event similar to  FCRC , but centered on AI & Learning.  This seems like a fine idea.  The field is fractured across so many different conferences that the mixing of a supercolocation seems likely helpful for research.</p><p>same-blog 4 0.85926604 <a title="295-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-12-It_Doesn%26%238217%3Bt_Stop.html">295 hunch net-2008-04-12-It Doesn&#8217;t Stop</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve enjoyed the  Terminator  movies and show.  Neglecting the whacky aspects (time travel and associated paradoxes), there is an enduring topic of discussion: how do people deal with intelligent machines (and vice versa)?
 
In Terminator-land, the primary method for dealing with intelligent machines is to prevent them from being made.  This approach works pretty badly, because a new angle on building an intelligent machine keeps coming up.  This is partly a ploy for writer’s to avoid writing themselves out of a job, but there is a fundamental truth to it as well: preventing progress in research is hard.
 
The United States, has been experimenting with trying to stop research on  stem cells .  It hasn’t worked very well—the net effect has been retarding research programs a bit, and exporting some research to other countries.  Another less recent example was encryption technology, for which the United States generally did not encourage early public research and even  discouraged as a mu</p><p>5 0.84356385 <a title="295-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-04-JMLG.html">13 hunch net-2005-02-04-JMLG</a></p>

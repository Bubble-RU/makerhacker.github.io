are triannual now, betweenNIPS,AIStat, andICML. This has not always been the
case: the academic default is annual summer conferences, then NIPS started
with a December conference, and now AIStat has grown into an April
conference.However, the first claim is not quite correct. NIPS and AIStat have
few competing venues while ICML implicitly competes with many other
conferences accepting machine learning related papers. SinceJoelleand I are

<p>Introduction: Andrej Bauer has setup aMathematics and ComputationBlog. As a first step he
has tried to address the persistent and annoying problem of math on the web.
As a basic tool for precisely stating and transfering understanding of
technical subjects, mathematics is very necessary. Despite this necessity,
every mechanism for expressing mathematics on the web seems unnaturally
clumsy. Here are some of the methods and their drawbacks:MathMLThis was
supposed to be the answer, but it has two severe drawbacks: "Internet
Explorer" doesn't read it and the language is an example of push-XML-to-the-
limit which no one would ever consider writing in. (In contrast, html is easy
to write in.) It's also very annoying that math fonts must be installed
independent of the browser, even for mozilla based browsers.Create inline
images. This has several big drawbacks: font size is fixed for all viewers,
you can't cut & paste inside the images, and you can't hyperlink from (say)
symbol to definition.Math Worldis</p><p>6 0.12353697 <a title="305-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-08-27-NYAS_ML_2012_and_ICML_2013.html">472 hunch net-2012-08-27-NYAS ML 2012 and ICML 2013</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A big ouch--all the videos for ICML 2012 were lost in a shuffle. Rajnish sends
the below, but if anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated.
----------------------------------------------------Sincere apologies to ICML
community for loosing 2012 archived videosWhat happened: In order to publish
2013 videos, we decided to move 2012 videos to another server. We have a
weekly backup service from the provider but after removing the videos from the
current server, when we tried to retrieve the 2012 videos from backup service,
the backup did not work because of provider-specific requirements that we had
ignored while removing the data from previous server.What are we doing about
this: At this point, we are still looking into raw footage to find if we can
retrieve some of the videos, but following are the steps we are taking to make
sure this does not happen again in future:(1) We are going to create a channel
on Vimeo (and potentially on YouTube) and we will publish there the p-in-p-</p><p>5 0.48912376 <a title="305-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-10-ML_Symposium_and_ICML_details.html">447 hunch net-2011-10-10-ML Symposium and ICML details</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everyone should have received notice forNY ML Symposiumabstracts. Check
carefully, as one was lost by our system.The event itself is October 21, next
week.Leon Bottou,Stephen Boyd, andYoav Freundare giving the invited talks this
year, and there are many spotlights on local work spread throughout the
day.Chris Wigginshas setup 6(!) ML-interested startups to follow the
symposium, which should be of substantial interest to the employment
interested.I also wanted to give an update onICML 2012. Unlike last year, our
deadline is coordinated withAIStat(which is due this Friday). The paper
deadline for ICML has been pushed back to February 24 which should allow
significant time for finishing up papers after the winter break. Other details
may interest people as well:We settled on usingCMTafter checking out the
possibilities. I wasn't looking for this, because I've often found CMT clunky
in terms of easy access to the right information. Nevertheless, the breadth of

<p>Introduction: Joel Preddmentioned"Antilearning" byAdam Kowalczyk, which is interesting from
a foundational intuitions viewpoint.There is a pervasive intuition that
"nearby things tend to have the same label". This intuition is instantiated in
SVMs, nearest neighbor classifiers, decision trees, and neural networks. It
turns out there are natural problems where this intuition is opposite of the
truth.One natural situation where this occurs is in competition. For example,
whenIntelfails to meet its earnings estimate, is this evidence thatAMDis doing
badly also? Or evidence that AMD is doing well?This violation of the proximity
intuition means that when the number of examples is few,negatinga classifier
which attempts to exploit proximity can provide predictive power (thus, the
term "antilearning").</p><p>4 0.76505542 <a title="305-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-02-27-The_Stats_Handicap.html">290 hunch net-2008-02-27-The Stats Handicap</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Graduating students in Statistics appear to be at a substantial handicap
compared to graduating students in Machine Learning, despite being in
substantially overlapping subjects.The problem seems to be cultural.
Statistics comes from a mathematics background which emphasizes large
publications slowly published under review at journals. Machine Learning comes
from a Computer Science background which emphasizes quick publishing at
reviewed conferences. This has a number of implications:Graduating statistics
PhDs often have 0-2 publications while graduating machine learning PhDs might
have 5-15.Graduating ML students have had a chance for others to build on
their work. Stats students have had no such chance.Graduating ML students have
attended a number of conferences and presented their work, giving them a
chance to meet people. Stats students have had fewer chances of this sort.In
short, Stats students have had relatively few chances to distinguish
themselves and are heavily reliant on t</p><p>5 0.72666246 <a title="305-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-14-Interesting_Papers_at_COLT_2007.html">247 hunch net-2007-06-14-Interesting Papers at COLT 2007</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are two papers that seem particularly interesting at this year's
COLT.Gilles BlanchardandFranÃƒÂ§ois Fleuret,Occam's Hammer. When we are
interested in very tight bounds on the true error rate of a classifier, it is
tempting to use a PAC-Bayes bound which can (empirically) bequite tight. A
disadvantage of the PAC-Bayes bound is that it applies to a classifier which
is randomized over a set of base classifiers rather than a single classifier.
This paper shows that a similar bound can be proved which holds for a single
classifier drawn from the set. The ability to safely use a single classifier
is very nice. This technique applies generically to any base bound, so it has
other applications covered in the paper.Adam Tauman Kalai.Learning Nested
Halfspaces and Uphill Decision Trees. Classification PAC-learning, where you
prove that any problem amongst some set is polytime learnable with respect to
any distribution over the inputXis extraordinarily challenging as judged by

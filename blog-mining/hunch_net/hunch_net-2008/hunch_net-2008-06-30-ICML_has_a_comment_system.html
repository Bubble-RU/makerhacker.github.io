<p>Introduction: Andrej Bauer has setup a  Mathematics and Computation  Blog.  As a first step he has tried to address the persistent and annoying problem of math on the web.  As a basic tool for precisely stating and transfering understanding of technical subjects, mathematics is very necessary.  Despite this necessity, every mechanism for expressing mathematics on the web seems unnaturally clumsy.  Here are some of the methods and their drawbacks:
  
  MathML   This was supposed to be the answer, but it has two severe drawbacks: “Internet Explorer” doesn’t read it and the language is an example of push-XML-to-the-limit which no one would ever consider writing in.  (In contrast, html is easy to write in.)  It’s also very annoying that math fonts must be installed independent of the browser, even for mozilla based browsers. 
 Create inline images.  This has several big drawbacks: font size is fixed for all viewers, you can’t cut & paste inside the images, and you can’t hyperlink from (say) symbol to de</p><p>6 0.14594242 <a title="305-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-04-Why_ICML%3F_and_the_summer_conferences.html">452 hunch net-2012-01-04-Why ICML? and the summer conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alex Smola  showed me this  ICML 2006  webpage.  This is  NOT  the ICML we know, but rather some people at “Enformatika”.  Investigation shows that they registered with an anonymous yahoo email account from  dotregistrar.com  the “Home of the $6.79 wholesale domain!” and their nameservers are by  Turkticaret , a Turkish internet company.
 
It appears the website has since been altered to “ ICNL ” (the above link uses the google cache).
 
They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so the organizers of the real  ICML 2006  must feel quite flattered.</p><p>6 0.58421463 <a title="305-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-29-ICML_survey_and_comments.html">468 hunch net-2012-06-29-ICML survey and comments</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I just visited  ISI  where  Daniel Marcu  and others are working on machine translation.  Apparently, machine translation is rapidly improving.   A particularly dramatic year was 2002->2003 when systems switched from word-based translation to phrase-based translation.  From a (now famous) slide by Charles Wayne at  DARPA  (which funds much of the work on machine translation) here is some anecdotal evidence:

The big winner this year is Europe.   This is partly a coincidence, and partly due to the general internationalization of science over the last few years.  With  cuts to basic science  in the US and increased hassle for visitors, conferences outside the US become more attractive.   Europe and Australia/New Zealand are the immediate winners because they have the science, infrastructure, and english in place.  China and India are possible future winners.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.9201529 <a title="305-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-06-30-ICML_has_a_comment_system.html">305 hunch net-2008-06-30-ICML has a comment system</a></p>

This is an excellent chance for the ICML community to experiment with making ICML year-round, so I hope it works out.  Please do consider experimenting with it.</p><p>4 0.89587659 <a title="305-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-10-08-An_easy_proof_of_the_Chernoff-Hoeffding_bound.html">413 hunch net-2010-10-08-An easy proof of the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Textbooks invariably seem to carry the proof that uses Markov’s inequality, moment-generating functions, and Taylor approximations. Here’s an easier way.
 
For  , let   be the KL divergence between a coin of bias   and one of bias  :  
 
 Theorem:  Suppose you do   independent tosses of a coin of bias  . The probability of seeing   heads or more, for  , is at most  . So is the probability of seeing   heads or less, for  .
 
 Remark:  By Pinsker’s inequality,  .
 
 Proof  Let’s do the   case; the other is identical.
 
Let   be the distribution over   induced by a coin of bias  , and likewise   for a coin of bias  . Let   be the set of all sequences of   tosses which contain   heads or more. We’d like to show that   is unlikely under  .
 
Pick any  , with say   heads. Then: 
 
 
Since   for every  , we have   and we’re done.</p><p>5 0.78935575 <a title="305-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-23-Interesting_papers_at_ACL.html">97 hunch net-2005-07-23-Interesting papers at ACL</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A  recent discussion  indicated that one goal of this blog might be to allow people to post comments about recent papers that they liked.  I think this could potentially be very useful, especially for those with diverse interests but only finite time to read through conference proceedings.   ACL 2005  recently completed, and here are four papers from that conference that I thought were either good or perhaps of interest to a machine learning audience.
 
David Chiang,   A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation  . (Best paper award.) This paper takes the standard phrase-based MT model that is popular in our field (basically, translate a sentence by individually translating phrases and reordering them according to a complicated statistical model) and extends it to take into account hierarchy in phrases, so that you can learn things like “X ‘s Y” -> “Y de X” in chinese, where X and Y are arbitrary phrases. This takes a step toward linguistic syntax for MT, whic</p><p>6 0.77791142 <a title="305-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-20-At_One_Month.html">25 hunch net-2005-02-20-At One Month</a></p>

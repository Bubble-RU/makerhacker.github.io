<p>Introduction: One thing which is clear on a little reflection is that there exists a single
master learning problem capable of encoding essentially all learning problems.
This problem is of course a very general sort of reinforcement learning where
the world interacts with an agent as:The world announces an observationx.The
agent makes a choicea.The world announces a rewardr.The goal here is to
maximize the sum of the rewards over the time of the agent. No particular
structure relatingxtoaoratoris implied by this setting so we do not know
effective general algorithms for the agent. It's very easy to prove lower
bounds showing that an agent cannot hope to succeed here--just consider the
case where actions are unrelated to rewards. Nevertheless, there is a real
sense in which essentially all forms of life are agents operating in this
setting, somehow succeeding. The gap between these observations drives
research--How can we find tractable specializations of the master problem
general enough to provide</p><p>3 0.24843273 <a title="317-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-24-Contextual_Bandits.html">269 hunch net-2007-10-24-Contextual Bandits</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the fundamental underpinnings of the internet is advertising based
content. This has become much more effective due to targeted advertising where
ads are specifically matched to interests. Everyone is familiar with this,
because everyone uses search engines and all search engines try to make money
this way.The problem of matching ads to interests is a natural machine
learning problem in some ways since there is much information in who clicks on
what. A fundamental problem with this information is that it is not supervised
--in particular a click-or-not on one ad doesn't generally tell you if a
different ad would have been clicked on. This implies we have a fundamental
exploration problem.A standard mathematical setting for this situation is
"k-Armed Bandits", often with various relevant embellishments. Thek-Armed
Bandit setting works on a round-by-round basis. On each round:A policy chooses
armafrom1ofkarms (i.e. 1 of k ads).The world reveals the rewardraof the chosen
arm (i.e.</p><p>4 0.19790041 <a title="317-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-03-26-A_Variance_only_Deviation_Bound.html">392 hunch net-2010-03-26-A Variance only Deviation Bound</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At thePAC-Bayesworkshop earlier this week,Olivier Catonidescribed a result
that I hadn't believed was possible:a deviation bound dependingonlyon the
variance of a random variable.For people not familiar with deviation bounds,
this may be hard to appreciate. Deviation bounds, are one of the core
components for the foundations of machine learning theory, so developments
here have a potential to alter our understanding of how to learn and what is
learnable. My understanding is that the basic proof techniques started
withBernsteinand have evolved into several variants specialized for various
applications. All of the variants I knew had a dependence on the range, with
some also having a dependence on the variance of an IID or martingale random
variable. This one is the first I know of with a dependence on only the
variance.The basic idea is to use a biased estimator of the mean which is not
influenced much by outliers. Then, a deviation bound can be proved by using

<p>Introduction: There weretwopapersat ICML presenting learning algorithms for acontextual
bandit-style setting, where the loss for all labels is not known, but the loss
for one label is known. (The first might require aexploration
scavengingviewpoint to understand if the experimental assignment was
nonrandom.) I strongly approve of these papers and further work in this
setting and its variants, because I expect it to become more important than
supervised learning. As a quick review, we are thinking about situations where
repeatedly:The world reveals feature values (aka context information).A policy
chooses an action.The world provides a reward.Sometimes this is done in an
online fashion where the policy can change based on immediate feedback and
sometimes it's done in a batch setting where many samples are collected before
the policy can change. If you haven't spent time thinking about the setting,
you might want to because there are many natural applications.I'm going to
pick on the Banditron paper (</p><p>6 0.17888722 <a title="317-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-06-13-The_Good_News_on_Exploration_and_Learning.html">400 hunch net-2010-06-13-The Good News on Exploration and Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Consider the contextual bandit setting where, repeatedly:A contextxis
observed.An actionais taken given the contextx.A rewardris observed, dependent
onxanda.Where the goal of a learning agent is to find a policy for step 2
achieving a large expected reward.This setting is of obvious importance,
because in the real world we typically make decisions based on some set of
information and then get feedback only about the single action taken. It also
fundamentally differs from supervised learning settings because knowing the
value of one action is not equivalent to knowing the value of all actions.A
decade ago the best machine learning techniques for this setting where
implausibly inefficient.Dean Fosteronce told me he thought the area was a
research sinkhole with little progress to be expected. Now we are on the verge
of being able to routinely attack these problems, in almost exactly the same
sense that we routinely attack bread and butter supervised learning problems.

<p>Introduction: We'd like to invite hunch.net readers to participate in the NIPS 2008 workshop
on kernel learning. While the main focus is on automatically learning kernels
from data, we are also also looking at the broader questions of feature
selection, multi-task learning and multi-view learning. There are no
restrictions on the learning problem being addressed (regression,
classification, etc), and both theoretical and applied work will be
considered. The deadline for submissions isOctober 24.More detail can be
foundhere.Corinna Cortes, Arthur Gretton, Gert Lanckriet, Mehryar Mohri,

<p>Introduction: This post is about contextual bandit problems where, repeatedly:The world
chooses featuresxand rewards for each actionr1,â&euro;Ś,rkthen announces the
featuresx(but not the rewards).A policy chooses an actiona.The world announces
the rewardraThe goal in these situations is to learn a policy which
maximizesrain expectation efficiently. I'm thinking about all situations which
fit the above setting, whether they are drawn IID or adversarially from round
to round and whether they involve past logged data or rapidly learning via
interaction.One common drawback of all algorithms for solving this setting, is
that they have a poor dependence on the number of actions. For example ifkis
the number of actions,EXP4 (page 66)has a dependence onk0.5,epoch-greedy(and
the simpler epsilon greedy) have a dependence onk1/3, and theoffset treehas a
dependence onk-1. These results aren't directly comparable because different
things are being analyzed. The fact thatallanalyses have poor dependence onkis

<p>Introduction: I just createdversion 5.1ofvowpal wabbit. This almost entirely a bugfix
release, so it's an easy upgrade from v5.0.In addition:There is now amailing
list, which I and several other developers are subscribed to.The main website
has shifted to the wiki on github. This means that anyone with a github
account can now edit it.I'm planning to give a tutorial tomorrow on it

interested.The status of VW amongst other open source projects has changed.
When VW first came out, it was relatively unique amongst existing projects in
terms of features. At this point, many other projects have started to
appreciate the value of the design choices here. This includes:Mahout, which
now has an SGD implementation.Shogun, whereSoerenis keen onincorporating
features.LibLinear, where they won the KDD best paper award forout-of-core
learning.This is expected--any open source approach which works well should be
widely adopted. None of these othe</p><p>4 0.86517763 <a title="317-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-30-Concerns_about_the_Large_Scale_Learning_Challenge.html">300 hunch net-2008-04-30-Concerns about the Large Scale Learning Challenge</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thelarge scale learning challengefor ICML interests me a great deal, although
I have concerns about the way it is structured.From theinstructions page,
several issues come up:Large DefinitionMy personal definition of dataset size
is:smallA dataset is small if a human could look at the dataset and plausibly
find a good solution.mediumA dataset is mediumsize if it fits in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.largeA large dataset does not fit in the RAM of a
reasonably priced computer.By this definition, all of the datasets are medium
sized. This might sound like a pissing match over dataset size, but I believe
it is more than that.The fundamental reason for these definitions is that they
correspond to transitions in the sorts of approaches which are feasible. From
small to medium, the ability to use a human as the learning algorithm
degrades. From medium to large, it becomes essential to have learning
algorithms that don't require random access to examples.No Loading TimeThe

<p>Introduction: I second thecall for workshops at ICML/COLT/UAI.Severaltimesbefore, details of
why and how to run a workshop have been mentioned.There is a simple reason to
prefer workshops here: attendance. The Helsinki colocation has placed
workshopsdirectly between ICML and COLT/UAI, which is optimal for getting
attendees from any conference. In addition,last year ICML had relatively few
workshopsand NIPS workshops were overloaded. In addition tothose that
happeneda similar number were rejected. The overload has strange consequences
--for example,the best attended workshopwasn't an official NIPS workshop.
Aside from intrinsic interest, the Deep Learning workshop benefited greatly
from being off schedule.</p><p>6 0.82800192 <a title="317-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-01-24-The_Humanloop_Spectrum_of_Machine_Learning.html">3 hunch net-2005-01-24-The Humanloop Spectrum of Machine Learning</a></p>

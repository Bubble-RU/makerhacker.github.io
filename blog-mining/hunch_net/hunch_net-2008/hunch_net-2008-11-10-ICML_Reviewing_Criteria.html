approach toreviewing at ICMLthis year. I'll be one of the area chairs, so I

<p>Introduction: Normally, I don't indulge in posters forICML, but this year is naturally an
exception for me. If you want one, there are a small numberleft here, if you
sign up before February.It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the
scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting
papers. At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which
informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers. Program chairs setup
the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the
reviewing process. Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because
a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the
community determine the conference. Nevertheless, as a program chair this year
it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to
encourage (and occasionally discourage).At the highest level, I believe ICML
exists to further research into machine learning, which I generally think of

<p>Introduction: Bob Williamsonand I are the learning theory PC members atNIPSthis year. This
is some attempt to state the standards and tests I applied to the papers. I
think it is a good idea to talk about this for two reasons:Making community
standards a matter of public record seems healthy. It give us a chance to
debate what is and is not the right standard. It might even give us a bit more
consistency across the years.It may save us all time. There are a number of
papers submitted which just aren't there yet. Avoiding submitting is the right
decision in this case.There are several criteria for judging a paper. All of
these were active this year. Some criteria are uncontroversial while others
may be so.The paper must have a theorem establishing something new for which
it is possible to derive high confidence in the correctness of the results. A
surprising number of papers fail this test. This criteria seems essential to
the definition of "theory".Missing theorem statementMissing proofThis isn't an</p><p>4 0.15748726 <a title="325-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>5 0.1528184 <a title="325-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-02-16-The_Forgetting.html">233 hunch net-2007-02-16-The Forgetting</a></p>
<p>Introduction: How many papers do you remember from 2006? 2005? 2002? 1997? 1987? 1967? One
way to judge this would be to look at the citations of the papers you write--
how many came from which year? For myself, the answers on recent papers
are:year200620052002199719871967count4105100This spectrum is fairly typical of
papers in general. There are many reasons that citations are focused on recent
papers.The number of papers being published continues to grow. This is not a
very significant effect, because the rate of publication has not grown nearly
as fast.Dead men don't reject your papers for not citing them. This reason
seems lame, because it's a distortion from the ideal of science. Nevertheless,
it must be stated because the effect can be significant.In 1997, I started as
a PhD student. Naturally, papers after 1997 are better remembered because they
were absorbed in real time. A large fraction of people writing papers and
attending conferences haven't been doing it for 10 years.Old papers aren't</p><p>6 0.14058621 <a title="325-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-18-ICML_%26%23038%3B_COLT_2010.html">403 hunch net-2010-07-18-ICML &#038; COLT 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: It's reviewing season right now, so I thought I would list (at a high level)
the sorts of problems which I see in papers. Hopefully, this will help us all
write better papers.The following flaws are fatal to any paper:Incorrect
theorem or lemma statementsA typo might be "ok", if it can be understood. Any
theorem or lemma which indicates an incorrect understanding of reality must be
rejected. Not doing so would severely harm the integrity of the conference. A
paper rejected for this reason must be fixed.Lack of UnderstandingIf a paper
is understood by none of the (typically 3) reviewers then it must be rejected
for the same reason. This is more controversial than it sounds because there
are some people who maximize paper complexity in the hope of impressing the
reviewer. The tactic sometimes succeeds with some reviewers (but not with
me).As a reviewer, I sometimes get lost for stupid reasons. This is why an
anonymizedcommunication channelwith the author can be very helpful.Bad

<p>Introduction: One of the confusing things about research is that progress is very hard to
measure. One of the consequences of being in a hard-to-measure environment is
that the wrong things are often measured.Lines of CodeThe classical example of
this phenomenon is the old lines-of-code-produced metric for programming. It
is easy to imagine systems for producing many lines of code with very little
work that accomplish very little.Paper countIn academia, a "paper count" is an
analog of "lines of code", and it suffers from the same failure modes. The
obvious failure mode here is that we end up with a large number of
uninteresting papers since people end up spending a lot of time optimizing
this metric.ComplexityAnother metric, is "complexity" (in the eye of a
reviewer) of a paper. There is a common temptation to make a method appear
more complex than it is in order for reviewers to judge it worthy of
publication. The failure mode here is unclean thinking. Simple effective
methods are often overlooked</p><p>6 0.66044396 <a title="325-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-26-The_SODA_Program_Committee.html">318 hunch net-2008-09-26-The SODA Program Committee</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One of the subsidiary roles of conferences is recruitment.NIPSis optimally
placed in time for this because it falls right before the major recruitment
season.I personally found job hunting embarrassing, and was relatively inept
at it. I expect this is true of many people, because it is not something done
often.The basic rule is: make the plausible hirers aware of your interest.
Anycorporate sponsoris a "plausible", regardless of whether or not there is a
booth.CRAand theacm job centerare other reasonable sources.There are
substantial differences between the different possibilities. Putting some
effort into understanding the distinctions is a good idea, although you should
always remember where the other person is coming from.</p><p>2 0.94298363 <a title="325-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-07-17-MUCMD_and_BayLearn.html">470 hunch net-2012-07-17-MUCMD and BayLearn</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Michael LittmanandLeon Bottouhave decided to use a franchise program chair
approach toreviewing at ICMLthis year. I'll be one of the area chairs, so I
wanted to mention a few things if you are thinking about naming me.I take
reviewing seriously. That means papers to be reviewed are read, the
implications are considered, and decisions are only made after that. I do my
best to be fair, and there are zero subjects that I consider categorical
rejects. I don't consider severalarguments for rejection-not-on-the-merits
reasonable.I am generally interested in papers that (a) analyze new models of
machine learning, (b) provide new algorithms, and (c) show that they work
empirically on plausibly real problems. If a paper has the trifecta, I'm
particularly interested. With 2 out of 3, I might be interested. I often find
papers with only one element harder to accept, including papers with just
(a).I'm a bit tough. I rarely jump-up-and-down about a paper, because I
believe that great progress is ra</p><p>4 0.82819253 <a title="325-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-30-ICML_Posters_and_Scope.html">454 hunch net-2012-01-30-ICML Posters and Scope</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally, I don't indulge in posters forICML, but this year is naturally an
exception for me. If you want one, there are a small numberleft here, if you
sign up before February.It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the
scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting
papers. At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which
informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers. Program chairs setup
the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the
reviewing process. Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because
a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the
community determine the conference. Nevertheless, as a program chair this year
it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to
encourage (and occasionally discourage).At the highest level, I believe ICML
exists to further research into machine learning, which I generally think of

<p>Introduction: In the quest to understand what good reviewing is, perhaps it's worthwhile to
think about what good research is. One way to think about good research is in
terms of a producer/consumer model.In the producer/consumer model of research,
for any element of research there are producers (authors and coauthors of
papers, for example) and consumers (people who use the papers to make new
papers or code solving problems). An produced bit of research is judged as
"good" if it is used by many consumers. There are two basic questions which
immediately arise:Is this a good model of research?Are there alternatives?The
producer/consumer model has some difficulties which can be (partially)
addressed.Disconnect.A group of people doing research on some subject may
become disconnected from the rest of the world. Each person uses the research
of other people in the group so it appears good research is being done, but
the group has no impact on the rest of the world. One way to detect this is by

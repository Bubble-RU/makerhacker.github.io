<p>Introduction: After amajor financial crisis, there is much discussion about howfinance has
become a casinogambling with other's money, keeping the winnings, and walking
away when the money is lost.When thinking about financial reform, all the many
losers in the above scenario are apt to take the view that this activity
should be completely, or nearly completely curtailed. But, a more thoughtful
view is that sometimes there is a real sense in which there are right and
wrong decisions, and we as a society would really prefer that the people most
likely to make right decisions are making them. A crucial question then is:
"What is the difference between gambling and rewarding good
prediction?"Wediscussed this before the financial crisis. The cheat-sheet
sketch is that the online learning against an adversary problem, algorithm,
and theorems, provide a good mathematical model for thinking about this
question. What I would like to do here is map this onto various types of
financial transactions. The basic</p><p>3 0.1468453 <a title="282-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research
has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States. I
know of two notable negative impacts:It's quite difficult to get a job this
year, as many companies and universities simply aren't hiring. This is
particularly tough on graduating students.Perhaps 10% ofIBM researchwas
fired.In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,ATnT
ResearchandLucenthad one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the
remainder ofBell Labs, triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine
learning group there. As the recession progresses, we may easily see more
firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer
support research.There are a couple positives to the recession as well.Both
the implosion of Wall Street (which siphoned off smart people) and the general
difficulty of getting a job coming out of an undergraduate education suggest
that the quality of admitted phd</p><p>4 0.14521147 <a title="282-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-14-The_Predictionist_Viewpoint.html">112 hunch net-2005-09-14-The Predictionist Viewpoint</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Virtually every discipline of significant human endeavor has a way explaining
itself as fundamental and important. In all the cases I know of, they are both
right (they are vital) and wrong (they are not solely vital).Politics. This is
the one that everyone is familiar with at the moment. "What could be more
important than the process of making decisions?"Science and Technology. This
is the one that we-the-academics are familiar with. "The loss of modern
science and technology would be catastrophic."Military. "Without the military,
a nation will be invaded and destroyed."(insert your favorite here)Within
science and technology, the same thing happens again.Mathematics. "What could
be more important than a precise language for establishing truths?"Physics.

<p>Introduction: I found the article on "Political Science" at theNew York Timesinteresting.
Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been
systematically distorting scientific views. With apetitionby some7000+
scientistsalleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.One
thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are
fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the
world. In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued. This value is
achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms. One example of a formal
mechanism is peer review.In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value
is agreement. It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be
passed or other actions can be taken. Since Science (with a capitol 'S') has
accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.
This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mechanism for
pushing agreement</p><p>6 0.13568729 <a title="282-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-01-Basic_computer_science_research_takes_a_hit.html">50 hunch net-2005-04-01-Basic computer science research takes a hit</a></p>

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and
then trying to figure out how to get there.A big part of science fiction is
imagining how things could be different, and then working through the
implications.Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can
sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research. (And, hey, it's
fun.) Here's some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem
particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning
systems:Vernor Vinge, "True Names", "A Fire Upon the Deep"Marc Stiegler,
"David's Sling", "Earthweb"Charles Stross, "Singularity Sky"Greg Egan,
"Diaspora"Joe Haldeman, "Forever Peace"(There are surely many
others.)Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.
Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans
control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series). That didn't really happen in the
last 50 years. Instead, we gradually refined the degree to whi</p><p>5 0.68825221 <a title="282-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-04-01-Basic_computer_science_research_takes_a_hit.html">50 hunch net-2005-04-01-Basic computer science research takes a hit</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The New York Times has an interestingarticleabout how DARPA has dropped
funding for computer science to universities by about a factor of 2 over the
last 5 years and become less directed towards basic research. Partially in
response, the number of grant submissions to NSF has grown by a factor of 3
(with the NSF budget staying approximately constant in the interim).This is
the sort of policy decision which may make sense for the defense department,
but which means a large hit for basic research on information technology
development in the US. For example "darpa funded the invention of the
internet" is reasonably correct. This policy decision is particularly painful
in the context of NSF budget cuts and the end of extensive phone monopoly
funded research at Bell labs.The good news from a learning perspective is that
(based on anecdotal evidence) much of the remaining funding is aimed at
learning and learning-related fields. Methods of making good automated
predictions obviously have a l</p><p>6 0.65113932 <a title="282-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-05-02-What%26%238217%3Bs_the_difference_between_gambling_and_rewarding_good_prediction%3F.html">397 hunch net-2010-05-02-What&#8217;s the difference between gambling and rewarding good prediction?</a></p>

the part about 'blogophobia', which in my experience is often a substantial
issue: many potential guest posters aren't quite ready, because of the fear of
a permanent public mistake, because it is particularly hard to write about the
unknown (the essence of research), and because the system for public credit
doesn't yet really handle blog posts.So far, science has been relatively
resistant to discussing research on blogs. Some things need to change to get
there. Public tolerance of the occasional mistake is essential, as is a
willingness to cite (and credit) blogs as freely as papers.I've often run into
another reason for holding back myself: I don't want to overtalk my own
research. Nevertheless, I'm slowly changing to the opinion that I'm holding
back too much: the real power of a blog in research is that it can be used to
confer with many people, and that just makes research work better.</p><p>2 0.90506923 <a title="282-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-08-20-The_Workshop_on_Cores%2C_Clusters%2C_and_Clouds.html">404 hunch net-2010-08-20-The Workshop on Cores, Clusters, and Clouds</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alekh,John,Ofer, and I are organizing aworkshopatNIPSthis year on learning in
parallel and distributed environments. The general interest level in parallel
learning seems to be growing rapidly, so I expect quite a bit of attendance.
Please join us if you are parallel-interested.And, if you are working in the
area of parallel learning, please considersubmitting an abstractdue Oct. 17
for presentation at the workshop.</p><p>same-blog 3 0.82249892 <a title="282-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-06-Research_Political_Issues.html">282 hunch net-2008-01-06-Research Political Issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest. The
problem with discussing politics is that it's customary for people to say much
based upon little information. Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial
impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa). It's primary
election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the
issues are not.There are several policy decisions which substantially effect
development of science and technology in the US.EducationThe US has great
contrasts in education. The top universities are very good places, yet the
grade school education system produces mediocre results. For me, the contrast
between apublic educationandCaltechwas bracing. For many others attending
Caltech, it clearly was not. Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is
a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about. My own
experience is that a basic attitude of "no child unrealized" is better than
"no child lef</p><p>4 0.80429226 <a title="282-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-26-Another_10-year_paper_in_Machine_Learning.html">368 hunch net-2009-08-26-Another 10-year paper in Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When I was thinking about the best "10 year paper" forICML, I also took a look
at a few other conferences. Here is one from 10 years ago that interested
me:David McAllesterPAC-Bayesian Model Averaging,COLT1999.2001 Journal
Draft.Prior to this paper, the only mechanism known for controlling or
estimating the necessary sample complexity for learning over continuously
parameterized predictors was VC theory and variants, all of which suffered
from a basic problem: they were incredibly pessimistic in practice. This meant
that only very gross guidance could be provided for learning algorithm design.
The PAC-Bayes bound provided an alternative approach to sample complexity
bounds which was radically tighter, quantitatively. It also imported and
explained many of the motivations for Bayesian learning in a way that learning
theory and perhaps optimization people might appreciate. Since this paper came
out, there have been a number of moderately successful attempts to drive
algorithms directly b</p><p>5 0.77640736 <a title="282-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-18-ICML_%26%23038%3B_COLT_2010.html">403 hunch net-2010-07-18-ICML &#038; COLT 2010</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The papers which interested me most atICMLandCOLT2010 were:Thomas

Apprenticeship Learning across Hypothesis Classes. This paper formalizes and
provides algorithms with guarantees for mixed-mode apprenticeship and
traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, allowing RL algorithms that
perform better than for either setting alone.István SzitaandCsaba

algorithm for Reinforcement Learning in a Markov Decision Process.James
MartensDeep learning via Hessian-free optimization. About a new not-quite-
online second order gradient algorithm for learning deep functional
structures. Potentially this is very powerful because while people have often
talked about end-to-end learning, it has rarely worked in practice.Chrisoph

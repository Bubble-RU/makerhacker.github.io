<p>Introduction: After a  major financial crisis , there is much discussion about how  finance has become a casino  gambling with other’s money, keeping the winnings, and walking away when the money is lost.  
 
When thinking about financial reform, all the many losers in the above scenario are apt to take the view that this activity should be completely, or nearly completely curtailed.  But, a more thoughtful view is that sometimes there is a real sense in which there are right and wrong decisions, and we as a society would really prefer that the people most likely to make right decisions are making them.  A crucial question then is: “What is the  difference between gambling and rewarding good prediction?”
 
We  discussed this before the financial crisis . The cheat-sheet sketch is that the online learning against an adversary problem, algorithm, and theorems, provide a good mathematical model for thinking about this question.  What I would like to do here is map this onto various types of financial t</p><p>3 0.14204973 <a title="282-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-22-Effective_Research_Funding.html">344 hunch net-2009-02-22-Effective Research Funding</a></p>
<p>Introduction: With a worldwide recession on, my impression is that the carnage in research has not been as severe as might be feared, at least in the United States.  I know of two notable negative impacts: 
  
 It’s quite difficult to get a job this year, as many companies and universities simply aren’t hiring.  This is particularly tough on graduating students. 
 Perhaps 10% of  IBM research  was fired. 
  
In contrast, around the time of the dot com bust,  ATnT Research  and  Lucent  had one or several 50% size firings wiping out much of the remainder of  Bell Labs , triggering a notable diaspora for the respected machine learning group there.  As the recession progresses, we may easily see more firings as companies in particular reach a point where they can no longer support research.
 
There are a couple positives to the recession as well.

<p>Introduction: The announcement of an increase in funding for basic research in the US is encouraging.   There is some discussion of this at the  Computing Research Policy  blog.  
 
One part of this discussion has a graph of NSF funding over time, presumably in dollar budgets.  I donâ&euro;&trade;t believe that dollar budgets are the right way to judge the impact of funding changes on researchers.  A better way to judge seems to be in terms of dollar budget divided by GDP which provides a measure of the relative emphasis on research.
 
  
 
This graph was assembled by dividing the  NSF budget  by the  US GDP .  For 2005 GDP, I used the  current estimate  and for 2006 and 2007 assumed an increase by a factor of 1.04 per year.  The 2007 number also uses the requested 2007 budget which is certain to change.
 
This graph makes it clear why researchers were upset: research funding emphasis has fallen for 3 years in a row.  The reality has been significantly more severe due to  DARPA decreasing funding  and industrial</p><p>5 0.13363545 <a title="282-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-14-The_Predictionist_Viewpoint.html">112 hunch net-2005-09-14-The Predictionist Viewpoint</a></p>

 Politics.  This is the one that everyone is familiar with at the moment.  “What could be more important than the process of making decisions?”

<p>Introduction: I found the article on “ Political Science ” at the  New York Times  interesting.  Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been systematically distorting scientific views.   With a  petition  by some  7000+ scientists  alleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.
 
One thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the world.  In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued.  This value is achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms.  One example of a formal mechanism is peer review.
 
In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value is agreement.  It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be passed or other actions can be taken.  Since Science (with a capitol ‘S’) has accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is imagining how things could be different, and then trying to figure out how to get there.  
 
A big part of science fiction is imagining how things could be different, and then working through the implications.  
 
Because of the similarity here, reading science fiction can sometimes be helpful in understanding and doing research.  (And, hey, it’s fun.)  Here’s some list of science fiction books I enjoyed which seem particularly relevant to computer science and (sometimes) learning systems:
  
 Vernor Vinge, “True Names”, “A Fire Upon the Deep” 
 Marc Stiegler, “David’s Sling”, “Earthweb” 
 Charles Stross, “Singularity Sky” 
 Greg Egan, “Diaspora” 
 Joe Haldeman, “Forever Peace” 
  
(There are surely many others.)  
 
Incidentally, the nature of science fiction itself has changed.  Decades ago, science fiction projected great increases in the power humans control (example: E.E. Smith Lensman series).  That didn’t really happen in the last 50 years.

<p>Introduction: The New York Times has an interesting  article  about how DARPA has dropped funding for computer science to universities by about a factor of 2 over the last 5 years and become less directed towards basic research.  Partially in response, the number of grant submissions to NSF has grown by a factor of 3 (with the NSF budget staying approximately constant in the interim).
 
This is the sort of policy decision which may make sense for the defense department, but which means a large hit for basic research on information technology development in the US.  For example “darpa funded the invention of the internet” is reasonably correct.  This policy decision is particularly painful in the context of NSF budget cuts and the end of extensive phone monopoly funded research at Bell labs. 
 
The good news from a learning perspective is that (based on anecdotal evidence) much of the remaining funding is aimed at learning and learning-related fields.

<p>Introduction: I’m visiting Beijing for the  Pao-Lu Hsu Statistics Conference  on Machine Learning.
 
I had several discussions about the state of Chinese research.  Given the large population and economy, you might expect substantial research—more than has been observed at international conferences.  The fundamental problem seems to be the  Cultural Revolution  which  lobotimized higher education, and the research associated with it.  There has been a process of slow recovery since then, which has begun to be felt in the research world via increased participation in international conferences and (now) conferences in China.
 
The amount of effort going into construction in Beijing is very impressive—people are literally building a skyscraper at night outside the window of the hotel I’m staying at (and this is not unusual).  If a small fraction of this effort is later focused onto supporting research, the effect could be very substantial.  General growth in China’s research portfolio should be expecte</p><p>2 0.86975455 <a title="282-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-04-30-COLT_2007.html">242 hunch net-2007-04-30-COLT 2007</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Registration for COLT 2007 is now open.
 
The conference will take place on 13-15 June, 2007, in San Diego, California, as part of the 2007 Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC), which includes STOC, Complexity, and EC.
 
The website for COLT: http://www.learningtheory.org/colt2007/index.html
 
The early registration deadline is May 11, and the cutoff date for discounted hotel rates is May 9.
 
Before registering, take note that the fees are substantially lower for members of ACM and/or SIGACT than for nonmembers. If youâ&euro;&trade;ve been contemplating joining either of these two societies (annual dues: $99 for ACM, $18 for SIGACT), now would be a good time!</p><p>same-blog 3 0.85956854 <a title="282-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-06-Research_Political_Issues.html">282 hunch net-2008-01-06-Research Political Issues</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’ve avoided discussing politics here, although not for lack of interest.  The problem with discussing politics is that it’s customary for people to say much based upon little information.  Nevertheless, politics can have a substantial impact on science (and we might hope for the vice-versa).  It’s primary election time in the United States, so the topic is timely, although the issues are not.
 
There are several policy decisions which substantially effect development of science and technology in the US.
  
  Education  The US has great contrasts in education.  The top universities are very good places, yet the grade school education system produces mediocre results.  For me, the contrast between a  public education  and  Caltech  was bracing.  For many others attending Caltech, it clearly was not.  Upgrading the k-12 education system in the US is a long-standing chronic problem which I know relatively little about.  My own experience is that a basic attitude of “no child unrealized” i</p><p>4 0.85580677 <a title="282-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-29-The_Benefits_of_Double-Blind_Review.html">485 hunch net-2013-06-29-The Benefits of Double-Blind Review</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is a (near) transcript of a talk that I gave at the  ICML 2013 Workshop on Peer Review and Publishing Models . Although there’s a  PDF available on my website , I’ve chosen to post a slightly modified version here as well in order to better facilitate discussion.
 
 Disclaimers and Context 
 
I want to start with a couple of disclaimers and some context.
 
First, I want to point out that although I’ve read a lot about double-blind review, this isn’t my research area and the research discussed in this post is not my own. As a result, I probably can’t answer super detailed questions about these studies.
 
I also want to note that I’m not opposed to open peer review — I was a free and open source software developer for over ten years and I care a great deal about openness and transparency. Rather, my motivation in writing this post is simply to create awareness of and to initiate discussion about the benefits of double-blind review.
 
Lastly, and most importantly, I think it’s e</p><p>5 0.75435686 <a title="282-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-18-What_it_means_to_do_research..html">22 hunch net-2005-02-18-What it means to do research.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point of view of an undergraduate.  The shift from a class-taking mentality to a research mentality is very significant and not easy.  
  
  Problem Posing  Posing the right problem is often as important as solving them.  Many people can get by in research by solving problems others have posed, but that’s not sufficient for really inspiring research.  For learning in particular, there is a strong feeling that we just haven’t figured out which questions are the right ones to ask.  You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem convincing. 
  Gambling your life  When you do research, you think very hard about new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions.  Many conversations are of the form “I wonder what would happen if…” These processes can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours.  The worst part is that you’ll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and some</p><p>6 0.72710836 <a title="282-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-07-04-The_Health_of_COLT.html">89 hunch net-2005-07-04-The Health of COLT</a></p>

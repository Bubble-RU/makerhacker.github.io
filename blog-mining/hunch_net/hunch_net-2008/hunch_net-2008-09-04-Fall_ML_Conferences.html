<p>Introduction: has  died .   He lived a full life.  I know him personally as a founder of the  Center for Computational Learning Systems  and the  New York Machine Learning Symposium , both of which have sheltered and promoted the advancement of machine learning.  I expect much of the New York area machine learning community will miss him, as well as many others around the world.</p><p>3 0.1877033 <a title="316-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-09-17-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">410 hunch net-2010-09-17-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is another  machine learning meetup  where I’ll be speaking.  Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as “the future of machine learning”.  In particular, it’s all about how to learn in an interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation, etc…
 
On Sept 24, abstracts for the  New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it’s a great way to have a conversation with other people.
 
On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually happens.  This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more time for posters.  In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:  David Blei ,  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Tommi Jaakkola , and  Yann LeCun .  After the meeting, a late  hackNY  related event is planned where students and startups can meet.
 
I’d also like to point out the related  CS/Econ symposium  as I have interests there as well.</p><p>4 0.16080488 <a title="316-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-08-27-NYAS_ML_2012_and_ICML_2013.html">472 hunch net-2012-08-27-NYAS ML 2012 and ICML 2013</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  New York Machine Learning Symposium  is October 19 with a 2 page abstract deadline due September 13 via email with subject “Machine Learning Poster Submission” sent to physicalscience@nyas.org.  Everyone is welcome to submit.  Last year’s attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.
 
The primary experiment for  ICML 2013  is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling review cycles.  The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15.  This is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and reduce peak load.   The “not for proceedings” experiment from this year’s ICML is not continuing.
 
Edit: Fixed second ICML deadline.</p><p>5 0.14260247 <a title="316-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-27-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">369 hunch net-2009-08-27-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Several events are happening in the NY area.
  
  Barriers in Computational Learning Theory Workshop, Aug 28.   That’s tomorrow near Princeton.  I’m looking forward to speaking at this one on “Getting around Barriers in Learning Theory”, but several other talks are of interest, particularly to the CS theory inclined. 
  Claudia Perlich  is running the  INFORMS Data Mining Contest  with a deadline of Sept. 25. This is a contest using real health record data (they partnered with  HealthCare Intelligence ) to predict transfers and mortality. In the current US health care reform debate, the case studies of high costs we hear strongly suggest machine learning & statistics can save many billions. 
  The Singularity Summit October 3&4 .  This is for the AIists out there.  Several of the talks look interesting, although unfortunately I’ll miss it for  ALT . 
  Predictive Analytics World, Oct 20-21 .  This is stretching the definition of “New York Area” a bit, but the train to DC is reasonable.</p><p>6 0.13468732 <a title="316-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-09-03-Fall_Machine_Learning_Events.html">443 hunch net-2011-09-03-Fall Machine Learning Events</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many Machine Learning related events are coming up this fall.
  
  September 9 ,  abstracts for the New York Machine Learning Symposium  are due.  Send a 2 page pdf, if interested, and note that we:
 
 widened submissions to be from anybody rather than students. 
 set aside a larger fraction of time for contributed submissions.  
 
 
  September 15 , there is a  machine learning meetup , where I’ll be discussing terascale learning at AOL. 
  September 16 , there is a  CS&Econ; day  at New York Academy of Sciences.  This is not ML focused, but it’s easy to imagine interest. 
  September 23 and later   NIPS workshop  submissions start coming due.  As usual, there are too many good ones, so I won’t be able to attend all those that interest me.  I do hope some workshop makers consider ICML this coming summer, as we are increasing to a 2 day format for you.  Here are a few that interest me:
 
  Big Learning  is about dealing with lots of data.  Abstracts are due  September 30 .

 VW is now 2-3 orders of magnitude faster at linear learning, primarily thanks to  Alekh .  Given the baseline, this is loads of fun, allowing us to easily deal with terafeature datasets, and dwarfing the scale of any other open source projects.  The core improvement here comes from effective parallelization over kilonode clusters (either  Hadoop  or not).   This code is highly scalable, so it even helps with clusters of size 2 (and doesn’t hurt for clusters of size 1).  The core allreduce technique appears widely and easily reused—we’ve already used it to parallelize Conjugate Gradient, LBFGS, and two variants of online learning.  We’ll be documenting how to do this more thoroughly, but for now “README_cluster” and associated scripts should provide a good starting point.
 
 The new  LBFGS  code from  Miro  seems to commonly dominate the existing conjugate gradient code in time/quality tradeoffs.

<p>Introduction: Multitask learning is the problem of jointly predicting multiple labels simultaneously with one system.   A basic question is  whether or not multitask learning can be decomposed into one (or more) single prediction problems .  It seems the answer to this is “yes”, in a fairly straightforward manner.
 
The basic idea is that a controlled input feature is equivalent to an extra output.  Suppose we have some process generating examples:  (x,y 1 ,y 2 ) in S  where  y 1   and  y 2   are labels for two different tasks.  Then, we could reprocess the data to the form  S b (S) = {((x,i),y i ): (x,y 1 ,y 2 ) in S, i in {1,2}}  and then learn a classifier  c:X x {1,2} -> Y . Note that  (x,i)  is the (composite) input. At testing time, given an input  x , we can query  c  for the predicted values of y 1  and y 2  using  (x,1)  and  (x,2) .
 
A strong form of equivalence can be stated between these tasks.  In particular, suppose we have a multitask learning algorithm  ML  which learns a multitask</p><p>4 0.55834496 <a title="316-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-22-Taking_the_next_step.html">297 hunch net-2008-04-22-Taking the next step</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At the  last ICML ,  Tom Dietterich  asked me to look into systems for commenting on papers.  I’ve been slow getting to this, but it’s relevant now.
 
The essential observation is that we now have many tools for online collaboration, but they are not yet much used in academic research.  If we can find the right way to use them, then perhaps great things might happen, with extra kudos to the first conference that manages to really create an online community.  Various conferences have been poking at this.  For example,  UAI has setup a wiki , COLT has  started using   Joomla , with some dynamic content, and AAAI has been setting up a “ student blog “.  Similarly,  Dinoj Surendran  setup a twiki for the  Chicago Machine Learning Summer School , which was quite useful for coordinating events and other things.
 
I believe the most important thing is a willingness to experiment.  A good place to start seems to be enhancing existing conference websites.  For example, the  ICML 2007 papers pag</p><p>5 0.4647204 <a title="316-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-02-The_Machine_Learning_Award_goes_to_%26%238230%3B.html">270 hunch net-2007-11-02-The Machine Learning Award goes to &#8230;</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Perhaps the biggest CS prize for research is the  Turing Award , which has a $0.25M cash prize associated with it.  It appears none of the prizes so far have been for anything like machine learning (the closest are perhaps database awards).
 
In CS theory, there is the  GÃƒÂ¶del Prize  which is smaller and newer, offering a $5K prize along and perhaps (more importantly) recognition.  One such award has been given for Machine Learning, to  Robert Schapire  and  Yoav Freund  for Adaboost.
 
In Machine Learning, there seems to be no equivalent of these sorts of prizes.  There are several plausible reasons for this:
  
 
 There is no coherent community. 
  People drift in and out of the central conferences all the time.  Most of the author names from 10 years ago do not occur in the conferences of today.  In addition, the entire subject area is fairly new. 
 There are at least a core group of people who have stayed around. 
 
 
 Machine Learning work doesn’t last

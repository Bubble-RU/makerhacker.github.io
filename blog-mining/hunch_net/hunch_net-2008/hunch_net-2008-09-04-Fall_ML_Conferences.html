<p>Introduction: On Sept 21, there is anothermachine learning meetupwhere I'll be speaking.
Although the topic is contextual bandits, I think of it as "the future of
machine learning". In particular, it's all about how to learn in an
interactive environment, such as for ad display, trading, news recommendation,
etcâ&euro;ŚOn Sept 24, abstracts for theNew York Machine Learning Symposiumare due.
This is the largest Machine Learning event in the area, so it's a great way to
have a conversation with other people.On Oct 22, the NY ML Symposium actually
happens. This year, we are expanding the spotlights, and trying to have more
time for posters. In addition, we have a strong set of invited speakers:David
Blei,Sanjoy Dasgupta,Tommi Jaakkola, andYann LeCun. After the meeting, a
latehackNYrelated event is planned where students and startups can meet.I'd
also like to point out the relatedCS/Econ symposiumas I have interests there
as well.</p><p>4 0.12769297 <a title="316-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-25-Upcoming_conference.html">198 hunch net-2006-07-25-Upcoming conference</a></p>

Last year's attendance was 246 and I expect more this year.The primary
experiment forICML 2013is multiple paper submission deadlines with rolling
review cycles. The key dates are October 1, December 15, and February 15. This
is an attempt to shift ICML further towards a journal style review process and
reduce peak load. The "not for proceedings" experiment from this year's ICML
is not continuing.Edit: Fixed second ICML deadline.</p><p>6 0.12214973 <a title="316-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-27-New_York_Area_Machine_Learning_Events.html">369 hunch net-2009-08-27-New York Area Machine Learning Events</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Joel Preddmentioned"Antilearning" byAdam Kowalczyk, which is interesting from
a foundational intuitions viewpoint.There is a pervasive intuition that
"nearby things tend to have the same label". This intuition is instantiated in
SVMs, nearest neighbor classifiers, decision trees, and neural networks. It
turns out there are natural problems where this intuition is opposite of the
truth.One natural situation where this occurs is in competition. For example,
whenIntelfails to meet its earnings estimate, is this evidence thatAMDis doing
badly also? Or evidence that AMD is doing well?This violation of the proximity
intuition means that when the number of examples is few,negatinga classifier
which attempts to exploit proximity can provide predictive power (thus, the
term "antilearning").</p><p>3 0.79606926 <a title="316-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-06-30-ICML_has_a_comment_system.html">305 hunch net-2008-06-30-ICML has a comment system</a></p>

Lindenhas tightly integrated.My understanding is that Mark spent quite a bit
of time on the details, and there are some cool features like working latex

with making ICML year-round, so I hope it works out. Please do consider

<p>Introduction: Graduating students in Statistics appear to be at a substantial handicap
compared to graduating students in Machine Learning, despite being in
substantially overlapping subjects.The problem seems to be cultural.
Statistics comes from a mathematics background which emphasizes large
publications slowly published under review at journals. Machine Learning comes
from a Computer Science background which emphasizes quick publishing at
reviewed conferences. This has a number of implications:Graduating statistics
PhDs often have 0-2 publications while graduating machine learning PhDs might
have 5-15.Graduating ML students have had a chance for others to build on
their work. Stats students have had no such chance.Graduating ML students have
attended a number of conferences and presented their work, giving them a
chance to meet people. Stats students have had fewer chances of this sort.In
short, Stats students have had relatively few chances to distinguish
themselves and are heavily reliant on t</p><p>5 0.62916923 <a title="316-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-06-14-Interesting_Papers_at_COLT_2007.html">247 hunch net-2007-06-14-Interesting Papers at COLT 2007</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Here are two papers that seem particularly interesting at this year's
COLT.Gilles BlanchardandFranÃƒÂ§ois Fleuret,Occam's Hammer. When we are
interested in very tight bounds on the true error rate of a classifier, it is
tempting to use a PAC-Bayes bound which can (empirically) bequite tight. A
disadvantage of the PAC-Bayes bound is that it applies to a classifier which
is randomized over a set of base classifiers rather than a single classifier.
This paper shows that a similar bound can be proved which holds for a single
classifier drawn from the set. The ability to safely use a single classifier
is very nice. This technique applies generically to any base bound, so it has
other applications covered in the paper.Adam Tauman Kalai.Learning Nested

prove that any problem amongst some set is polytime learnable with respect to

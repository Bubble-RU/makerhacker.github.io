 N = E x ~ D  f(x)

<p>Introduction: Yaroslav Bulatov  says that we should think about regularization a bit.  It’s a complex topic which I only partially understand, so I’ll try to explain from a couple viewpoints.
  
  Functionally . Regularization is optimizing some representation to fit the data  and  minimize some notion of predictor complexity.  This notion of complexity is often the l 1  or l 2  norm on a set of parameters, but the term can be used much more generally.  Empirically, this often works much better than simply fitting the data. 
  Statistical Learning Viewpoint  Regularization is about the failiure of statistical learning to adequately predict generalization error.  Let  e(c,D)  be the expected error rate with respect to  D  of classifier  c  and  e(c,S)  the observed error rate on a sample  S .

<p>Introduction: Exploration is one of the big unsolved problems in machine learning. This isn’t for lack of trying—there are many models of exploration which have been analyzed in many different ways by many different groups of people. At some point, it is worthwhile to sit back and see what has been done across these many models.
  
   Reinforcement Learning  (1) . Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on Markov Decision Processes where the next state  s’    is given by a conditional distribution  P(s’|s,a)  given the current state  s  and action  a .  The typical result here is that certain specific algorithms controlling an agent can behave within  e  of optimal for horizon  T  except for  poly(1/e,T,S,A)  “wasted” experiences (with high probability).  This started with  E 3   by  Satinder Singh  and  Michael Kearns .  Sham Kakade’s thesis  has significant discussion.

<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given framework or mathematical model.  It turns out that all of these models are significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning.  I’ve created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of machine learning.
 
The point here is not simply “woe unto us”.  There are several implications which seem important.
  
 The multitude of models is a point of continuing confusion.  It is common for people to learn about machine learning within one framework which often becomes there “home framework” through which they attempt to filter all machine learning.  (Have you met people who can only think in terms of kernels?  Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)  Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help resolve the confusion.  This is particularly important when reviewing and particularly important for students.

<p>Introduction: Here are a few of the papers I enjoyed at ICML.
  
  Steffen Bickel , Michael BrÃƒÂ¼eckner,  Tobias Scheffer ,  Discriminative Learning for Differing Training and Test Distributions   There is a nice trick in this paper: they predict the probability that an unlabeled sample is in the training set vs. the test set, and then use this prediction to importance weight labeled samples in the training set.  This paper uses a specific parametric model, but the approach is easily generalized.

<p>Introduction: One of the central concerns of learning is to understand and to 
prevent overfitting. Various notion of “function complexity” often 
arise: VC dimension, Rademacher complexity, comparison classes of 
experts, and program length are just a few.
 
The term “complexity” to me seems somehow misleading; the terms never 
capture something that meets my intuitive notion of complexity. The 
Bayesian notion clearly captures what’s going on. Functions aren’t 
“complex”– they’re just “surprising”: we assign to them low 
probability. Most (all?) complexity notions I know boil down 
to some (generally loose) bound on the prior probability of the function.
 
In a sense, “complexity” fundementally arises because probability 
distributions must sum to one. You can’t believe in all possibilities 
at the same time, or at least not equally. Rather you have to 
carefully spread the probability mass over the options you’d like to 
consider. Large complexity classes means that beliefs are spread 
thinly. In</p><p>4 0.59311789 <a title="303-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-26-Compositional_Machine_Learning_Algorithm_Design.html">311 hunch net-2008-07-26-Compositional Machine Learning Algorithm Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: There were  two   papers  at ICML presenting learning algorithms for a  contextual bandit -style setting, where the loss for all labels is not known, but the loss for one label is known.  (The first might require a  exploration scavenging  viewpoint to understand if the experimental assignment was nonrandom.)  I strongly approve of these papers and further work in this setting and its variants, because I expect it to become more important than supervised learning.  As a quick review, we are thinking about situations where repeatedly:
  
 The world reveals feature values (aka context information). 
 A policy chooses an action. 
 The world provides a reward. 
  
Sometimes this is done in an online fashion where the policy can change based on immediate feedback and sometimes it’s done in a batch setting where many samples are collected before the policy can change.  If you haven’t spent time thinking about the setting, you might want to because there are many natural applications.

<p>Introduction: This post is partly meant as an advertisement for the  reductions tutorial   Alina ,  Bianca , and I are planning to do at  ICML .  Please come, if you are interested.
 
Many research programs can be thought of as finding and building new useful abstractions.  The running example I’ll use is  learning reductions  where I have experience.  The basic abstraction here is that we can build a learning algorithm capable of solving classification problems up to a small expected regret.   This is used repeatedly to solve more complex problems.
 
In working on a new abstraction, I think you typically run into many substantial problems of understanding, which make publishing particularly difficult.
  
 It is difficult to seriously discuss the reason behind or mechanism for abstraction in a conference paper with small page limits.  People rarely see such discussions and hence have little basis on which to think about new abstractions.    Another difficulty is that when building an abstraction, yo</p><p>6 0.55360121 <a title="303-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-11-20-Context_and_the_calculation_misperception.html">218 hunch net-2006-11-20-Context and the calculation misperception</a></p>

<p>Introduction: To commemorate the  Twenty Fourth Annual International Conference on Machine  Learning  (ICML-07), the FOX Network has decided to  launch a new spin-off series in prime time.

<p>Introduction: This post is about a trick that I learned from  Dale Schuurmans  which has been repeatedly useful for me over time.
 
The basic trick has to do with importance weighting for monte carlo integration.  Consider the problem of finding: 
 N = E x ~ D  f(x)  
given samples from  D  and knowledge of  f .
 
Often, we don’t have samples from  D  available.  Instead, we must make do with samples from some other distribution  Q .  In that case, we can still often solve the problem, as long as Q(x) isn’t 0 when D(x) is nonzero, using the importance weighting formula: 
 E x ~ Q  f(x) D(x)/Q(x) 
 
A basic question is: How many samples from  Q  are required in order to estimate  N  to some precision?  In general the convergence rate is not bounded, because  f(x) D(x)/Q(x)  is not bounded given the assumptions. 
Nevertheless, there is one special value  Q(x) = f(x) D(x) / N  where the sample complexity turns out to be  1 , which is typically substantially better than the sample complexity of the orig</p><p>3 0.85680437 <a title="303-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-06-29-ICML_survey_and_comments.html">468 hunch net-2012-06-29-ICML survey and comments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attending  ICML , except for  Dora  who arrived on Monday.  Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is going well.
 
For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like everyone),  Mark Reid  has setup the  ICML discussion  site where you can comment on any paper or subscribe to papers.  Authors are automatically subscribed to their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly after the fact, as people desire.
 
We also conducted a survey before the conference and have the  survey results  now.  This can be compared with the  ICML 2010 survey results .  Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4 being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and 2010.
 
Glancing through them, I see:

<p>Introduction: Dean Foster  and  Daniel Hsu  had a couple observations about reductions to regression that I wanted to share.  This will make the most sense for people familiar with error correcting output codes (see the  tutorial, page 11 ).
 
Many people are comfortable using linear regression in a one-against-all style, where you try to predict the probability of choice  i  vs other classes, yet they are not comfortable with more complex error correcting codes because they fear that they create harder problems.  This fear turns out to be mathematically incoherent under a linear representation: comfort in the linear case should imply comfort with more complex codes.
 
In particular, If there exists a set of weight vectors  w i   such that  P(i|x)=, then for any invertible error correcting output code  C , there exists weight vectors  w c   which decode to perfectly predict the probability of each class.  The proof is simple and constructive: the weight vector  w c   can be constructed acc</p><p>5 0.83523911 <a title="303-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-26-The_SODA_Program_Committee.html">318 hunch net-2008-09-26-The SODA Program Committee</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Claire  asked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite a bit of work.
 
I had a relatively light load—merely 49 theory papers.  Many of these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help review the papers.  I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally.  There were a couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.
 
There are some differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and theory communities.  In machine learning it is expected that a review be detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case.  Every paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very detailed.  
 
I’m sure not every author was happy with the outcome.  While we did our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make.

<p>Introduction: The 2006 Machine Learning Summer School in Taipei, Taiwan ended on August 4,
2006. It has been a very exciting two weeks for a record crowd of 245
participants (including speakers and organizers) from 18 countries. We had a
lineup of speakers that is hard to match up for other similar events (see
ourWIKIfor more information). With this lineup, it is difficult for us as
organizers to screw it up too bad. Also, since we have pretty good
infrastructure for international meetings and experienced staff at NTUST and
Academia Sinica, plus the reputation established by previous MLSS series, it
was relatively easy for us to attract registrations and simply enjoyed this
two-week long party of machine learning.In the end of MLSS we distributed a
survey form for participants to fill in. I will report what we found from this
survey, together with the registration data and word-of-mouth from
participants.The first question is designed to find out how our participants
learned about MLSS 2006 Taipei.</p><p>3 0.14669794 <a title="322-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>4 0.11522011 <a title="322-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-10-10-ML_Symposium_and_ICML_details.html">447 hunch net-2011-10-10-ML Symposium and ICML details</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Everyone should have received notice forNY ML Symposiumabstracts. Check
carefully, as one was lost by our system.The event itself is October 21, next
week.Leon Bottou,Stephen Boyd, andYoav Freundare giving the invited talks this
year, and there are many spotlights on local work spread throughout the
day.Chris Wigginshas setup 6(!) ML-interested startups to follow the
symposium, which should be of substantial interest to the employment
interested.I also wanted to give an update onICML 2012. Unlike last year, our
deadline is coordinated withAIStat(which is due this Friday). The paper
deadline for ICML has been pushed back to February 24 which should allow
significant time for finishing up papers after the winter break. Other details
may interest people as well:We settled on usingCMTafter checking out the
possibilities. I wasn't looking for this, because I've often found CMT clunky
in terms of easy access to the right information. Nevertheless, the breadth of
features and willingness to s</p><p>5 0.11516833 <a title="322-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-28-Running_A_Machine_Learning_Summer_School.html">75 hunch net-2005-05-28-Running A Machine Learning Summer School</a></p>

was 2 weeks long with about 130 (or 140 counting the speakers) participants.

<p>Introduction: About 200 people attended the2010 NYAS ML Symposiumthis year. (It wasabout 170
last year.) I particularly enjoyed several talks.Yannhas a new live demo of
(limited) real-time object recognition learning.Sanjoygave a fairly convincing
and comprehensible explanation of why amodified form of single-linkage
clusteringis consistent in higher dimensions, and why consistency is a
critical feature for clustering algorithms. I'm curious how well this
algorithm works in practice.Matt Hoffman's poster covering online LDA seemed
pretty convincing to me as an algorithmic improvement.This year, we allocated
more time towards posters & poster spotlights.For next year, we are
considering some further changes. The format has traditionally been 4 invited
Professor speakers, with posters and poster spotlight for students. Demand
from other parties to participate is growing, for example from postdocs and
startups in the area. Another growing concern is the facility--the location is
exceptional, but fittin</p><p>4 0.62664127 <a title="322-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-10-18-7th_Annual_Machine_Learning_Symposium.html">474 hunch net-2012-10-18-7th Annual Machine Learning Symposium</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Rajat Rainapresented a paper on the technique they used for
thePASCALRecognizing Textual Entailmentchallenge."Text entailment" is the
problem of deciding if one sentence implies another. For example the previous
sentence entails:Text entailment is a decision problem.One sentence can imply
another.The challenge was of the form: given an original sentence and another
sentence predict whether there was an entailment. All current techniques for
predicting correctness of an entailment are at the "flail" stage--accuracies
of around 58% where humans could achieve near 100% accuracy, so there is much
room to improve. Apparently, there may be another PASCAL challenge on this
problem in the near future.</p><p>2 0.89690399 <a title="322-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-10-The_Large_Scale_Learning_class_notes.html">483 hunch net-2013-06-10-The Large Scale Learning class notes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Thelarge scale machine learning classI taught withYann LeCunhas finished. As I
expected, it took quite a bit of time. We had about 25 people attending in
person on average and 400 regularly watching therecorded lectureswhich is
substantially more sustained interest than I expected for an advanced ML
class. We also had some fun with class projects--I'm hopeful that several will
eventually turn into papers.I expect there are a number of professors
interested in lecturing on this and related topics. Everyone will have their
personal taste in subjects of course, but hopefully there will be some
convergence to common course materials as well. To help with this, I am making
thesources to my presentations available. Feel free to

<p>Introduction: I only managed to make it out to the NIPS workshops this year soI'll give my
comments on what I saw there.The Learing and Robotics workshops lives again. I
hope itcontinues and gets more high quality papers in the future. Themost
interesting talk for me was Larry Jackel's on the LAGRprogram (see John's
previous post on said program). I got someideas as to what progress has been
made. Larry really explainedthe types of benchmarks and the tradeoffs that had
to be made tomake the goals achievable but challenging.Hal Daume gave a very
interesting talk about structuredprediction using RL techniques, something
near and dear to my ownheart. He achieved rather impressive results using only
a verygreedy search.The non-parametric Bayes workshop was great. I enjoyed the
entiremorning session I spent there, and particularly (the usuallydesultory)
discussion periods. One interesting topic was theGibbs/Variational inference
divide. I won't try to summarizeespecially as no conclusion was reached. It</p><p>4 0.86368704 <a title="322-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-11-16-MLSS_2008.html">273 hunch net-2007-11-16-MLSS 2008</a></p>
<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś is in Kioloa, Australia from March 3 to March 14. It's a great chance to
learn something about Machine Learning and I've enjoyed severalprevious
Machine Learning Summer Schools.Thewebsite has many more details, but
registration is open now for the first 80 to sign up.</p><p>same-blog 5 0.83725595 <a title="322-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-20-New_York%26%238217%3Bs_ML_Day.html">322 hunch net-2008-10-20-New York&#8217;s ML Day</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I'm not as naturally exuberant asMuthu2orDavidaboutCS/Econday, but I believe
it andML daywere certainly successful.At the CS/Econ day, I particularly
enjoyedToumas Sandholm'stalk which showed a commanding depth of understanding
and application in automated auctions.For the machine learning day, I enjoyed
several talks and posters (I better, I helped pick them.). What stood out to
me was number of people attending: 158 registered, a level qualifying as
"scramble to find seats". My rule of thumb for workshops/conferences is that
the number of attendees is often something like the number of submissions.
That isn't the case here, where there were just 4 invited speakers and 30-or-
so posters. Presumably, the difference is due to a critical mass of Machine
Learning interested people in the area and the ease of their attendance.Are
there other areas where a local Machine Learning day would fly? It's easy to
imagine something working out in the San Francisco bay area and possibly
Germany or E</p><p>6 0.80911601 <a title="322-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-11-The_Heritage_Health_Prize.html">430 hunch net-2011-04-11-The Heritage Health Prize</a></p>

<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms

<p>Introduction: as of last night, late.When the reviewing deadline passed Wednesday night 15%
of reviews were still missing, much higher than I expected. Between late
reviews coming in, ACs working overtime through the weekend, and people
willing to help in the pinch another ~390 reviews came in, reducing the
missing mass to 0.2%. Nailing that last bit and a similar quantity of papers
with uniformly low confidence reviews is what remains to be done in terms of
basic reviews. We are trying to make all of those happen this week so authors
have some chance to respond.I was surprised by the quantity of late reviews,
and I think that's an area where ICML needs to improve in future years. Good
reviews are not done in a rush--they are done by setting aside time (like an
afternoon), and carefully reading the paper while thinking about implications.
Many reviewers do this well but a significant minority aren't good at
scheduling their personal time. In this situation there are several ways to

<p>Introduction: If we accept that bad reviewing often occurs and want to fix it, the question
is "how"?Reviewing is done by paper writers just like yourself, so a good
proxy for this question is asking "How can I be a better reviewer?" Here are a
few things I've learned by trial (and error), as a paper writer, and as a
reviewer.The secret ingredient is careful thought. There is no good
substitution for a deep and careful understanding.Avoid reviewing papers that
you feel competitive about. You almost certainly will be asked to review
papers that feel competitive if you work on subjects of common interest. But,
the feeling of competition can easily lead to bad judgement.If you feel biased
for some other reason, then you should avoid reviewing. For exampleâ&euro;ŚFeeling
angry or threatened by a paper is a form of bias. See above.Double blind
yourself (avoid looking at the name even in a single-blind situation). The
significant effect of a name you recognize is making you pay close attention
to a paper. Since</p><p>6 0.25184882 <a title="320-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers
is via bidding, which has steps something like:Invite people to reviewAccept
papersReviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are
interested in reviewing.Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get
approximately the papers they bid for.At the ICML business meeting,Andrew
McCallumsuggested getting rid of bidding for papers. A couple reasons were
given:PrivacyThe title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to
every participating reviewer. Some authors might be uncomfortable about this
for submitted papers. I'm not sympathetic to this reason: the point of
submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not
publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited.CliquesA bidding
system is gameable. If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your
submissions, you can each bid for your friend's papers and express a
disinterest in others. There</p><p>4 0.87569326 <a title="320-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-04-09-ICML_author_feedback_is_open.html">461 hunch net-2012-04-09-ICML author feedback is open</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a difficult subject to talk about for many reasons, but a discussion
may be helpful.Bad reviewing is a problem in academia. The first step in
understanding this is admitting to the problem, so here is a short list of
examples of bad reviewing.Reviewer disbelieves theorem proof (ICML), or
disbelieve theorem with a trivially false counterexample. (COLT)Reviewer
internally swaps quantifiers in a theorem, concludes it has been done before
and is trivial. (NIPS)Reviewer believes a technique will not work despite
experimental validation. (COLT)Reviewers fail to notice flaw in theorem
statement (CRYPTO).Reviewer erroneously claims that it has been done before
(NIPS, SODA, JMLR)--(complete with references!)Reviewer inverts the message of
a paper and concludes it says nothing important. (NIPS*2)Reviewer fails to
distinguish between a DAG and a tree (SODA).Reviewer is enthusiastic about
paper but clearly does not understand (ICML).Reviewer erroneously believe that

generalslimit has been exceeded. For example, I've seen recent reviews where
the given reasons for rejecting are:[NIPS] Theorem A is uninteresting because
Theorem B is uninteresting.[UAI] When you learn by memorization, the problem
addressed is trivial.[NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.[NIPS] This has been
done before. (â&euro;Ś but not giving any relevant citations)Just for the record I
want to point out what's wrong with these reviews. A future world in which
such reasons never come up again would be great, but I'm sure these errors
will be committed many times more in the future.This is nonsense. A theorem
should be evaluated based on it's merits, rather than the merits of another
theorem.Learning by memorization requires an exponentially larger sample
complexity than man</p><p>2 0.97977811 <a title="320-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-17-New_Machine_Learning_mailing_list.html">278 hunch net-2007-12-17-New Machine Learning mailing list</a></p>

<p>Introduction: The health ofCOLT(Conference on Learning Theory or Computational Learning
Theory depending on who you ask) has been questioned over the last few years.
Low points for the conference occurred whenEuroCOLTmerged with COLT in 2001,
and the attendance at the 2002 Sydney COLT fell to a new low. This occurred in
the general context of machine learning conferences rising in both number and
size over the last decade.Any discussion ofwhyCOLT has had difficulties is
inherently controversial as is any story about well-intentioned people making
the wrong decisions. Nevertheless, this may be worth discussing in the hope of
avoiding problems in the future and general understanding. In any such
discussion there is a strong tendency to identify with a conference/community
in a patriotic manner that is detrimental to thinking. Keep in mind that
conferences exist to further research.My understanding (I wasn't around) is
that COLT started as a subcommunity of the computer science theory community.

<p>Introduction: We just finished theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer School. The school
was 2 weeks long with about 130 (or 140 counting the speakers) participants.
For perspective, this is perhaps the largest graduate level machine learning
class I am aware of anywhere and anytime (previousMLSSs have been close).
Overall, it seemed to go well, although the students are the real authority on
this. For those who missed it, DVDs will be available from our Slovenian
friends. EmailMrs Spela Sitarof the Jozsef Stefan Institute for details.The

<p>Introduction: How should we, as researchers in machine learning, organize ourselves?The most
immediate measurable objective of computer science research is publishing a
paper. The most difficult aspect of publishing a paper is having reviewers
accept and recommend it for publication. The simplest mechanism for doing this
is to show theoretical progress on some standard, well-known easily understood
problem.In doing this, we often fall into a local minima of the research
process. The basic problem in machine learning is that it is very unclear that
the mathematical model is the right one for the (or some) real problem. A good
mathematical model in machine learning should have one fundamental trait: it
should aid the design of effective learning algorithms. To date, our ability
to solve interesting learning problems (speech recognition, machine
translation, object recognition, etcâ&euro;Ś) remains limited (although improving),
so the "rightness" of our models is in doubt.If our mathematical models are
bad, t</p><p>6 0.95482397 <a title="320-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-18-What_is_missing_for_online_collaborative_research%3F.html">208 hunch net-2006-09-18-What is missing for online collaborative research?</a></p>

<p>Introduction: All branches of machine learning seem to be united in the idea of using data to make predictions.  However, people disagree to some extent about what this means.  One way to categorize these different goals is on an axis, where one extreme is “tools to aid a human in using data to do prediction” and the other extreme is “tools to do prediction with no human intervention”.  Here is my estimate of where various elements of machine learning fall on this spectrum.
  
 
 Human Necessary 
  
 Human partially necessary 
  
 Human unnecessary 
 
 
 Clustering, data visualization 
 Bayesian Learning, Probabilistic Models, Graphical Models 
 Kernel Learning (SVM’s, etc..) 
 Decision Trees? 
 Reinforcement Learning 
 
  
The exact position of each element is of course debatable.  My reasoning is that clustering and data visualization are nearly useless for prediction without a human in the loop.  Bayesian/probabilistic models/graphical models generally require a human to sit and think about what</p><p>3 0.12786889 <a title="287-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-08-Computability_in_Artificial_Intelligence.html">353 hunch net-2009-05-08-Computability in Artificial Intelligence</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally I do not blog, but John kindly invited me to do so.  Since computability issues play a major role in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I would like to take the opportunity to comment on that and raise some questions.
 
The general attitude is that AI is about finding efficient smart algorithms. For large parts of machine learning, the same attitude is not too dangerous. If you want to concentrate on conceptual problems, simply become a statistician. There is no analogous escape for modern research on AI (as opposed to  GOFAI  rooted in logic).

 
Let me show by analogy why  limiting research to computational questions is bad for any field. 
 
Except in computer science, computational aspects play little role in the development of  fundamental  theories: Consider e.g. set theory with axiom of choice, foundations of logic, exact/full minimax for zero-sum games, quantum (field) theory, string theory, … Indeed, at least in physics, every new fundamental theory seems to</p><p>4 0.12107984 <a title="287-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-29-AI_Safety.html">380 hunch net-2009-11-29-AI Safety</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I’ve enjoyed the  Terminator  movies and show.  Neglecting the whacky aspects (time travel and associated paradoxes), there is an enduring topic of discussion: how do people deal with intelligent machines (and vice versa)?
 
In Terminator-land, the primary method for dealing with intelligent machines is to prevent them from being made.  This approach works pretty badly, because a new angle on building an intelligent machine keeps coming up.  This is partly a ploy for writer’s to avoid writing themselves out of a job, but there is a fundamental truth to it as well: preventing progress in research is hard.
 
The United States, has been experimenting with trying to stop research on  stem cells .  It hasn’t worked very well—the net effect has been retarding research programs a bit, and exporting some research to other countries.

<p>Introduction: A big ouch—all the videos for ICML 2012 were lost in a shuffle.  Rajnish sends the below, but if anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated.
 
——————————————————————————
 
Sincere apologies to ICML community for loosing 2012 archived videos
 
What happened: In order to publish 2013 videos, we decided to move 2012 videos to another server. We have a weekly backup service from the provider but after removing the videos from the current server, when we tried to retrieve the 2012 videos from backup service, the backup did not work because of provider-specific requirements that we had ignored while removing the data from previous server.
 
What are we doing about this: At this point, we are still looking into raw footage to find if we can retrieve some of the videos, but following are the steps we are taking to make sure this does not happen again in future: 
(1) We are going to create a channel on Vimeo (and potentially on YouTube) and we will publish there the p-in-p- or slide-vers</p><p>same-blog 2 0.91717148 <a title="287-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-28-Sufficient_Computation.html">287 hunch net-2008-01-28-Sufficient Computation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Do we have computer hardware sufficient for AI?  This question is difficult to answer, but here’s a try:
 
One way to achieve AI is by simulating a human brain.  A human brain has about 10 15  synapses which operate at about 10 2  per second implying about 10 17  bit ops per second.
 
A modern computer runs at 10 9  cycles/second and operates on 10 2  bits per cycle implying 10 11  bits processed per second.  
 
The gap here is only 6 orders of magnitude, which can be plausibly surpassed via cluster machines.  For example, the  BlueGene/L  operates 10 5  nodes (one order of magnitude short).  It’s peak recorded performance is about 0.5*10 15  FLOPS which translates to about 10 16  bit ops per second, which is nearly 10 17 .
 
There are many criticisms (both positive and negative) for this argument.
  
 Simulation of a human brain might require substantially more detail.  Perhaps an additional 10 2  is required per neuron. 
 We may not need to simulate a human brain to achieve AI.  Ther</p><p>3 0.81807482 <a title="287-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-14-NIPS_workshp%3A_Learning_Problem_Design.html">265 hunch net-2007-10-14-NIPS workshp: Learning Problem Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Alina  and I are organizing a workshop on  Learning Problem Design  at  NIPS .  
 
 What is learning problem design?  Itâ&euro;&trade;s about being clever in creating learning problems from otherwise unlabeled data.  Read the webpage above for examples.
 
 I want to participate!  Email us before Nov. 1 with a description of what you want to talk about.</p><p>4 0.79647106 <a title="287-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-07-02-MetaOptimize.html">402 hunch net-2010-07-02-MetaOptimize</a></p>

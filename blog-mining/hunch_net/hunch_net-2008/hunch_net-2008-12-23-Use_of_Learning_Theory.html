<p>Introduction: Normally, I don't indulge in posters forICML, but this year is naturally an
exception for me. If you want one, there are a small numberleft here, if you
sign up before February.It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the
scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting
papers. At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which
informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers. Program chairs setup
the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the
reviewing process. Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because
a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the
community determine the conference. Nevertheless, as a program chair this year
it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to
encourage (and occasionally discourage).At the highest level, I believe ICML
exists to further research into machine learning, which I generally think of

<p>Introduction: I wanted to expand on thispostand some of the previousproblems/research
directionsabout where learning theory might make large strides.Why theory?The
essential reason for theory is "intuition extension". A very good applied
learning person can master some particular application domain yielding the
best computer algorithms for solving that problem. A very good theory can take
the intuitions discovered by this and other applied learning people and extend
them to new domains in a relatively automatic fashion. To do this, we take
these basic intuitions and try to find a mathematical model that:Explains the
basic intuitions.Makes new testable predictions about how to learn.Succeeds in
so learning.This is "intuition extension": taking what we have learned
somewhere else and applying it in new domains. It is fundamentally useful to
everyone because it increases the level of automation in solving
problems.Where next for learning theory?I like the analogy with physics. Back

<p>Introduction: Despite my best intentions, this is not a fully specified problem, but rather
a research direction.Competitive online learning is one of the more compelling
pieces of learning theory because typical statements of the form "this
algorithm will perform almost as well as a large set of other algorithms" rely
only on fully-observable quantities, and are therefore applicable in many
situations. Examples includeWinnow,Weighted Majority, andBinomial Weighting.
Algorithms with this property haven't taken over the world yet. Here might be
some reasons:Lack of caring. Many people working on learning theory don't care
about particular applications much. This means constants in the algorithm are
not optimized, usable code is often not produced, and empirical studies aren't
done.Inefficiency. Viewed from the perspective of other learning algorithms,
online learning is terribly inefficient. It requires that every hypothesis
(called an expert in the online learning setting) be enumerated and tested o</p><p>5 0.18375547 <a title="332-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-05-16-Research_Directions_for_Machine_Learning_and_Algorithms.html">435 hunch net-2011-05-16-Research Directions for Machine Learning and Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Muthuinvited me to the workshop onalgorithms in the field, with the goal of
providing a sense of where near-term research should go. When the time came
though, I bargained for a post instead, which provides a chance for many other
people to comment.There are several things I didn't fully understand when I
went to Yahoo! about 5 years ago. I'd like to repeat them as people in
academia may not yet understand them intuitively.Almost all the big impact
algorithms operate in pseudo-linear or better time. Think about caching,
hashing, sorting, filtering, etcâ&euro;Ś and you have a sense of what some of the
most heavily used algorithms are. This matters quite a bit to Machine Learning
research, because people often work with superlinear time algorithms and
languages. Two very common examples of this are graphical models, where
inference is often a superlinear operation--think about then2dependence on the

<p>Introduction: A couple years ago, Drew Bagnell and I started theRLBench projectto setup a
suite of reinforcement learning benchmark problems. We haven't been able to
touch it (due to lack of time) for a year so the project is on hold. Luckily,
there are several other projects such asCLSquareandRL-Gluewith a similar goal,
and we strongly endorse their continued development.I would like to explain
why, especially in the context of criticism of other learning benchmarks. For
example, sometimes theUCI Machine Learning Repositoryis criticized. There are
two criticisms I know of:Learning algorithms have overfit to the problems in
the repository. It is easy to imagine a mechanism for this happening
unintentionally. Strong evidence of this would be provided by learning
algorithms which perform great on the UCI machine learning repository but very
badly (relative to other learning algorithms) on non-UCI learning problems. I
have seen little evidence of this but it remains a point of concern. There is

<p>Introduction: This post is partly meant as an advertisement for thereductions
tutorialAlina,Bianca, and I are planning to do atICML. Please come, if you are
interested.Many research programs can be thought of as finding and building
new useful abstractions. The running example I'll use islearning
reductionswhere I have experience. The basic abstraction here is that we can
build a learning algorithm capable of solving classification problems up to a
small expected regret. This is used repeatedly to solve more complex
problems.In working on a new abstraction, I think you typically run into many
substantial problems of understanding, which make publishing particularly
difficult.It is difficult to seriously discuss the reason behind or mechanism
for abstraction in a conference paper with small page limits. People rarely
see such discussions and hence have little basis on which to think about new
abstractions. Another difficulty is that when building an abstraction, you
often don't know the right way to</p><p>4 0.78848708 <a title="332-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-10-26-Fallback_Analysis_is_a_Secret_to_Useful_Algorithms.html">126 hunch net-2005-10-26-Fallback Analysis is a Secret to Useful Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The ideal of theoretical algorithm analysis is to construct an algorithm with
accompanying optimality theorems proving that it is a useful algorithm. This
ideal often fails, particularly for learning algorithms and theory. The
general form of a theorem is:IfpreconditionsThenpostconditionsWhen we design
learning algorithms it is very common to come up with precondition assumptions
such as "the data is IID", "the learning problem is drawn from a known
distribution over learning problems", or "there is a perfect classifier". All
of these example preconditions can be false for real-world problems in ways
that are not easily detectable. This means that algorithms derived and
justified by these very common forms of analysis may be prone to catastrophic
failure in routine (mis)application.Wecanhope for better. Several different
kinds of learning algorithm analysis have been developed some of which have
fewer preconditions. Simply demanding that these forms of analysis be used may
be too stron</p><p>5 0.77872431 <a title="332-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-03-26-Machine_Learning_is_too_easy.html">347 hunch net-2009-03-26-Machine Learning is too easy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the remarkable things about machine learning is how diverse it is. The
viewpoints of Bayesian learning, reinforcement learning, graphical models,
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, genetic programming, etc… share
little enough overlap that many people can and do make their careers within
one without touching, or even necessarily understanding the others.There are
two fundamental reasons why this is possible.For many problems, many
approaches work in the sense that they do something useful. This is true
empirically, where for many problems we can observe that many different
approaches yield better performance than any constant predictor. It's also
true in theory, where we know that for any set of predictors representable in
a finite amount of RAM, minimizing training error over the set of predictors
does something nontrivial when there are a sufficient number of examples.There
is nothing like a unifying problem defining the field. In many other areas
there are unifying p</p><p>6 0.77684021 <a title="332-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-25-Turing%26%238217%3Bs_Club_for_Machine_Learning.html">286 hunch net-2008-01-25-Turing&#8217;s Club for Machine Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Online learning is in vogue, which means we should expect to see in the near
future:Online boosting.Online decision trees.Online SVMs. (actually, we've
already seen)Online deep learning.Online parallel learning.etc…There are three
fundamental drivers of this trend.Increasing size of datasets makes online
algorithms attractive.Online learning can simply be more efficient than batch
learning. Here is a picture from a class on online learning:The point of this
picture is that even in 3 dimensions and even with linear constraints, finding
the minima of a set in an online fashion can be typically faster than finding
the minima in a batch fashion. To see this, note that there is a minimal
number of gradient updates (i.e. 2) required in order to reach the minima in
the typical case. Given this, it's best to do these updates as quickly as
possible, which implies doing the first update online (i.e. before seeing all
the examples) is preferred. Note that this is the simplest possible setting--

<p>Introduction: It turns out that many different people use the term "Online Learning", and
often they don't have the same definition in mind. Here's a list of the
possibilities I know of.Online Information SettingOnline learning refers to
aproblemin which unlabeled data comes, a prediction is made, and then feedback
is acquired.Online Adversarial SettingOnline learning refers toalgorithmsin
the Online Information Setting which satisfy guarantees of the form: "For all
possible sequences of observations, the algorithim has regret at mostlog (
number of strategies)with respect to the best strategy in a set." This is
sometimes called online learning with experts.Online Optimization
ConstraintOnline learning refers to optimizing a predictor via a learning
algorithm tunes parameters on a per-example basis. This may or may not be
applied in the Online Information Setting, and the strategy may or may not
satisfy Adversarial setting theory.Online Computational ConstraintOnline

<p>Introduction: I've had serious conversations with several people who believe that the theory
in machine learning is "only useful for getting papers published". That's a
compelling statement, as I've seen many papers where the algorithm clearly
came first, and the theoretical justification for it came second, purely as a
perceived means to improve the chance of publication.Naturally, I disagree and
believe that learning theory has much more substantial applications.Even in
core learning algorithm design, I've found learning theory to be useful,
although it's application is more subtle than many realize. The most
straightforward applications can fail, because (as expectation suggests) worst
case bounds tend to be loose in practice (*). In my experience, considering
learning theory when designing an algorithm has two important effects in
practice:It can help make your algorithm behave right at a crude level of
analysis, leaving finer details to tuning or common sense. The best example I
have of this is</p><p>4 0.91082704 <a title="332-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-03-03-All_Models_of_Learning_have_Flaws.html">235 hunch net-2007-03-03-All Models of Learning have Flaws</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Attempts to abstract and study machine learning are within some given
framework or mathematical model. It turns out that all of these models are
significantly flawed for the purpose of studying machine learning. I've
created a table (below) outlining the major flaws in some common models of
machine learning.The point here is not simply "woe unto us". There are several
implications which seem important.The multitude of models is a point of
continuing confusion. It is common for people to learn about machine learning
within one framework which often becomes there "home framework" through which
they attempt to filter all machine learning. (Have you met people who can only
think in terms of kernels? Only via Bayes Law? Only via PAC Learning?)
Explicitly understanding the existence of these other frameworks can help
resolve the confusion. This is particularly important when reviewing and
particularly important for students.Algorithms which conform to multiple
approaches can have substantial</p><p>5 0.91074824 <a title="332-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-14-Explorations_of_Exploration.html">183 hunch net-2006-06-14-Explorations of Exploration</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Exploration is one of the big unsolved problems in machine learning. This
isn't for lack of trying--there are many models of exploration which have been
analyzed in many different ways by many different groups of people. At some
point, it is worthwhile to sit back and see what has been done across these
many models.Reinforcement Learning(1). Reinforcement learning has
traditionally focused on Markov Decision Processes where the next states'is
given by a conditional distributionP(s'|s,a)given the current statesand
actiona. The typical result here is that certain specific algorithms
controlling an agent can behave withineof optimal for horizonTexcept

discussion. Extensions have typically been of the form "under extra
assumptions, we can prove more", for exampleFactored-E3andMetric-E3. (It turns

<p>Introduction: A big part of doing research is presenting it at a conference. Since many
people start out shy of public presentations, this can be a substantial
challenge. Here are a few notes which might be helpful when thinking about
preparing a presentation on research.Motivate. Talks which don't start by
describing the problem to solve cause many people to zone out.Prioritize. It
is typical that you have more things to say than time to say them, and many
presenters fall into the failure mode of trying to say too much. This is an
easy-to-understand failure mode as it's very natural to want to include
everything. A basic fact is: you can't. Example of this are:Your slides are so
densely full of equations and words that you can't cover them.Your talk runs
over and a moderator prioritizes for you by cutting you off.You motor-mouth
through the presentation, and the information absorption rate of the audience

<p>Introduction: â&euro;Ś and you should use that fact.A workshop differs from a conference in that it
is about a focused group of people worrying about a focused topic. It also
differs in that a workshop is typically a "one-time affair" rather than a
series. (TheSnowbird learning workshopcounts as a conference in this
respect.)A common failure mode of both organizers and speakers at a workshop
is to treat it as a conference. This is "ok", but it is not really taking
advantage of the situation. Here are some things I've learned:For speakers: A
smaller audience means it can be more interactive. Interactive means a better
chance to avoid losing your audience and a more interesting presentation
(because you can adapt to your audience). Greater focus amongst the
participants means you can get to the heart of the matter more easily, and
discuss tradeoffs more carefully. Unlike conferences, relevance is more valued
than newness.For organizers: Not everything needs to be in a conference style

<p>Introduction: I want to try to describe what doing research means, especially from the point
of view of an undergraduate. The shift from a class-taking mentality to a
research mentality is very significant and not easy.Problem PosingPosing the
right problem is often as important as solving them. Many people can get by in
research by solving problems others have posed, but that's not sufficient for
really inspiring research. For learning in particular, there is a strong
feeling that we just haven't figured out which questions are the right ones to
ask. You can see this, because the answers we have do not seem
convincing.Gambling your lifeWhen you do research, you think very hard about
new ways of solving problems, new problems, and new solutions. Many
conversations are of the form "I wonder what would happen if…" These processes
can be short (days or weeks) or years-long endeavours. The worst part is that
you'll only know if you were succesful at the end of the process (and
sometimes not even then be</p><p>5 0.10362945 <a title="307-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-01-30-ICML_Posters_and_Scope.html">454 hunch net-2012-01-30-ICML Posters and Scope</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Normally, I don't indulge in posters forICML, but this year is naturally an
exception for me. If you want one, there are a small numberleft here, if you
sign up before February.It also seems worthwhile to give some sense of the
scope and reviewing criteria for ICML for authors considering submitting
papers. At ICML, the (very large) program committee does the reviewing which
informs final decisions by area chairs on most papers. Program chairs setup
the process, deal with exceptions or disagreements, and provide advice for the
reviewing process. Providing advice is tricky (and easily misleading) because
a conference is a community, and in the end the aggregate interests of the
community determine the conference. Nevertheless, as a program chair this year
it seems worthwhile to state the overall philosophy I have and what I plan to
encourage (and occasionally discourage).At the highest level, I believe ICML
exists to further research into machine learning, which I generally think of

<p>Introduction: One thing common to much research is that the researcher must be the first
personeverto have some thought. How do you think of something that has never
been thought of? There seems to be no methodical manner of doing this, but
there are some tricks.The easiest method is to just have some connection come
to you. There is a trick here however: you should write it down and fill out
the idea immediately because it can just as easily go away.A harder method is
to set aside a block of time and simply think about an idea. Distraction
elimination is essential here because thinking about the unthought is hard
work which your mind will avoid.Another common method is in conversation.
Sometimes the process of verbalizing implies new ideas come up and sometimes
whoever you are talking to replies just the right way. This method is
dangerous though--you must speak to someone who helps you think rather than
someone who occupies your thoughts.Try to rephrase the problem so the answer
is simple. This is</p><p>4 0.69429773 <a title="307-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-03-09-Use_of_Notation.html">162 hunch net-2006-03-09-Use of Notation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: For most people, a mathematical notation is like a language: you learn it and
stick with it. For people doing mathematical research, however, this is not
enough: they must design new notations for new problems. The design of good
notation is both hard and worthwhile since a bad initial notation can retard a
line of research greatly.Before we had mathematical notation, equations were
all written out in language. Since words have multiple meanings and variable
precedences, long equations written out in language can be extraordinarily
difficult and sometimes fundamentally ambiguous. A good representative example
of this is the legalese in the tax code. Since we want greater precision and
clarity, we adopt mathematical notation.One fundamental thing to understand
about mathematical notation, is that humans as logic verifiers, are barely
capable. This is the fundamental reason why one notation can be much better
than another. This observation is easier to miss than you might expect
because,</p><p>5 0.640764 <a title="307-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-08-10-Precision_is_not_accuracy.html">202 hunch net-2006-08-10-Precision is not accuracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: In my experience, there are two different groups of people who believe the
same thing: the mathematics encountered in typical machine learning conference
papers is often of questionable value.The two groups who agree on this are
applied machine learning people who have given up on math, and mature
theoreticians who understand the limits of theory.Partly, this is just a
statement about where we are with respect to machine learning. In particular,
we have no mechanism capable of generating a prescription for how to solve all
learning problems. In the absence of such certainty, people try to come up
with formalisms that partially describe and motivate how and why they do
things. This is natural and healthy--we might hope that it will eventually
lead to just such a mechanism.But, part of this is simply an emphasis on
complexity over clarity. A very natural and simple theoretical statement is
often obscured by complexifications. Common sources of complexification
include:GeneralizationBy tr</p><p>6 0.59644878 <a title="307-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-10-Workshops_are_not_Conferences.html">80 hunch net-2005-06-10-Workshops are not Conferences</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I'm theworkshops chairforICMLthis year. As such, I would like to personally
encourage people to consider running a workshop.My general view of workshops
is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research
directions--some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and
several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various
problems. My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making
them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops
often come off much better than expected in the end. Submissions are due
January 18, two weeks before papers.Similarly,Ben Taskaris looking for
goodtutorials, which is complementary. Workshops are about exploring a

<p>Introduction: To commemorate theTwenty Fourth Annual International Conference on Machine
Learning(ICML-07), the FOX Network has decided to launch a new spin-off series
in prime time. Through unofficial sources, I have obtained thestory arcfor the
first season, which appears frighteningly realistic.</p><p>3 0.97279084 <a title="307-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-11-18-ICML_2011_%26%238211%3B_Call_for_Tutorials.html">417 hunch net-2010-11-18-ICML 2011 &#8211; Call for Tutorials</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I would like to encourage people to consider giving a tutorial at next years
ICML. The ideal tutorial attracts a wide audience, provides a gentle and
easily taught introduction to the chosen research area, and also covers the
most important contributions in depth.Submissions are due January 14 Â (about
two weeks before paper
deadline).http://www.icml-2011.org/tutorials.phpRegards,Ulf</p><p>same-blog 4 0.93853831 <a title="307-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-07-04-More_Presentation_Preparation.html">307 hunch net-2008-07-04-More Presentation Preparation</a></p>
<p>Introduction: We've discussedpresentation preparation before, but I have one more thing to
add:transitioning. For a research presentation, it is substantially helpful
for the audience if transitions are clear. A common outline for a research
presentation in machine leanring is:The problem. Presentations which don't
describe the problem almost immediately lose people, because the context is
missing to understand the detail.Prior relevant work. In many cases, a paper
builds on some previous bit of work which must be understood in order to
understand what the paper does. A common failure mode seems to be spending too
much time on prior work. Discuss just the relevant aspects of prior work in
the language of your work. Sometimes this is missing when unneeded.What we
did. For theory papers in particular, it is often not possible to really cover
the details. Prioritizing what you present can be very important.How it
worked. Many papers in Machine Learning have some sort of experimental test of

<p>Introduction: One part of doing research is debugging your understanding of reality. This is
hard work: How do you even discover where you misunderstand? If you discover a
misunderstanding, how do you go about removing it?The process of debugging
computer programs is quite analogous to debugging reality misunderstandings.
This is natural--a bug in a computer program is a misunderstanding between you
and the computer about what you said. Many of the familiar techniques from
debugging have exact parallels.DetailsWhen programming, there are often signs
that some bug exists like: "the graph my program output is shifted a little
bit" = maybe you have an indexing error. In debugging yourself, we often have
some impression that something is "not right". These impressions should be
addressed directly and immediately. (Some people have the habit of suppressing
worries in favor of excess certainty. That's not healthy for research.)Corner

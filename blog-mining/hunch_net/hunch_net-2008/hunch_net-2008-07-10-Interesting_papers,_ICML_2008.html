<p>Introduction: Consider the contextual bandit setting where, repeatedly:A contextxis
observed.An actionais taken given the contextx.A rewardris observed, dependent
onxanda.Where the goal of a learning agent is to find a policy for step 2
achieving a large expected reward.This setting is of obvious importance,
because in the real world we typically make decisions based on some set of
information and then get feedback only about the single action taken. It also
fundamentally differs from supervised learning settings because knowing the
value of one action is not equivalent to knowing the value of all actions.A
decade ago the best machine learning techniques for this setting where
implausibly inefficient.Dean Fosteronce told me he thought the area was a
research sinkhole with little progress to be expected. Now we are on the verge
of being able to routinely attack these problems, in almost exactly the same
sense that we routinely attack bread and butter supervised learning problems.

<p>Introduction: One of the fundamental underpinnings of the internet is advertising based
content. This has become much more effective due to targeted advertising where
ads are specifically matched to interests. Everyone is familiar with this,
because everyone uses search engines and all search engines try to make money
this way.The problem of matching ads to interests is a natural machine
learning problem in some ways since there is much information in who clicks on
what. A fundamental problem with this information is that it is not supervised
--in particular a click-or-not on one ad doesn't generally tell you if a
different ad would have been clicked on. This implies we have a fundamental
exploration problem.A standard mathematical setting for this situation is
"k-Armed Bandits", often with various relevant embellishments. Thek-Armed
Bandit setting works on a round-by-round basis. On each round:A policy chooses
armafrom1ofkarms (i.e. 1 of k ads).The world reveals the rewardraof the chosen

<p>Introduction: One thing which is clear on a little reflection is that there exists a single
master learning problem capable of encoding essentially all learning problems.
This problem is of course a very general sort of reinforcement learning where
the world interacts with an agent as:The world announces an observationx.The
agent makes a choicea.The world announces a rewardr.The goal here is to
maximize the sum of the rewards over the time of the agent. No particular
structure relatingxtoaoratoris implied by this setting so we do not know
effective general algorithms for the agent. It's very easy to prove lower
bounds showing that an agent cannot hope to succeed here--just consider the
case where actions are unrelated to rewards. Nevertheless, there is a real
sense in which essentially all forms of life are agents operating in this
setting, somehow succeeding. The gap between these observations drives
research--How can we find tractable specializations of the master problem

<p>Introduction: Awhile ago, we discussed the health ofCOLT.COLT 2008substantially addressed my
concerns. The papers were diverse and several were interesting. Attendance was
up, which is particularly notable in Europe. In my opinion, the colocation
with UAI and ICML was the best colocation since 1998.And, perhaps best of all,
registration ended up being free for all students due to various grants from
theAcademy of Finland,Google,IBM, andYahoo.A basic question is: what went
right? There seem to be several answers.Cost-wise, COLT had sufficient grants
to alleviate the high cost of the Euro and location at a university
substantially reduces the cost compared to a hotel.Organization-wise, the
Finns were great with hordes of volunteers helping set everything up. Having
too many volunteers is a good failure mode.Organization-wise, it was clear
that all 3 program chairs were cooperating in designing the program
.Facilities-wise, proximity in time and space made the colocation much more
real than many others</p><p>6 0.16280822 <a title="309-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-04-20-The_End_of_the_Beginning_of_Active_Learning.html">432 hunch net-2011-04-20-The End of the Beginning of Active Learning</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is about contextual bandit problems where, repeatedly:The world
chooses featuresxand rewards for each actionr1,â&euro;Ś,rkthen announces the
featuresx(but not the rewards).A policy chooses an actiona.The world announces
the rewardraThe goal in these situations is to learn a policy which
maximizesrain expectation efficiently. I'm thinking about all situations which
fit the above setting, whether they are drawn IID or adversarially from round
to round and whether they involve past logged data or rapidly learning via
interaction.One common drawback of all algorithms for solving this setting, is
that they have a poor dependence on the number of actions. For example ifkis
the number of actions,EXP4 (page 66)has a dependence onk0.5,epoch-greedy(and
the simpler epsilon greedy) have a dependence onk1/3, and theoffset treehas a
dependence onk-1. These results aren't directly comparable because different
things are being analyzed. The fact thatallanalyses have poor dependence onkis

<p>Introduction: Here are some papers fromICML 2008that I found interesting.Risi
KondorandKarsten Borgwardt,The Skew Spectrum of Graphs. This paper is about a
new family of functions on graphs which is invariant under node label
permutation. They show that these quantities appear to yield good features for
learning.Sanjoy DasguptaandDaniel Hsu.Hierarchical sampling for active
learning.This is the first published practical consistent active learning
algorithm. The abstract is also pretty impressive.Lihong Li,Michael Littman,
andThomas WalshKnows What It Knows: A Framework For Self-Aware Learning.This
is an attempt to create learning algorithms that know when they err, (other
work includesVovk). It's not yet clear to me what the right model forfeature-
dependent confidence intervalsis.Novi Quadrianto,Alex Smola,TIberio Caetano,
andQuoc Viet LeEstimating Labels from Label Proportions. This is an example of
learning in a specialization of the offline contextual bandit setting.Filip

<p>Introduction: Suppose we had an infinitely powerful mathematician sitting in a room and
proving theorems about learning. Could he solve machine learning?The answer is
"no". This answer is both obvious and sometimes underappreciated.There are
several ways to conclude that somebiasis necessary in order to succesfully
learn. For example, suppose we are trying to solve classification. At
prediction time, we observe some featuresXand want to make a prediction of
either0or1. Bias is what makes us prefer one answer over the other based on
past experience. In order to learn we must:Have a bias. Always predicting0is
as likely as1is useless.Have the "right" bias. Predicting1when the answer
is0is also not helpful.The implication of "have a bias" is that we can not
design effective learning algorithms with "a uniform prior over all
possibilities". The implication of "have the 'right' bias" is that our
mathematician fails since "right" is defined with respect to the solutions to
problems encountered in the real</p><p>3 0.99951899 <a title="309-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-15-IJCAI_is_out_of_season.html">184 hunch net-2006-06-15-IJCAI is out of season</a></p>
<p>Introduction: IJCAIis running January 6-12 in Hyderabad India rather than a more traditional
summer date. (Presumably, this is to avoid melting people in the Indian
summer.)The paper deadline(June 23 abstract / June 30 submission) are
particularly inconvenient if you attendCOLTorICML. But on the other hand, it's
a good excuse to visit India.</p><p>4 0.99951369 <a title="309-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-29-Academic_Mechanism_Design.html">48 hunch net-2005-03-29-Academic Mechanism Design</a></p>
<p>Introduction: From game theory, there is a notion of "mechanism design": setting up the
structure of the world so that participants have some incentive to do sane
things (rather than obviously counterproductive things). Application of this
principle to academic research may be fruitful.What is misdesigned about
academic research?TheJMLGguides give many hints.The common nature ofbad
reviewingalso suggests the system isn't working optimally.There are many ways
to experimentally"cheat" in machine learning.Funding Prisoner's Delimma. Good
researchers often write grant proposals for funding rather than doing
research. Since the pool of grant money is finite, this means that grant
proposals are often rejected, implying that more must be written. This is
essentially a "prisoner's delimma": anyone not writing grant proposals loses,
but the entire process of doing research is slowed by distraction. If everyone
wrote 1/2 as many grant proposals, roughly the same distribution of funding
would occur, and time w</p><p>5 0.99834943 <a title="309-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-06-Don%26%238217%3Bt_mix_the_solution_into_the_problem.html">67 hunch net-2005-05-06-Don&#8217;t mix the solution into the problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A common defect of many pieces of research is defining the problem in terms of
the solution. Here are some examples in learning:"The learning problem is
finding a good seperating hyperplane.""The goal of learning is to
minimize(y-p)2+ C w2wherey= the observation,p= the prediction andw= a
parameter vector."Defining thelossfunction to be the one that your algorithm
optimizes rather than the one imposed by the world.The fundamental reason why
this is a defect is that it creates artificial boundaries to problem solution.
Artificial boundaries lead to the possibility of being blind-sided. For
example, someone committing (1) or (2) above might find themselves themselves
surprised to find a decision tree working well on a problem. Example (3) might
result in someone else solving a learning problem better for real world
purposes, even if it's worse with respect to the algorithm optimization. This
defect should be avoided so as to not artificially limit your learning
kungfu.The way to avoid thi</p><p>6 0.99700993 <a title="309-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-12-09-Some_NIPS_papers.html">138 hunch net-2005-12-09-Some NIPS papers</a></p>

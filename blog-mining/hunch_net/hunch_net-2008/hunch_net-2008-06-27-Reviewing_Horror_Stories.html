<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>3 0.25113174 <a title="304-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-26-The_SODA_Program_Committee.html">318 hunch net-2008-09-26-The SODA Program Committee</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Claireasked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite
a bit of work.I had a relatively light load--merely 49 theory papers. Many of
these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common
for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help
review the papers. I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally. There were a
couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed
off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.There are some
differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and
theory communities. In machine learning it is expected that a review be
detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case. Every
paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very
detailed.I'm sure not every author was happy with the outcome. While we did
our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make. For

<p>Introduction: ByShieandNatiFollowing John's advertisement for submitting to ICML, we thought
it appropriate to highlight the advantages of COLT, and the reasons it is
often the best place for theory papers. We would like to emphasize that we
both respect ICML, and are active in ICML, both as authors and as area chairs,
and certainly are not arguing that ICML is a bad place for your papers. For
many papers, ICML is the best venue. But for many theory papers, COLT is a
better and more appropriate place.Why should you submit to COLT?By-and-large,
theory papers go to COLT. This is the tradition of the field and most theory
papers are sent to COLT. This is the place to present your ground-breaking
theorems and new models that will shape the theory of machine learning. COLT
is more focused then ICML with a single track session. Unlike ICML, the norm
in COLT is for people to sit through most sessions, and hear most of the talks
presented. There is also often a lively discussion following paper

sometimes the unfairness seems particularly striking. This is most easily seen
by comparison:PaperBanditronOffset TreeNotesProblem ScopeMulticlass problems

sensitive multiclass problems where only the loss of one choice can be
probed.Often generalizations don't matter. That's not the case here, since
every plausible application I've thought of involves loss functions
substantially different from 0/1.What's newAnalysis and ExperimentsAlgorithm,

problem was first stated and analyzed with theEXP4 algorithm (page 16)(1998).
It's also the time horizon 1 simplification of the Reinforcement Learning

<p>Introduction: This is a very difficult post to write, because it is about a perenially
touchy subject. Nevertheless, it is an important one which needs to be thought
about carefully.There are a few things which should be understood:The system
is changing and responsive. We-the-authors are we-the-reviewers, we-the-PC,
and even we-the-NIPS-board. NIPS has implemented 'secondary program chairs',
'author response', and 'double blind reviewing' in the last few years to help
with the decision process, and more changes may happen in the future.Agreement
creates a perception of correctness. When any PC meets and makes a group
decision about a paper, there is a strong tendency for the reinforcement
inherent in a group decision to create the perception of correctness. For the
many people who have been on the NIPS PC it's reasonable to entertain a
healthy skepticism in the face of this reinforcing certainty.This post is
about structural problems. What problems arise because of the structure of the
process? The</p><p>3 0.83868015 <a title="304-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-10-14-Who_is_Responsible_for_a_Bad_Review%3F.html">320 hunch net-2008-10-14-Who is Responsible for a Bad Review?</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Although I'm greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be
admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in
reviews. The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if theByzantine
generalslimit has been exceeded. For example, I've seen recent reviews where
the given reasons for rejecting are:[NIPS] Theorem A is uninteresting because
Theorem B is uninteresting.[UAI] When you learn by memorization, the problem
addressed is trivial.[NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.[NIPS] This has been
done before. (â&euro;Ś but not giving any relevant citations)Just for the record I
want to point out what's wrong with these reviews. A future world in which
such reasons never come up again would be great, but I'm sure these errors
will be committed many times more in the future.This is nonsense. A theorem
should be evaluated based on it's merits, rather than the merits of another
theorem.Learning by memorization requires an exponentially larger sample
complexity than man</p><p>4 0.83239281 <a title="304-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-26-The_SODA_Program_Committee.html">318 hunch net-2008-09-26-The SODA Program Committee</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a rather long post, detailing the ICML 2012 review process. The goal
is to make the process more transparent, help authors understand how we came
to a decision, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this process for
future conference organizers.Microsoft’s Conference Management Toolkit (CMT)We
chose to useCMTover other conference management software mainly because of its
rich toolkit. The interface is sub-optimal (to say the least!) but it has
extensive capabilities (to handle bids, author response, resubmissions, etc.),
good import/export mechanisms (to process the data elsewhere), excellent
technical support (to answer late night emails, add new functionalities).
Overall, it was the right choice, although we hope a designer will look at
that interface sometime soon!Toronto Matching System (TMS)TMSis now being used
by many major conferences in our field (including NIPS and UAI). It is an

on my website, I've chosen to post a slightly modified version here as well in
order to better facilitate discussion.Disclaimers and ContextI want to start
with a couple of disclaimers and some context.First, I want to point out that
although I've read a lot about double-blind review, this isn't my research
area and the research discussed in this post is not my own. As a result, I
probably can't answer super detailed questions about these studies.I also want
to note that I'm not opposed to open peer review -- I was a free and open
source software developer for over ten years and I care a great deal about
openness and transparency. Rather, my motivation in writing this post is
simply to create awareness of and to initiate discussion about the benefits of
double-blind review.Lastly, and most importantly, I think it's essential to

<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections. They
always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections
come to seem reasonable. Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the
topic just isn't as important as was originally thought. A few rejections do
not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror
stories, a great material for conversations. I've decided to share three of
mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.Prediction Theory for
Classification Tutorial. This is a tutorial about tight sample complexity
bounds for classification that I submitted toJMLR. The first decision I heard
was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me--for example one of the
reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics
books. Upon further inquiry, several citations were given, none of which
actually covered the content. Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was
accepted. Apparently, the pape</p><p>3 0.88998133 <a title="304-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-21-NIPS_paper_evaluation_criteria.html">180 hunch net-2006-05-21-NIPS paper evaluation criteria</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Platt, who is PC-chair forNIPS 2006has organized aNIPS paper evaluation
criteriadocument with input from theprogram committeeand others.The document
contains specific advice about what is appropriate for the various subareas
within NIPS. It may be very helpful, because the standards of evaluation for
papers varies significantly.This is a bit of an experiment: the hope is that
by carefully thinking about and stating what is important, authors can better
understand whether and where their work fits.Update: Thegeneral submission

<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research. They provide many
roles including "announcing research", "meeting people", and "point of
reference". Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: "to what
extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?" This question is
very difficult to answer in any satisfying way. What we can do is compare
details of the process across multiple conferences.CommentsThe average quality
of comments across conferences can vary dramatically. At one extreme, the
tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback. At
the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing
detailed constructive feedback. Detailed feedback can give authors significant
guidance about how to improve research. This is the most subjective
entry.BlindVirtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors
do not know reviewers. Some also providedouble blindreview where reviewers do
not know authors. T</p><p>5 0.87159419 <a title="304-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-16-Representative_Reviewing.html">484 hunch net-2013-06-16-Representative Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms
and/or change formats</p><p>6 0.86279136 <a title="304-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

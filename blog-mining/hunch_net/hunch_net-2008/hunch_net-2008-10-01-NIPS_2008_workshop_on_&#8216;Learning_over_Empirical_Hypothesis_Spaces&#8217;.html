<p>Introduction: As usualICML 2007will be hosting aworkshop programto be held this year on June
24th. The success of the program depends on having researchers like you
propose interesting workshop topics and then organize the workshops. I'd like
to encourage all of you to consider sending a workshop proposal. The proposal
deadline has been extended to March 5. See the workshop web-site for
details.Organizing a workshop is a unique way to gather an international group
of researchers together to focus for an entire day on a topic of your
choosing. I've always found that the cost of organizing a workshop is not so
large, and very low compared to the benefits. The topic and format of a
workshop are limited only by your imagination (and the attractiveness to
potential participants) and need not follow the usual model of a mini-
conference on a particular ML sub-area. Hope to see some interesting proposals
rolling in.</p><p>3 0.100504 <a title="319-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-23-Use_of_Learning_Theory.html">332 hunch net-2008-12-23-Use of Learning Theory</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I've had serious conversations with several people who believe that the theory
in machine learning is "only useful for getting papers published". That's a
compelling statement, as I've seen many papers where the algorithm clearly
came first, and the theoretical justification for it came second, purely as a
perceived means to improve the chance of publication.Naturally, I disagree and
believe that learning theory has much more substantial applications.Even in
core learning algorithm design, I've found learning theory to be useful,
although it's application is more subtle than many realize. The most
straightforward applications can fail, because (as expectation suggests) worst
case bounds tend to be loose in practice (*). In my experience, considering
learning theory when designing an algorithm has two important effects in
practice:It can help make your algorithm behave right at a crude level of
analysis, leaving finer details to tuning or common sense. The best example I
have of this is</p><p>4 0.098497249 <a title="319-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-24-The_Role_of_Workshops.html">46 hunch net-2005-03-24-The Role of Workshops</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A good workshop is often far more interesting than the papers at a conference.
This happens because a workshop has a much tighter focus than a conference.
Since you choose the workshops fitting your interest, the increased relevance
can greatly enhance the level of your interest and attention. Roughly
speaking, a workshop program consists of elements related to a subject of your
interest. The main conference program consists of elements related to
someone's interest (which is rarely your own). Workshops are more about doing
research while conferences are more about presenting research.Several
conferences have associated workshop programs, some with deadlines due
shortly.ICML workshopsDue April 1IJCAI workshopsDeadlines VaryKDD workshopsNot
yet finalizedAnyone going to these conferences should examine the workshops
and see if any are of interest. (If none are, then maybe you should organize
one next year.)</p><p>5 0.096133105 <a title="319-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-07-25-Upcoming_conference.html">198 hunch net-2006-07-25-Upcoming conference</a></p>

<p>Introduction: We'd like to invite hunch.net readers to participate in the NIPS 2008 workshop
on kernel learning. While the main focus is on automatically learning kernels
from data, we are also also looking at the broader questions of feature
selection, multi-task learning and multi-view learning. There are no
restrictions on the learning problem being addressed (regression,
classification, etc), and both theoretical and applied work will be
considered. The deadline for submissions isOctober 24.More detail can be
foundhere.Corinna Cortes, Arthur Gretton, Gert Lanckriet, Mehryar Mohri,

<p>Introduction: In research, it's often the case that solving a problem helps you realize that
it wasn't the right problem to solve. This is the case for the "reduce RL to
classification" problem with the solution hinted athereand turned into a
paperhere.The essential difficulty is that the method of stating and analyzing
reductions ends up being nonalgorithmic (unlike previous reductions) unless
you work with learning from teleoperated robots asGreg Grudicdoes. The
difficulty here is due to the reduction being dependent on the optimal policy
(which a human teleoperator might simulate, but which is otherwise
unavailable).So, thisproblemis "open" again with the caveat that this time we
want a more algorithmic solution.Whether or not this is feasible at all is
still unclear and evidence in either direction would greatly interest me. A
positive answer might have many practical implications in the long run.</p><p>3 0.86790812 <a title="319-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-16-KDNuggets.html">342 hunch net-2009-02-16-KDNuggets</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Many decision problems can be represented in the formFORn=1,2,â&euro;Ś:-- Reality
chooses a datumxn.-- Decision Maker chooses his decisiondn.-- Reality chooses
an observationyn.-- Decision Maker suffers lossL(yn,dn).END FOR.The
observationyncan be, for example, tomorrow's stock price and the decisiondnthe
number of shares Decision Maker chooses to buy. The datumxnideally contains
all information that might be relevant in making this decision. We do not want
to assume anything about the way Reality generates the observations and
data.Suppose there is a good and not too complex decision ruleDmapping each
datumxto a decisionD(x). Can we perform as well, or almost as well, asD,
without knowing it? This is essentially a special case of the problem ofon-
line learning.This is a simple result of this kind. Suppose the dataxnare
taken from [0,1] andL(y,d)=|y-d|. A norm ||h|| of a functionhon [0,1] is
defined by||h||2= (Integral01h(t)dt)2+ Integral01(h'(t))2dt.Decision Maker has

<p>Introduction: TheNew York Timeshas an article on thegrowth of spam. Interesting facts
include: 9/10 of all email is spam, spam source identification is nearly
useless due to botnet spam senders, and image based spam (emails which consist
of an image only) are on the growth.Estimates of the cost of spam are almost
certainly far to low, because they do not account for the cost in time lost by
people.The image based spam which is currently penetrating many filters should
be catchable with a more sophisticated application of machine learning
technology. For the spam I see, the rendered images come in only a few
formats, which would be easy to recognize via a support vector machine (with
RBF kernel), neural network, or even nearest-neighbor architecture. The
mechanics of setting this up to run efficiently is the only real challenge.
This is the next step in the spam war.The response to this system is to make
the image based spam even more random. We should (essentially) expect to

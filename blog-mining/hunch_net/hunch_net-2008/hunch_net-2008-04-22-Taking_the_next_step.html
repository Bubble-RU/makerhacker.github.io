<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>3 0.14334257 <a title="297-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-10-04-Health_of_Conferences_Wiki.html">212 hunch net-2006-10-04-Health of Conferences Wiki</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Martin Pooland I recently discussed the similarities and differences between
academia and open source programming.Similarities:Cost profileResearch and
programming share approximately the same cost profile: A large upfront effort
is required to produce something useful, and then "anyone" can use it. (The
"anyone" is not quite right for either group because only sufficiently
technical people could use it.)Wealth profileA "wealthy" academic or open
source programmer is someone who has contributed a lot to other people in
research or programs. Much of academia is a "gift culture": whoever gives the
most is most respected.ProblemsBoth academia and open source programming
suffer from similar problems.Whether or not (and which) open source program is
used are perhaps too-often personality driven rather than driven by capability
or usefulness. Similar phenomena can happen in academia with respect to
directions of research.Funding is often a problem for both groups. Academics

<p>Introduction: Chicago '05ended a couple of weeks ago. This was the sixthMachine Learning
Summer School, and the second one that used awiki. (The first was Berder '04,
thanks to Gunnar Raetsch.) Wikis are relatively easy to set up, greatly aid
social interaction, and should be used a lot more at summer schools and
workshops. They can even be used as the meeting's webpage, as a permanent
record of its participants' collaborations -- see for example the wiki/website
for last year'sNVO Summer School.A basic wiki is a collection of editable
webpages, maintained by software called awiki engine. The engine used at both
Berder and Chicago wasTikiWiki-- it is well documented and gets you something
running fast. It uses PHP and MySQL, but doesn't require you to know either.
Tikiwiki has far more features than most wikis, as it is really a fullContent
Management System. (My thanks to Sebastian Stark for pointing this out.) Here
are the features we found most useful:Bulletin boards, or forums. The most-

<p>Introduction: This is near the one month point, so it seems appropriate to consider meta-
issues for the moment.The number of posts is a bit over 20.The number of
people speaking up in discussions is about 10.The number of people viewing the
site is somewhat more than 100.I am (naturally) dissatisfied with many
things.Many of thepotential useshaven't been realized. This is partly a matter
of opportunity (no conferences in the last month), partly a matter of will (no
open problems because it's hard to give them up), and partly a matter of
tradition. In academia, there is a strong tradition of trying to get
everything perfectly right before presentation. This is somewhat contradictory
to the nature of making many posts, and it's definitely contradictory to the
idea of doing "public research". If that sort of idea is to pay off, it must
be significantly more succesful than previous methods. In an effort to
continue experimenting, I'm going to use the next week as "open problems
week".Spam is a problem.</p><p>3 0.59346724 <a title="297-lsi-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-08-16-Centmail_comments.html">367 hunch net-2009-08-16-Centmail comments</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Centmailis a scheme which makes charity donations have a secondary value, as a
stamp for email. When discussed onnewscientist,slashdot, and others, some of
the comments make the academic review process appear thoughtful. Some
prominent fallacies are:Costing money fallacy. Some commenters appear to
believe the system charges money per email. Instead, the basic idea is that
users get an extra benefit from donations to a charity and participation is
strictly voluntary. The solution to this fallacy is simply readingthe
details.Single solution fallacy. Some commenters seem to think this is
proposed as a complete solution to spam, and since not everyone will opt to
participate, it won't work. But a complete solution is not at all necessary or
even possible given theflag-day problem. Deployed machine learning systems for
fighting spam are great at taking advantage of a partial solution. The
solution to this fallacy is learning about machine learning. In the current
state of affairs, informed</p><p>4 0.58268422 <a title="297-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-23-%28Dis%29similarities_between_academia_and_open_source_programmers.html">105 hunch net-2005-08-23-(Dis)similarities between academia and open source programmers</a></p>

<p>Introduction: As part of aPASCALproject, the Slovenians have been filming various machine
learning events and placing them on the webhere. This includes, for example,
theChicago 2005 Machine Learning Summer Schoolas well as a number of other
summer schools, workshops, and conferences.There are some significant caveats
here--for example, I can't access it from Linux. Based upon the webserver
logs, I expect that is a problem for most people--Computer scientists are
particularly nonstandard in their choice of computing platform.Nevertheless,
the core idea here is excellent and details of compatibility can be fixed
later. With modern technology toys, there is no fundamental reason why the
process of announcing new work at a conference should happen only once and
only for the people who could make it to that room in that conference. The
problems solved include:The multitrack vs. single-track debate. ("Sometimes
the single track doesn't interest me" vs. "When it's multitrack I miss good

suspect we need to build it dynamically in response to which subsets of the

<p>Introduction: Davorhas been working to setupvideolectures.netwhich is the new site for the
many lecturesmentioned here. (Tragically, they seem to only be available in
windows media format.) I went throughmy own projectsand added a few links to
the videos. The day when every result is a set of {paper, slides, video} isn't
quite here yet, but it's within sight. (For many papers, of course, code is a
4th component.)</p><p>same-blog 3 0.85309482 <a title="297-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-22-Taking_the_next_step.html">297 hunch net-2008-04-22-Taking the next step</a></p>
<p>Introduction: At thelast ICML,Tom Dietterichasked me to look into systems for commenting on
papers. I've been slow getting to this, but it's relevant now.The essential
observation is that we now have many tools for online collaboration, but they
are not yet much used in academic research. If we can find the right way to
use them, then perhaps great things might happen, with extra kudos to the
first conference that manages to really create an online community. Various
conferences have been poking at this. For example,UAI has setup a wiki, COLT
hasstarted usingJoomla, with some dynamic content, and AAAI has been setting
up a "student blog". Similarly,Dinoj Surendransetup a twiki for theChicago
Machine Learning Summer School, which was quite useful for coordinating events
and other things.I believe the most important thing is a willingness to
experiment. A good place to start seems to be enhancing existing conference
websites. For example, theICML 2007 papers pageis basically only useful via
grep. A mu</p><p>4 0.7396189 <a title="297-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-09-28-Programming_Languages_for_Machine_Learning_Implementations.html">210 hunch net-2006-09-28-Programming Languages for Machine Learning Implementations</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Machine learning algorithms have a much better chance of being widely adopted
if they are implemented in some easy-to-use code. There are several important
concerns associated with machine learning which stress programming languages
on the ease-of-use vs. speed frontier.SpeedThe rate at which data sources are
growing seems to be outstripping the rate at which computational power is
growing, so it is important that we be able to eak out every bit of
computational power. Garbage collected languages (java,ocaml,perlandpython)
often have several issues here.Garbage collection often implies that floating
point numbers are "boxed": every float is represented by a pointer to a float.
Boxing can cause an order of magnitude slowdown because an extra nonlocalized
memory reference is made, and accesses to main memory can are many CPU cycles
long.Garbage collection often implies that considerably more memory is used
than is necessary. This has a variable effect. In some circumstances it
results in</p><p>5 0.7328645 <a title="297-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-17-Learning_Research_Programs.html">21 hunch net-2005-02-17-Learning Research Programs</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is an attempt to organize the broad research programs related to machine
learning currently underway. This isn't easy--this map is partial, the
categories often overlap, and there are many details left out. Nevertheless,
it is (perhaps) helpful to have some map of what is happening where. The word
'typical' should not be construed narrowly here.Learning TheoryFocuses on
analyzing mathematical models of learning, essentially no experiments. Typical
conference: COLT.Bayesian LearningBayes law is always used. Focus on methods
of speeding up or approximating integration, new probabilistic models, and
practical applications. Typical conferences: NIPS,UAIStructured
learningPredicting complex structured outputs, some applications. Typiical
conferences: NIPS, UAI, othersReinforcement LearningFocused on 'agent-in-the-
world' learning problems where the goal is optimizing reward. Typical

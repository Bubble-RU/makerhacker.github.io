<p>Introduction: Andrej Bauer has setup a  Mathematics and Computation  Blog.  As a first step he has tried to address the persistent and annoying problem of math on the web.  As a basic tool for precisely stating and transfering understanding of technical subjects, mathematics is very necessary.  Despite this necessity, every mechanism for expressing mathematics on the web seems unnaturally clumsy.  Here are some of the methods and their drawbacks:
  
  MathML   This was supposed to be the answer, but it has two severe drawbacks: “Internet Explorer” doesn’t read it and the language is an example of push-XML-to-the-limit which no one would ever consider writing in.  (In contrast, html is easy to write in.)  It’s also very annoying that math fonts must be installed independent of the browser, even for mozilla based browsers. 
 Create inline images.  This has several big drawbacks: font size is fixed for all viewers, you can’t cut & paste inside the images, and you can’t hyperlink from (say) symbol to de</p><p>6 0.042149067 <a title="294-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-22-Taking_the_next_step.html">297 hunch net-2008-04-22-Taking the next step</a></p>

<p>Introduction: At the  last ICML ,  Tom Dietterich  asked me to look into systems for commenting on papers.  I’ve been slow getting to this, but it’s relevant now.
 
The essential observation is that we now have many tools for online collaboration, but they are not yet much used in academic research.  If we can find the right way to use them, then perhaps great things might happen, with extra kudos to the first conference that manages to really create an online community.  Various conferences have been poking at this.  For example,  UAI has setup a wiki , COLT has  started using   Joomla , with some dynamic content, and AAAI has been setting up a “ student blog “.  Similarly,  Dinoj Surendran  setup a twiki for the  Chicago Machine Learning Summer School , which was quite useful for coordinating events and other things.
 
I believe the most important thing is a willingness to experiment.  A good place to start seems to be enhancing existing conference websites.  For example, the  ICML 2007 papers pag</p><p>4 0.47611305 <a title="294-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-17-Server_Update.html">354 hunch net-2009-05-17-Server Update</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Alina  and  Jake  point out the COLT  Call for Open Questions  due May 11.  In general, this is cool, and worth doing if you can come up with a crisp question.  In my case, I particularly enjoyed  crafting an open question  with precisely a form such that a  critic targeting my papers  would be forced to confront their fallacy or make a case for the reward.  But less esoterically, this is a way to get the attention of some very smart people focused on a problem that really matters, which is the real value.</p><p>4 0.34508798 <a title="294-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-06-Exact_Online_Learning_for_Classification.html">78 hunch net-2005-06-06-Exact Online Learning for Classification</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Jacob Abernethy and I have found a computationally tractable method for computing an optimal (or near optimal depending on setting) master algorithm combining expert predictions addressing  this open problem .  A draft is  here .  
 
The effect of this improvement seems to be about a factor of  2  decrease in the regret (= error rate minus best possible error rate) for the low error rate situation.  (At large error rates, there may be no significant difference.)  
 
There are some unfinished details still to consider:
  
 When we remove all of the approximation slack from online learning, is the result a satisfying learning algorithm, in practice?  I consider online learning is one of the more compelling methods of analyzing and deriving algorithms, but that expectation must be either met or not by this algorithm 
 Some extra details: The algorithm is optimal given a small amount of side information ( k  in the draft).  What is the best way to remove this side information?

<p>Introduction: Given John’s recent posts on CMU’s new machine learning department and “Deep Learning,” I asked for an opportunity to give a computational learning theory perspective on these issues.
 
To my mind, the answer to the question “Are the core problems from machine learning different from the core problems of statistics?” is a clear Yes.  The point of this post is to describe a core problem in machine learning that is computational in nature and will appeal to statistical learning folk (as an extreme example note that if P=NP– which, for all we know, is true– then we would suddenly find almost all of our favorite machine learning problems considerably more tractable).
 
If the central question of statistical learning theory were crudely summarized as “given a hypothesis with a certain loss bound over a test set, how well will it generalize?” then the central question of computational learning theory might be “how can we find such a hypothesis efficently (e.g., in polynomial-time)?”

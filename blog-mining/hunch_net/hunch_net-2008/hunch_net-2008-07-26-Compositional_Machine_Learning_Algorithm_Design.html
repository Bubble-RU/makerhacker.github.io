[sent-19, score-1.002]
</p><p>2 It more robustly transforms a supervised learner’s performance into good policy performance than any other reduction. [sent-20, score-0.394]
</p><p>3 The offset tree also has good computational properties, since it produces at most  log 2  k  binary examples per train or test event, where  k  is the number of actions. [sent-21, score-0.609]
</p><p>4 In some sense it’s unfair to include the offset tree because it hasn’t yet been formally published. [sent-22, score-0.555]
</p><p>5 The Epoch-greedy approach shows how to handle the explore/exploit tradeoff for learning in a contextual bandit setting as a function of a sample complexity bound. [sent-25, score-0.397]
</p><p>6 Occam’s Razor Bound   The Occam’s Razor bound limits the regret of an empirical error minimizing perceptron as  function of the number of examples. [sent-27, score-0.398]
</p><p>7 Each component above has been analyzed  in isolation  and is at least a reasonable approach (some are the best possible). [sent-30, score-0.471]
</p><p>8 Fitting these pieces together, we get an online learning algorithm (agnostic offset-tree perceptron) that chooses to explore uniformly at random amongst the actions with probability about  1/t 1/3  . [sent-32, score-0.424]
</p><p>9 There are three results in the left plot:     The blue line is a version of the component set where the Occam’s Razor bound and the Offset Tree reduction have been optimized for the realizable case. [sent-37, score-0.764]
</p><p>10 The two components that we tweaked are:     Realizable case Bound  It’s well known that in the realizable case the regret of a chosen classifier should scale as  1/t  rather than  1/t 0. [sent-40, score-0.719]
</p><p>11 The offset tree reduction can be altered to take this into account by eliminating the importance weight from all updates, and updating even for exploitation examples which are not drawn uniform randomly. [sent-46, score-0.756]
</p><p>12 The red line is what you get with exactly the component set stated above. [sent-47, score-0.379]
</p><p>13 We were curious about the degree to which a general purpose algorithm can perform well on this application as the realizable case algorithm is definitely broken when the problem is inherently noisy. [sent-48, score-0.53]
</p><p>14 The green line is from a component set where epoch greedy and the offset tree have been tweaked to keep track of and use the distribution over actions at every timestep. [sent-51, score-1.158]
</p><p>15 The tweaks used for the component set are:     Stochastic Epoch-Greedy  Instead of deterministically exploring every 1/(bound_gap) times, choose to explore with probability 1/(bound_gap), and pass this probability to the offset tree reduction. [sent-54, score-1.194]
</p><p>16 Importance Weighted Perceptron   We dealt with importance weights generated by the offset tree reduction by scaling any update by the importance weight. [sent-58, score-0.926]
</p><p>17 People may be dissatisfied with the component assembly approach to learning algorithm design, because all of the pieces are not analyzed together. [sent-59, score-0.718]
</p><p>18 We start by assembling a set of components which we know work well from individual component analysis. [sent-69, score-0.454]
</p><p>19 Then, we try to optimize the performance of the assembly by swapping components or improving individual components to address known properties of the problem or observed deficiencies. [sent-70, score-0.62]
</p><p>20 In this particular case, we end up with a better performing algorithm  and  better components (such as stochastic epoch greedy) which are directly reusable in other settings. [sent-71, score-0.357]

 Often generalizations don’t matter.  That’s not the case here, since every plausible application I’ve thought of involves loss functions substantially different from 0/1.

  As far as I know, the essence of the more general problem was first stated and analyzed with the  EXP4 algorithm (page 16)  (1998).

<p>Introduction: This post is about contextual bandit problems where, repeatedly:
  
 The world chooses features  x  and rewards for each action  r 1 ,…,r k   then announces the features  x  (but not the rewards). 
 A policy chooses an action  a . 
 The world announces the reward  r a   
  
The goal in these situations is to learn a policy which maximizes  r a   in expectation efficiently.  I’m thinking about all situations which fit the above setting, whether they are drawn IID or adversarially from round to round and whether they involve past logged data or rapidly learning via interaction.
 
One common drawback of all algorithms for solving this setting, is that they have a poor dependence on the number of actions.  For example if  k  is the number of actions,  EXP4 (page 66)  has a dependence on  k 0.5  ,  epoch-greedy  (and the simpler epsilon greedy) have a dependence on  k 1/3  , and the  offset tree  has a dependence on  k-1 .  These results aren’t directly comparable because different things a</p><p>4 0.18476298 <a title="311-tfidf-4" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-01-24-Specializations_of_the_Master_Problem.html">388 hunch net-2010-01-24-Specializations of the Master Problem</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One thing which is clear on a little reflection is that there exists a single master learning problem capable of encoding essentially all learning problems.  This problem is of course a very general sort of reinforcement learning where the world interacts with an agent as:
  
 The world announces an observation  x . 
 The agent makes a choice  a . 
 The world announces a reward  r . 
  
The goal here is to maximize the sum of the rewards over the time of the agent.  No particular structure relating  x  to  a  or  a  to  r  is implied by this setting so we do not know effective general algorithms for the agent.  It’s very easy to prove lower bounds showing that an agent cannot hope to succeed here—just consider the case where actions are unrelated to rewards.  Nevertheless, there is a real sense in which essentially all forms of life are agents operating in this setting, somehow succeeding.  The gap between these observations drives research—How can we find tractable specializations of</p><p>5 0.17539757 <a title="311-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-10-24-Contextual_Bandits.html">269 hunch net-2007-10-24-Contextual Bandits</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One of the fundamental underpinnings of the internet is advertising based content.  This has become much more effective due to targeted advertising where ads are specifically matched to interests.  Everyone is familiar with this, because everyone uses search engines and all search engines try to make money this way.
 
The problem of matching ads to interests is a natural machine learning problem in some ways since there is much information in who clicks on what.  A fundamental problem with this information is that it is not supervised—in particular a click-or-not on one ad doesn’t generally tell you if a different ad would have been clicked on.  This implies we have a fundamental exploration problem.
 
A standard mathematical setting for this situation is “ k -Armed Bandits”, often with various relevant embellishments.  The  k -Armed Bandit setting works on a round-by-round basis.  On each round:
  
 A policy chooses arm  a  from  1  of  k  arms (i.e. 1 of k ads).

<p>Introduction: This post is about a general technique for problem solving which I’ve never seen taught (in full generality), but which I’ve found very useful.
 
Many problems in computer science turn out to be discretely difficult.  The best known version of such problems are NP-hard problems, but I mean ‘discretely difficult’ in a much more general way, which I only know how to capture by examples.
  
  ERM  In empirical risk minimization, you choose a minimum error rate classifier from a set of classifiers.  This is NP hard for common sets, but it can be much harder, depending on the set. 
  Experts  In the online learning with experts setting, you try to predict well so as to compete with a set of (adversarial) experts.  Here the alternating quantifiers of you and an adversary playing out a game can yield a dynamic programming problem that grows exponentially.

<p>Introduction: There were  two   papers  at ICML presenting learning algorithms for a  contextual bandit -style setting, where the loss for all labels is not known, but the loss for one label is known.  (The first might require a  exploration scavenging  viewpoint to understand if the experimental assignment was nonrandom.)  I strongly approve of these papers and further work in this setting and its variants, because I expect it to become more important than supervised learning.  As a quick review, we are thinking about situations where repeatedly:
  
 The world reveals feature values (aka context information). 
 A policy chooses an action. 
 The world provides a reward. 
  
Sometimes this is done in an online fashion where the policy can change based on immediate feedback and sometimes it’s done in a batch setting where many samples are collected before the policy can change.  If you haven’t spent time thinking about the setting, you might want to because there are many natural applications.

<p>Introduction: Maybe it’s too early to call, but with four separate Neural Network sessions at this year’s  ICML ,  it looks like Neural Networks are making a comeback. Here are my  highlights of these sessions. In general, my feeling is that these  papers both demystify deep learning and show its broader applicability.
 
The first observation I made is that the once disreputable “Neural” nomenclature is being used again  in lieu of  “deep learning”. Maybe it’s because Adam Coates et al. showed that single layer networks can work surprisingly well.

<p>Introduction: How do we judge success in Machine Learning?  As  Aaron   notes , the best way is to use the loss imposed on you by the world.  This turns out to be infeasible sometimes for various reasons.  The ones I’ve seen are:
  
 The learned prediction is used in some complicated process that does not give the feedback necessary to understand the prediction’s impact on the loss.  
 The prediction is used by some other system which expects some semantics to the predicted value.  This is similar to the previous example, except that the issue is design modularity rather than engineering modularity. 
 The correct loss function is simply unknown (and perhaps unknowable, except by experimentation). 
  
In these situations, it’s unclear what metric for evaluation should be chosen.  This post has some design advice for this murkier case.  I’m using the word “metric” here to distinguish the fact that we are considering methods for  evaluating  predictive systems rather than a loss imposed by the real wor</p><p>4 0.87617517 <a title="311-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-05-02-Wielding_a_New_Abstraction.html">351 hunch net-2009-05-02-Wielding a New Abstraction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This post is partly meant as an advertisement for the  reductions tutorial   Alina ,  Bianca , and I are planning to do at  ICML .  Please come, if you are interested.
 
Many research programs can be thought of as finding and building new useful abstractions.  The running example I’ll use is  learning reductions  where I have experience.  The basic abstraction here is that we can build a learning algorithm capable of solving classification problems up to a small expected regret.   This is used repeatedly to solve more complex problems.
 
In working on a new abstraction, I think you typically run into many substantial problems of understanding, which make publishing particularly difficult.
  
 It is difficult to seriously discuss the reason behind or mechanism for abstraction in a conference paper with small page limits.  People rarely see such discussions and hence have little basis on which to think about new abstractions.    Another difficulty is that when building an abstraction, yo</p><p>5 0.87502027 <a title="311-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated_Gradient.html">258 hunch net-2007-08-12-Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The  Exponentiated Gradient  algorithm by  Manfred Warmuth  and  Jyrki Kivinen  came out just as I was starting graduate school, so I missed it both at a conference and in class.  It’s a fine algorithm which has a remarkable theoretical statement accompanying it.
 
The essential statement holds in the “online learning with an adversary” setting.  Initially, there are of set of  n  weights, which might have values  (1/n,…,1/n) , (or any other values from a probability distribution).  Everything happens in a round-by-round fashion.  On each round, the following happens:
  
 The world reveals a set of features  x in {0,1} n  .  In the online learning with an adversary literature, the features are called “experts” and thought of as subpredictors, but this interpretation isn’t necessary—you can just use feature values as experts (or maybe the feature value and the negation of the feature value as two experts). 
 EG makes a prediction according to  y’ = w . x  (dot product).

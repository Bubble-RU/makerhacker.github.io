<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections.  They always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections come to seem reasonable.  Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the topic just isn’t as important as was originally thought.  A few rejections do not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror stories, a great material for conversations.  I’ve decided to share three of mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.
  
  Prediction Theory for Classification Tutorial .  This is a tutorial about tight sample complexity bounds for classification that I submitted to  JMLR .  The first decision I heard was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me—for example one of the reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics books.  Upon further inquiry, several citations were given, none of which actually covered the content.  Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was accepted.

<p>Introduction: This post is by Daniel Hsu and John Langford.
 
In selective sampling style active learning, a learning algorithm chooses which examples to label.  We now have an active learning algorithm that is:
  
  Efficient  in label complexity, unlabeled complexity, and computational complexity. 
  Competitive  with supervised learning anywhere that supervised learning works. 
  Compatible  with online learning, with any optimization-based learning algorithm, with any loss function, with offline testing, and even with changing learning algorithms. 
  Empirically  effective. 
  
The basic idea is to combine  disagreement region-based sampling  with  importance weighting : an example is selected to be labeled with probability proportional to how useful it is for distinguishing among near-optimal classifiers, and labeled examples are importance-weighted by the inverse of these probabilities.  The combination of these simple ideas removes the  sampling bias  problem that has plagued many previous he</p><p>5 0.13230559 <a title="310-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-15-In_Active_Learning%2C_the_question_changes.html">360 hunch net-2009-06-15-In Active Learning, the question changes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: A little over 4 years ago,  Sanjoy   made a post  saying roughly “we should  study active learning theoretically, because not much is understood”.   
 
At the time, we did not understand basic things such as whether or not it was possible to PAC-learn with an active algorithm without making strong assumptions about the noise rate.  In other words, the fundamental question was “can we do it?”
 
The nature of the question has fundamentally changed in my mind.   The answer is to the previous question is “yes”, both information theoretically and computationally, most places where supervised learning could be applied.  
 
In many situation, the question has now changed to: “is it worth it?”  Is the programming and computational overhead low enough to make the label cost savings of active learning worthwhile?  Currently, there are situations where this question could go either way.  Much of the challenge for the future is in figuring out how to make active learning easier or more worthwhile.</p><p>6 0.11341457 <a title="310-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-11-28-A_Bumper_Crop_of_Machine_Learning_Graduates.html">329 hunch net-2008-11-28-A Bumper Crop of Machine Learning Graduates</a></p>

<p>Introduction: I learned a number of things at  NIPS .
  
 The financial people were there in greater force than previously.   Two Sigma  sponsored NIPS while  DRW Trading  had a booth. 
 The  adversarial machine learning workshop  had a number of talks about interesting applications where an adversary really is out to try and mess up your learning algorithm.  This is very different from the situation we often think of where the world is oblivious to our learning.  This may present new and convincing applications for the learning-against-an-adversary work common at  COLT . 
 There were several interesing papers.
 
  Sanjoy Dasgupta ,  Daniel Hsu , and  Claire Monteleoni  had a paper on  General Agnostic Active Learning .  The basic idea is that active learning can be done via reduction to a form of supervised learning problem.  This is great, because we have many supervised learning algorithms from which the benefits of active learning may be derived.

<p>Introduction: Here are a few papers from  COLT 2008  that I found interesting.
  
  Maria-Florina Balcan ,  Steve Hanneke , and  Jenn Wortman ,  The True Sample Complexity of Active Learning .  This paper shows that in an asymptotic setting, active learning is  always  better than supervised learning (although the gap may be small).  This is evidence that the only thing in the way of universal active learning is us knowing how to do it properly. 
  Nir Ailon  and  Mehryar Mohri ,  An Efficient Reduction of Ranking to Classification .  This paper shows how to robustly rank  n  objects with  n log(n)  classifications using a quicksort based algorithm.  The result is applicable to many ranking loss functions and has implications for others. 
  Michael Kearns  and  Jennifer Wortman .  Learning from Collective Behavior .  This is about learning in a new model, where the goal is to predict how a collection of interacting agents behave.  One claim is that learning in this setting can be reduced to IID lear</p><p>2 0.83120894 <a title="310-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2007/hunch_net-2007-12-20-Cool_and_Interesting_things_at_NIPS%2C_take_three.html">280 hunch net-2007-12-20-Cool and Interesting things at NIPS, take three</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Following up on Hal Daume’s post and John’s post on cool and interesting things seen at NIPS I’ll post my own little list of neat papers here as well.  Of course it’s going to be biased towards what I think is interesting.  Also, I have to say that I hadn’t been able to see many papers this year at nips due to myself being too busy, so please feel free to contribute the papers that you liked   
 
1. P. Mudigonda, V. Kolmogorov, P. Torr.  An Analysis of Convex Relaxations for MAP Estimation.  A surprising paper which shows that many of the more sophisticated convex relaxations that had been proposed recently turns out to be subsumed by the simplest LP relaxation.  Be careful next time you try a cool new convex relaxation!
 
2. D. Sontag, T. Jaakkola.  New Outer Bounds on the Marginal Polytope.  The title says it all.

<p>Introduction: One way to organize learning theory is by assumption (in the  assumption = axiom sense ), from no assumptions to many assumptions.   As you travel down this list, the statements become stronger, but the scope of applicability decreases.
  
   No assumptions 
 
  Online learning  There exist a meta prediction algorithm which compete well with the best element of any set of prediction algorithms. 
  Universal Learning  Using a “bias” of 2 - description length of turing machine  in learning is equivalent to all other computable biases up to some constant. 
  Reductions  The ability to predict well on classification problems is equivalent to the ability to predict well on many other learning problems.
 
 
 
  Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) Data 
 
  Performance Prediction  Based upon past performance, you can predict future performance. 
  Uniform Convergence  Performance prediction works even after choosing classifiers based on the data from large sets of classifiers.</p><p>4 0.57401341 <a title="310-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-02-07-The_State_of_the_Reduction.html">14 hunch net-2005-02-07-The State of the Reduction</a></p>
<p>Introduction: What?  Reductions are machines which turn solvers for one problem into solvers for another problem. 
 Why?  Reductions are useful for several reasons.
  
  Laziness .  Reducing a problem to classification make at least 10 learning algorithms available to solve a problem.  Inventing 10 learning algorithms is quite a bit of work.  Similarly, programming a reduction is often trivial, while programming a learning algorithm is a great deal of work. 
  Crystallization .  The problems we often want to solve in learning are worst-case-impossible, but average case feasible.  By reducing all problems onto one or a few primitives, we can fine tune these primitives to perform well on real-world problems with greater precision due to the greater number of problems to validate on. 
  Theoretical Organization .  By studying what reductions are easy vs. hard vs. impossible, we can learn which problems are roughly equivalent in difficulty and which are much harder. 
  
 What we know now .

<p>Introduction: Hal  asks   a very good question: “When is the right time to insert the loss function?”  In particular, should it be used at testing time or at training time?
 
When the world imposes a loss on us, the standard Bayesian recipe is to predict the (conditional) probability of each possibility and then choose the possibility which minimizes the expected loss.  In contrast, as the  confusion  over “loss = money lost” or “loss = the thing you optimize” might indicate, many people ignore the Bayesian approach and simply optimize their loss (or a close proxy for their loss) over the representation on the training set.
 
The best answer I can give is “it’s unclear, but I prefer optimizing the loss at training time”.  My experience is that optimizing the loss in the most direct manner possible typically yields best performance.  This question is related to a basic principle which both  Yann LeCun (applied) and  Vladimir Vapnik (theoretical) advocate: “solve the simplest prediction problem that s</p><p>6 0.56895971 <a title="310-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-01-07-NYU_Large_Scale_Machine_Learning_Class.html">478 hunch net-2013-01-07-NYU Large Scale Machine Learning Class</a></p>

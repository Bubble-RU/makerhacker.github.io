<p>Introduction: I found the article about  science using modern tools interesting , especially the part about ‘blogophobia’, which in my experience is often a substantial issue: many potential guest posters aren’t quite ready, because of the fear of a permanent public mistake, because it is particularly hard to write about the unknown (the essence of research), and because the system for public credit doesn’t yet really handle blog posts.

<p>Introduction: It’s been almost two years since this blog began.  In that time, I’ve learned enough to shift my expectations in several ways.
  
 Initially, the idea was for a general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts.  What has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that I greatly value.  There are a few reasons I see for this.
 
  Overload .  A couple years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a researcher.  Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etc…}.  This is a substantial transition away from what life as a graduate student is like.  At some point the question is not “when will I get to it?” but rather “will I get to it?” and the answer starts to become “no” most of the time.

<p>Introduction: The internet has significantly effected the way we do research but it’s capabilities have not yet been fully realized.
 
First, let’s acknowledge some known effects.
  
  Self-publishing  By default, all researchers in machine learning (and more generally computer science and physics) place their papers online for anyone to download.  The exact mechanism differs—physicists tend to use a central repository ( Arxiv ) while computer scientists tend to place the papers on their webpage.  Arxiv has been slowly growing in subject breadth so it now sometimes used by computer scientists. 
  Collaboration  Email has enabled working remotely with coauthors.  This has allowed collaborationis which would not otherwise have been possible and generally speeds research. 
  
Now, let’s look at attempts to go further.
  
  Blogs  (like this one) allow public discussion about topics which are not easily categorized as “a new idea in machine learning” (like this topic).

<p>Introduction: One viewpoint on academia is that it is inherently adversarial: there are finite research dollars, positions, and students to work with, implying a zero-sum game between different participants.  This is not a viewpoint that I want to promote, as I consider it flawed.  However, I know several people believe strongly in this viewpoint, and I have found it to have  substantial explanatory power.
 
For example:
  
 It explains why your paper was rejected based on poor logic.  The reviewer wasn’t concerned with research quality, but rather with rejecting a competitor. 
 It explains why professors rarely work together.  The goal of a non-tenured professor (at least) is to get tenure, and a case for tenure comes from a portfolio of work that is undisputably yours. 
 It explains why new research programs are not quickly adopted.  Adopting a competitor’s program is impossible, if your career is based on the competitor being wrong. 
  
Different academic groups subscribe to the adversarial viewp</p><p>6 0.10573845 <a title="296-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-11-26-The_Design_of_an_Optimal_Research_Environment.html">132 hunch net-2005-11-26-The Design of an Optimal Research Environment</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is the  6 month point  in the “run a research blog” experiment, so it seems like a good point to take stock and assess.  
 
One fundamental question is: “Is it worth it?”  The idea of running a research blog will never become widely popular and useful unless it actually aids research.  On the negative side, composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount of time.  On the positive side, the process might yield better research because there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster thinking.
 
My answer at the moment is a provisional “yes”.  Running the blog has been incidentally helpful in several ways:
  
 It is sometimes educational.  example  
 More often, the process of composing thoughts well enough to post simply aids thinking.  This has resulted in a couple solutions to problems of  interest  (and perhaps more over time).  If you really want to solve a problem, letting the world know is helpful.  This isn’t necessarily</p><p>5 0.61872661 <a title="296-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-04-Science_in_the_Government.html">106 hunch net-2005-09-04-Science in the Government</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found the article on “ Political Science ” at the  New York Times  interesting.  Essentially the article is about allegations that the US government has been systematically distorting scientific views.   With a  petition  by some  7000+ scientists  alleging such behavior this is clearly a significant concern.
 
One thing not mentioned explicitly in this discussion is that there are fundamental cultural differences between academic research and the rest of the world.  In academic research, careful, clear thought is valued.  This value is achieved by both formal and informal mechanisms.  One example of a formal mechanism is peer review.
 
In contrast, in the land of politics, the basic value is agreement.  It is only with some amount of agreement that a new law can be passed or other actions can be taken.  Since Science (with a capitol ‘S’) has accomplished many things, it can be a significant tool in persuading people.  This makes it compelling for a politician to use science as a mec</p><p>6 0.56882113 <a title="296-lsi-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-06-Research_Political_Issues.html">282 hunch net-2008-01-06-Research Political Issues</a></p>

Learning near-optimal policies with Bellman-residual minimization based fitted policy iteration and a single sample path 
AndrÃƒÂ¡s Antos, Csaba SzepesvÃƒÂ¡ri, RÃƒÂ©mi Munos 
Again, on the list to read. I saw Csaba and Remi talk about this and related work at an ICML Workshop on Kernel Reinforcement Learning. The big question in my head is how this compares/contrasts with existing work in  reductions to reinforcement learning.  Are there advantages/disadvantages?

<p>Introduction: I found the article about  science using modern tools interesting , especially the part about ‘blogophobia’, which in my experience is often a substantial issue: many potential guest posters aren’t quite ready, because of the fear of a permanent public mistake, because it is particularly hard to write about the unknown (the essence of research), and because the system for public credit doesn’t yet really handle blog posts.
 
So far, science has been relatively resistant to discussing research on blogs.  Some things need to change to get there.  Public tolerance of the occasional mistake is essential, as is a willingness to cite (and credit) blogs as freely as papers.  
 
I’ve often run into another reason for holding back myself: I don’t want to overtalk my own research.  Nevertheless, I’m slowly changing to the opinion that I’m holding back too much: the real power of a blog in research is that it can be used to confer with many people, and that just makes research work better.</p><p>3 0.75276715 <a title="296-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-05-21-NIPS_paper_evaluation_criteria.html">180 hunch net-2006-05-21-NIPS paper evaluation criteria</a></p>
<p>Introduction: John Platt , who is PC-chair for  NIPS 2006  has organized a  NIPS paper evaluation criteria  document with input from the  program committee  and others.  
 
The document contains specific advice about what is appropriate for the various subareas within NIPS.  It may be very helpful, because the standards of evaluation for papers varies significantly.  
 
This is a bit of an experiment: the hope is that by carefully thinking about and stating what is important, authors can better understand whether and where their work fits.

<p>Introduction: This is a rather long post, detailing the ICML 2012 review process. The goal is to make the process more transparent, help authors understand how we came to a decision, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this process for future conference organizers.
 
 Microsoft’s Conference Management Toolkit (CMT)  
We chose to use  CMT  over other conference management software mainly because of its rich toolkit. The interface is sub-optimal (to say the least!) but it has extensive capabilities (to handle bids, author response, resubmissions, etc.), good import/export mechanisms (to process the data elsewhere), excellent technical support (to answer late night emails, add new functionalities).  Overall, it was the right choice, although we hope a designer will look at that interface sometime soon!
 
 Toronto Matching System (TMS)  
  TMS  is now being used by many major conferences in our field (including NIPS and UAI).

<p>Introduction: It turns out that many different people use the term “Online Learning”, and often they don’t have the same definition in mind.  Here’s a list of the possibilities I know of.  
  
  Online Information Setting   Online learning refers to a  problem  in which unlabeled data comes, a prediction is made, and then feedback is acquired. 
  Online Adversarial Setting  Online learning refers to  algorithms  in the Online Information Setting which satisfy guarantees of the form: “For all possible sequences of observations, the algorithim has regret at most  log ( number of strategies)  with respect to the best strategy in a set.”  This is sometimes called online learning with experts. 
  Online Optimization Constraint  Online learning refers to optimizing a predictor via a learning algorithm tunes parameters on a per-example basis.  This may or may not be applied in the Online Information Setting, and the strategy may or may not satisfy Adversarial setting theory.

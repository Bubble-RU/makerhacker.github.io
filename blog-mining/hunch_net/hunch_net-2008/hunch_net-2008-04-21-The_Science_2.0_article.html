<p>Introduction: It's been almost two years since this blog began. In that time, I've learned
enough to shift my expectations in several ways.Initially, the idea was for a
general purpose ML blog where different people could contribute posts. What
has actually happened is most posts come from me, with a few guest posts that
I greatly value. There are a few reasons I see for this.Overload. A couple
years ago, I had not fully appreciated just how busy life gets for a
researcher. Making a post is not simply a matter of getting to it, but rather
of prioritizing between {writing a grant, finishing an overdue review, writing
a paper, teaching a class, writing a program, etcâ&euro;Ś}. This is a substantial
transition away from what life as a graduate student is like. At some point
the question is not "when will I get to it?" but rather "will I get to it?"
and the answer starts to become "no" most of the time.Feedback failure. This
blog currently receives about 3K unique visitors per day from about 13K unique

<p>Introduction: This is the6 month pointin the "run a research blog" experiment, so it seems
like a good point to take stock and assess.One fundamental question is: "Is it
worth it?" The idea of running a research blog will never become widely
popular and useful unless it actually aids research. On the negative side,
composing ideas for a post and maintaining a blog takes a significant amount
of time. On the positive side, the process might yield better research because
there is an opportunity for better, faster feedback implying better, faster
thinking.My answer at the moment is a provisional "yes". Running the blog has
been incidentally helpful in several ways:It is sometimes
educational.exampleMore often, the process of composing thoughts well enough
to post simply aids thinking. This has resulted in a couple solutions to
problems ofinterest(and perhaps more over time). If you really want to solve a

parallel and distributed environments. The general interest level in parallel
learning seems to be growing rapidly, so I expect quite a bit of attendance.

<p>Introduction: When I was thinking about the best "10 year paper" forICML, I also took a look
at a few other conferences. Here is one from 10 years ago that interested
me:David McAllesterPAC-Bayesian Model Averaging,COLT1999.2001 Journal
Draft.Prior to this paper, the only mechanism known for controlling or
estimating the necessary sample complexity for learning over continuously
parameterized predictors was VC theory and variants, all of which suffered
from a basic problem: they were incredibly pessimistic in practice. This meant
that only very gross guidance could be provided for learning algorithm design.
The PAC-Bayes bound provided an alternative approach to sample complexity
bounds which was radically tighter, quantitatively. It also imported and
explained many of the motivations for Bayesian learning in a way that learning
theory and perhaps optimization people might appreciate. Since this paper came
out, there have been a number of moderately successful attempts to drive
algorithms directly b</p><p>5 0.65907574 <a title="296-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-01-06-Research_Political_Issues.html">282 hunch net-2008-01-06-Research Political Issues</a></p>

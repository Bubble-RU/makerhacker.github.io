<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively

<p>Introduction: as of last night, late.When the reviewing deadline passed Wednesday night 15%
of reviews were still missing, much higher than I expected. Between late
reviews coming in, ACs working overtime through the weekend, and people
willing to help in the pinch another ~390 reviews came in, reducing the
missing mass to 0.2%. Nailing that last bit and a similar quantity of papers
with uniformly low confidence reviews is what remains to be done in terms of
basic reviews. We are trying to make all of those happen this week so authors
have some chance to respond.I was surprised by the quantity of late reviews,
and I think that's an area where ICML needs to improve in future years. Good
reviews are not done in a rush--they are done by setting aside time (like an
afternoon), and carefully reading the paper while thinking about implications.
Many reviewers do this well but a significant minority aren't good at
scheduling their personal time. In this situation there are several ways to
fail:Give early w</p><p>6 0.23772937 <a title="315-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-13-Avoiding_Bad_Reviewing.html">40 hunch net-2005-03-13-Avoiding Bad Reviewing</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Although I'm greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be
admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in
reviews. The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if theByzantine
generalslimit has been exceeded. For example, I've seen recent reviews where
the given reasons for rejecting are:[NIPS] Theorem A is uninteresting because
Theorem B is uninteresting.[UAI] When you learn by memorization, the problem
addressed is trivial.[NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.[NIPS] This has been
done before. (â&euro;Ś but not giving any relevant citations)Just for the record I
want to point out what's wrong with these reviews. A future world in which
such reasons never come up again would be great, but I'm sure these errors
will be committed many times more in the future.This is nonsense. A theorem
should be evaluated based on it's merits, rather than the merits of another
theorem.Learning by memorization requires an exponentially larger sample
complexity than man</p><p>4 0.89615822 <a title="315-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-02-ICML%3A_Behind_the_Scenes.html">463 hunch net-2012-05-02-ICML: Behind the Scenes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This is a difficult subject to talk about for many reasons, but a discussion
may be helpful.Bad reviewing is a problem in academia. The first step in
understanding this is admitting to the problem, so here is a short list of
examples of bad reviewing.Reviewer disbelieves theorem proof (ICML), or
disbelieve theorem with a trivially false counterexample. (COLT)Reviewer
internally swaps quantifiers in a theorem, concludes it has been done before
and is trivial. (NIPS)Reviewer believes a technique will not work despite
experimental validation. (COLT)Reviewers fail to notice flaw in theorem
statement (CRYPTO).Reviewer erroneously claims that it has been done before
(NIPS, SODA, JMLR)--(complete with references!)Reviewer inverts the message of
a paper and concludes it says nothing important. (NIPS*2)Reviewer fails to
distinguish between a DAG and a tree (SODA).Reviewer is enthusiastic about
paper but clearly does not understand (ICML).Reviewer erroneously believe that

<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers
is via bidding, which has steps something like:Invite people to reviewAccept
papersReviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are
interested in reviewing.Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get
approximately the papers they bid for.At the ICML business meeting,Andrew
McCallumsuggested getting rid of bidding for papers. A couple reasons were
given:PrivacyThe title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to
every participating reviewer. Some authors might be uncomfortable about this
for submitted papers. I'm not sympathetic to this reason: the point of
submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not
publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited.CliquesA bidding
system is gameable. If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your
submissions, you can each bid for your friend's papers and express a
disinterest in others. There</p><p>2 0.880364 <a title="315-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-09-NYAS_ML_Symposium_this_year..html">377 hunch net-2009-11-09-NYAS ML Symposium this year.</a></p>
<p>Introduction: TheNYAS ML symposiumgrew again this year to 170 participants, despite the need
to outsmart or otherwise tunnel througha crowd.Perhaps the most distinct talk
was by Bob Bell on various aspects of theNetflix prizecompetition. I also
enjoyed several student posters includingMatt Hoffman's cool examples of blind
source separation for music.I'm somewhat surprised how much the workshop has
grown, as it is now comparable in size to a small conference, although in
style more similar to a workshop. At some point as an event grows, it becomes
owned by the community rather than the organizers, so if anyone has
suggestions on improving it, speak up and be heard.</p><p>3 0.8424927 <a title="315-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2006/hunch_net-2006-06-16-Regularization_%3D_Robustness.html">185 hunch net-2006-06-16-Regularization = Robustness</a></p>
<p>Introduction: The Gibbs-Jaynes theorem is a classical result that tells us that the highest
entropy distribution (most uncertain, least committed, etc.) subject to
expectation constraints on a set of features is an exponential family
distribution with the features as sufficient statistics. In math,argmax_p
H(p)s.t. E_p[f_i] = c_iis given by e^{\sum \lambda_i f_i}/Z. (Z here is the
necessary normalization constraint, and the lambdas are free parameters we set
to meet the expectation constraints).A great deal of statistical mechanics
flows from this result, and it has proven very fruitful in learning as well.
(Motivating work in models in text learning and Conditional Random Fields, for
instance. ) The result has been demonstrated a number of ways. One of the most
elegant is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“geometricÃ¢â‚¬Â versionhere.In the case when the
expectation constraints come from data, this tells us that the maximum entropy
distribution is exactly the maximum likelihood distribution in the exponential
family. ItÃ</p><p>4 0.77986318 <a title="315-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-06-28-A_COLT_paper.html">85 hunch net-2005-06-28-A COLT paper</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found Tong Zhang's paper onData Dependent Concentration Bounds for
Sequential Prediction Algorithmsinteresting. Roughly speaking, it states a
tight bound on the future error rate for online learning algorithms assuming
that samples are drawn independently. This bound is easily computed and will
make the progressive validation approaches usedheresignificantly more
practical.</p><p>5 0.7586661 <a title="315-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-04-Why_Reinforcement_Learning_is_Important.html">100 hunch net-2005-08-04-Why Reinforcement Learning is Important</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One prescription for solving a problem well is:State the problem, in the
simplest way possible. In particular, this statement should involve no
contamination with or anticipation of the solution.Think about solutions to
the stated problem.Stating a problem in a succinct and crisp manner tends to
invite a simple elegant solution. When a problem can not be stated succinctly,
we wonder if the problem is even understood. (And when a problem is not
understood, we wonder if a solution can be meaningful.)Reinforcement learning
does step (1) well. It provides a clean simple language to state general AI
problems. In reinforcement learning there is a set of actionsA, a set of
observationsO, and a rewardr. The reinforcement learning problem, in general,
is defined by a conditional measureD( o, r | (o,r,a)*)which produces an
observationoand a rewardrgiven a history(o,r,a)*. The goal in reinforcement
learning is to find a policypi:(o,r,a)*-> amapping histories to actions so as
to maximize (or appro</p><p>6 0.74102736 <a title="315-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>

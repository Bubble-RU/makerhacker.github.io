<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some conception of what good reviewing is.  As far as I can tell, this is almost always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a “good paper” looks like for that area) rather than general principles.  Neither individual papers or areas are sufficiently general for a large conference—every paper differs in the details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?
 
An unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too large.  In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper which someone thinks might be of interest.  This reason for reviewing exists independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual conferences.  Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively meaningless over the long term — growing conferences simply use more rooms and/or change fo</p><p>3 0.32725072 <a title="315-tfidf-3" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-18-Decision_by_Vetocracy.html">343 hunch net-2009-02-18-Decision by Vetocracy</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Few would mistake the process of academic paper review for a fair process, but sometimes the unfairness seems particularly striking.  This is most easily seen by comparison:
  
 
 Paper 
  Banditron  
  Offset Tree  
 Notes 
 
 
 Problem Scope 
 Multiclass problems where only the loss of one choice can be probed. 
 Strictly greater: Cost sensitive multiclass problems where only the loss of one choice can be probed. 
 Often generalizations don’t matter.  That’s not the case here, since every plausible application I’ve thought of involves loss functions substantially different from 0/1.

 Microsoft’s Conference Management Toolkit (CMT)  
We chose to use  CMT  over other conference management software mainly because of its rich toolkit. The interface is sub-optimal (to say the least!) but it has extensive capabilities (to handle bids, author response, resubmissions, etc.), good import/export mechanisms (to process the data elsewhere), excellent technical support (to answer late night emails, add new functionalities).  Overall, it was the right choice, although we hope a designer will look at that interface sometime soon!

<p>Introduction: as of last night, late.
 
When the reviewing deadline passed Wednesday night 15% of reviews were still missing, much higher than I expected.  Between late reviews coming in, ACs working overtime through the weekend, and people willing to help in the pinch another ~390 reviews came in, reducing the missing mass to 0.2%.  Nailing that last bit and a similar quantity of papers with uniformly low confidence reviews is what remains to be done in terms of basic reviews.  We are trying to make all of those happen this week so authors have some chance to respond.
 
I was surprised by the quantity of late reviews, and I think that’s an area where ICML needs to improve in future years.  Good reviews are not done in a rush—they are done by setting aside time (like an afternoon), and carefully reading the paper while thinking about implications.  Many reviewers do this well but a significant minority aren’t good at scheduling their personal time.

<p>Introduction: Although I’m greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in reviews.  The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if the  Byzantine generals  limit has been exceeded.  For example, I’ve seen recent reviews where the given reasons for rejecting are:
  
 [ NIPS ] Theorem A is uninteresting because Theorem B is uninteresting. 
 [ UAI ] When you learn by memorization, the problem addressed is trivial. 
 [NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.  
 [NIPS] This has been done before.  (… but not giving any relevant citations)  
  
Just for the record I want to point out what’s wrong with these reviews.  A future world in which such reasons never come up again would be great, but I’m sure these errors will be committed many times more in the future.
  
 This is nonsense.  A theorem should be evaluated based on it’s merits, rather than the merits of another theorem. 
 Learning by memorization requires an expon</p><p>5 0.88580799 <a title="315-lsi-5" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-02-ICML%3A_Behind_the_Scenes.html">463 hunch net-2012-05-02-ICML: Behind the Scenes</a></p>

<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers is via bidding, which has steps something like:
  
 Invite people to review 
 Accept papers 
 Reviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are interested in reviewing. 
 Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get approximately the papers they bid for. 
  
At the ICML business meeting,  Andrew McCallum  suggested getting rid of bidding for papers.  A couple reasons were given:
  
  Privacy  The title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to every participating reviewer.  Some authors might be uncomfortable about this for submitted papers.  I’m not sympathetic to this reason: the point of submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited. 
  Cliques   A bidding system is gameable.  If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your submissions, you can each bid for your friend’s papers a</p><p>3 0.70626968 <a title="315-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2012/hunch_net-2012-05-02-ICML%3A_Behind_the_Scenes.html">463 hunch net-2012-05-02-ICML: Behind the Scenes</a></p>
<p>Introduction: This is a rather long post, detailing the ICML 2012 review process. The goal is to make the process more transparent, help authors understand how we came to a decision, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this process for future conference organizers.
 
 Microsoft’s Conference Management Toolkit (CMT)  
We chose to use  CMT  over other conference management software mainly because of its rich toolkit. The interface is sub-optimal (to say the least!) but it has extensive capabilities (to handle bids, author response, resubmissions, etc.), good import/export mechanisms (to process the data elsewhere), excellent technical support (to answer late night emails, add new functionalities).  Overall, it was the right choice, although we hope a designer will look at that interface sometime soon!
 
 Toronto Matching System (TMS)  
  TMS  is now being used by many major conferences in our field (including NIPS and UAI). It is an automated system (developed by  Laurent Charlin  and  Rich Ze</p><p>4 0.68407154 <a title="315-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-03-13-Avoiding_Bad_Reviewing.html">40 hunch net-2005-03-13-Avoiding Bad Reviewing</a></p>
<p>Introduction: If we accept that bad reviewing often occurs and want to fix it, the question is “how”?
 
Reviewing is done by paper writers just like yourself, so a good proxy for this question is asking “How can I be a better reviewer?”  Here are a few things I’ve learned by trial (and error), as a paper writer, and as a reviewer.
  
 The secret ingredient is careful thought.  There is no good substitution for a deep and careful understanding. 
 Avoid reviewing papers that you feel competitive about.  You almost certainly will be asked to review papers that feel competitive if you work on subjects of common interest.  But, the feeling of competition can easily lead to bad judgement. 
 If you feel biased for some other reason, then you should avoid reviewing.  For example… 
 Feeling angry or threatened by a paper is a form of bias.  See above. 
 Double blind yourself (avoid looking at the name even in a single-blind situation).  The significant effect of a name you recognize is making you pay close a</p><p>5 0.68201011 <a title="315-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-11-23-ICML_2009_Workshops_%28and_Tutorials%29.html">379 hunch net-2009-11-23-ICML 2009 Workshops (and Tutorials)</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I’m the  workshops chair  for  ICML  this year.  As such, I would like to personally encourage people to consider running a workshop.
 
My general view of workshops is that they are excellent as opportunities to discuss and develop research directions—some of my best work has come from collaborations at workshops and several workshops have substantially altered my thinking about various problems.  My experience running workshops is that setting them up and making them fly often appears much harder than it actually is, and the workshops often come off much better than expected in the end.  Submissions are due January 18, two weeks before papers.
 
Similarly,  Ben Taskar  is looking for good  tutorials , which is complementary.  Workshops are about exploring a subject, while a tutorial is about distilling it down into an easily taught essence, a vital part of the research process.  Tutorials are due February 13, two weeks after papers.</p><p>6 0.67791861 <a title="315-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-02-02-User_preferences_for_search_engines.html">423 hunch net-2011-02-02-User preferences for search engines</a></p>

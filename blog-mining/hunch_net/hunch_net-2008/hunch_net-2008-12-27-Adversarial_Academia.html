<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively
meaningless over the long term -- growing conferences simply use more rooms

<p>Introduction: Although I'm greatly interested in machine learning, I think it must be
admitted that there is a large amount of low quality logic being used in
reviews. The problem is bad enough that sometimes I wonder if theByzantine
generalslimit has been exceeded. For example, I've seen recent reviews where
the given reasons for rejecting are:[NIPS] Theorem A is uninteresting because
Theorem B is uninteresting.[UAI] When you learn by memorization, the problem
addressed is trivial.[NIPS] The proof is in the appendix.[NIPS] This has been
done before. (â&euro;Ś but not giving any relevant citations)Just for the record I
want to point out what's wrong with these reviews. A future world in which
such reasons never come up again would be great, but I'm sure these errors
will be committed many times more in the future.This is nonsense. A theorem
should be evaluated based on it's merits, rather than the merits of another
theorem.Learning by memorization requires an exponentially larger sample
complexity than man</p><p>5 0.18436372 <a title="333-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>6 0.17049101 <a title="333-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-03-Bidding_Problems.html">315 hunch net-2008-09-03-Bidding Problems</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is a (near) transcript of a talk that I gave at theICML 2013
Workshop on Peer Review and Publishing Models. Although there's aPDF available
on my website, I've chosen to post a slightly modified version here as well in
order to better facilitate discussion.Disclaimers and ContextI want to start
with a couple of disclaimers and some context.First, I want to point out that
although I've read a lot about double-blind review, this isn't my research
area and the research discussed in this post is not my own. As a result, I
probably can't answer super detailed questions about these studies.I also want
to note that I'm not opposed to open peer review -- I was a free and open
source software developer for over ten years and I care a great deal about
openness and transparency. Rather, my motivation in writing this post is
simply to create awareness of and to initiate discussion about the benefits of
double-blind review.Lastly, and most importantly, I think it's essential to

<p>Introduction: One way that many conferences in machine learning assign reviewers to papers
is via bidding, which has steps something like:Invite people to reviewAccept
papersReviewers look at title and abstract and state the papers they are
interested in reviewing.Some massaging happens, but reviewers often get
approximately the papers they bid for.At the ICML business meeting,Andrew
McCallumsuggested getting rid of bidding for papers. A couple reasons were
given:PrivacyThe title and abstract of the entire set of papers is visible to
every participating reviewer. Some authors might be uncomfortable about this
for submitted papers. I'm not sympathetic to this reason: the point of
submitting a paper to review is to publish it, so the value (if any) of not
publishing a part of it a little bit earlier seems limited.CliquesA bidding
system is gameable. If you have 3 buddies and you inform each other of your
submissions, you can each bid for your friend's papers and express a
disinterest in others. There</p><p>4 0.76465827 <a title="333-lsi-4" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-02-18-Decision_by_Vetocracy.html">343 hunch net-2009-02-18-Decision by Vetocracy</a></p>

increasingly frustrated with the peer review system in our field. I constantly
get asked to review papers in which I have no interest. At the same time, as
an action editor in JMLR, I constantly have to harass people to review papers.
When I send papers to conferences and to journals I often get rejected with
reviews that, at least in my mind, make no sense. Finally, I have a very hard
time keeping up with the best new work, because I don't know where to look for
itâ&euro;ŚI decided to try an do something to improve the situation. I started a new
web site, which I decided to call "The machine learning forum" the URL
ishttp://themachinelearningforum.orgThe main idea behind this web site is to
remove anonymity from the review process. In this site, all opinions are
attributed to the actual person that expressed them. I expect that this will
improve the quality of the reviews. An obvious other effect is that there will
be fewer n</p><p>same-blog 2 0.96047699 <a title="333-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-27-Adversarial_Academia.html">333 hunch net-2008-12-27-Adversarial Academia</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One viewpoint on academia is that it is inherently adversarial: there are
finite research dollars, positions, and students to work with, implying a
zero-sum game between different participants. This is not a viewpoint that I
want to promote, as I consider it flawed. However, I know several people
believe strongly in this viewpoint, and I have found it to have substantial
explanatory power.For example:It explains why your paper was rejected based on
poor logic. The reviewer wasn't concerned with research quality, but rather
with rejecting a competitor.It explains why professors rarely work together.
The goal of a non-tenured professor (at least) is to get tenure, and a case
for tenure comes from a portfolio of work that is undisputably yours.It
explains why new research programs are not quickly adopted. Adopting a
competitor's program is impossible, if your career is based on the competitor
being wrong.Different academic groups subscribe to the adversarial viewpoint
in different degrees</p><p>3 0.8980844 <a title="333-lda-3" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>4 0.89760047 <a title="333-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-09-26-The_SODA_Program_Committee.html">318 hunch net-2008-09-26-The SODA Program Committee</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Claireasked me to be on the SODA program committee this year, which was quite
a bit of work.I had a relatively light load--merely 49 theory papers. Many of
these papers were not on subjects that I was expert about, so (as is common
for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help
review the papers. I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally. There were a
couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed
off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.There are some
differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and
theory communities. In machine learning it is expected that a review be
detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case. Every
paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very
detailed.I'm sure not every author was happy with the outcome. While we did
our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make. For
example, if there is a</p><p>5 0.893399 <a title="333-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research. They provide many
roles including "announcing research", "meeting people", and "point of
reference". Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: "to what
extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?" This question is
very difficult to answer in any satisfying way. What we can do is compare
details of the process across multiple conferences.CommentsThe average quality
of comments across conferences can vary dramatically. At one extreme, the
tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback. At
the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing
detailed constructive feedback. Detailed feedback can give authors significant
guidance about how to improve research. This is the most subjective
entry.BlindVirtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors
do not know reviewers. Some also providedouble blindreview where reviewers do
not know authors. T</p><p>6 0.88518804 <a title="333-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2009/hunch_net-2009-06-24-Interesting_papers_at_UAICMOLT_2009.html">361 hunch net-2009-06-24-Interesting papers at UAICMOLT 2009</a></p>

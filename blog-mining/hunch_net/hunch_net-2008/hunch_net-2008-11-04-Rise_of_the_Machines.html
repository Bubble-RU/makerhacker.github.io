<p>Introduction: I've enjoyed theTerminatormovies and show. Neglecting the whacky aspects (time
travel and associated paradoxes), there is an enduring topic of discussion:
how do people deal with intelligent machines (and vice versa)?In Terminator-
land, the primary method for dealing with intelligent machines is to prevent
them from being made. This approach works pretty badly, because a new angle on
building an intelligent machine keeps coming up. This is partly a ploy for
writer's to avoid writing themselves out of a job, but there is a fundamental
truth to it as well: preventing progress in research is hard.The United
States, has been experimenting with trying to stop research onstem cells. It
hasn't worked very well--the net effect has been retarding research programs a
bit, and exporting some research to other countries. Another less recent
example was encryption technology, for which the United States generally did
not encourage early public research and evendiscouraged as a munition. This

<p>Introduction: The internet has significantly effected the way we do research but it's
capabilities have not yet been fully realized.First, let's acknowledge some
known effects.Self-publishingBy default, all researchers in machine learning
(and more generally computer science and physics) place their papers online
for anyone to download. The exact mechanism differs--physicists tend to use a
central repository (Arxiv) while computer scientists tend to place the papers
on their webpage. Arxiv has been slowly growing in subject breadth so it now
sometimes used by computer scientists.CollaborationEmail has enabled working
remotely with coauthors. This has allowed collaborationis which would not
otherwise have been possible and generally speeds research.Now, let's look at
attempts to go further.Blogs(like this one) allow public discussion about
topics which are not easily categorized as "a new idea in machine learning"
(like this topic).Organizationof some subfield of research. This

<p>Introduction: I just releasedVowpal Wabbit 6.0. Since the last version:VW is now 2-3 orders
of magnitude faster at linear learning, primarily thanks toAlekh. Given the
baseline, this is loads of fun, allowing us to easily deal with terafeature
datasets, and dwarfing the scale of any other open source projects. The core
improvement here comes from effective parallelization over kilonode clusters
(eitherHadoopor not). This code is highly scalable, so it even helps with
clusters of size 2 (and doesn't hurt for clusters of size 1). The core
allreduce technique appears widely and easily reused--we've already used it to
parallelize Conjugate Gradient, LBFGS, and two variants of online learning.
We'll be documenting how to do this more thoroughly, but for now
"README_cluster" and associated scripts should provide a good starting
point.The newLBFGScode fromMiroseems to commonly dominate the existing
conjugate gradient code in time/quality tradeoffs.The new matrix factorization

<p>Introduction: Reviewers and students are sometimes greatly concerned by the distinction
between:Anopen setand aclosed set.ASupremumand aMaximum.An event which happens
with probability 1 and an event that always happens.I don't appreciate this
distinction in machine learning & learning theory. All machine learning takes
place (by definition) on a machine where every parameter has finite precision.
Consequently, every set is closed, a maximal element always exists, and
probability 1 events always happen.The fundamental issue here is that
substantial parts of mathematics don't appear well-matched to computation in
the physical world, because the mathematics has concerns which are unphysical.
This mismatched mathematics makes irrelevant distinctions. We can ask "what
mathematics is appropriate to computation?"Andrejhas convinced me that a
pretty good answer to this question isconstructive mathematics.So, here's a
basic challenge: Can anyone name a situation where any of the distinctions

<p>Introduction: Yahoo! is sponsoring two machine learning events that might interest
people.TheKey Scientific Challengesprogram (due March 5) forMachine
LearningandStatisticsoffers $5K (plus bonuses) for graduate students working
on a core problem of interest to Y! If you are already working on one of these
problems, there is no reason not to submit, and if you aren't you might want
to think about it for next year, as I am confident they all press the boundary
of the possible in Machine Learning. There are 7 days left.TheLearning to Rank
challenge(due May 31) offers an $8K first prize for the best ranking algorithm
on a real (and really used) dataset for search ranking, with presentations at
an ICML workshop. Unlike the Netflix competition, there are prizes for 2nd,
3rd, and 4th place, perhaps avoiding the heartbreakthe ensembleencountered. If
you think you know how to rank, you should give it a try, and we might all
learn something. There are 3 months left.</p><p>6 0.2252091 <a title="323-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2010/hunch_net-2010-12-26-NIPS_2010.html">420 hunch net-2010-12-26-NIPS 2010</a></p>

<p>Introduction: COLT has acall for open problemsdue March 21. I encourage anyone with a
specifiable open problem to write it down and send it in. Just the effort of
specifying an open problem precisely and concisely has been very helpful for
my own solutions, and there is a substantial chance others will solve it. To
increase the chance someone will take it up, you can even put a bounty on the
solution. (Perhaps I should raise the$500 bountyon theK-fold cross-validation
problemas it hasn't yet been solved).</p><p>5 0.075713314 <a title="328-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-08-04-Why_Reinforcement_Learning_is_Important.html">100 hunch net-2005-08-04-Why Reinforcement Learning is Important</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One prescription for solving a problem well is:State the problem, in the
simplest way possible. In particular, this statement should involve no
contamination with or anticipation of the solution.Think about solutions to
the stated problem.Stating a problem in a succinct and crisp manner tends to
invite a simple elegant solution. When a problem can not be stated succinctly,
we wonder if the problem is even understood. (And when a problem is not
understood, we wonder if a solution can be meaningful.)Reinforcement learning
does step (1) well. It provides a clean simple language to state general AI
problems. In reinforcement learning there is a set of actionsA, a set of
observationsO, and a rewardr. The reinforcement learning problem, in general,
is defined by a conditional measureD( o, r | (o,r,a)*)which produces an
observationoand a rewardrgiven a history(o,r,a)*. The goal in reinforcement
learning is to find a policypi:(o,r,a)*-> amapping histories to actions so as
to maximize (or appro</p><p>6 0.072716653 <a title="328-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-08-20-The_Large_Scale_Learning_Survey_Tutorial.html">442 hunch net-2011-08-20-The Large Scale Learning Survey Tutorial</a></p>

<p>Introduction: This post is some combination of belaboring the obvious and speculating wildly
about the future. The basic issue to be addressed is how to think about
machine learning in terms given to us from Programming Language theory.Types
and ReductionsJohn's research programme (I feel this should be in British
spelling to reflect the grandiousness of the ideaâ&euro;Ś) of machine learning
reductionsStateOfReductionis at some essential level type-theoretic in nature.
The fundamental elements are the classifier, a function f: alpha -> beta, and
the corresponding classifier trainer g: List of (alpha,beta) -> (alpha ->
beta). The research goal is to create *combinators* that produce new f's and
g's given existing ones. John (probably quite rightly) seems unwilling at the
moment to commit to any notion stronger than these combinators are correctly
typed. One way to see the result of a reduction is something typed like: (For
those denied the joy of the Hindly-Milner type system, "simple" is probably

<p>Introduction: At NIPS I'm giving atutorial on Learning to Interact. In essence this is about
dealing with causality in a contextual bandit framework. Relative toprevious
tutorials, I'll be covering several new results that changed my understanding
of the nature of the problem. Note thatJudea PearlandElias Bareinboimhave
atutorial on causality. This might appear similar, but is quite different in
practice. Pearl and Bareinboim's tutorial will be about the general concepts
while mine will be about total mastery of the simplest nontrivial case,
including code. Luckily, they have the right order. I recommend going to bothI
also just released version 7.4 ofVowpal Wabbit. When I was a frustrated
learning theorist, I did not understand why people were not using learning
reductions to solve problems. I've been slowly discovering why with VW, and
addressing the issues. One of the issues is that machine learning itself was
not automatic enough, while another is that creating a very low overhead

<p>Introduction: This post is a (near) transcript of a talk that I gave at theICML 2013
Workshop on Peer Review and Publishing Models. Although there's aPDF available
on my website, I've chosen to post a slightly modified version here as well in
order to better facilitate discussion.Disclaimers and ContextI want to start
with a couple of disclaimers and some context.First, I want to point out that
although I've read a lot about double-blind review, this isn't my research
area and the research discussed in this post is not my own. As a result, I
probably can't answer super detailed questions about these studies.I also want
to note that I'm not opposed to open peer review -- I was a free and open
source software developer for over ten years and I care a great deal about
openness and transparency. Rather, my motivation in writing this post is
simply to create awareness of and to initiate discussion about the benefits of
double-blind review.Lastly, and most importantly, I think it's essential to

<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections. They
always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections
come to seem reasonable. Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the
topic just isn't as important as was originally thought. A few rejections do
not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror
stories, a great material for conversations. I've decided to share three of
mine, now all safely a bit distant in the past.Prediction Theory for
Classification Tutorial. This is a tutorial about tight sample complexity
bounds for classification that I submitted toJMLR. The first decision I heard
was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me--for example one of the
reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics
books. Upon further inquiry, several citations were given, none of which
actually covered the content. Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was
accepted. Apparently, the pape</p><p>6 0.38693726 <a title="328-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-04-27-Watchword%3A_Supervised_Learning.html">299 hunch net-2008-04-27-Watchword: Supervised Learning</a></p>

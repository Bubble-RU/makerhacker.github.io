<p>Introduction: When thinking about how best to review papers, it seems helpful to have some
conception of what good reviewing is. As far as I can tell, this is almost
always only discussed in the specific context of a paper (i.e. your rejected
paper), or at most an area (i.e. what a "good paper" looks like for that area)
rather than general principles. Neither individual papers or areas are
sufficiently general for a large conference--every paper differs in the
details, and what if you want to build a new area and/or cross areas?An
unavoidable reason for reviewing is that the community of research is too
large. In particular, it is not possible for a researcher to read every paper
which someone thinks might be of interest. This reason for reviewing exists
independent of constraints on rooms or scheduling formats of individual
conferences. Indeed, history suggests that physical constraints are relatively

<p>Introduction: Essentially everyone who writes research papers suffers rejections. They
always sting immediately, but upon further reflection many of these rejections
come to seem reasonable. Maybe the equations had too many typos or maybe the
topic just isn't as important as was originally thought. A few rejections do
not come to seem acceptable, and these form the basis of reviewing horror
stories, a great material for conversations. I've decided to share three of

bounds for classification that I submitted toJMLR. The first decision I heard
was a reject which appeared quite unjust to me--for example one of the
reviewers appeared to claim that all the content was in standard statistics

actually covered the content. Later, I was shocked to hear the paper was
accepted. Apparently, the pape</p><p>5 0.24559908 <a title="318-tfidf-5" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-09-30-Research_in_conferences.html">116 hunch net-2005-09-30-Research in conferences</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research. They provide many
roles including "announcing research", "meeting people", and "point of
reference". Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: "to what
extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?" This question is
very difficult to answer in any satisfying way. What we can do is compare
details of the process across multiple conferences.CommentsThe average quality
of comments across conferences can vary dramatically. At one extreme, the
tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback. At
the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing
detailed constructive feedback. Detailed feedback can give authors significant
guidance about how to improve research. This is the most subjective
entry.BlindVirtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors
do not know reviewers. Some also providedouble blindreview where reviewers do
not know authors. T</p><p>6 0.24506924 <a title="318-tfidf-6" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>

<p>Introduction: Just about nothing could keep me from attendingICML, except forDorawho arrived
on Monday. Consequently, I have only secondhand reports that the conference is
going well.For those who are remote (like me) or after the conference (like
everyone),Mark Reidhas setup theICML discussionsite where you can comment on
any paper or subscribe to papers. Authors are automatically subscribed to
their own papers, so it should be possible to have a discussion significantly
after the fact, as people desire.We also conducted a survey before the
conference and have thesurvey resultsnow. This can be compared with theICML
2010 survey results. Looking at the comparable questions, we can sometimes
order the answers to have scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 0 to 4 with 3 or 4
being best and 0 worst, then compute the average difference between 2012 and
2010.Glancing through them, I see:Most people found the papers they reviewed a
good fit for their expertise (-.037 w.r.t 2010). Achieving this was one of our

for theory conferences) I found various reviewers that I trusted to help
review the papers. I ended up reviewing about 1/3 personally. There were a
couple instances where I ended up overruling a subreviewer whose logic seemed
off, but otherwise I generally let their reviews stand.There are some
differences in standards for paper reviews between the machine learning and
theory communities. In machine learning it is expected that a review be
detailed, while in the theory community this is often not the case. Every
paper given to me ended up with a review varying between somewhat and very
detailed.I'm sure not every author was happy with the outcome. While we did
our best to make good decisions, they were difficult decisions to make. For
example, if there is a</p><p>2 0.91039288 <a title="318-lda-2" href="../hunch_net-2005/hunch_net-2005-05-29-Bad_ideas.html">76 hunch net-2005-05-29-Bad ideas</a></p>
<p>Introduction: I found these two essays on bad ideas interesting. Neither of these is written
from the viewpoint of research, but they are both highly relevant.Why smart
people have bad ideasby Paul GrahamWhy smart people defend bad ideasby Scott
Berkun (which appeared onslashdot)In my experience, bad ideas are
commonandover confidence in ideas is common. This overconfidence can take
either the form of excessive condemnation or excessive praise. Some of this is
necessary to the process of research. For example, some overconfidence in the
value of your own research is expected and probably necessary to motivate your
own investigation. Since research is a rather risky business, much of it does
not pan out. Learning to accept when something does not pan out is a critical
skill which is sometimes never acquired.Excessive condemnation can be a real
ill when it's encountered. This has two effects:When the penalty for being
wrong is too large, it means people have a great investment in defending

<p>Introduction: Conferences exist as part of the process of doing research. They provide many
roles including "announcing research", "meeting people", and "point of
reference". Not all conferences are alike so a basic question is: "to what
extent do individual conferences attempt to aid research?" This question is
very difficult to answer in any satisfying way. What we can do is compare
details of the process across multiple conferences.CommentsThe average quality
of comments across conferences can vary dramatically. At one extreme, the
tradition in CS theory conferences is to provide essentially zero feedback. At
the other extreme, some conferences have a strong tradition of providing
detailed constructive feedback. Detailed feedback can give authors significant
guidance about how to improve research. This is the most subjective
entry.BlindVirtually all conferences offer single blind review where authors
do not know reviewers. Some also providedouble blindreview where reviewers do
not know authors. T</p><p>4 0.88775039 <a title="318-lda-4" href="../hunch_net-2008/hunch_net-2008-12-27-Adversarial_Academia.html">333 hunch net-2008-12-27-Adversarial Academia</a></p>
<p>Introduction: One viewpoint on academia is that it is inherently adversarial: there are
finite research dollars, positions, and students to work with, implying a
zero-sum game between different participants. This is not a viewpoint that I
want to promote, as I consider it flawed. However, I know several people
believe strongly in this viewpoint, and I have found it to have substantial
explanatory power.For example:It explains why your paper was rejected based on
poor logic. The reviewer wasn't concerned with research quality, but rather
with rejecting a competitor.It explains why professors rarely work together.
The goal of a non-tenured professor (at least) is to get tenure, and a case
for tenure comes from a portfolio of work that is undisputably yours.It
explains why new research programs are not quickly adopted. Adopting a
competitor's program is impossible, if your career is based on the competitor
being wrong.Different academic groups subscribe to the adversarial viewpoint
in different degrees</p><p>5 0.88732064 <a title="318-lda-5" href="../hunch_net-2011/hunch_net-2011-07-10-ICML_2011_and_the_future.html">437 hunch net-2011-07-10-ICML 2011 and the future</a></p>
<p>Introduction: Unfortunately, I ended up sick for much of this ICML. I did manage to catch
one interesting paper:Richard Socher,Cliff Lin,Andrew Y. Ng, andChristopher D.
ManningParsing Natural Scenes and Natural Language with Recursive Neural
Networks.I invited Richard to share his list of interesting papers, so
hopefully we'll hear from him soon. In the meantime,PaulandHalhave posted some
lists.the futureJoelleand I are program chairs for ICML 2012 inEdinburgh,
which I previously enjoyed visiting in2005. This is a huge responsibility,
that we hope to accomplish well. A part of this (perhaps the most fun part),
is imagining how we can make ICML better. A key and critical constraint is
choosing things that can be accomplished. So far we have:Colocation. The first
thing we looked into was potential colocations. We quickly discovered that
many other conferences precomitted their location. For the future, getting a
colocation withACLorSIGIR, seems to require more advanced planning. If that
can be done, I</p><p>6 0.88585687 <a title="318-lda-6" href="../hunch_net-2013/hunch_net-2013-06-16-Representative_Reviewing.html">484 hunch net-2013-06-16-Representative Reviewing</a></p>
